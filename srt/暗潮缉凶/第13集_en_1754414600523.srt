1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,560
Death!

2
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,880
Hurry!

3
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,280
här

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,100
I didn't tell you to leave.

5
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,140
And you're more misbehaving than me.

6
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,640
I know.

7
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,220
aide Xia tienes is sorry.

8
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,520

00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,880
I Milf shown you.

10
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,520
See you.

11
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,020
Just go.

12
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,920
ova.

13
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,900
apparently.

14
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,660
She was excited.

15
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,000
She said he is sorry,

16
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,780
will be out early.

17
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,500
So,

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,920
don't Internet problems.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,640
Can run?

20
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,600
Yes.

21
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,000
I just ran back with Sui Xiao Chu.

22
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,840
This is the power of love.

23
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,400
Where's Ao Xiao Jie?

24
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,840
What are you thinking?

25
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,760
Please leave.

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,240
Can I let go?

27
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,600
No.

28
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,960
This kid can't do anything.

29
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,280
He brought you here without saying hello.

30
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,400
Am I very messy?

31
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,680
Not bad.

32
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,400
Not messy.

33
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,280
It's quite clean.

34
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
He's here to help me clean.

35
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,960
He's so good at it.

36
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,000
He's not messy.

37
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Did he tell you who I am?

38
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,400
He said it on the way here.

39
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,160
Then why did he bring you here?

40
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,760
He said you're his only family now.

41
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,240
You're also the only girl

42
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,400
he brought here.

43
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
I didn't mean anything else.

44
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,520
I didn't mean that he's been in many relationships.

45
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,320
He's...

46
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,520
You know what I mean.

47
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,560
He hasn't had a girlfriend.

48
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,680
I understand.

49
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,000
He brought you here

50
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,320
means he really loves you.

51
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,440
Let me see.

52
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,040
Whatever.

53
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,360
I'll go.

54
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,560
How did you get this?

55
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,800
I got it from Ding Gui.

56
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,600
He left it when he was young.

57
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,520
He also has a knife wound.

58
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
He won't blame me, right?

59
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
You're sensible now.

60
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,320
What are you doing?

61
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,480
Yang, be careful.

62
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,840
Be gentle.

63
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,560
What are you doing?

64
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,720
Sit down.

65
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,000
Yang.

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,520
You're a bad guy.

67
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,200
Who told you to come here?

68
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,320
Yang, what are you doing?

69
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,080
Don't touch me.

70
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,760
I'm not your dad.

71
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,960
Yang.

72
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,920
Yang, what are you doing?

73
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,960
Yang.

74
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,160
Yang.

75
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,960
Yang.

76
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,840
Yang, get off.

77
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,880
I'm your sister.

78
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,920
Stop it.

79
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,360
Can you be a couple with him?

80
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,040
Lin An Pei,

81
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,400
go to the other side.

82
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,120
Go.

83
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,880
Get off.

84
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm a bad guy.

85
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,560
I'll let you drink.

86
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,640
I'll let you drink.

87
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,120
Mom.

88
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,640
Let's drink.

89
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,600
Let's go.

90
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,240
Go.

91
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,680
This family doesn't want you.

92
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,320
Go.

93
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,560
You want to kill me?

94
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,000
Go.

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Go.

96
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,520
You're short of money.

97
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,400
Kill me.

98
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,200
Kill me.

99
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,160
Kill me.

100
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,200
Kill me.

101
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,480
Oh my god.

102
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,520
Don't drink anymore.

103
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,960
You're a good girl.

104
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,280
You're so lucky.

105
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,400
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Nothing.

107
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,080
You can keep the peanuts.

108
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,000
Miss An was caught.

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,400
I'm really a rock.

110
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,960
I know.

111
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,600
I helped you.

112
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,120
You see her as a friend.

113
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,400
But I'm afraid you can't see her.

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,760
She's different from you.

115
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
She has her own ambition.

116
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
I wanted to help her

117
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,760
get to the right path.

118
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,040
But she

119
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
thought I was going to catch her.

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,760
My eyes

121
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,520
are probably

122
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,760
because of her.

123
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,000
Because of you

124
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,440
I lost my vision.

125
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,480
Really?

126
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,720
The wrong faith.

127
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,960
It's wrong to notice it.

128
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,400
I found the soybean poop.

129
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,480
What's the matter with you, dad?

130
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,200
Xiaocheng.

131
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,040
I'm sorry, Xiaocheng.

132
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,480
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,720
I didn't protect your skin well.

134
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,920
I didn't protect your skin well.

135
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,160
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,080
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,800
Since yesterday,

138
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,040
this Second Miss hasn't said anything.

139
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,480
She's been playing tag after playing mahjong.

140
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,880
She's been beaten by a girl.

141
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
She said she was unruly to her subordinates.

142
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,560
She never participated in it.

143
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,080
She wouldn't tolerate killing people.

144
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,400
Someone dared to attack her in front of us?

145
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,480
Yes.

146
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,880
Someone wanted to kill her.

147
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,400
Who could it be?

148
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,400
She might know it, but she doesn't know it.

149
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,440
That old man, Sha Hongli,

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,440
should have been killed too.

151
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,400
I thought that Ao Xiaojie was that yellow dog.

152
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,320
Now it seems that he's also a leader.

153
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
He's about to be killed.

154
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,160
You're not going to tell us?

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,280
I can only say that this yellow dog is very powerful.

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,440
It has a long paw.

157
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,840
This case is no longer a simple murder case.

158
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,520
It's very heavy

159
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,560
when it's dragged along the rope.

160
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,720
How is the old man who escaped with Ao Xiaojie

161
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,200
now?

162
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,200
He was saved in the hospital.

163
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,800
But he was badly injured.

164
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,200
Did Ao Xiaojie see it with his own eyes

165
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,960
that the old man was beaten like this?

166
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,640
Yes.

167
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,600
He was beaten like this.

168
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,320
But when we interrogated him,

169
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,600
Ao Xiaojie didn't ask anything about Dayong.

170
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,520
He didn't ask.

171
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,520
He's just a blind man.

172
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,160
He's definitely not a righteous man.

173
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
But he didn't ask anything.

174
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,360
You think...

175
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,440
Report!

176
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,000
Shi Jiangfeng is beating Ao Xiaojie again.

177
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,880
Yuan Su!

178
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,720
What are you doing?

179
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,560
I'm warning you, don't make any mistakes.

180
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,040
I'm not going to beat him.

181
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm going to ask him something.

182
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,880
No!

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,080
No!

184
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
I won't beat him.

185
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,160
I have something to ask him.

186
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,320
The interrogation is going according to the procedure.

187
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,040
Okay, I'll ask him after you're done.

188
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,920
But I have a request.

189
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,400
0.

190
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,680
0.

191
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,560
Did you look thoroughly?

192
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
He was badly wounded,

193
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:14,160
but he wasn't

194
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,720
or return it?

195
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,200
Even if it's his, he should return it.

196
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,800
You don't have to act like you don't care.

197
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,400
It's not a shame to have someone you care about.

198
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,960
Don't worry.

199
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,680
We've already communicated with the guard.

200
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,600
We guarantee your absolute safety.

201
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,920
You didn't blackmail me, right?

202
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,600
No.

203
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,200
Let's go.

204
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,560
Wait, why is she here?

205
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,920
Even though I'm blind, but I'm still a cop.

206
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,680
You're already retired.

207
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,120
Can you still interrogate me?

208
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,760
After I quit my position,

209
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,960
to investigate the case.

210
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
You're so proud.

211
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,320
Brother.

212
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,440
Brother Feng.

213
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,760
I didn't want to kill you.

214
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,680
I was right about the medicine.

215
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,880
You know I sold it for...

216
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,640
Mr. Lin.

217
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,720
I know

218
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,280
you're not as brave as the one who killed.

219
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,880
Otherwise, he wouldn't have lived to this day.

220
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,760
Yes.

221
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,040
It's true.

222
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,440
Lao Xiaojie.

223
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,000
How long have we known each other?

224
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,600
I remember

225
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,560
I've known you

226
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,240
for a longer time than I've known him.

227
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,080
You're still a kid.

228
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,160
You're small and timid.

229
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,640
I hope you can be a good friend.

230
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,520
You won't be in the future.

231
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,120
You're not a bad kid.

232
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,480
You're just a kid without love

233
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,080
and bullied by others.

234
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,280
People

235
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,640
need to learn to protect themselves.

236
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,080
You're smart and smart.

237
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,040
You can learn to be a good kid.

238
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,520
You're better than him.

239
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,800
So you

240
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,360
caught me and went to school.

241
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,200
I'm not that kind of kid.

242
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,240
You're smart and smart.

243
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,640
You're smart.

244
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,680
So you can do everything

245
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,840
without any worries.

246
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,160
You're a good kid.

247
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,200
You can't do

248
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,920
anything that's not your thing.

249
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,800
You can't do anything that's not your thing.

250
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,560
Right?

251
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,760
I heard from them

252
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,160
that you've been doing something

253
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
for years.

254
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,320
You're just a good friend.

255
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,960
You kill people.

256
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,560
You're not that brave.

257
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,040
I don't believe that you don't have a boss.

258
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,840
You have to think it over.

259
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,240
You're a criminal.

260
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,880
You're a criminal.

261
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,680
You're still young.

262
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,160
You're honest and generous.

263
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,200
You're a good kid.

264
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,080
After you get your father's permission,

265
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
you can start your own life.

266
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,040
Look at me.

267
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,280
I'm already this old.

268
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,040
I'm already like this.

269
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,640
I can start my own life.

270
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,000
Right?

271
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,600
An accident destroyed my eyes.

272
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,320
Xiao Jie.

273
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,440
You did it, didn't you?

274
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,120
Tell me the truth.

275
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,800
Who did it?

276
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,520
Who?

277
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,200
You're so...

278
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,160
Tell me the truth!

279
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,000
It's Kun.

280
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,800
He talked to me.

281
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,200
But no one will bother me anymore.

282
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,840
Who's Kun?

283
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,120
He's a dirty man.

284
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,880
The person who wants to kill me this time

285
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,920
must be him.

286
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,320
He's very cruel.

287
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,640
There's a nickname in the wall.

288
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,040
It's Ye Chang.

289
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,760
He's a good guy.

290
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,920
He's a good guy.

291
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,120
He's a good guy.

292
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,200
He's a good guy.

293
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
He's a good guy.

294
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,280
But no one dares to teach him.

295
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,440
Who will he be buried with?

296
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,240
Xiao Jie.

297
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,040
Since you want to kill me,

298
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,040
kill me all.

299
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,640
I'm going.

300
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,640
What more do you want?

301
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,920
A wife.

302
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,960
She's juniors to you.

303
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,040
Be nice to taste.

304
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,800
Is it tasty?

305
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,680
When did you find my partner

306
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,680
My company, KTV, is all his.

307
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
I'm just a street hunk.

308
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,680
I don't have money to do such a big business.

309
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
I'm a white glove.

310
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Kun is a black glove.

311
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,680
I choose the hosts under my hand.

312
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
Li Da Na also chooses once.

313
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
If there is a satisfactory one,

314
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,680
I will take him to attend the secret gathering he held.

315
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,680
But I can't attend the gathering.

316
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,680
So I don't know what happened.

317
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
I dare not ask.

318
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,680
Those two died.

319
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,680
I know one went to me.

320
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,680
And one, someone took me to the upstairs in the room.

321
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
I know too much.

322
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
What about Shen Xiao Zhou?

323
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,680
She didn't go to Shen Xiao Zhou.

324
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
She just did it twice.

325
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
She left after the live broadcast.

326
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
I never saw her again.

327
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,680
At that time, Li Da Na asked me to force that dead body.

328
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
I was a little strange.

329
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:38,680
Why doesn't she want others to know that Shen Xiao Zhou did the live broadcast before?

330
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,680
Because she doesn't want us to find you and find her.

331
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Shen Xiao Zhou was introduced to me by Zhang Hao Yang and Tuo Li Da Na.

332
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,680
She really wanted to make money.

333
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Her family was poor.

334
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,680
But I don't understand why there was such a person.

335
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,680
I had to make a mess to rely on my uncle.

336
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
This person is also a woman.

337
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
She was clearly in front of me.

338
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,680
When I was discussing with Sun Cheng,

339
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,680
I just rubbed the old one for a while for one or two percent.

340
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,680
I know it.

341
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Then?

342
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
I said I would resign.

343
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
I don't have a penny.

344
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,680
Who else in your company has ever attended Li Da Na's secret meeting?

345
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
Say it.

346
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
We will protect everyone.

347
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,680
No use.

348
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
No use.

349
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
No use.

350
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Anyway, I haven't seen her come back.

351
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
Who is it?

352
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Haven't you slept yet?

353
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,680
Sorry to bother you.

354
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
What?

355
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,680
I want to ask you for a favor.

356
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,680
We will take care of Aou's business.

357
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
Forget it.

358
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
She doesn't dare to talk nonsense.

359
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
Aou doesn't have a family.

360
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
It's hard to control.

361
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,680
So be careful in the future.

362
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
I will listen to you.

363
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
You just have to be careful for me.

364
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,680
Deng Deng.

365
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
How did you know Shi Jiang Feng?

366
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,680
He was caught by the railing.

367
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
He was 17 years old.

368
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
He was in the train station.

369
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
He was in a fight with someone.

370
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,680
He couldn't leave anyone alone.

371
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,680
He was still holding on to his head.

372
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,680
I've been friends with him for a long time.

373
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,680
He dared to call me uncle after more than a year.

374
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
He is not bad.

375
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
He has a strong spirit.

376
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
He is a stone.

377
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,680
He might be able to get out of prison.

378
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
What?

379
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
Go to the police station.

380
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
I'm coming out.

381
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,680
Let's go, mom.

382
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
You've made a contribution.

383
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
What do you mean?

384
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,680
You arranged it well.

385
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
I'm leaving.

386
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
Aou Xiaojie told me that

387
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Jia Beibei participated in Li Dada's secret gathering.

388
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,680
Wang Yishan

389
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,680
should be brought by Old Sha and Sha Hongli.

390
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
This Sha Hongli

391
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
is very likely

392
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,680
to be Li Dada's puppet.

393
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
Now all the evidence

394
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
points to Li Dada.

395
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,680
He should be a key suspect.

396
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,680
He should be concentrated.

397
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
He is bad.

398
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
Bad?

399
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,680
The case is not clear.

400
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
His father, Li Ronghe,

401
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
is the ancestor of Jinghai Group.

402
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,680
A star entrepreneur

403
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
can't appear again

404
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,680
in the last Internet incident of Zhang Haoyang.

405
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Mr. Qiu.

406
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,680
We'll take action after we get the evidence.

407
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,680
We'll kill him if we take action.

408
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
Mr. Qiu.

409
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
Any other instructions?

410
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Although the clues point to Li Dada,

411
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,680
we don't know

412
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,680
who participated in the gathering.

413
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,680
What happened in the gathering?

414
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,680
All the suspects in the gathering

415
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
have their own

416
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,680
unique hobbies and symbols.

417
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,680
He is a typical

418
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,680
psycho-pneumatic personality.

419
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,680
So we need to continue

420
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,680
to verify and eliminate him.

421
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
Liang Yaoping.

422
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,680
What do you think of Li Dada?

423
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,680
I've seen him twice.

424
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
I think he is

425
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,680
70% likely

426
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,680
to be a psycho-pneumatic personality.

427
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
I think he is 70% likely to be a psycho-pneumatic personality.

428
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
And he is more used to left-handed people.

429
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
And he is more used to left-handed people.

430
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
I won't hit you.

431
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
He is Shen Xiaozhou.

432
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
What's wrong with Shen Xiaozhou?

433
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
What's wrong with Shen Xiaozhou?

434
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
What's wrong with Shen Xiaozhou?

435
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Do you remember

436
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
the next morning of Shen Xiaozhou's case,

437
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
he hit someone while driving

438
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
and we caught him.

439
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,680
He was in a very crazy mood.

440
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Yes, he was very excited.

441
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
Actually,

442
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,680
this is not the state after the murder.

443
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
On the contrary,

444
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,680
he was satisfied.

445
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
He should be relatively calm.

446
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
You mean

447
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Shen Xiaozhou

448
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,680
was not killed by him?

449
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
I don't know.

450
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
Sun Xiaozhou

451
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,680
works with Shen Xiaozhou.

452
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,680
It means he doesn'tnis.

453
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
I'm don't think so.

454
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
That's amazing.

455
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Miss loyalist,

456
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
what's the matter with you,

457
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
theEr.

458
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
Come on.

459
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Come one.

460
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
Come.

461
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,640
Learn from me.

462
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Watch it after you learn it.

463
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,440
Watch it after you learn it.

464
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,520
Come on.

465
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,520
Break it.

466
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,400
Watch TV.

467
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:21,880
Be good.

468
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,800
Watch TV.

469
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,640
Learn from me.

470
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,080
Watch TV after you learn it.

471
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,160
Be good, kid.

472
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,040
Mix it well.

473
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,680
Watch it.

474
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
For the small portion,

475
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,400
two spoons will do.

476
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,320
Come on.

477
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,640
Watch it.

478
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,480
Watch TV.

479
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,600
Watch TV.

480
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,200
Don't watch it.

481
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,920
Don't watch it if you don't learn it.

482
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,520
What are you crying for?

483
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,800
Okay.

484
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,080
Kid.

485
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
The TV is on.

486
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,840
Watch it.

487
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,200
What's wrong?

488
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,640
Why do you make him learn this?

489
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,240
When Xiao Zhou was alive,

490
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,400
he promised to rely on it.

491
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
What should we do now?

492
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,520
If we lose it,

493
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,040
he can only rely on himself.

494
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,600
Listen.

495
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,200
Listen.

496
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,240
Listen.

497
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,440
Captain Tian.

498
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,840
Mom made a big bun.

499
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,440
Don't let it get cold.

500
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,600
Thank me, mom.

501
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
How's Xiao Shu?

502
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,840
She's obedient.

503
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,600
Don't worry.

504
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
I'm going to work.

505
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,080
Sha.

506
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,320
It's okay. Go ahead.

507
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
We'll talk when the case is solved.

508
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,480
Okay.

509
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,000
We'll talk when the case is solved.

510
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:58,960
Okay.

511
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Eat the buns while they're hot.

512
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,680
Sit down.

513
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,440
Come on, let's have a meeting.

514
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,640
That's it.

515
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,240
Let me tell you.

516
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Au Xiao Jie

517
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,960
provided a few invites

518
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
who had taken part

519
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,640
of Rocketade's secret gathering.

520
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,000
After our investigation,

521
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
left Linchuan within one to two years.

522
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Three people were clearly found.

523
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,900
Two returned to the Northeast, one to Sichuan.

524
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,000
The others are not found.

525
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Is Li Dada a pervert?

526
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm afraid these people have seen him before.

527
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,600
Were they scared away or sent away?

528
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,800
Go find them.

529
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,800
We've already sent three groups of people. We'll set off soon.

530
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,200
You have to be prepared.

531
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,400
I'm afraid these people are more afraid than Ao Xiaojie.

532
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,000
As long as we can find someone who's willing to talk, it'll be easy.

533
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,600
Report. Someone called the police.

534
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,800
They said there's a reaction to the case of Shen Xiaozhou.

535
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Who?

536
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
An old couple.

537
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,400
They used to be in the daily life.

538
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,800
No. We're doing small business.

539
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,800
But if they're in the daily life, that's good.

540
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,600
What's good about that?

541
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,200
The daily life has already been shut down.

542
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,400
It's good that it's shut down.

543
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,400
But the daily life has its own house and land.

544
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,000
When the demolition is done, we can change the sea view building.

545
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Now that the death of the people has come,

546
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,600
I'm afraid the demolition of the house will be delayed.

547
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,400
I heard the boss changed his mind.

548
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
He wants to choose another land.

549
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,200
I don't understand this situation.

550
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,800
Is the reaction to Shen Xiaozhou related to this?

551
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,800
I'm talking about Yang Tao.

552
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,600
No, not Yang Tao. It's his father.

553
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,400
Yes, Yang Tao's father, Yang Bao Ge.

554
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,400
What's the relationship between Yang Bao Ge and Shen Xiaozhou?

555
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,600
It's related to Shen Xiaozhou's father.

556
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,200
We heard it a long time ago.

557
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,000
Yang Bao Ge doesn't like Shen Hua Zhang.

558
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,400
Yesterday's wedding, that's not the case.

559
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,400
It's not that he doesn't like her. It's just that he has a grudge.

560
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,600
Yang Tao's wedding?

561
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Yes, Yang Bao Ge is in a mess.

562
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,000
He was drunk and made a scene.

563
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,600
That scene doesn't give us any face.

564
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,400
My daughter doesn't want to marry into that kind of family.

565
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,600
Fortunately, they haven't gotten married yet.

566
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Then why doesn't Yang Bao Ge like Shen Hua Zhang?

567
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,600
He's married.

568
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,200
It's Yang Tao's mother.

569
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,400
When he was young, he was close to Shen Hua Zhang.

570
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,400
But it's all a long time ago.

571
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,800
It's been so many years.

572
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,400
They're still like young people.

573
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,000
How did you know about this?

574
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,800
Last night, Yang Tao came to my house to apologize.

575
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,400
I asked around.

576
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Because their family has a good relationship with the Shen family.

577
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,200
They didn't even put the wedding invitation on the wedding.

578
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,400
It's because the Shen family's daughter died.

579
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,000
I think Yang Tao doesn't look like Yang Bao Ge at all.

580
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,200
Shen Hua Zhang came to the wedding yesterday.

581
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,600
I found out that Yang Tao looks like him.

582
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
They're both innocent.

583
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,200
Do you think he and...

584
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Don't guess.

585
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,600
But Yang Bao Ge is really bad-tempered.

586
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,000
He was drunk and hit his son.

587
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,800
He's not as cruel as his son.

588
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,200
Yang Tao has a scar on his back.

589
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,400
That's right.

590
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,800
The farther away we are from this kind of family, the better.

591
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,400
What if they really want to kill someone?

592
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,800
How can they live with him?

593
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Do you think Yang Bao Ge might...

594
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,600
Okay.

595
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,200
I know what you're thinking.

596
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,800
Thank you.

597
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Oh, right.

598
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,200
I heard that the Shen family's daughter was found in the sewage pool in the daily life.

599
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Right?

600
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,400
Before Yang Bao Ge got off work,

601
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,400
he worked at the sewage treatment station in the daily life.

602
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,200
Hello, is this Mr. Shi?

603
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Your DNA test results are out.

604
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,600
You can come and get it whenever you need it.

605
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,800
Okay, I got it.

606
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Do you think the clues they provided are useful?

607
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,600
I think it's to destroy the marriage.

608
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,400
As long as it's a clue, we can't let it go.

609
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,000
Shen Xiao's case

610
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,400
has a lot of unusual places.

611
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,800
It's connected to those two cases, and it's different.

612
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,200
Didn't those complicated cases also have

613
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,800
such unexpected situations?

614
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,000
The one who didn't wake up was the real murderer.

615
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,800
Have you touched Yang Bao Ge's background?

616
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
He has a case.

617
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,200
When he was young, he often went to the sewage treatment station.

618
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,800
He went in twice because he hurt someone.

619
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,800
If Yang Tao is really Sheng Huazhang's child,

620
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,400
I don't think we can rule out

621
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,600
that he might harm Shen Xiao Zhou

622
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,400
to take revenge on Sheng Huazhang.

623
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,800
Okay, then you continue to investigate.

624
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,600
Li Da Da is now very suspicious.

625
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,200
There are many situations. Zhao Hong Gang has already sent

626
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,800
three groups of people to investigate. Are you nervous?

627
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,200
You distribute them.

628
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,000
Leave the rest you need to transfer to him.

629
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,000
Okay.

630
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,400
One person follows me.

631
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,200
The rest will cooperate with Chief Zhao.

632
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,800
Yes.

633
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Don't worry. We'll cooperate well.

634
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,200
If you don't, we won't be able to fight with Erli.

635
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200
I want to catch Li Da Da.

636
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,400
Not catch, but investigate.

637
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,200
If you investigate, then catch.

638
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,000
Are you going over there? Have you thought it through?

639
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,400
I've thought it through.

640
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,600
You go.

641
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,800
You follow me.

642
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Okay.

643
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,800
Captain Lian, I'm sorry.

644
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,200
It's for Old Ma, right?

645
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,400
Don't worry. I won't be impulsive.

646
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,000
Linzi is more experienced than you.

647
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,600
Cooperate well. Don't fight.

648
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,000
Call me if you have any questions.

649
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,200
I understand.

650
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,000
The police are too strong.

651
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,800
Actually, our regiment is too dangerous.

652
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,600
We'll just have to take a look.

653
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,200
Let's have a look.

654
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,800
I'm thirsty. I'll go buy a drink.

655
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,000
Leave someone in the car.

656
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,800
Bring me a cup of iced tea.

657
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,000
Okay, I know.

658
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,400
What is she going to do?

659
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,800
Old aspect.

660
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,400
A clean shot.

661
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,160
I don't know if I'm crazy or not.

662
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
I'm still sleepy.

663
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,760
I'm really tired.

664
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,680
No, look.

665
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,920
Who went to Yang Tao's wedding two days ago?

666
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,680
I heard that they had a fight.

667
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,960
That's right.

668
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,920
They even made a table.

669
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,680
But Yang Tao is a good kid.

670
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,120
But his father is not good.

671
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,800
He's the one who plays the wine-cups when his son gets married.

672
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,000
What's going on?

673
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,280
He's so old that he's like a dog.

674
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,080
I heard that Yang Tao was in a fight

675
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,760
because of Shen Hua Zhang.

676
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,960
He's been eating vinegar for decades.

677
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,320
He can't hold his acidity.

678
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,240
Don't blame him for being old and sour.

679
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,440
Shen Hua Zhang and Ding Shu Lan

680
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,120
were a good match.

681
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,720
Right?

682
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,800
Aren't they on Shanggu TV?

683
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,440
Yes.

684
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,200
Shanggu.

685
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,200
The city council meeting in 1990.

686
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,560
They were on the show that represented our factory.

687
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,320
One of them played pipa.

688
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,600
The other one danced folk dance.

689
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,880
That level

690
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,680
is not the local level.

691
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,360
It's the central level.

692
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,200
Why didn't they

693
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
get together in the end?

694
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,200
It was 1991.

695
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,080
Shen Hua Zhang's parents were all sick.

696
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,600
Shen Hua Zhang didn't have time to play pipa.

697
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,880
In this way,

698
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,560
he didn't have much time

699
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
with Ding Shu Lan.

700
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,760
Besides, Sui Qiuhong

701
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,560
is very obsessed with Shen Hua Zhang.

702
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,560
He works in our factory.

703
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,800
He always serves his parents.

704
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,960
He's a security guard.

705
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,880
You can't say he's a servant.

706
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,760
Then,

707
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,160
Ding Shu Lan married Yang Bao Ge.

708
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,120
Shen Hua Zhang and Sui Qiuhong

709
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,160
became a couple.

710
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,680
That's nonsense.

711
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,640
Who doesn't know about this?

712
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,280
Why did they split up?

713
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,840
Do you know?

714
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,960
Why?

715
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,320
Sui Qiuhong is a living person.

716
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,040
Ding Shu Lan isn't.

717
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
Who do you think Shen Hua Zhang is looking for?

718
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,920
You.

719
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,800
Can Shen Hua Zhang be like you?

720
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,360
When did Shen Hua Zhang and Ding Shu Lan

721
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,960
break up?

722
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,040
It was in the winter of 1991.

723
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,440
My son was just born that year.

724
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,040
He was in the same hospital with his parents.

725
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,560
Officer.

726
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,560
Can this case be solved?

727
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,040
It can be solved.

728
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,720
It won't be solved for a day.

729
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,800
We are not at ease for a day.

730
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,760
Are you thinking about your sea police?

731
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,080
Stop talking nonsense.

732
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,160
Xiaozhou is our son.

733
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,560
She's a very good girl.

734
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,640
She's a good girl.

735
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
If we keep fighting,

736
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
we'll be caught.

737
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Yes.

738
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,240
We'll be caught.

739
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,800
If Shen Hua Zhang and Ding Shu Lan

740
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,360
broke up in the winter of 1991,

741
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,080
I remember that Yang Tao was born in the summer of 1992.

742
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,800
You remember it well.

743
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,960
Yang Tao.

744
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,160
Xiao Xuan Girlfriend

745
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,040
You're child's play.

746
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,800
Is there some way to go?

747
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,020
What's wrong with that word?

748
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,280
She'll understand me without thing!

749
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,000
What are you afraid about

750
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,080
Say you have something.

751
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,120
say observe

752
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,400
Success!

753
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
I'm hungry.

754
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Let's go back to the pot and cook.

755
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,920
I just went in.

756
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
What's this?

757
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
Why did you buy the snail powder?

758
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,400
You didn't burn it.

759
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
It's smelly and has soup.

760
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
This thing is a must-have item.

761
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
This is not smelly at all.

762
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
It's smelly.

763
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
It's smelly.

764
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
It's smelly.

765
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
It's smelly.

766
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
It's smelly.

767
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Thanks.

768
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
You can't cross a red door from further ahead.

769
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
It's almost past me now.

770
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Are you soêtey-nae match or should I drive first?

771
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
Come on.

772
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
I'm the top three in driving skills.

773
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,560
The first one is definitely the team.

774
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,320
His driving is

775
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,080
almost like the movie.

776
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,920
The basic skills are fast and steady.

777
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,920
The main thing is the sense of distance.

778
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,320
He doesn't even step on the brakes.

779
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
He just steps on the brakes.

780
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,400
That's the style.

781
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,160
Are you the one who posted it?

782
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,040
Hello, Sir.

783
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,760
This is the personal residence.

784
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,720
Which one are you looking for?

785
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,320
Hello, Officer.

786
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,800
Which condo that cab operator was in?

787
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,480
He's at 902 condo.

788
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,360
Master Walk's

789
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,240
video stuck.

790
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,240
Show your video.

791
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,600
Here.

792
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,320
Now,

793
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,120
show your video.

794
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:07,800
Please.

795
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,880
Show me your video.

796
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,040
Hello?

797
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
I followed Li Dada.

798
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,280
He took a girl home.

799
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,440
But I can't see

800
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,640
all of her apartment now.

801
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,840
What should I do?

802
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,760
I'm afraid he'll do it.

803
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,520
I don't have time.

804
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,160
Where did you take this girl back?

805
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,160
The bar.

806
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,880
The victim

807
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,720
didn't take her away from the bar.

808
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,320
I see.

809
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,840
I'll keep an eye on her.

810
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,520
Let's get inside.

811
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,280
They are waiting for me.

812
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,080
Li Dada is noisy.

813
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,600
Dalin only left for an hour.

814
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,680
One hour doing nothing?

815
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,640
Memorize it

816
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,000
I forgot

817
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,600
meetings

818
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,560
Where are you going

819
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,680
The rice is in the pot, you can eat it later

820
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,680
Next time when you cook

821
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,120
Open the gas door

822
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,920
Light it with fire

823
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,720
Otherwise, you can't

824
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,120
Oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar

825
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,040
I put it in a place where it's obvious

826
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,120
And a few dishes you like

827
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,680
I wrote down the recipe

828
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,320
Pressed under the jar

829
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,280
What do you mean

830
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,680
Are you going to go out

831
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,600
You can use the washing machine

832
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,280
Little pig has taught you

833
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,000
Put less washing powder

834
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Wash the powder in the morning

835
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,960
Remember to collect it at night

836
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,000
What the hell are you doing

837
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,240
You tell me clearly

838
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,200
I saw Shen Cheng in the TV today

839
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,760
Selling bread and cake

840
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,040
Selling children like Xiao Hai

841
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,880
I want to take him to see

842
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,920
Can you take him as a disciple

843
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,080
How long will it take

844
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,280
Sometimes

845
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,840
Just stay

846
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:29,920
Good good

847
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,160
Let's go

848
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,440
Don't come back if you don't want to come back

849
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,480
Xiao Zhou's business hasn't come to an end yet

850
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,920
Don't want this guy

851
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,640
There is only Xiao in my eyes and no Xiao Zhou

852
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,440
Isn't Xiao Zhou a girl?

853
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,720
I think Xiao shou will have to marry Li Que

854
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:07,800
I think so

855
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:10,960
Miss trendy

856
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:12,920
You think is congenial

857
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:13,840
She's yelling

858
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,040
Is that unable to make aiamo

859
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,680
Let her go

860
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,640
Yes

861
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,520
Can make aamos

862
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,960
No one can 고들24

863
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,400
Alan

864
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,240
Is this congenial

865
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,640
If you laugh

866
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:30,680
OK

867
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,560
Look at him

868
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,200
He looks like Li Hui

869
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,000
He can give birth to such a white-skinned child

870
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,920
He doesn't have to worry about it

871
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,720
He is not a thing

872
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,000
I have a grudge against him

873
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,080
Once he was joking

874
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,480
Did you say his son

875
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,120
Yes

876
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,200
Just said half

877
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,520
He raised his hand and threw me into the front yard

878
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,080
You didn't find the Shen family's girl's pool

879
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,280
If someone didn't close the door quickly

880
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,640
I was sucked into the排海管道

881
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:07,860
The two are caught and themselves are

882
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,800
So if I say the wrong thing

883
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,280
You are right

884
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,640
To be clear

885
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,920
Life is not all about money

886
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,800
You can't buy a rich family

887
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,480
This money

888
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,160
What kind of old words can an old man say

889
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,040
Don't talk about old ideas

890
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,880
No.

891
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,880
I didn't lie.

892
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,880
You're close to Yang Tao's mother, Ding Shu Lan.

893
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,800
Not bad.

894
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,280
What does this have to do with the case?

895
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,720
I want to ask you a question.

896
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,760
It might be embarrassing,

897
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,200
but I hope you can answer it truthfully.

898
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,760
Is Yang Tao your son?

899
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,240
I'm not your son.

900
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,880
I'm your mother.

901
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,880
I'm your father.

902
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,880
I'm your mother.

903
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,880
I'm your father.

904
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,880
I'm your mother.

905
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,880
I'm your father.

906
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,880
I'm your mother.

907
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,880
I'm your father.

908
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,880
I'm your mother.

909
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,880
I'm your father.

910
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,880
I'm your mother.

911
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,880
I'm your father.

912
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,880
I'm your father.

913
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,880
I'm your father.

914
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,880
I'm your father.

915
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,880
I'm your father.

916
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,880
I'm your father.

917
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,880
I'm your father.

918
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,880
I'm your father.

919
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,880
I'm your father.

920
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,880
I'm your father.

921
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,880
I'm your father.

922
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,880
I'm your father.

923
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,880
I'm your father.

924
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,880
I'm your father.

925
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,880
I'm your father.

926
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,880
I'm your father.

927
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,920
I'm your father.

928
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,920
I'm your father.

929
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,920
I'm your father.

930
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,000
I'm your father.

931
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,960
I'm your father.

932
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,960
I'm your father.

933
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,960
I'm your father.

934
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,960
I'm your father.

935
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,960
I'm your father.

936
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,960
I'm your father.

937
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,960
I'm your father.
