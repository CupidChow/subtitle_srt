We Chand

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
What shall we do

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,420
I believe

4
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,620
I have told friends

5
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,200
On the Yi heat

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,920
You why don't you

7
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,220
Sunset marginalized

8
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,340
krijgen

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,280

00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,160
double

11
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,420
double

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,760
Everybody can hear somebody

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,760
Everybody can hear somebody

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,040
ein

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,280
mo

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,600
dad

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,280
I'm not talking about you

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,080
I'm notけ

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,800
No one、 can't shame you

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,960
Dad is not talking about you

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,320
No everyone is talking about how you

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,920
Has this place been harmed

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,000
No one can come to help

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What's wrong with the child?

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's okay.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How are you?

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm in pain.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm in pain.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm in pain.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's like being held by a tiger.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You can't collapse.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I had a dream.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I dreamed that Xiao Zhou got married.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
When he got married,

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
he had a daughter.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She was only one and a half years old.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Three of them came to play at home.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Just on this bed,

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Xiao Zhou was teaching the child to recite poems.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It was a long poem.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The child remembered it twice.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It was as cute as Xiao Zhou when he was a child.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Smart and cute.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We were happy.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We were clapping and laughing.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Then I woke up.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The moment I woke up, I was even more painful than death.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Xiao Zhou was no longer like that.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Xiao Zhou, you're..!

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Xiao Zhou, you're awake.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Xiao Zhou, you're alive.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Xiao Zhou, you're...

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Xiao Zhou, you're...

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,960
Did you get the result of the blood test?

78
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,560
Is there any anesthetic?

79
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,600
Yes.

80
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,080
But there are more types of anesthetic

81
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,160
in the needle.

82
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,040
We have to compare the specific type.

83
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,880
Let me tell you some.

84
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,760
See if you have it.

85
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,280
You must have tested the Yimi and Liyuan copper.

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,720
Uvabitona

87
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,720
and this Ibicin,

88
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,200
water and lychine,

89
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,360
and Procain.

90
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,400
These are the only ones I can recognize.

91
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
Okay, let's continue.

92
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,840
Where are we going now?

93
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,120
Let's go check

94
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,200
if Shen Xiaozhou has a boyfriend.

95
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,240
Can you believe Chen Hui's words?

96
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,200
I think

97
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,320
he must have made up the lie.

98
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,680
He's lying, right?

99
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,920
You'll know after checking.

100
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,840
Our counselor doesn't care about these.

101
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,240
But

102
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,840
as far as I know,

103
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,280
no.

104
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,040
He said there's no suitable one.

105
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,000
How about

106
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,160
you ask Yue Chunxia?

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,960
Boyfriend?

108
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,080
Yes.

109
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,080
Does he have one?

110
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,960
No.

111
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,160
If he had one,

112
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,600
the neighbors would have spread it.

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,080
Xiaozhou doesn't have a boyfriend.

114
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,560
I think Chen Hui

115
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,320
is a bastard.

116
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,720
You totally believe in Shen Xiaozhou?

117
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,040
I believe in this.

118
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,600
Why?

119
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,880
I can't tell.

120
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,840
But

121
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,280
I think she's a good girl

122
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,640
from the video.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,160
You have feelings for her?

124
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,760
Don't you?

125
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,920
You said that

126
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,720
she must be a good girl.

127
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,640
Do you think

128
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,520
she's not so pure?

129
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,040
You think so?

130
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,400
I only see the facts.

131
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:15,880
By the way,

132
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,480
there's a class in school called

133
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,040
Crime and Victim Education.

134
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,360
It's about the characteristics of victims.

135
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,440
You must know

136
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,600
my grades.

137
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,120
With your experience over the years,

138
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,040
have you seen

139
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,440
similar victims?

140
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,200
Shen Xiaozhou is

141
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,640
a little different.

142
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,880
Although she has a poor family background,

143
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,040
she's happy and harmonious.

144
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,760
Her environment is healthy.

145
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,360
For example,

146
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,320
the victims of

147
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,760
unhealthy growth environments,

148
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,560
do they have any characteristics?

149
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,040
Sometimes,

150
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
they want to make up for

151
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,800
what they lack.

152
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,280
How?

153
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,160
Find a boyfriend you like

154
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,000
and then

155
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,200
be abandoned by your boyfriend.

156
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,960
Then you'll be broken.

157
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,920
Is Shen Xiaozhou

158
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
in this situation?

159
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,120
I thought I found a boyfriend

160
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,840
who could help her

161
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,200
get out of the bitter sea.

162
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,320
But I was dumped.

163
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,960
Then there was a conflict

164
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,200
and a conflict of plans.

165
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
If so,

166
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,200
I think she'll let go.

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,640
Really?

168
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,800
Will a girl let go like that?

169
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,360
A strong military force.

170
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,800
Is it okay?

171
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,880
It's okay.

172
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,920
Then I'll pull it out.

173
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,560
Is what Chen Hui said

174
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
reliable or not?

175
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,760
We have to

176
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,080
go through two more aspects

177
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,880
to confirm it.

178
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,080
Okay, you go back first.

179
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
I'll walk around.

180
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,360
Let's split up tomorrow.

181
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,440
Remember to record

182
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
and write notes.

183
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,480
Okay.

184
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,480
I'll go back first.

185
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,120
Okay.

186
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,600
Hello.

187
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,240
Well, Lin,

188
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,000
how are you today?

189
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,840
Still the same.

190
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,560
What's wrong?

191
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,800
You...

192
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,840
You...

193
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,000
Be prepared.

194
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,400
Although you haven't come

195
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,480
when you were handling the case,

196
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,280
maybe you

197
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,240
will ask me later.

198
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,680
What case?

199
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,720
Why?

200
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,000
It's a case of compensation.

201
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,200
You don't know about the fame?

202
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,240
The students who contacted

203
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,680
Chen Hui's dormitory

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,920
are all Chen Hui's students.

205
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,440
They're meeting outside the school.

206
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,760
They've been in the dorm for 20 minutes.

207
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,240
How much do you know about Chen Hui?

208
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,880
Not much.

209
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,640
I know that his parents

210
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,200
were workers at the factory.

211
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,400
Factory?

212
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,760
Isn't it next to the factory?

213
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,400
Yes.

214
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,120
It's the old industrial zone.

215
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,560
But I heard that

216
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,080
their house has been moved out.

217
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,840
Do you have a new address?

218
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,400
I'm not sure.

219
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,240
He doesn't like to talk about his family.

220
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,680
Officer, can you give me the car ticket?

221
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,400
No problem.

222
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,800
Captain Liang, what's up?

223
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,360
I have a few questions.

224
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,840
Okay, come to my office.

225
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,920
Officer Liang, this is

226
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,680
our company's

227
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,320
own bottle of water.

228
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,600
I'm sure it's purer

229
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,120
than all pure water in the market.

230
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,760
Did you check the classmate

231
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
I told you about last time?

232
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,520
I can't tell you that.

233
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,400
I shouldn't have asked.

234
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,880
Today,

235
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,520
we need to verify some information.

236
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,840
It's about

237
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,840
your 19th schedule.

238
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,480
There's no other meaning.

239
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,920
All social relations

240
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
about Shen Xiaozhou

241
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,520
need to be thoroughly investigated.

242
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,160
I understand.

243
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,240
Please go ahead.

244
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,440
How did you go to Qingzhou

245
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,840
on the 19th?

246
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
I drove there.

247
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,040
What car?

248
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,920
What's the license plate number?

249
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,040
Wait a minute.

250
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,120
I'll write it down for you.

251
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,840
Wait a minute.

252
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,360
What was the schedule like that day?

253
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,520
I was with the client

254
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,880
from morning to night.

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,160
We had dinner together

256
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,880
and went to the amusement park for a while.

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,160
We came back to the hotel in the middle of the night.

258
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,560
I don't like the entertainment there.

259
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,460
So, I

260
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,700
came with the patient.

261
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,720
What's your name?

262
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,340
I want to apply for the Chinese Federation as a terra fis plugged into thecasting of the Chinese Coalition.

263
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,640
never something highly Valley

264
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,400
of recent people

265
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,520
though it will disappear

266
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,800
in early May

267
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,440
I know

268
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,720
how much this is speaking

269
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,640
This kind of lot

270
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,100
causal

271
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,560
So I recommend

272
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,200
this house

273
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,400
to Mr. Wang Liu for commission,

274
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,040
please change it out.

275
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,200
OK,

276
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,400
As long as you register, you can find out.

277
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,280
Please save some time for us.

278
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,120
Lotus Hotel, room 806.

279
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,560
Last question.

280
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,760
Do you have a girlfriend?

281
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,760
I'm too busy to take care of her.

282
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,200
Chen Hui is not familiar with us.

283
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,440
He wanders around the school every day.

284
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,120
He doesn't deal with anyone.

285
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,400
Does he not attend the dinner every time?

286
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,200
He's poor. He can't even drink milk tea.

287
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,640
He only drinks water.

288
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,400
To be honest, I'm afraid to live with him.

289
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,480
I'm afraid he'll suddenly...

290
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,160
You know?

291
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,280
Why do you say that?

292
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,560
He has a violent tendency.

293
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,920
I'll tell you this.

294
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,400
Once, everyone in our dorm was hungry.

295
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,520
He was fine.

296
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,120
We were just kidding.

297
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,920
Chen Hui, is it you?

298
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

299
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,920
Hurry up.

300
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Why do you think he did that?

301
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,320
He's self-respecting and self-pitying.

302
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,240
He's afraid that everyone will look down on him.

303
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,640
He's just feeling guilty.

304
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,840
He can't do anything except study.

305
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,280
Does he have a girlfriend?

306
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,040
He...

307
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,040
He can't possibly have a girlfriend.

308
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,520
He's already been through all the youth.

309
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,800
By the way, sir.

310
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,640
Chen Hui has a habit.

311
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,840
He leaves school at 8 p.m. every Wednesday and Friday.

312
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,280
He comes back in the middle of the night.

313
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,240
Sometimes he comes back the next morning.

314
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
So we suspect he's going to...

315
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,160
I'm sorry.

316
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
The client who received Hu Xiangde in Qingzhou

317
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,400
has probably confirmed the truth about Hu Xiangde.

318
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,840
He was eating, singing, and drinking until 11 or 12 p.m.

319
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,440
What time exactly?

320
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,680
He said he was drunk and couldn't remember.

321
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,280
He stayed home for the night.

322
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,400
But Hu Xiangde

323
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,720
is really something.

324
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,440
I found out that he had a civil dispute case last year.

325
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,480
Hu Xiangde and his fiancée

326
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,600
had a lot of conflict.

327
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
When they found out about their husband,

328
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
they smashed Hu Xiangde's car.

329
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,360
Anyway, they kept talking about it.

330
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,600
Hu Xiangde insisted that

331
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
he didn't know that he had a husband.

332
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,600
He didn't really care about his husband's responsibility.

333
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,120
If I were to say,

334
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,080
if you had a husband,

335
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
how could you not know?

336
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,080
Hu Xiangde?

337
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,600
He doesn't look like one.

338
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
He looks like a gentleman.

339
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
You're just saying childish things.

340
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
He's an adult.

341
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
It's complicated.

342
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,600
What did you think Hu Xiangde was hiding?

343
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,560
It's just a little thing.

344
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
It's not a doubt.

345
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
You still have to believe the direct feeling of the company.

346
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,400
Not a direct feeling.

347
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,360
I've seen a lot of people.

348
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
I can summarize some common things.

349
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,200
Look at what I found.

350
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
This Chen Hui is interesting.

351
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Hu Xiangde's car.

352
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,200
The surveillance cameras at the entrance and exit of the city high-speed

353
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
have been found.

354
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
No. 19 went to the morning.

355
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
No. 20 went back to the morning.

356
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
It's not his style.

357
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Then look at mine.

358
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Help me put it on the screen. Thank you.

359
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Don't worry.

360
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
One by one.

361
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
The car of Lianhua Hotel

362
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
is in the car.

363
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
What about the surveillance videos of Lianhua Hotel?

364
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
I just sent it.

365
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Can you let me breathe?

366
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
I'll see.

367
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
It's him. That's right.

368
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
It doesn't look like Shen Xiaozhou.

369
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
No.

370
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
It's so close.

371
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
This is another female subordinate.

372
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
It's a big deal.

373
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
The direct feeling of the company is indeed accurate.

374
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,200
If you have doubts, you have to eliminate them.

375
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Then you can rest assured.

376
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Do you understand?

377
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Yes.

378
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Is Lin Hai Ping here?

379
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Please wait a moment.

380
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Come with me.

381
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Before I see them, I

382
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
have to ask you a question.

383
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Okay.

384
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Do you know what that blue-haired eight-haired man

385
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
did the night before?

386
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
He was a delivery man.

387
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
He was the one who broke the casino

388
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,200
and built the factory for us.

389
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Did he tell you anything?

390
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
No.

391
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Did he tell you anything?

392
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
What do you mean?

393
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
We are all police officers.

394
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
I just want to say it.

395
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
I always feel like

396
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
you have been against me.

397
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
You think it's

398
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
the thing that Bachuai told me about money.

399
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,200
You think I sent you a anonymous letter.

400
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,200
I don't think it's you.

401
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
If I want to send it,

402
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
I won't send an anonymous letter.

403
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
You know,

404
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
I have to ask you a question.

405
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Do you understand?

406
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
No.

407
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
I'll ask you another time.

408
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Okay.

409
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Okay.

410
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
These are the questions.

411
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,200
We'll check it out.

412
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
We won't let a good police officer be framed.

413
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Who sent you this anonymous letter?

414
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
What do you think?

415
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,400
the leader of the team.

416
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,600
Could it be...

417
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Is there any conflict between you and

418
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
the candidate Zhao Hougang?

419
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,040
Finished?

420
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,400
How is it?

421
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,040
It's fine.

422
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,800
Go on.

423
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,800
Look at the video of time-limit.

424
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,840
Have you found out?

425
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,160
This is the story of

426
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,560
Shen Xiaozhu being killed.

427
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,000
Cheng Hui was not at the school.

428
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,240
Where is she?

429
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,240
Who posted it?

430
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,040
Can't find.

431
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,280
I'm sorry.

432
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,360
Is it Sew koska?

433
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,200
I can't find it.

434
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,360
It's Yu Dayou and those hooligans.

435
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,000
You want to vent your anger on him, right?

436
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,160
The casino is gone.

437
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,880
You've lost a lot.

438
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,240
I'll sue you for black material.

439
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,040
And I'll chop you up.

440
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,880
You're so naughty.

441
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,000
I want to file a complaint.

442
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,120
Sit down first.

443
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,120
If you have a misunderstanding, you should solve it.

444
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,960
Good people fight, bad people cooperate.

445
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,680
That won't do.

446
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,560
Sit.

447
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,120
Hai Bing.

448
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,800
Hai Bing.

449
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,600
I'm sorry.

450
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,480
I shouldn't have said that.

451
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,280
I've been a policeman for so many years.

452
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,120
I've never been slandered like this.

453
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,640
My brain is a little messy.

454
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,640
I'll transfer this slander to you.

455
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,400
Actually, I should be able to judge.

456
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,320
I've always believed that you're a righteous person.

457
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,840
I'm not good at saying this.

459
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,640
It's important to say it.

460
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,560
This...

461
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,640
A policeman is a man.

462
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,560
You're not afraid of sacrifice.

463
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,080
What's wrong with this?

464
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,560
The wind blows and it's gone.

465
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,280
It's still a friend who can't be separated.

466
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,400
Let's get this straight.

467
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,680
Show your attitude.

468
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,280
I'm sorry.

469
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Don't transfer it.

470
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,080
Let's break the case together.

471
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,160
Okay?

472
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,240
Zhi Xiang Feng.

473
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,800
Do you know how difficult it is for him

474
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,400
to say such a thing to Hai Bing?

475
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,920
You're young and a man.

476
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,560
You can't even get through this.

477
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,400
Okay.

478
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,280
Let's just forget about what happened today.

479
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,520
You're done?

480
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,200
This person, Lao Lian, is like a horse on the road.

481
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,800
You'll know it later.

482
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,880
Hello?

483
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,440
You really didn't ask for this.

484
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,840
You're still hiding tea.

485
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,400
They've testified it?

486
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,120
Yes, a tie.

487
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,560
It contains Shen Xiao Zhou's blood.

488
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,720
It's not high concentration.

489
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,240
It's veryonergicallyundosis.

490
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,320
Didn't you drink it before?

491
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,920
It'sропic.

492
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,200
It mixed with tea, coffee and juice.

493
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,320
You'd quite easily fail to get it.

494
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,280
in the lab.

495
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,400
Don't be so excited.

496
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,560
Don't be so excited.

497
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,800
The vaccine is very common.

498
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,440
It's easy to get now.

499
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,680
Some people even use it

500
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,800
as a drug.

501
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,000
Keep an eye on Cheng Hui.

502
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,320
The campus is special.

503
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,200
We have so few young people.

504
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,520
How about we borrow some?

505
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,320
Well,

506
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,840
who is the little one?

507
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,200
Is he like a doctor?

508
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,000
No need.

509
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,240
I can stay up for three days.

510
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,680
Me too.

511
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,680
Hello?

512
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,400
Hello,

513
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,280
Police?

514
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,160
Police.

515
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,520
Police.

516
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Hello?

517
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,920
Hello, Police?

518
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,360
Hello?

519
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,320
Hello?

520
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,640
I need an answer.

521
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,400
Hello, Police?

522
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,160
Are you late?

523
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,320
Where is it?

524
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,200
Let's talk.

525
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,040
I'm going to the hospital.

526
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,760
I'll go with you.

527
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,360
No need.

528
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,960
I'm ready.

529
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,160
Don't say that.

530
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,680
You look like a gift man in this dress.

531
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,200
You're just a little old.

532
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,240
Why are you looking at me?

533
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,400
I'm just a newbie.

534
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,440
Stop it.

535
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,480
I've thought it through.

536
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
My identity

537
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,360
is a doctorate student

538
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,840
in the Engineering Department of Mechanical Engineering.

539
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,480
I've borrowed the book.

540
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
I'll pay you

541
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,440
for the book.

542
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
I'll pay you for the book.

543
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
I'll pay you for the book.

544
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,480
I'll pay you for the book.

545
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,620
ambient

546
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,480
The director told me

547
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
this was not what you want.

548
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,280
I didn't think

549
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,520
you would be soithmetic.

550
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,800
You'd have to hide to watch here

551
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,720
and help me tell you.

552
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,400
What of this case

553
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,120
is I didn't about it before?

554
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,800
Then we shall have a meeting tomorrow.

555
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,520
Det Карла

556
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,500
AAA

557
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,940
Green

558
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,380
Your turn

559
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,840
Get it helping

560
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,800
The

561
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,000
the

562
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,160
The

563
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:44,840
the

564
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,480
his

565
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,360
look

566
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,920
Those people

567
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,560
Little

568
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,880
Old

569
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,320
Old

570
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm sorry.

571
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,760
No.

572
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,600
Didn't your security office

573
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
say hello to you?

574
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,840
I'm on a mission.

575
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
I'm sorry.

576
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,400
Please.

577
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,280
I'm sorry.

578
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,520
Officer.

579
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,360
Is the case solved?

580
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,720
Did you find the murderer?

581
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,880
Not yet.

582
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,000
Then...

583
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,440
Is there a suspect?

584
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,680
I'm sorry.

585
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,520
We can't tell you about the case.

586
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,000
Can't we tell you about the family tree?

587
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,640
There's a rule.

588
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,520
Officer Lin.

589
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,960
Please tell us.

590
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,360
Uncle Shen has been

591
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,760
waiting for the case to be solved.

592
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,560
He's exhausted and his body is about to collapse.

593
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,640
Don't worry.

594
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,240
If the case is solved,

595
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,160
I'll let you know as soon as possible.

596
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,640
Yang Tao.

597
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,640
You know their family, right?

598
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,040
Yes.

599
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,640
Xiaozhou has been playing with me since she was a kid.

600
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,520
She's like my sister.

601
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,280
Look.

602
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Xiaozhou found this with me last month.

603
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,800
Your car?

604
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,240
I bought a new car.

605
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,800
Xiaozhou came to congratulate me.

606
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,160
He said I had enough cars.

607
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,920
This is...

608
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,320
This is my girlfriend.

609
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,040
We were going to get married.

610
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,040
Just these few days.

611
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,640
Xiaozhou also said

612
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,240
he wanted to come to the wedding

613
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,560
and give me a piece of advice.

614
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Let's go.

615
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,440
Why don't you go home by car?

616
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,440
Mom.

617
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,520
I'm tired.

618
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,600
I'm afraid of being possessed.

619
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,000
Let's go home.

620
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,800
What did you buy?

621
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,920
Look.

622
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,360
I bought you this.

623
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
You're so cute.

624
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm so happy.

625
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm so happy.

626
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,720
I'm so happy.

627
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,640
I'm so happy.

628
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,520
I'm so happy.

629
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
I'm so happy.

630
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,200
I'm so happy.

631
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,080
I'm so happy.

632
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:50,160
You're my tomb bakers,

633
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
You should call the teacher.

634
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Or you want to get more evidence?

635
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
You're working on a case.

636
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
Okay, I got it.

637
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
It's the end of the month.

638
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
Our unit is going through the summary.

639
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
I'm busy now.

640
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Hello?

641
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
He went to the front door.

642
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,160
Come here. I'm here.

643
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
Insane.

644
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,160
I'm here.

645
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Hey, student.

646
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
How do you go to the building?

647
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
I don't know. I'm a sportsman.

648
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
Okay, thank you.

649
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
Did you find it?

650
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
He should be in the lab at this time.

651
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
His activity rules have changed.

652
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
He goes to the dormitory,

653
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
the lab, the cafeteria.

654
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
He wears a hat today.

655
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
He doesn't want to be recognized.

656
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
It's not normal.

657
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
I'm going to the car.

658
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Don't go.

659
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
There are few people in the car.

660
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
I can't hide.

661
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
The driver of the car is not allowed to pass.

662
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
He is not allowed to pass.

663
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,160
He is not allowed to pass.

664
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
He is not allowed to pass.

665
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
He is not allowed to pass.

666
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,160
He is not allowed to pass.

667
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
He is not allowed to pass.

668
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
He is not allowed to pass.

669
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
He is not allowed to pass.

670
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
He is not allowed to pass.

671
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,160
He is not allowed to pass.

672
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
He is not allowed to pass.

673
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
He is not allowed to pass.

674
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
He is not allowed to pass.

675
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
What's wrong?

676
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
The driver of the car is following us.

677
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,160
No way.

678
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Who dares to be with the police?

679
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
We need to clean up.

680
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Are you still following us?

681
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
You are wrong.

682
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,160
What's wrong?

683
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Where did you find him?

684
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,160
We can't follow him anymore.

685
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
He is too alert.

686
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
This guy.

687
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,160
He is blind.

688
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,160
He can't even take the wallet.

689
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Brother Piao.

690
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,160
He hid the police.

691
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,160
The guy who was in the car.

692
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
He is also in the car.

693
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,160
He is also in the car.

694
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
He is also in the car.

695
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
He is also in the car.

696
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,160
We have reached our goal.

697
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
Let's all use our brains.

698
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,160
No matter how strong the person is.

699
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160
There will be weakness.

700
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Go and see if Chen Hui is in the car.

701
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
I've been watching. I didn't get off the car.

702
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Go.

703
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
He wants to see me?

704
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Go.

705
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
He is not here.

706
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
Where did he go?

707
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
There is a man with a hat and working uniform.

708
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
He got off the car in the three-room factory.

709
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
But on the way.

710
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
I didn't see this man in the uniform.

711
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,160
You remember what clothes every passenger in the car wears?

712
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,160
I didn't remember.

713
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
There are more people in the three-room factory.

714
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,160
I was distracted.

715
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,160
That person should be Chen Hui.

716
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Why did he change clothes?

717
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Did he find someone following him?

718
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,160
This guy is not that smart.

719
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Get in the car.

720
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Go back to the three-room factory.

721
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
I'm watching.

722
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Chen Hui is going back to school.

723
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,160
He must be getting off the car.

724
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
I'll go around.

725
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Okay.

726
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Go.

727
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Can you lend me your car?

728
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
I'm a police officer. I'm going to catch a suspect.

729
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Okay.

730
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,160
He is a police officer.

731
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,160
You are not a good person.

732
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
Hello.

733
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
I saw Chen Hui.

734
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,160
He was in the three-room factory.

735
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
He went to the factory.

736
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
I didn't catch him.

737
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
What kind of three-room factory?

738
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
Electric, flat, and comfortable.

739
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Go in first.

740
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
I'll be there soon.

741
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
Okay.

742
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
I'm not taking it.

743
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,160
I'll come tomorrow.

744
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
Who told you to go in?

745
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
Police.

746
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Has this person

747
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,160
been here just now?

748
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,160
No.

749
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Officer.

750
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
I'm going to get off work soon.

751
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,160
My wife is waiting for me at home.

752
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
Don't you live here?

753
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
I'm not a police officer.

754
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,160
Don't you live here?

755
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,160
What are you doing?

756
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,160
I'm a police officer.

757
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
You?

758
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,160
Police?

759
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
You're a thief.

760
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,160
I'm a police officer.

761
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
Don't go.

762
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,160
We can't get out of this mess.

763
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,160
Don't.

764
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
What are you doing?

765
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Don't move.

766
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,160
I have a certificate.

767
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Not local?

768
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
Where is it from?

769
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,160
Did you do something in the hometown?

770
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
How do you know?

771
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
The teacher answers the question.

772
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
This bow can cut the shape.

773
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Come.

774
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
Look again.

775
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,160
He was driving a flat-plate electric three-wheeled car.

776
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
The last one came to deliver the waste.

777
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
The statue.

778
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,160
With a mask.

779
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
I dare not say that it's old.

780
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,160
What did he bring?

781
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
He's coming every three floors.

782
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
He's coming every three floors.

783
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
Did he bring a laptop recently?

784
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,160
Did he bring women's clothes?

785
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
It's really him.

786
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Sorry.

787
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
Sorry, sir.

788
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
I didn't see it.

789
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
I know all the police stations here.

790
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
But you, Nian Sheng.

791
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,160
I've never seen you.

792
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
I'm from the criminal police.

793
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
What case?

794
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
Do you want us to cooperate?

795
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
As long as you say yes, we'll...

796
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
Don't go.

797
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
I'm looking for a three-wheeled car.

798
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Three-wheeled car?

799
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,160
I know who has three wheels.

800
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,160
Yes, we know who has it.

801
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,160
I received all these.

802
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
I don't know who brought it.

803
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,160
I'm going to check the NBA.

804
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,160
There's my NBA.

805
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
I didn't do anything bad.

806
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
I didn't do anything bad.

807
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
Police officer, you have to believe me.

808
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,160
I've been in the hometown for a while.

809
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
I've been in the hometown for a while.

810
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,160
I've been out for years.

811
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
I'm scared every day.

812
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
Now you're here.

813
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,160
I'm so worried.

814
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,160
He comes here every three or five.

815
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,160
Is it always at this time of night?

816
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,160
Do you want to see it?

817
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,160
What's this?

818
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,160
This is pipa.

819
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,160
Can you play it?

820
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Yes.

821
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
I'm good at it.

822
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
What can you play?

823
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
I can play all the notes.

824
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
Do you want to learn?

825
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
You play first. I'll listen.

826
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
You choose one.

827
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
This one.

828
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
This one, dad.

829
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
You really chose the hardest one.

830
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
You really chose the hardest one.

831
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
But it's not hard for dad.

832
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,160
I'm sorry.

833
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,160
It's just ahead.

834
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
It's almost there.

835
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,160
It's coming.

836
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,160
I'm crying in the sun.

837
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,160
I'm crying in the sun.

838
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,160
Is there a gust of wind

839
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,160
that can blow away all the dust?

840
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Is there a firefly

841
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,160
that can laugh at the lies from the past?

842
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,160
If I can feel the wine of darkness,

843
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,160
the wine of the world,

844
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,160
and the moon and the moon shine,

845
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,160
if I can feel the heart beat,

846
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,160
I can feel the echo of the dream.

847
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,160
I want to be the light

848
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,160
that lights up the way.

849
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,160
The truth is invisible,

850
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,160
but you can see it clearly.

851
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Memories are like the gust of wind

852
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,160
that can blow away all the dust.

853
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,160
The story is like the wind

854
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,160
that can blow away all the dust.

855
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,160
The dream is like the wind

856
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:32,160
that can blow away all the dust.

857
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,160
Is there a gust of wind

858
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,160
that can blow away all the dust?

859
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,160
Is there a firefly

860
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,160
that can laugh at the lies from the past?

861
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,160
If I can feel the wine of darkness,

862
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,160
the wine of the world,

863
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,160
and the moon and the moon shine,

864
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,160
if I can feel the echo of the dream.

865
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,160
I want to be the light

866
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,160
that lights up the way.

867
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,160
The truth is invisible,

868
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:26,160
but you can feel the echo of the dream.
