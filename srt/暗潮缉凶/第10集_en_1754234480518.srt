1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
Mysteries of solar eclipse

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,200
теперь

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,240
In 1995,

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,760
there wasuttering in the cloud,

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Li Hai Ren is also a young woman.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,720
She looks like Shen Xiao Zhou.

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,760
Don't get in the car.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,760
Don't get in the car.

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,360
Our names

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,440
are all from Tang poetry.

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,800
Poetry related to the sea.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,240
Spring river, tide, water, sea, and pavilion.

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,600
The wind will break the waves, and there will be stones.

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,960
Like it or not?

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,360
Not too dramatic.

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,240
There're two sentences I have best.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,760
From now on,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,680
Xiao Zhou will matter to the ocean.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,600
What?

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,360
Think I'm bad at this?

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,840
Are you anslowpoke?

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,440
No.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,600
I feel a little lonely.

24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
If one day,

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
I want to leave by myself,

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,320
don't ask me why, okay?

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,080
Why?

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,160
Okay.

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,160
If there really is such a day,

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
I will tell you,

31
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,360
I have left my best

32
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,040
to you.

33
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,080
Just remember it.

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,840
Why do you always say that?

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,400
Just kidding.

36
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,080
Because that shell is so beautiful.

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,440
Go and pick it up for me.

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,800
Wait for me.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,840
That woman was not killed.

40
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,040
She still has a child.

41
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,280
Why?

42
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,240
Hey.

43
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,240
Zhang Haoyang does not force us to come.

44
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Okay.

45
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
What's going on?

46
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
He has a congenital congenital blood vessel narrowness.

47
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
The doctor who saved him said that

48
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
the things he injected

49
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,600
can cause the congenital blood vessel to shrink severely.

50
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Shrink?

51
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Shouldn't that thing expand the blood vessel?

52
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
According to the two people, it shouldn't.

53
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,600
But Zhang Haoyang injected mixed drugs.

54
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
The ingredients are complicated.

55
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Old Guo is still in the process of further testing.

56
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Who?

57
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
You've wronged me. You've really wronged me.

58
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
It's not his first time here.

59
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
He uses the same thing every time he comes.

60
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,600
How come this time, something happened?

61
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
You should just be honest and tell your boss.

62
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
I'm not his boss. I made it all myself.

63
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Could it be that the raw material is wrong?

64
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Or is it just that there's a problem with the flow?

65
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Where did you get the raw material?

66
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
It's heavy.

67
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
There's also some kind of anesthetic.

68
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
I know that these are illegal.

69
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
I admit it.

70
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Do you know how to react to such complicated chemical reactions?

71
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
I know. It's not difficult.

72
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:48,860
How about I give you a

73
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
I'm not going to be pure.

74
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Although I'm not very good at chemistry,

75
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
what you just said is nonsense.

76
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,600
If you still insist on saying that,

77
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
then go to the police to explain it.

78
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
No, I...

79
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,600
That young man with intellectual disabilities is your brother, right?

80
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Yes. How is he now?

81
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,600
He's fine. He has a professional care.

82
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Don't worry.

83
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
When he's calm,

84
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
I'll send him to a specialized institution.

85
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
There won't be any problems in life.

86
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Thank you.

87
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
If you want to go out and take care of him earlier,

88
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
you'd better confess.

89
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Where did Zhang Haoyang's injection come from?

90
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
On the night of June 19,

91
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,600
who else would go to your place besides Zhang Haoyang?

92
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,600
You should know both of these questions.

93
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,600
That anesthetic machine was brought to us by someone.

94
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,600
That big one Zhang Haoyang didn't use before.

95
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Who brought it?

96
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,600
I didn't see it. They didn't go into the yard.

97
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Every time, a man went to the car.

98
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
What car?

99
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
It's just a normal small car.

100
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
It's not a car.

101
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,600
It stopped far away. I don't know what car it is.

102
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Is it this car?

103
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
It seems to be.

104
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Who went to the place on the night of June 19?

105
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Brother Zheng, I really don't know.

106
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
You're awake.

107
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Eat while it's hot.

108
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
If you don't want noodles,

109
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
then eat the eggs.

110
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
You need to follow the nutrition.

111
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm going to eat.

112
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
The food is ready. It's outside.

113
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Go eat.

114
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
I'm going to eat.

115
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I'm going to eat.

116
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Thanks.

117
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
photo

118
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Brother Zheng Boxu

119
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Director Liang.

120
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
What's up?

121
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,160
To make yourself beautiful,

122
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,520
first of all, you should adjust your teeth.

123
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,280
Checking the dental clinic?

124
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,800
It's even more difficult.

125
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,880
Is it the same thing

126
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,320
between the dental and the oral?

127
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,200
Anyway,

128
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,360
let's check it out first.

129
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
The dental clinic

130
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,440
is much more than the dental hospital.

131
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,160
How long do we have to check it out?

132
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,200
Jia Beibei didn't check

133
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,640
the relevant dental information online.

134
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,800
She might have seen it on the way.

135
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,880
We'll start from the area near her place.

136
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,480
Come in.

137
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,720
I'm early.

138
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,280
Mr. Hu, nice to meet you.

139
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,680
Let me introduce you.

140
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,400
This is Mr. Hu,

141
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,640
the director of Lvcheng Environmental Protection of our company.

142
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,120
We've met before.

143
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,000
We've met before.

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,400
Hello, Mr. Lv.

145
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,760
Then, you can talk first.

146
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,000
No, we've already finished.

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,760
Please sit.

148
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,680
Yue,

149
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,840
we're talking about the Golden Sea 37,

150
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,400
the solar power plant.

151
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,080
The environmental monitoring assessment.

152
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,000
The project is moving forward.

153
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,200
You'll meet sooner or later.

154
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,640
Right, Mr. Hu?

155
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,680
Yes, because the solar power plant

156
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,720
is a heavy industry.

157
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,520
It's been produced for so many years.

158
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,640
On the environmental issue,

159
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,880
there will be some

160
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,120
chemical and heavy soft materials left.

161
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,440
Especially heavy metals.

162
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,160
This is irreversible

163
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,240
to the health of the human body.

164
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,040
So we must deal with it properly.

165
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,840
The topic is too professional.

166
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,640
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,960
I accidentally

168
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,240
revealed the nature of Li Gongnan.

169
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,360
Actually, what I want to say is

170
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,760
if Shen Yao Zhou is here,

171
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,560
I will let her

172
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,600
participate in this project.

173
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
She should be happy

174
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
to give Xu Rui Chang a share.

175
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,360
Mr. Hu is considerate.

176
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,280
I have a meeting.

177
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,480
I'll go now.

178
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,240
Hello?

179
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,160
What's going on?

180
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,400
Mr. Qian...

181
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,800
Uncle, he numbers it.

182
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,480
It's not me.

183
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
It's you.

184
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,200
Why did you ask his leader

185
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,240
to invite you?

186
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,920
Because it's only a meeting with details,

187
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,120
Why are you here?

188
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,160
I...

189
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
I don't like him.

190
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,400
He's here to take revenge on me.

191
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:45,920
You...

192
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,880
I think you can guarantee that it won't be him.

193
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
If it's him,

194
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,880
the door won't be opened.

195
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
A few days ago,

196
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,680
I went on a blind date with him.

197
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,520
He said he was a kindergarten teacher.

198
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,360
I...

199
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,920
I like kindergarten teachers.

200
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,120
When we were chatting,

201
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,160
he asked me about the case.

202
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,680
I...

203
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,280
I just said something.

204
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,800
What did you say?

205
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,280
I said that

206
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Shen Xiaozhou's case

207
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,680
may not be related to other cases.

208
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,960
That's all I said.

209
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,720
Captain Lian,

210
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,040
I was wrong.

211
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,880
I'm willing to take any punishment.

212
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,320
You hit your phone last night

213
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,360
because of this?

214
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,880
He...

215
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,520
They exposed Zhang Haoyang.

216
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,080
I knew he was a gangster.

217
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,920
He was a gangster.

218
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,480
I knew he was a gangster.

219
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,720
I called him

220
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,200
and he still wanted to get involved in my case.

221
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
I was so angry.

222
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,280
I...

223
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,160
I...

224
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,160
I couldn't help it.

225
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,040
I came to him this morning.

226
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,800
I wanted to ask him for an explanation.

227
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,680
I found the surveillance camera.

228
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
At four o'clock in the morning,

229
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,560
a few drug addicts came into this community.

230
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,560
They had the same time as the neighbors.

231
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,120
It was too noisy.

232
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,040
There was an earthquake downstairs.

233
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,680
Zhang Haoyang?

234
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,680
Really?

235
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,240
Here,

236
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,800
find him.

237
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:11,940
Where's Zhang Haoyang?

238
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,360
He's only two hours away.

239
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,000
I heard the news

240
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,520
and I want to send a post.

241
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Most of your usual content

242
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,800
on your post

243
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,400
will have no use.

244
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,200
You saw it down?

245
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,120
Even if you have no use,

246
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,480
you still have the push to commit hurting.

247
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,320
He died because we exposed him.

248
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,160
You're a police officer.

249
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,880
Don't accuse him of being a criminal.

250
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,240
Do you still want to send it?

251
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,840
Guess

252
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,000
how the public will react.

253
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,600
You can convince yourself

254
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,280
whether he's dead or alive.

255
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,640
But it's really none of your business.

256
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,880
You worked as a reporter

257
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,000
just to singing an old folk song

258
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,080
and fail your position.

259
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,840
How justice do you consider it?

260
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,520
Be mindful

261
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,960
and衝 up!

262
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
What to do?

263
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,280
to keep the traffic.

264
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,480
At least we should keep the traffic.

265
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,440
Tell me.

266
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,960
Who is your informant?

267
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,080
The hospital.

268
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,160
Your informant last time.

269
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,000
Last time,

270
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
someone sent us an anonymous document.

271
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,920
An anonymous document?

272
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,080
Yes.

273
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,800
Where is it now?

274
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,760
We're in trouble.

275
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,680
But I can tell you.

276
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,840
The post was so popular last time

277
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,960
because of the water army.

278
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,160
I didn't find the water army.

279
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,560
It was not natural.

280
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,080
It's all true.

281
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,960
I didn't expect it to die.

282
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,640
It doesn't hurt.

283
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,360
It's just like the one my mom bit.

284
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,560
It's not even a bit.

285
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,840
Why did you hang it?

286
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,520
I've never hung it since I was a kid.

287
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,680
It's for the salt.

288
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,480
We're both the same.

289
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
We need to put salt in it.

290
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,360
You're so excited

291
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,760
because you ate the water army, right?

292
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,440
It's yours.

293
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,120
What are you doing?

294
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,560
I told you.

295
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,840
We need to eat the pork.

296
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,920
I need to replenish my blood.

297
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,800
You...

298
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,280
You're not even close to the pork.

299
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,720
You're a man.

300
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,520
You're so stupid.

301
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,720
You even ate the water army.

302
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,000
You're so stupid.

303
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,800
You said the stone was flying.

304
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,880
You didn't know how to dodge.

305
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
You even got hit.

306
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,920
Eat the chicken.

307
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,920
I'm smart.

308
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,880
So,

309
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,440
Zhang Huayang's suspicion

310
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,520
was also eliminated.

311
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,840
Yes.

312
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,200
The couple who were the witnesses

313
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,520
actually went there that night.

314
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,720
So,

315
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,520
they were in a group to cover up.

316
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,440
It's a guess.

317
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,920
I have no evidence.

318
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,200
I made a mistake yesterday.

319
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,960
I didn't hear a word and I took action.

320
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,440
Why didn't you tell me?

321
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,920
It's good that you know me.

322
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,080
Write a check later.

323
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,600
Your birthday is

324
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,000
auspicious.

325
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,160
I just randomly chose it.

326
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,120
I don't even know my own birthday.

327
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,600
And on August 8th,

328
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,280
you made it up.

329
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,120
Then we talked about the stars for nothing.

330
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,080
Why didn't I say it was accurate?

331
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,840
Why didn't you know your own birthday?

332
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,160
When I was a kid,

333
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,600
I grew up in a rural family.

334
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,080
No one knew my birthday.

335
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,160
Then your mom...

336
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,200
I'm telling you.

337
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
It's good that you don't know.

338
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,760
I chose it myself, right?

339
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,200
I can choose the day.

340
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,320
August 8th.

341
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,680
It's so good.

342
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,920
It's so cool, right?

343
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,600
Yes.

344
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,600
I heard that I was born in April.

345
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,880
In spring.

346
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,840
Spring.

347
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,080
It should be called spring.

348
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,880
Right?

349
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,080
It's so nice to hear that.

350
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,600
Right?

351
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,560
What are you talking about?

352
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,760
You were born in the first month.

353
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,920
Why didn't you say it was the first month?

354
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,920
Did you say it was the first month?

355
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,480
You...

356
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,120
Ignore him.

357
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,920
Let's go.

358
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,360
It's the first month of spring.

359
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,680
It's nice to hear that.

360
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,360
It's nice to hear that.

361
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,720
It's yours, right?

362
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,080
President Ma.

363
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,160
President Chen.

364
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,360
You have the guts to come here?

365
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,720
Is there any use of asking the police?

366
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,000
That bottom,

367
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,640
A good child

368
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,280
is being delayed

369
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,200
and turned into a bad one.

370
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,120
This is your negligence.

371
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,240
You have to take responsibility.

372
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
I'm sorry.

373
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,240
Please don't be sad.

374
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,800
The truth will clear your son's name.

375
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,560
The rumor will be legally responsible.

376
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,760
In fact, Zhang Hao Yang is a good child.

377
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,320
He's very good at it.

378
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Wait.

379
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Hao Yang

380
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,200
sent me a message yesterday.

381
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,800
Hao Yang is going to turn himself in to you?

382
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,080
Is that girl him?

383
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
No.

384
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,000
She's been expelled.

385
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,720
I'm the one who caused this.

386
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,520
If I could give her more love

387
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,200
and freedom,

388
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,440
she wouldn't have kept it from me.

389
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,360
She wouldn't have kept it from me.

390
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Dad.

391
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,080
Come on, son.

392
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
Let's go.

393
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,280
Let's go.

394
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Let's go.

395
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,640
Will he come back?

396
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,840
No. He works overtime every day.

397
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,200
What if he comes back?

398
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,440
What are you afraid of?

399
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,200
He's your dad.

400
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Shu Er.

401
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,800
Your dad is that kind of person.

402
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,720
He doesn't have any good words

403
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
or words to say.

404
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
He's so picky.

405
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
He's so picky.

406
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
He's so picky.

407
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
He's so picky.

408
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
He's so picky.

409
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
He's so picky.

410
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
He's so picky.

411
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
He's so picky.

412
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
He's so picky.

413
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
He's so picky.

414
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,120
But he's always thinking about the good.

415
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,720
He just doesn't know how to bring out the good.

416
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,480
I didn't see it.

417
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,400
I know you didn't see it.

418
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,200
You've known him for years.

419
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,440
You're better than him.

420
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,880
You're better than him.

421
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,440
How about this?

422
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,520
You be generous.

423
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
Be nice to him.

424
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,560
Why should I be nice to him?

425
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,120
If he wants to be nice to me, I'll be nice to him.

426
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,560
You just remember that he loves you.

427
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,840
Although he doesn't say it,

428
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,320
he's willing to give you anything.

429
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,600
Are you talking about him?

430
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,880
Of course it's him.

431
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
How else would I marry him?

432
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,400
Your mom is so beautiful.

433
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,280
Mom, I'm leaving.

434
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,120
Dad hasn't finished eating yet.

435
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,800
Why did you come back so early today?

436
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Don't leave.

437
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,520
I came back to get something.

438
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
I came to get something.

439
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,640
Uncle.

440
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,240
I apologize to you.

441
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,640
Don't leave.

442
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,640
Talk to me.

443
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,960
You know that

444
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,240
I'm an introvert.

445
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,760
I was more serious when I was a kid.

446
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,240
I was a lonely person.

447
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,800
I was afraid of talking to people.

448
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
I hid everything in my heart.

449
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,680
Maybe

450
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,120
I have a little autism.

451
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,920
When you're a police officer,

452
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,720
you have to say a lot of things.

453
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,800
But that's all for the case,

454
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
for work.

455
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
In daily life,

456
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,920
I'm still not good at communicating.

457
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,960
I'm not good at communicating.

458
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,280
Work has consumed my patience.

459
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,960
So I took a simple,

460
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,040
strict method for you.

461
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,600
I remember

462
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,000
since you were in junior high school,

463
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,520
we both

464
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,520
haven't sat together

465
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,160
and talked like this.

466
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,320
In my phone,

467
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,880
the most recent photos of you

468
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,760
are from your fourth grade in primary school.

469
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,560
I really don't know

470
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,480
your heart.

471
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,040
I should say

472
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,280
I'm an unworthy father.

473
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,960
But I do live in the county

474
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,880
so you should remember me.

475
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:22,760
I didn't

476
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,960
say anything

477
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,240
at that time.

478
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,000
this time,

479
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,960
forgive me.

480
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,840
It's okay.

481
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,440
By the way,

482
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,200
have you seen the driver?

483
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,880
No.

484
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,480
He ran away without stopping.

485
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,360
I didn't drive the car.

486
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm sorry.

487
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,920
I know.

488
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,200
By the way,

489
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,520
if you really want to learn how to drive,

490
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,360
I'll teach you when you're old.

491
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
My skills are not bad.

492
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,000
Of course.

493
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,760
I've never seen anyone who's better than you.

494
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,440
When you learn it,

495
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,400
if you meet someone who suddenly stops the car

496
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,840
and you can't avoid it,

497
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,040
don't let them.

498
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
You're on the right track.

499
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,440
You should be punished.

500
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,200
Dad,

501
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,360
you're talking about life again.

502
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,080
Let's go.

503
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,640
I'll send you to grandma's house.

504
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,640
I'm still going?

505
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,880
Can you

506
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,480
tell your mom

507
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,760
to go to grandma's house

508
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,200
with you for a few days?

509
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,640
Why?

510
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,440
I'm too busy

511
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,880
with the case.

512
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,960
I leave early and come back late every day.

513
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,640
It affects your mom's sleep.

514
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,160
She's bored

515
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,200
by herself.

516
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,640
How about

517
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,480
you have fun at grandma's house together?

518
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,800
After I finish the case,

519
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,000
I'll pick you up.

520
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,800
Okay?

521
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,960
What if my mom doesn't want to go?

522
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,720
She's afraid you can't eat.

523
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,160
I'll think of a way.

524
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,720
Mom,

525
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,120
I had a dream that day.

526
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,160
Eat well.

527
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:38,960
Don't be lazy.

528
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,040
I'll be back in a few days.

529
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,000
By the way,

530
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,200
don't forget to hand me the flowers.

531
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,300
Since nutrition

532
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,080
is not United Nations terms.

533
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
Tymine

534
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,460
Are you okay?

535
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,560
I'm fine

536
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,080
He's they not been testing you?

537
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,540
You see my Disability

538
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,780
It's a small problem.

539
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,180
It's okay. I'll recover quickly.

540
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,500
I'll go to the hospital after the surgery.

541
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,020
Oh, right.

542
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,820
Help me write the check-up.

543
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,260
Write it yourself.

544
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,740
It's yours. Help me with it.

545
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,220
So the injury treatment is so good.

546
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:07,860
Then I'll...

547
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,860
You still dare to say it?

548
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,420
Why is the comment gone?

549
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,500
Which comment?

550
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
The post I told you last time.

551
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,580
Someone posted a picture below.

552
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,140
It's a picture of Shen Xiaozhou

553
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,300
playing pipa live.

554
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,340
Why was it deleted?

555
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,500
I also want to make a report.

556
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,860
Is it cut off?

557
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,700
Cut off.

558
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,100
No. You eat it yourself.

559
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,580
I have to go check it out.

560
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,900
Is it cut off or checked?

561
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,500
What's the difference between a good photographer and a bad one?

562
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,700
A good technical police officer is just a photographer?

563
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,500
Go ahead and eat. I'll wash the dishes after you finish.

564
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,300
I'll go.

565
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,100
Have you seen it?

566
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,500
I have. I recognized it at a glance.

567
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,700
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

568
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,500
I was looking at this tooth.

569
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,500
I was thinking about what plan I had for her.

570
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
This girl is quite talkative.

571
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,500
I even talked to her for a long time.

572
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Then I wondered why she didn't come.

573
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Then did she say

574
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,700
why she had to get a tooth?

575
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,500
That's because the tooth is not up.

576
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,300
Oh, right.

577
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,500
It seems that after getting a tooth, she can be a anchor.

578
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
An anchor?

579
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,300
Yes.

580
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,700
What kind of anchor did she say?

581
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,700
The kind that can make money online.

582
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:57,700
She can sing, dance, and talk.

583
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:02,100
Also, she said that a friend's company has approved her.

584
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,700
The commission is higher.

585
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,700
She said that after half a month, she can pay off the tooth.

586
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,500
What company?

587
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
She didn't say.

588
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,700
Let's investigate Wang Yishan's social relations.

589
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,700
See if she also has the will to be a anchor.

590
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,300
I thought all these anchors were single.

591
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,100
I didn't expect there would be a company.

592
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,100
Linzi, you're childish.

593
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,300
Do you think these network breaks are real?

594
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,100
Wang Meng, come.

595
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,560
Yes.

596
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,500
How about the economists?

597
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,100
They still have two.

598
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,900
It's complete.

599
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,340
Wait.

600
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,460
No rush.

601
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,140
This screenshot

602
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,260
is a comment under the hotline.

603
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,460
It was deleted today.

604
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,460
I checked it

605
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,260
and posted the comment's ID.

606
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,020
It was searched online.

607
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,260
Many users

608
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,380
use the same user name

609
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,660
on different websites.

610
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:37,740
Fortunately,

611
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,060
the user name is quite special.

612
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,420
It should be

613
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,220
the culture of

614
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,500
hating and hating.

615
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,580
According to the IP address of the city,

616
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,460
and the narrow scope,

617
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,540
I found a hidden

618
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,580
personal page.

619
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:50,940
This should be

620
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,580
a website created by him.

621
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,460
There are many such small videos

622
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,140
which are not popular at that time.

623
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,020
The source of that comment

624
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,980
should be

625
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,100
this video.

626
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,860
The video is more than ten minutes long.

627
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,020
When Shen Xiaozhou

628
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,500
played the second song,

629
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,100
someone started to give him a reward.

630
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,700
This self-made love

631
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,340
was also rewarded.

632
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,300
I counted it.

633
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,460
In ten minutes,

634
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,380
he almost got

635
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,660
a gift of 5 or 6 thousand yuan.

636
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,700
5 or 6 thousand yuan?

637
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,460
RMB or game coin?

638
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,260
It's equivalent to

639
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,380
RMB 5 or 6 thousand yuan.

640
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,820
Is he stupid?

641
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,740
He has money at home.

642
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,980
And this video

643
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,420
is not popular at that time.

644
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,820
And the comment of this person

645
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,860
is very low.

646
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,980
He always asked Shen Xiaozhou

647
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,820
to wear less.

648
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,620
It's quite strange.

649
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,540
Later, Shen Xiaozhou

650
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,420
stopped the live broadcast.

651
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,860
This is the photo of his

652
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,260
main page.

653
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:02,940
No face.

654
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,020
A little familiar.

655
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,660
You know him?

656
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,780
No.

657
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,500
The background is a little familiar.

658
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,940
I know where he is.

659
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,860
Well done.

660
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,940
Well done.

661
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,100
Lvcheng Environmental Protection Company.

662
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,940
This is the tip of that tree.

663
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,620
So this

664
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,620
is a love story.

665
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,900
It's possible that

666
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,580
he has seen Shen Xiaozhou himself.

667
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,420
Could it be

668
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,180
that Shen Xiaozhou

669
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,300
found the person

670
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,100
who stopped the live broadcast.

671
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,060
He is going to

672
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,660
tell the company his next action.

673
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,180
So he...

674
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,380
After Lvcheng,

675
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,620
don't reveal our purpose first.

676
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,100
Make sure he takes the bullet.

677
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,780
Why?

678
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,660
I think the case is a little complicated.

679
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,220
There is another involved

680
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,140
behind the murderer.

681
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,460
There is also a helper.

682
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,260
What does it mean?

683
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,180
I have a feeling.

684
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,580
Shen Xiaozhou's case

685
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,140
has been

686
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,700
searched outside the room.

687
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,340
We haven't found that door.

688
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,100
Mr. Hu is having a meeting.

689
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,100
Do you want to go and see him?

690
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,740
No.

691
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,740
Let's wait.

692
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,380
Wait.

693
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,420
Where is the bathroom?

694
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,380
Go in and go inside.

695
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,460
On that corner.

696
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,260
On your right hand.

697
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,660
I'm a little thirsty.

698
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,540
Can I have a glass of water?

699
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,500
I'll get it for you.

700
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:43,980
No, no.

701
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,780
You do your work.

702
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,620
I'll do it myself.

703
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,940
Please.

704
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,740
It's okay, don't wipe it.

705
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,740
This guy must have gone to the restroom.

706
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,740
When he comes back, tell him I'm sorry.

707
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,740
He's been on leave for days.

708
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,740
Captain Liang,

709
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,740
I'm sorry for the trouble. I just came back from a meeting.

710
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,740
Let's go in.

711
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,740
No need. Just a few words.

712
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,740
I just want to ask

713
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,740
if Shen Xiaozhou has

714
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,740
asked your company to pay her a salary in advance.

715
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,740
Or

716
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,740
did your company pay her a salary in advance?

717
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,740
No, never.

718
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,740
Then let your financial department give me a certificate.

719
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,740
It's such a small thing.

720
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,740
Just call me.

721
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,740
According to the rules, we have to ask in person.

722
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,740
By the way,

723
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,740
the case has not been broken yet.

724
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,740
We still need to expand the scope of investigation.

725
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,740
Can you give me the name of the person who came to your company?

726
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,740
Just give me a name, ID number, phone number.

727
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,740
No problem, I'll call you right away.

728
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,740
I'll tell you about the last time.

729
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,740
Thank you for signing up for me.

730
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,740
Yes, what's your name?

731
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,740
Huang Bin.

732
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,740
Just this time, the break is too small.

733
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,740
I'll call you later.

734
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,740
Change the garden.

735
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,740
Did he run away?

736
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,740
What's his phone number?

737
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,740
I'll order a cup.

738
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,740
Who are you?

739
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,740
Shen Xiaoshu has been to your company several times.

740
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,740
You should have seen her.

741
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,740
The one who was killed.

742
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,740
I heard it was worth it.

743
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,740
You recognized her as soon as you saw her.

744
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,740
I didn't know her before.

745
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,740
How could I recognize her?

746
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,740
You gave her a gift of several thousand yuan.

747
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,740
You should not forget.

748
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,740
What do you mean?

749
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,740
This is you who made the love and hate.

750
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,740
Does Shen Xiaozhou know this is you?

751
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,740
How could she know?

752
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,740
It's anonymous.

753
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,740
It's not hard to find you.

754
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,740
We spent half an hour to find the song.

755
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,740
She found you.

756
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,740
You won't be easy to be in the company.

757
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,740
She won't find out.

758
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,740
She saw me in the company.

759
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,740
She's very friendly.

760
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,740
Did someone find out?

761
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,740
Why did you delete these screenshots?

762
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,740
Did someone force you to delete them?

763
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,740
No, I didn't.

764
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,740
I deleted them myself.

765
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,740
Why did you delete them?

766
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,740
You did this to let everyone know

767
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,740
that Shen Xiaozhou is not a good girl.

768
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,740
You still have a grudge against her.

769
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,740
But have you thought about it?

770
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:31,740
Maybe Shen Xiaozhou doesn't hate you.

771
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,740
She would even be grateful to you.

772
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,740
You gave her a gift of several thousand yuan.

773
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,740
She probably can't see it.

774
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,740
She didn't respond to me at all.

775
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,740
Maybe she has some difficulties.

776
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,740
Shen Xiaozhou is the anchor.

777
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,740
She did it willingly

778
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,740
or was forced to do it?

779
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,740
The one who forced you to delete these screenshots

780
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,740
was also worried that

781
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,740
Shen Xiaozhou would be found out as the anchor.

782
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,740
Someone forced you to delete the screenshots, right?

783
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,740
If not, you wouldn't hesitate.

784
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,740
You would immediately reject me.

785
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:29,740
Can you protect me?

786
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,740
Yes.

787
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,740
I can arrange for you to go to the hospital

788
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,740
and get a special care.

789
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,740
They...

790
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,740
They?

791
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,740
Not only one person.

792
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,740
One person?

793
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,740
I deleted them and you still beat me with a stick?

794
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,740
Who?

795
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,740
You didn't show your face with a headscarf?

796
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,740
I was pretending to be married.

797
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,740
I heard them calling someone

798
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,740
named Ou.

799
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,740
Ou?

800
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,740
You said

801
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,740
Shen Xiaozhou

802
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,740
would be the kind of person that Chen Hui said.

803
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,740
What?

804
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,740
In my memory,

805
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,740
I was the one who said

806
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,740
Shen Xiaozhou

807
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,740
would be the one.

808
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,740
I didn't expect

809
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,740
Shen Xiaozhou would be the anchor.

810
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,740
What about the anchor?

811
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,740
The room where he was the anchor

812
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,740
was a bedroom.

813
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,740
It wasn't the university dormitory

814
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,740
or his house.

815
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,740
In the investigation,

816
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,740
he didn't rent any other house.

817
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,740
Where was he?

818
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,740
Could it be

819
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,740
that he has another kind of personality?

820
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,740
Even if he is different from what we imagine,

821
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,740
what's wrong with him?

822
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,740
But his education, character and ideas

823
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,740
shouldn't be like this.

824
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,740
It's not something that's not glorious.

825
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,740
He just wants to make money for his family.

826
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,740
That's not the way he should make money.

827
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,740
What do you mean?

828
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,740
It's not serious.

829
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,740
It's too serious.

830
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,740
No.

831
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,740
Maybe I can't keep up with this era.

832
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,740
I always feel that...

833
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,740
What's your era like?

834
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,740
Have you never seen

835
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,740
a girl like this?

836
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,740
I remember the victims

837
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,740
of the cases that I've handled before.

838
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,740
They were all after

839
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,740
things that made life easier.

840
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,740
This easy-to-get

841
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,740
seems to create a habit.

842
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,740
It's okay.

843
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,740
It's easy, but it can't stop.

844
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,740
The deeper it gets,

845
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,740
in the end,

846
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,740
it gets seen.

847
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,740
You mean

848
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,740
they deserve to die.

849
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,740
It's their fault.

850
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,740
They deserve it.

851
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,740
Why do we police have to handle cases?

852
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,740
What are you talking about?

853
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,740
Hello?

854
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,740
I found out.

855
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,740
Ling Chuan is just a singer.

856
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,740
His real name is Ao Xiaojie.

857
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,740
This singer

858
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,740
is...

859
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,740
How do you say it?

860
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,740
A crab.

861
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,740
Isn't the big crab also a singer?

862
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,740
That singer...

863
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,740
Ao Xiaojie

864
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,740
is a character in the past.

865
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,740
He has a big

866
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,740
cultural success company.

867
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,740
They mainly run

868
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,740
online live broadcasts.

869
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,740
I think they have 20 live broadcasts.

870
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,740
Is there Shen Xiaozhou?

871
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,740
No. He seems to be a test user.

872
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,740
He was investigated once last year.

873
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,740
He was fined for

874
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,740
his low-level performance.

875
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,740
But it seems to be still in operation.

876
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,740
The company's specific location is...

877
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,740
Baoyang Building.

878
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,740
Yes.

879
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,740
Tao.

880
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,740
His name is Ao Xiaojie.

881
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,740
He won't go back.

882
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,740
He will go to Ao Xiaojie's company.

883
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,740
Now?

884
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,740
He's late. He's off work.

885
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,740
Their industry

886
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,740
starts working at night.

887
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,740
This case

888
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,740
starts with the first suspect,

889
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,740
Wu Bo.

890
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,740
Then Chen Hui.

891
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,740
Then Zhang Haoyang.

892
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,740
There's always someone

893
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,740
or a force

894
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,740
fighting with us.

895
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,740
They want to

896
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,740
distort our direction of investigation.

897
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,740
You think it's

898
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,740
Ao Xiaojie?

899
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,740
I think

900
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,740
the door to this room

901
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,740
might be found.

902
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,740
I'm sorry.

903
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,740
I'm sorry.

904
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,740
I'm sorry.

905
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,740
I'm sorry.

906
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,740
I'm sorry.

907
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,740
I'm sorry.

908
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,740
I'm sorry.

909
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,740
I'm sorry.

910
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,740
I'm sorry.

911
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,740
I'm sorry.

912
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,740
I'm sorry.

913
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,740
I'm sorry.

914
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,740
I'm sorry.

915
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,740
I'm sorry.

916
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,740
If I can see clearly

917
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,740
the dark night

918
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,740
and the light of fate

919
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,740
will shine on me.

920
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,740
If I can

921
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,740
hear the heartbeat

922
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,740
and feel the echo

923
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,740
of the past,

924
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,740
how I wish to

925
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,740
become the light

926
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,740
and light up

927
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,740
the way

928
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,740
I came.

929
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,740
The truth is

930
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,740
I'm still

931
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,740
in the deep end.

932
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,740
Memories are like

933
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,740
a gust of wind that

934
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,740
cuts through the night.

935
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,740
The story

936
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,740
is like a dream.

937
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,740
The dream

938
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,740
is like a prison

939
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,740
that's trapped

940
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,740
in the prison.

941
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,740
Is there

942
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,740
a gust of wind

943
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,740
that can

944
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,740
blow away the mist?

945
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,740
Is there

946
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,740
a firework

947
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,740
that can

948
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,740
burn the lies from the beginning?

949
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,740
If I can

950
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,740
see clearly the dark night

951
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,740
and the light of fate

952
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,740
will shine on me.

953
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,740
If I can hear the heartbeat

954
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,740
and feel the echo

955
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,740
of the past,

956
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,740
how I wish to

957
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,740
become the light

958
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,740
and light up

959
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,740
the way I came.

960
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,740
The truth is

961
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,740
I'm still

962
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,740
in the deep end.
