1
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,240
We can't afford to waste our precious time no matter what

2
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,440
Yes, Miss

3
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,700
I don't know about the operation

4
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,620
But thank you

5
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,780
Chen Cuいて

6
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,060
He's from the same family as me.

7
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,020
He's my son.

8
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,380
His surname is Li.

9
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,900
He has a girlfriend.

10
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,420
Shen Chen is a high-class seafood restaurant.

11
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,780
That's all.

12
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,140
I'm sorry.

13
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,460
I only know this much.

14
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,140
No problem.

15
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,660
There are a few seafood restaurants in Shen Chen.

16
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,700
They're all out of business.

17
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,820
Give me 24 hours.

18
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,820
I'll go there overnight.

19
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,860
Please.

20
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,420
You're still following me?

21
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,380
Wait for me.

22
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,780
I just counted one of the pollutants.

23
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,700
The main point is the data of the pit.

24
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,820
According to the pollution level in the original soil,

25
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,540
the repair method is the same as the amount of the medicine.

26
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,300
Okay, I won't explain the principle in detail.

27
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,180
In short,

28
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,580
it's hard to get the result in the environmental report.

29
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,940
It's impossible to remove 99.9% of the soil.

30
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,900
You mean

31
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,740
the report is nonsense?

32
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,060
This is just a report.

33
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,580
Maybe the land has been done a lot of research.

34
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,260
Maybe the land has been done further repair.

35
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,420
It's already reached the standard.

36
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,420
If you want to know

37
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,260
how high the pollution level is now,

38
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,780
it's best to do a soil sample now.

39
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,100
I'll re-evaluate it.

40
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,820
I'm afraid Shen Xiaozhou has done this.

41
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,020
If Shen Xiaozhou wants to do a soil sample

42
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,900
and do a pollution analysis,

43
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,820
is it also in this lab?

44
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,380
Yes, I checked the record.

45
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,260
Shen Xiaozhou...

46
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,340
It's true.

47
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,780
On June 5,

48
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,340
Shen Xiaozhou used a soil sample.

49
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,260
If he did the experiment here,

50
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,060
there should be data in the computer.

51
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,300
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,660
The computer was broken last time.

53
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,180
The data was lost.

54
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,820
What are you doing?

55
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,060
Nothing.

56
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,220
What's in the code?

57
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,100
What did you say?

58
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,940
I said the computer was lost.

59
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,540
It can't be restored.

60
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,700
Could it be that they did it?

61
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,780
They are busy enough to be lost everywhere.

62
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,260
We want to borrow something from you.

63
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,580
If Shen Xiaozhou really found out such a big secret,

64
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,380
it's like he's loaded with a bomb.

65
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,620
Li Ronghe is a human being.

66
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,780
He eats his own green organic and polluted food

67
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,460
and sells it to the people on poisonous soil.

68
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,540
That's the kind of person

69
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,740
who can't be trusted.

70
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,580
He's a human being.

71
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,380
He's a human being.

72
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,220
That's the kind of person

73
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,700
who's a worthless businessman.

74
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,300
We're sure that

75
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,100
Shen Xiaozhou has never stepped on the sample.

76
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,300
Is the land of Jinhai No. 1 poisonous?

77
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,460
What if it really reaches the target?

78
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,820
How about applying for a search warrant

79
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,620
and sealing down Jinhai No. 1?

80
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,540
We have to do this quietly.

81
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,540
I'm going to get in the car for a while.

82
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,180
When the sun rises,

83
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,260
you go back to the team and find some people

84
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,780
to go to Jinhai No. 1 to find me.

85
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,300
Why are you going alone?

86
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,100
The place we're going is called Wangyun Sea.

87
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,980
When you open the window,

88
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,180
you can feel the sea.

89
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,300
The whole neighborhood

90
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,340
is filled with fitness rooms,

91
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,060
and our kindergartens.

92
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,740
You can go now.

93
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,900
Sir.

94
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,980
Hello.

95
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,180
Hello.

96
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,660
My name is Lian Haiping.

97
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,500
Your chairman Li Longhe

98
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,540
asked me to come and check on the house.

99
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,900
Hello, Mr. Lian.

100
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,860
He may have never greeted you.

101
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,860
I'm just asking for a moment.

102
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,460
Do you want to ask him?

103
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,660
Oh, right.

104
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,780
I know you.

105
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,180
Your chairman Li Longhe

106
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,420
has given awards to employees who are good at their work.

107
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,740
You won the first prize.

108
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,620
He showed me that video.

109
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,420
No need to ask.

110
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,980
I'll show you our sample room first.

111
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,020
If you like it, let's talk about it.

112
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,460
I don't want to run upstairs and downstairs.

113
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,500
I'll just watch the video in the sample room.

114
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,580
I work in the public security system.

115
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,860
I need to take a look at the security of the community.

116
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,180
Please introduce it to me.

117
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,540
Okay.

118
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,260
The walls of the community are all installed with infrared detectors.

119
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,260
It connects to our central host.

120
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,180
Once someone crosses the wall, they call the police.

121
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,260
The security of the community

122
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,540
is also everywhere,

123
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,820
even in layers.

124
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,220
This is called over-protection and surveillance.

125
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,020
The security level is definitely top-notch.

126
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,020
The business is very skilled.

127
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,420
Congratulations on your first prize.

128
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,020
Oh, right.

129
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,500
Actually, that day was quite sudden.

130
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,340
No one informed us in advance.

131
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,660
The chairman suddenly came.

132
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,300
The big prize was directly in my hands.

133
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,580
It's like saving money.

134
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,540
How long does video surveillance last?

135
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,900
Ninety days, the highest standard.

136
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,540
Hello?

137
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,740
Yes.

138
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,380
Yes.

139
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,740
Okay.

140
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,220
My colleagues are also leaders of the relevant departments.

141
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,740
They also want to come and have a look.

142
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,220
They're all at the door.

143
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,740
Hi, welcome.

144
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,140
I'll pick them up right now.

145
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,820
When they arrive, you can take them around.

146
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,740
Don't worry about me.

147
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,180
Okay.

148
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,100
Go

149
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,460
and buy us something new

150
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,980
and I'll send you PS福 source concerns.

151
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,580
What Louise Boll스가 was trying to tell us

152
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,060
was that when he was drunk,

153
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,740
she was driving to the opposite end

154
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,620
of the street and flipped a Embassy driver off.

155
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,060
Our car didn't turn out as well.

156
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,740
We asked the police to stop working and

157
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,020
drive to improve the situation.

158
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,220
They were trying to getSíنا.

159
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,580
My colleaguesAPPLAUSE

160
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,780
that at the last minute,

161
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,100
the apartment was completely revolutionized

162
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,660
Shen Xiaozhou can't prove it.

163
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,020
It's not a threat to them.

164
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,620
Besides,

165
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,500
they don't have the patience like us.

166
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,340
Our neighborhood is really close to the sea.

167
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,500
It's only three or five minutes.

168
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,460
It's only 200 meters in total.

169
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,180
That's great.

170
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,300
But will it be too noisy?

171
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,260
It's too close to the sea.

172
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,700
No.

173
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,500
The house noise in our neighborhood

174
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,340
is very good.

175
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,100
Is there a kindergarten nearby?

176
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,380
Yes, there is.

177
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,540
There is a kindergarten in our neighborhood.

178
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,060
That's good.

179
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,100
I'm listening to you.

180
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,620
Are you having a cold?

181
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,220
Yes, I've been working hard lately.

182
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,860
There are so many people who have a cold recently.

183
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,940
It's not good to have a cold.

184
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,180
Some people have a fever.

185
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,540
Some people have a cold.

186
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,980
You should drink more hot water.

187
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,860
It's not easy to work when you come out.

188
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,300
Where is your home?

189
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,740
It's in Shanxi.

190
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,740
Shanxi.

191
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,140
Can you go back to your hometown?

192
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,580
I have friends in Shanxi.

193
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,700
I can go back to my hometown

194
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,020
when I'm on vacation.

195
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,780
What's this?

196
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,700
It's a sea of ​​sand.

197
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,460
Look at this.

198
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,940
This is a special art

199
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,780
made by a top artist in China.

200
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,580
Art?

201
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,300
Yes.

202
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,140
This is art.

203
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,220
I thought it was a wind and water.

204
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,580
What kind of artist is this?

205
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,340
Aren't you doing business?

206
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,620
What does this mean?

207
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,940
This stone is also caught from the sea.

208
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,540
The iron chain is tied up and tied up.

209
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,460
What does it mean?

210
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,220
It symbolizes the cohesion of everyone in our entire community.

211
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,740
It's a small thing, right?

212
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,940
To put it bluntly, it's the cohesion of our entire country.

213
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,460
Right?

214
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,700
You're right.

215
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,780
This is the iron chain

216
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,700
that tied up the stone.

217
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,580
It's a real stone.

218
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,420
I found it.

219
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,060
It's him, right?

220
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,380
This is the one.

221
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,780
And then everyone is decorating.

222
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,260
I think I still like the low-level one.

223
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,620
The high one is not good.

224
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,780
The low-level one is low-level.

225
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,460
Right?

226
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,660
Look, I have that experience.

227
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,700
This one.

228
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,500
In the high-level building,

229
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,260
look at the view outside.

230
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,780
Look.

231
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,300
Leader.

232
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,500
Go down.

233
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,660
I'll go back to the car.

234
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,060
You go.

235
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,660
You go.

236
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,260
You go.

237
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,460
The high-level building.

238
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,380
When you work,

239
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,660
you see the things below.

240
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,780
You are in a good mood.

241
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,540
You're in a good mood.

242
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,540
You're in a good mood.

243
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,540
You're in a good mood.

244
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,540
You're in a good mood.

245
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,300
Very good.

246
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,300
Captain Yan.

247
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,860
Come.

248
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,620
Send it to Cheng Hui immediately.

249
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
I know what you're investigating.

250
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,140
I forgot.

251
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,300
You Lessyie said

252
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,260
you're assigned to work at Beijing Turbine Fares.

253
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,660
I got a call from Qiu Jun again.

254
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,820
There are two more things.

255
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,580
Shen Xiao Zhou may have found

256
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,340
the magnificence of By droit called 1

257
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,180
gotaria tilted over.

258
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
No. 1.

259
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
Is that true?

260
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,580
This is a big deal.

261
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,020
I hope I'm wrong too.

262
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,140
Do you have any idea

263
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,020
about the timeline you want to know?

264
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,660
If Shen Xiaozhong can confirm

265
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,740
that No. 1 is indeed

266
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,180
a soil pollution problem,

267
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,620
then on June 19,

268
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,580
after the farewell party,

269
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,340
he should have wanted to go to Lv Cheng's company.

270
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,980
Because the environmental report of No. 1

271
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,740
was made by Lv Cheng.

272
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,140
He went to Lv Cheng

273
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,540
to find the vice president of Lv Cheng,

274
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,620
Hu Xiangze.

275
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,580
Because Hu Xiangze is his senior.

276
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,820
He can trust him.

277
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,820
On the way, he found out

278
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,980
that Hu Xiangze was on a business trip.

279
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,700
He went to Qingzhou.

280
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,860
He thought that

281
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,060
he knew Li Longhe.

282
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,020
Li Longhe had expressed his feelings to him.

283
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,580
He thought that

284
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,380
he should go to Li Longhe directly.

285
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,100
These are all my speculations.

286
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,340
I haven't confirmed it yet.

287
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:50,900
Hello, Lin.

288
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,900
I found Xiangze's girlfriend.

289
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,700
She said that Xiangze

290
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,420
didn't find her at all.

291
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,260
Her phone has been out of service for several days.

292
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,180
I asked her colleague in the restaurant.

293
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,700
She said that the situation was true.

294
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,380
Okay.

295
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,580
Thank you.

296
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,500
You can come back.

297
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,980
I may

298
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,420
have to go to Qianlong Bay.

299
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,980
Come on, sit down.

300
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,780
Sit down and eat together.

301
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,580
Get two more dishes.

302
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:31,940
I've eaten.

303
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,540
You don't have any wedding dishes.

304
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,620
I'll eat vegetarian food.

305
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,620
June 2,

306
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,060
Han Chao Club

307
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,260
The file agent

308
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,860
didn't install the Pinyong contract.

309
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,700
It wasn't you who gave it to Shen Xiaozhou.

310
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,820
It was him who showed it to you.

311
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,780
It should be

312
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:09,560
the report of the

313
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,460
Shen Xiaozhou came in the afternoon on June 19.

314
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,660
He came by a rental car

315
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,940
of a villager.

316
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,860
Now he is paying with his phone.

317
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,260
When he is cleaning the car,

318
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,380
the payment documentation

319
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,580
would track the time

320
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,820
and passives at that moment.

321
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,740
The passives were very accurate.

322
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,260
Yes.

323
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,620
He came in the morning.

324
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,420
I'm sorry.

325
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,620
I didn't find any free food

326
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,620
I didn't want to tell you last time.

327
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,620
What did he tell you?

328
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,620
He talked about his professional insights.

329
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,620
Is it about the pollution of Jinghai No. 1?

330
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,620
He is an excellent college student.

331
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,620
His professional knowledge is very solid.

332
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,620
But after all, students are easy to be caught in the trap.

333
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,620
They can't get out of the professional trap.

334
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,620
I answered his question at that time.

335
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,620
We will do a comprehensive investigation again.

336
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,620
At the same time, I also found Mr. Hu from Lvcheng.

337
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,620
Hu Xiangze, you know each other, right?

338
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,620
I told Mr. Hu

339
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,620
that if there is a mistake, you must correct it.

340
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,620
This is my principle.

341
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,620
This matter involves a lot of people.

342
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,620
We can't just conclude it easily.

343
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,620
If the rumors spread out,

344
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,620
it will have a bad impact on society.

345
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,620
If there is any negative impact,

346
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,620
no one can take this responsibility.

347
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,620
So you came last time.

348
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,620
I really can't tell you.

349
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,620
Even now,

350
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,620
I still hope you can keep it secret for the time being.

351
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:31,620
Wait until the final test result comes out.

352
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,620
We are investigating the murder case.

353
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,620
The question is the whereabouts of the victim.

354
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
No matter what the reason is,

355
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,620
you shouldn't have hidden such important details last time.

356
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,620
There is a story.

357
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,620
I don't know if you have heard of it.

358
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,620
There used to be a place where the mountains were flooded.

359
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:14,620
The farmers there lived a low life.

360
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,620
One day, a man from the village was born.

361
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,620
He was powerful since he was a child.

362
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,620
He grew up and became a giant.

363
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,620
He helped the villagers move a mountain and opened a river.

364
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,620
The river led to the water source.

365
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,620
With the farmland and water,

366
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,620
the villagers' lives were filled up in a few years.

367
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,620
They were full of food and clothing.

368
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,620
At first, everyone was grateful for this giant.

369
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,620
But this giant has a very big body.

370
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,620
He wants to live in a house as big as a palace.

371
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,620
And he needs to eat a hundred meals a day.

372
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,620
So, over time,

373
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,620
the villagers started to have a problem with him.

374
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,620
Why would he eat a cow for a meal?

375
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,620
It's a waste.

376
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,620
He had to live in such a big house.

377
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:35,620
The giant died by accident when he was moving another mountain.

378
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,620
Someone called all the villagers.

379
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,620
They wanted to interrogate the giant.

380
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,620
The giant was very sad and disappointed.

381
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,620
So he went to his palace on the mountain.

382
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:59,620
He couldn't come down from his palace.

383
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,620
What a bad story.

384
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,620
You made it up.

385
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,620
You remember it wrong.

386
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,620
The villagers were not that petty.

387
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,620
Even if the giant helped them get more food and food,

388
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,620
and ate a cow,

389
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,620
the villagers would know that their life was much better than before.

390
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,620
Besides,

391
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,620
does the giant need to eat a cow every meal?

392
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,620
The ending of the story is wrong.

393
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,620
The giant killed a chicken.

394
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,620
The girl was seen by the farmer.

395
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,620
Before the girl said anything,

396
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,620
the giant killed the girl.

397
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,620
Am I right?

398
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,620
The story is a story.

399
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,620
Everyone has their own version.

400
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,620
But I've asked about your case.

401
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,620
Sheng Xiaozhou was killed in the middle of the night.

402
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,620
He came to my place that day.

403
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,620
I sent a car at six o'clock and sent him away.

404
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:24,620
I don't know where he went and who he met.

405
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,620
Who sent you?

406
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,620
Where?

407
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,620
Mr. Li, he did it.

408
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,620
You should answer the questions of the two officers.

409
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,620
You should answer them one by one.

410
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,620
Think it over.

411
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,620
Yes.

412
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,620
Tell me about the two officers.

413
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,620
He was supposed to be sent back to school that day.

414
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,620
He went to...

415
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,620
He went here.

416
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,620
He said he was getting off the car.

417
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,620
I didn't send him away.

418
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,620
I let him go.

419
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,620
I found a bus to the gas station.

420
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,620
He should have gone home.

421
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,620
They said there was no surveillance at the place where Sheng Xiaozhou got off the car.

422
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,620
But there was a surveillance at the intersection of Xiangling and Hongli.

423
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
I did see the target vehicle.

424
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,620
It passed twice in a row.

425
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,620
The time is right.

426
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,620
They pushed one after another.

427
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,620
I almost believed it.

428
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,620
Sheng Xiaozhou and Yu Hai have nothing to do with them.

429
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,620
Let's go to a place.

430
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,620
There is a place that I can't figure out.

431
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,620
I will come here to run.

432
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,620
This place is good.

433
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,620
Can I come here in the future?

434
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,620
I told you last time.

435
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,620
I think...

436
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,620
Sheng Xiaozhou should be like your mother.

437
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,620
She has experienced those difficulties and despair.

438
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,620
What should I do when I face an enemy that I can't defeat?

439
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,620
How is it?

440
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,620
Simply put, the soil restoration is very complex.

441
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,620
Several trees are seriously polluted.

442
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,620
It doesn't meet the standard of building use.

443
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,620
I will send you the data later.

444
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,620
I will send you the data later.

445
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,620
I will send you the data later.

446
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,620
I will send you the data later.

447
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,620
I will send you the data later.

448
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,620
Okay.

449
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,620
Thank you.

450
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,620
And keep it secret.

451
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,620
By the way, the report of the anti-bio-report is made by Lv Chen, right?

452
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,620
How do you know?

453
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,620
I have researched many reports of their company before.

454
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,620
I can see it.

455
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,620
I said it earlier.

456
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,620
That Mr. Hu is not a person who is not in the political position.

457
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,620
I saw him come to school to send a girl.

458
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,620
We checked.

459
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,620
He and Sheng Xiaozhou are not the kind of relationship you said.

460
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,620
I didn't say it was Sheng Xiaozhou.

461
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,620
Anyway, she is also a girl from our school.

462
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,620
Do you remember when it was?

463
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,620
That day was at night.

464
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,620
I came back from home and saw her at the school gate.

465
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,620
Which girl?

466
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
I didn't see this clearly.

467
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,620
But I don't know this girl either.

468
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,620
Could it be the girl from Lotus Hotel?

469
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,620
Do you remember which day?

470
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,620
The last day of the fifth and first period holiday.

471
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
True that day.

472
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:14,620
Flator novels are lacking in script.

473
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:34,700
The

474
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,600
all the good people in your field.

475
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:48,240
You're the junior student.

476
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,040
Why are you pensions?

477
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,680
Why do you need pensions?

478
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,720
You don't even know?

479
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
is really hard.

480
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,960
He found

481
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,560
a small mistake in our company.

482
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,360
A small mistake?

483
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,680
I understand his concern.

484
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,440
I explained it to him.

485
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,280
Maybe it was when we

486
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,800
were doing environmental evaluation,

487
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,960
the coverage of the dye wasn't full enough.

488
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,840
There were some

489
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,200
small particles

490
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,880
that didn't meet the appropriate standards.

491
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,240
That's possible.

492
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,320
But we must solve this problem.

493
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,640
Because it relates to

494
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,160
the personal interests of the owner.

495
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,720
Even if it has no significant impact

496
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,080
on health,

497
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,800
we must solve this problem.

498
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,920
It's not easy.

499
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,040
Our professional research team

500
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
is already

501
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,160
working on some countermeasures.

502
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,800
I think

503
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,560
there will be a

504
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,720
feasible plan soon.

505
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,960
The day when Shen Xiao Zhu was in trouble,

506
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,720
you were in Qingzhou.

507
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,080
Yes.

508
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,640
You were with your girlfriend,

509
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,680
right?

510
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,680
The woman in the hotel surveillance camera.

511
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,760
Your girlfriend is looking at how to define it, right?

512
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,040
She is Yue Chun Xia, right?

513
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,320
Yes.

514
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,920
We

515
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,920
just left like this?

516
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,400
I asked everything she should have.

517
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,560
She said what she should have.

518
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,160
I don't know

519
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,920
how Shen Xiao Zhu

520
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,240
knew that the guardian

521
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,640
was not in the company

522
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,680
on her way to Lv Cheng.

523
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,640
Yue Chun Xia

524
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,000
told her on the phone.

525
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:29,840
Yes.

526
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,120
Do you think

527
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,760
she knows about

528
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,160
Jing Hai's case?

529
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
Why are you here again?

530
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,000
We want to find Yue Chun Xia again.

531
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
Just a few words.

532
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,200
I'm sorry.

533
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,920
I'm sorry.

534
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,640
I'm sorry.

535
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,320
I'm sorry.

536
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,040
I'm sorry.

537
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,200
She hasn't woken up yet.

538
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,400
She's sick.

539
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
It's too exciting.

540
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,360
She hasn't recovered yet.

541
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,400
Chun Xia.

542
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,960
Captain Lian and others are here.

543
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,600
Wait a minute.

544
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,440
Can we talk inside?

545
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,640
Come in.

546
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,920
We want to talk to her alone.

547
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,760
Okay.

548
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,440
From today,

549
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,640
we shouldn't have

550
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,480
I'm not sure.

551
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,760
Are you in a relationship with Hu Xiang Ze?

552
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,480
It's okay.

553
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,480
We just want to verify it with you.

554
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,800
On June 19th,

555
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,600
you were the day

556
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Shen Xiaozhou was born.

557
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,480
Where is Hu Xiang Ze?

558
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,760
In Qingzhou.

559
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,960
I'm there too.

560
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,800
When did you go to Qingzhou?

561
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,000
Were you together all the time?

562
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,120
He went to see a client in the day.

563
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,560
He went back to the hotel late at night.

564
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,560
We came back the next day.

565
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,600
How did you know Hu Xiang Ze?

566
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,000
Yes, I knew him through Xiaozhou.

567
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,000
What did you say

568
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,880
to Shen Xiaozhou

569
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,280
at 4 p.m. on the 19th?

570
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,840
You asked me this before.

571
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,800
Xiaozhou said

572
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,840
he met a hooligan driver.

573
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,720
What else?

574
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,640
You forgot?

575
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,200
Shen Xiaozhou

576
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,800
was going to Lvcheng

577
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,720
to see Hu Xiang Ze.

578
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:19,760
Yes.

579
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,400
But he asked where I was.

580
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,760
He asked where I was.

581
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,720
I said I was in Qingzhou

582
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,400
with him.

583
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,640
What else?

584
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,600
Nothing.

585
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,600
Didn't Shen Xiaozhou tell you

586
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,840
what he was going to do with Hu Xiang Ze?

587
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,000
No.

588
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,960
He said

589
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,000
his phone was running out of battery.

590
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,840
He was sick again.

591
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,960
Did he?

592
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,000
How did you know?

593
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,680
I just wonder

594
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:14,860
what a woman's

595
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,080
paste is.

596
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,280
You didn't tell me,

597
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,080
You have to go to Qingzhou.

598
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,480
You have to go now.

599
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,480
You can stay at the hotel.

600
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,880
Lianhua Hotel is the center.

601
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
Check the nearby hospitals.

602
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,280
Go to the obstetrics and gynecology department.

603
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,880
It's not necessary to go that far to get a checkup.

604
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,680
Do you think they went to do the miscarriage?

605
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,480
If so,

606
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,480
it will be a breakthrough under the moon and spring.

607
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,680
Didn't the client who received the checkup in Qingzhou say

608
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,080
that they were with them all day?

609
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,480
That client is a member of Jinghai Group.

610
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,280
You dare to make a false witness? I'll ask and understand.

611
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,480
You can't ask like that.

612
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,880
I understand. I'll learn from you.

613
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,280
I'm sorry.

614
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,280
You already thought that there was something wrong with Hu Xiangze.

615
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
If I didn't make a mistake,

616
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,280
you wouldn't have found out what happened after you checked him.

617
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,080
I blame you.

618
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,880
Now think about it.

619
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,680
When you were checking Hu Xiangze,

620
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,280
someone secretly reported that I took black money.

621
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,080
It was them who kept making mistakes.

622
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,880
Before Hu Xiangze,

623
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,880
Hu Xiangze was lying.

624
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,280
You said that Hu Xiangze might have returned that day.

625
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,680
He also participated in Shen Xiaozhou's case.

626
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,480
I checked his car last time.

627
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,880
He left that day and returned the next day.

628
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,480
I didn't see him return.

629
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,880
If Hu Xiangze didn't want people to know that he returned,

630
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,080
he would have avoided the high speed.

631
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,280
I understand.

632
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,880
National road, dry road,

633
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,280
all roads.

634
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,080
I'll go check it now.

635
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,280
Let's go.

636
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,680
We still need people to support Shi Xiaofeng.

637
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
I'll go.

638
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,680
Shen Chen came back hundreds of kilometers.

639
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,480
He didn't even return the money.

640
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,680
Hai Bing, let's change the person.

641
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,080
I'm not sleepy.

642
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,480
I don't think Shi Xiaofeng can do it.

643
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,680
Once these things are checked,

644
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,680
the situation will be serious.

645
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,080
No one can change the situation.

646
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,680
We need to do it now.

647
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,880
We need to find the target.

648
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,480
Keep an eye on Li Luohao.

649
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,080
Don't let him escape.

650
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
I'll take someone to check.

651
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,680
Since you said that you were with Hu Xiangze on June 19,

652
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,480
then recall

653
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,480
what you did with the time and place of the unit.

654
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
If you want to be so detailed,

655
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
how can you remember it clearly?

656
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,680
You have to be clear. It's such a big case.

657
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,080
Turn on your phone.

658
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,680
Look at the call records and chat records from that day.

659
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,080
Recall it.

660
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,280
Once you recall it, sign a letter and sign a contract.

661
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,880
Does this case have anything to do with Mr. Hu?

662
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,480
It's just a love affair.

663
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,480
You still don't know anything, right?

664
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,280
Love affair? Who told you that?

665
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,280
I'm hurting you.

666
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
You think you're helping your friend to break up.

667
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,280
You're breaking the law without knowing it.

668
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,480
You're so lucky. Are you kidding?

669
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,480
I think I'm not that bad.

670
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,480
On June 19, Hu Xiangze only had lunch with them.

671
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,680
Then he said he had four things to do, for women.

672
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
He didn't see them again.

673
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,480
Very good.

674
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
I don't think it's that simple.

675
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,280
They dare to do fake evidence.

676
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,880
Does Hu Xiangze's words work?

677
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Could it be Li Ronghe's benefit?

678
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,680
But when I mentioned Li Ronghe,

679
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,080
he didn't say a word.

680
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,480
Do you want to think about him again?

681
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,880
No.

682
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,480
You did very well.

683
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,480
I'm very happy.

684
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,680
He's so happy.

685
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,280
He's so happy.

686
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,680
I'm so happy.

687
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,680
I'm so happy.

688
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,680
Shi Qiangfeng, I'm so happy to hear you praise him.

689
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,480
Did you find it?

690
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,080
No.

691
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,680
Li Ronghe and Hu Xiangze didn't call each other on June 19.

692
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,880
But they definitely had a spare number.

693
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,880
Mr. Hu, is there anything about the daily life?

694
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,880
I found it.

695
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,880
Mr. Hu registered at 11 a.m. on June 19.

696
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,880
He returned on June 20 at 8 a.m.

697
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
Just one person?

698
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
Yes, Mr. Hu is a VIP customer.

699
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,880
Do we have a map of the city?

700
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Yes.

701
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
Hey!

702
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
Not bad.

703
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,880
The company is sending you out so quickly.

704
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,880
You must be tired.

705
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
Go.

706
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,880
I'm not worried about the company.

707
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Report your plan.

708
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
Who invited you?

709
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
The company is sending you out so quickly.

710
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,880
You must be tired.

711
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,880
Go.

712
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,880
I'm not worried about the company.

713
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
Who invited you?

714
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
I'm not worried about the company.

715
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,880
Who invited you?

716
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,880
I'm not worried about the company.

717
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
Who invited you?

718
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,880
I'm not worried about the company.

719
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Who invited you?

720
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
I'm not worried about the company.

721
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Who invited you?

722
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
I'm not worried about the company.

723
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
Who invited you?

724
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Is there only one way out?

725
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,880
There is only one way.

726
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,880
The car can't get in.

727
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,880
It will be lost as soon as it enters.

728
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
Okay.

729
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
The car can't get in.

730
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,880
The car can't get in.

731
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
Hide well.

732
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Find an observation point.

733
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,880
Use people to block all possible escape routes.

734
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
Even if it's a machine,

735
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,880
we need to know.

736
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,880
This is all the information about the virtual reality in Shen Xiaozhou's USB.

737
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
It's all here.

738
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,880
Do you want to know why Shen Xiaozhou was thrown into the virtual reality?

739
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,880
This is designed by the South Li Gong University Environmental Department.

740
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,880
This is the study of Shen Xiaozhou's study.

741
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,880
Professor Xu.

742
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,880
Is he Shen Xiaozhou's mentor?

743
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,880
Wu Xiang Ze.

744
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
Here.

745
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,880
How about we go outside and check it out?

746
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,880
He can walk that far?

747
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
Have you talked enough?

748
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
Not enough.

749
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,880
Why do you think Wu Xiang Ze participated in the murder?

750
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,880
This kind of thing is more likely

751
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,880
Li Longhe sent his men to do it.

752
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,880
Shen Xiaozhou's autopsy report is more suitable for a single person.

753
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
Dr. Wang has anti-abortion injuries.

754
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,880
His hands and feet have been tied up.

755
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
Shen Xiaozhou doesn't have any.

756
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,880
Shen Xiaozhou only has scratches on his legs and heels.

757
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,880
This is caused by a soil drag.

758
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,880
And he didn't have any resistance injuries.

759
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
He was put in anesthesia beforehand.

760
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,880
It's more like a familiar case.

761
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,880
Li Longhe's men and Shen Xiaozhou may also know.

762
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,880
If Shen Xiaozhou was put in anesthesia in the farm,

763
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
what about the medicine that was put in?

764
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,880
The location of the autopsy report.

765
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Wu Xiang Ze is familiar with the water drainage system of the daily life.

766
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,880
Maybe he wanted to push Shen Xiaozhou into the sea.

767
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,880
Why did he chop off a foot of Shen Xiaozhou?

768
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,880
Do you think he can do it?

769
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,880
There is still no evidence that Wu Xiang Ze is at the scene.

770
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,880
Hai Ping, the lost leader has made a clear statement.

771
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,880
Once it is found, it will be severely punished.

772
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,880
No matter who it is, he will not let it go.

773
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,880
So Hai Ping, no matter what,

774
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,880
you must get the evidence that makes the opponent irresistible.

775
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,880
Captain Lian, someone is looking for you.

776
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,880
Who?

777
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,880
Didn't you say you didn't have to bring food?

778
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,880
I'm here to bring food.

779
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,880
I'm fine. I've been too busy these days.

780
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,880
I went to buy groceries and went home.

781
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
There was this note in the bag.

782
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,880
Dad, there was a car following me after school today.

783
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
It seems to be the car from last time.

784
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,880
I found out that it was still following me.

785
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,880
I'm fast, it's fast.

786
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
I'm slow, it's slow.

787
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,880
I'm going around, it's also following me.

788
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Did it hurt you?

789
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
No.

790
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,880
Who are they?

791
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,880
A suspect.

792
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,880
What case are you talking about?

793
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,880
Is it related to Yun Fan?

794
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,880
Someone came to get revenge on you?

795
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
No, where do you think you're going?

796
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Then why are you taking those photos?

797
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
I came to find time.

798
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
And two days ago,

799
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,880
those people did the car accident.

800
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,880
Is it true?

801
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,880
Find time.

802
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,880
I'll talk to you.

803
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,880
I can wait, but what about Xiao Shu?

804
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
Mom, be quiet.

805
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
I'm not afraid.

806
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
I'm afraid.

807
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,880
If it's about me, I won't come to you.

808
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,880
But Xiao Shu...

809
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,880
You should come.

810
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,880
Let me think.

811
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,880
I'll go buy some food.

812
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,880
Bring me a bowl of rice noodles.

813
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,880
What do you want to eat?

814
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,880
Buns.

815
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,880
Okay.

816
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Which hospital are you from?

817
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,880
Police?

818
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
Upstairs.

819
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,880
You're foreigners.

820
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,880
Just your English name.

821
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
We only receive VIP customers.

822
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,880
Now the new patient is called a client.

823
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,880
The client's information is basically confidential.

824
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
It can't be disclosed.

825
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,880
Doctor, we're investigating a secret case.

826
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,880
What is it?

827
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,880
This client did make an appointment

828
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,880
to stop the labor operation on June 19th.

829
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,880
It's a miscarriage.

830
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,880
The patient came, but he didn't do it.

831
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,880
Why?

832
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,880
I remember it clearly.

833
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,880
The woman regretted it.

834
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,880
They had a fight.

835
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,880
And then they left.

836
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,880
This is it.

837
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,880
Thank you.

838
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,880
You're welcome.

839
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,880
By the way,

840
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,880
did you find anything missing that day?

841
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,880
What?

842
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,880
The anesthetic.

843
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,880
Good.

844
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,880
You're very calm now.

845
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,880
You have a connection.

846
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,880
You're not modest.

847
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,880
I'm not.

848
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,880
You have to learn the advantages of being modest.

849
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,480
Your

850
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
We'll sleep in the team tonight.

851
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,880
The people are all out.

852
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
There's a bed.

853
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,880
What about tomorrow?

854
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,080
Can I stay here forever?

855
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,000
No need.

856
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,480
The case will be solved soon.
