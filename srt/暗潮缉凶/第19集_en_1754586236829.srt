1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,020
Five Great Industries

2
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,880
Get down, close the door

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,280
What should I do

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,600
Spare energy

5
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,760
there is no end to shift

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,880
it can't be worse

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,160
General

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,520
General

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You and me, the rest, let's go

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Come

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Come

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Come

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Come

14
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Come

15
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Xiao Zhong

16
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's calm down

17
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Good night

18
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We will definitely take care of it

19
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Enough

20
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Drink some water

21
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Drink some water

22
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Xiao Zhong

23
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry

24
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're not sorry for me

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Really

26
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry

27
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm sorry

28
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Xiao Zhong

29
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why did you put down his foot?

30
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The whole person can't do it in the sea

31
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't

32
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Bring that back to the water

33
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So I thought

34
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Disassemble

35
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Easy to deal with

36
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Are you pretending to be a police officer?

37
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You want to give the goods to Li Dada

38
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I know how Li Dada does it

39
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll definitely do it

40
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
How good a coincidence

41
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Right

42
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Li Dada's brain is already recognized

43
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Li Dada

44
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Li Dada

45
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Li Dada

46
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Li Dada has already accepted it.

47
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
I just wanted to be a fan.

48
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,360
I didn't expect that

49
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,280
it's easy to say this,

50
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
but hard to do.

51
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,880
I cut a foot.

52
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,280
I thought about the workload.

53
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
I gave up.

54
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Where did you get the electric saw?

55
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
Li Dada gave it to me.

56
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Once, we went to the market together

57
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
to buy a whole sheep.

58
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
I said it was very useful.

59
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
He gave it to me.

60
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
I put it in the trunk of the car.

61
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
It never used it.

62
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Did you like Sheng Xiaozhou?

63
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
She rejected you.

64
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
No.

65
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
I've seen her several times.

66
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
I can tell

67
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
she's not the kind of girl

68
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
that's easy to get.

69
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
Women spend more time

70
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
on me than on her.

71
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Then why are you so interested?

72
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
I don't know.

73
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
It's a question of memory.

74
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Or

75
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,280
hate.

76
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,280
I just hated her.

77
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
She ruined my big deal.

78
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,280
So I wanted to break her.

79
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
I really couldn't do anything.

80
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
I thought of the market.

81
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,280
I thought of the seaport.

82
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,280
But I failed.

83
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
You found me.

84
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
When the case came out,

85
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Li Zhonghe scolded me.

86
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,280
He said I didn't want you to kill her.

87
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
He was so angry.

88
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
But how could I understand

89
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
what he said?

90
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Xiaozhou

91
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
is too naive.

92
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
She still talked to Li Zhonghe.

93
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,280
What's there to talk about?

94
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,280
She overestimated the bottom line.

95
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
I saw the second before

96
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
she fainted.

97
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
She didn't expect

98
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
she would die today.

99
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
I didn't know

100
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
she would die today.

101
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
They are all playing with life.

102
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,280
We are too.

103
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,280
We should be proud of ourselves.

104
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
And this career

105
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,280
is worth our life.

106
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Not necessarily.

107
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
She is braver than you think.

108
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
Bravery?

109
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
What's the use of bravery?

110
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
She thinks she can rely on her own strength

111
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
to move such a big group.

112
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Can she change this world?

113
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
She moved.

114
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
She changed the world, didn't she?

115
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,280
You are a senior intellectual.

116
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
How could you be like this?

117
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
When I was in school,

118
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
and when I just started my company,

119
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
I was quite simple.

120
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
I had

121
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
the so-called dream.

122
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Later,

123
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
I got more and more people.

124
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
The benefits of my hands were getting bigger.

125
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
I had wealth.

126
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
I could do anything.

127
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
I could get anything.

128
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
Before I got into the business,

129
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,280
I felt like a pawn.

130
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
I could replace anyone.

131
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
What if

132
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
I was kicked into the sand?

133
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
I would stay in that dark,

134
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
dark and dirty place for a lifetime.

135
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,280
So I had to be a mountain.

136
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
The wind blew,

137
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
and the wind blew.

138
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
Go back.

139
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Give it to me.

140
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
It's done.

141
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
I almost got it.

142
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
I got Li Dong He.

143
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
Did he do it?

144
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Did he do it?

145
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
You might see him soon.

146
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
Police, don't move.

147
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
The guy in there, he threw it away.

148
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Get up slowly.

149
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
What's wrong with your head?

150
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
What if it falls?

151
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
The quality of the engineering of Jinghai Group

152
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
is not bad.

153
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
It's so thin.

154
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Yeah.

155
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
If it were steel, it would have run away.

156
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Captain, hello.

157
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
We met before.

158
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Excuse me.

159
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
As far as I know,

160
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,280
your uncle works in a decoration company.

161
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
In the past two years,

162
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Linchuan's real estate has developed rapidly.

163
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
His income is also good.

164
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
He raised a small family.

165
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
I've checked it.

166
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
What do you want to say?

167
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
I've never done any fake construction.

168
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
That's not what I meant.

169
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
I understand.

170
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
I understand you.

171
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
This is your job.

172
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,280
You are also carrying out orders.

173
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
But the Chinese have a saying.

174
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
The general...

175
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Enough.

176
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Come with us.

177
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
Okay.

178
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
I'll go with you.

179
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Hold it.

180
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Hurry.

181
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Hurry.

182
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Go.

183
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Hurry.

184
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Hold on.

185
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
Captain.

186
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
Hold on.

187
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
Get out.

188
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Go.

189
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
They will come back.

190
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Hurry.

191
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
Help.

192
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Help.

193
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
I admit.

194
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Wealth is just a magnet.

195
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
It can suck people all in.

196
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
It's like seawater.

197
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
The more you drink, the more thirsty you get.

198
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Actually,

199
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,280
I don't think it's the root cause of my thirst.

200
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
For me,

201
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
wealth is just a kind of proof.

202
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
It's a kind of game score.

203
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,280
It does give me a lot of happiness.

204
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,280
This happiness makes me feel so deep.

205
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
It satisfies my desire deep inside.

206
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
Once these desires are satisfied,

207
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
it will be like a film.

208
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
It will make you addicted.

209
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,280
You can't bear to lose it.

210
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
You lie to your conscience and say,

211
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
it's nothing.

212
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,280
But you look at yourself in the mirror.

213
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
You can't go back.

214
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
You can't go back.

215
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
I really don't know

216
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
how happy you are.

217
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Let me tell you about my happiness.

218
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Just a casual story.

219
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Once,

220
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,280
the three of us went to an ancient town for a trip.

221
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
My child was still very young.

222
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
He was in the first grade.

223
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,280
It was winter.

224
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
It was very late.

225
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,280
All the shops on the street were closed.

226
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
It was very cold.

227
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,280
We found a shop.

228
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
It was still open.

229
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:00,280
It was a sweet tea made with dried fruits and lotus root powder.

230
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,280
My wife likes sweet food.

231
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
The owner was an old man.

232
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
He made us a bowl of sweet tea.

233
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
The shop was very small.

234
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Just the three of us

235
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,280
sat under the light.

236
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
I watched them

237
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
eat one by one

238
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
and it was very hot.

239
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
I was not afraid of burning my mouth.

240
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
I was eating.

241
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
My wife asked me to eat.

242
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
I didn't eat.

243
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,280
I watched them

244
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
eat.

245
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
I was too sweet.

246
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
I couldn't eat.

247
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
I suddenly felt

248
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
that we had been walking

249
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,280
in this dark and cold night for a long time.

250
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
We will

251
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,280
meet under the warm light.

252
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
I know

253
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
that this is the person I love most.

254
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,280
They love me the most.

255
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Our life is ordinary.

256
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
But being with them

257
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
is the happiest time.

258
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
In my life,

259
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
there has never been anyone like this.

260
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
It's too boring.

261
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Take a break.

262
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Shen Xiaozhou

263
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,280
is too kind.

264
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
He doesn't know how bad the bad guys are.

265
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
If he had reported the evidence

266
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
in the morning, he wouldn't have died.

267
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
So good people are always

268
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
better than bad people.

269
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
Why is his mother

270
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
a giant?

271
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
We can't ask kind people

272
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
to abandon kindness.

273
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
We are police.

274
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
We are protecting

275
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
those kind,

276
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
innocent,

277
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
and weak people

278
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
from the pressure of the bad guys.

279
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
We are letting them

280
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
be a little scared

281
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
of hurting good people.

282
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
It's dark.

283
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
This is Shi Jiangfeng.

284
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Yunfan's child.

285
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Come on.

286
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Go.

287
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Captain Hong, thank you.

288
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Qiu Jue.

289
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Qiu Jue.

290
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Thank you all.

291
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Qiu Jue.

292
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
The mission is well done.

293
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Thank you.

294
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
Thank you.

295
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Thank you.

296
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Thank you.

297
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,800
Thank you

298
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
OK, OK, OK

299
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,080
The case is solved

300
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,760
They are caught

301
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,840
Yes, they are

302
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,200
The case is solved

303
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,480
They are caught

304
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,040
Xiao Zhao's case is solved

305
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
The case is solved

306
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,200
They are caught

307
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,960
Police, thank you

308
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,520
We believe you

309
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
Believe you

310
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,840
Thank you

311
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
Believe you

312
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,320
We must

313
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,160
Thank you

314
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,960
Come on, come on

315
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,560
Thank you

316
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,240
Thank you

317
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,800
No, no

318
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,320
Thank you

319
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,440
Thank you

320
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,280
Thank you

321
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,400
Thank you

322
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,920
The police Apostate

323
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,320
the police

324
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,280
Thanks, correct

325
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,040
Better

326
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,520
That, do do

327
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,400
I love you

328
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,440
Thank you

329
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,200
Yes

330
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,160
oral

331
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Thanks

332
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
I love you

333
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,120
OK

334
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,900
Good

335
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,560
We believe you

336
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,160
Thank you

337
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,360
Thank you

338
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,200
Come on

339
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,920
Thank you

340
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,600
no

341
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
to protect them.

342
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,320
If Hu Xiang Ze grew up in these good people's house,

343
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,520
would he not become like this today?

344
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
Get in the car.

345
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
Go to the front.

346
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
This is fresh.

347
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,120
It's fresh.

348
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,920
I'll take it.

349
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,040
This is fresh.

350
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,120
Two bowls of fish.

351
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,520
I'm not going out today.

352
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,440
Three pieces for ten yuan, right?

353
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,120
Three pieces for ten yuan.

354
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
Okay.

355
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Okay.

356
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,720
If you came earlier,

357
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,080
you should have taken care of him more.

358
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,480
Thank you.

359
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
You...

360
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
You...

361
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
You...

362
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Okay, no problem.

363
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,520
Thank you.

364
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,240
You got it.

365
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,240
Check his legs.

366
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Thank, thank you.

367
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
Sit tight.

368
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,280
Ding ding

369
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
Xiao Hai, let's go

370
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Ding ding

371
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Wait, my hair is messy

372
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,280
Ding ding

373
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Ding ding

374
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
Ding ding

375
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
Let's go

376
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Beijing

377
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Beijing Tian Anmen

378
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Tian Anmen

379
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,280
I didn't expect

380
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:59,220
my

381
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,280
I didn't expect

382
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,280
my

383
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,280
I didn't expect

00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,280
my

385
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,280
I didn't expect

386
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,280
My

387
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,280
My

388
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,280
My

389
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
My

My

00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,500
We 함께

395
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,740
get knowledge

396
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,900
is more important than working and hunger.

397
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,220
We get more reliable

398
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,940
as dad and I work

399
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,160
as hard as I can.

400
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,120
What did he say?

401
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,620
He said

402
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,260
we can't close the door

403
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,960
it must go and rush to DALI

404
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,660
to meet anyone

405
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,260
Yes

406
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,320
You can feel good now

407
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,980
I've also figured it out.

408
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,820
Rather than handing this job over to Wei,

409
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,220
it's better to hand it over to Ya first.

410
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,860
The case is settled,

411
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,900
I'll be leaving soon too.

412
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,540
Write a material for it.

413
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,260
As the successor,

414
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,740
you should recommend Lao Zhao.

415
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,580
As the captain,

416
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,140
he's more suitable than me.

417
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,940
My Ya is fine.

418
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,220
I can still

419
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,900
work hard for a few more years.

420
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,320
ede manifold

421
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,180
This is for you.

422
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,180
I took care of it.

423
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,180
Thank you.

424
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,180
Master.

425
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,180
Master.

426
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,180
Master.

427
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,140
The moon is the

428
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:32,180
moon is the

429
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,180
moon is the

430
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,180
moon is the

431
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,180
moon is the

432
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,180
moon is the

433
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,180
moon is the

434
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,180
moon is the

435
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,180
moon is the

436
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,180
moon is the

437
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,180
moon is the

438
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:04,180
moon is the

439
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:12,180
moon is the

440
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,180
moon is the

441
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,180
moon is the

442
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,180
moon is the

443
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,180
moon is the

444
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:25,180
Can blow away the misty clouds

445
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,180
Can there be a moonlit night

446
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:34,180
Can burn the lies from the past

447
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,180
If I can see through the darkness

448
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:43,180
The fate is still moving

449
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,180
If I can hear the heartbeat

450
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,180
I will be able to see the light of the future

451
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,180
I want to be the light

452
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:01,180
The light in my heart

453
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,180
I know I'm not lucky

454
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:10,180
But I always have a goal

455
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:22,180
I want to be the light
