1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,640
They are out of luck

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,520
You came back

3
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,600
What?

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,040
Who's house?

5
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,200
The house you want is yours.

6
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,920
I want it.

7
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,120
Of course I want it.

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
How much is it?

9
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,600
You don't have to worry about that.

10
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,040
But you can't keep this house.

11
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,000
You can sell it soon.

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,560
It's good that

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,320
you got back the money you lost.

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,320
Then sell it.

15
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,760
I don't want to damage the house.

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,760
I don't want to lose it.

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,080
Then I want to send you abroad.

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,640
Abroad?

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,000
Why do you want to go abroad?

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,560
Chen Xia can't find a job

21
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,120
in the meantime.

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,360
She doesn't want to work either.

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,160
So it's better to go abroad

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,920
to study.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Just the two of us?

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,960
If you don't go,

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,240
I can't bear it.

28
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,320
Go.

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,560
I'll finish handling the matters at hand.

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,520
I'll go after I finish.

31
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,840
debt

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,160
debt

33
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,320
debt

34
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,240
debt

35
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,680
debt

36
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,560
debt

37
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,920
When you meet Ouyang Xiaogger.

38
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,960
Can you let me ask?

39
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
You know him?

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
You are really...

41
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
You sell it?

42
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
You sell it?

43
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
I want to eat that.

44
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,480
We have finished the flowers we sent.

45
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
What are you doing?

46
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
Looking for Ou Xiaojie.

47
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Police.

48
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Right here?

49
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Yes.

50
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,520
It must be this big crab company.

51
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,920
KTV is also theirs.

52
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,120
And that Meiyi Medical Association.

53
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,920
There is also Ou Xiaojie's shares.

54
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,120
Zheng Wanrong is the anchor.

55
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,720
The water is not flowing, the people are sweet.

56
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
The people are not sweet.

57
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
The people are not sweet.

58
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
The people are not sweet.

59
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,880
The water is not flowing, the people are not sweet.

60
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,560
Then you say that the old sand that makes high-pressure bags

61
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,480
will also be with them?

62
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,880
You think, first put high-pressure bags on them to make them melt.

63
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,440
Then return the money as the anchor.

64
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,880
Self-producing, self-sale, a dragon.

65
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,600
This idea, the boss and others have already investigated.

66
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,160
But these people are very evil.

67
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,040
They don't even hide their heads.

68
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,760
Then we two are just waiting in the car.

69
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
Don't you go up and have a look?

70
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Ou Xiaojie's car.

71
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Please come in.

72
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Brother Hun.

73
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,800
Officer Shi.

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Welcome.

75
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,320
This is...

76
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
Captain Wu Wenchong.

77
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,320
Hello, leader.

78
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,480
You probably don't know.

79
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,520
Officer Shi and I have been old friends.

80
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,720
The war was over.

81
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,400
I'll help him with this.

82
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Come, please sit.

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Dan Yong.

84
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,000
I thought you came to see me.

85
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,120
It seems that you have a sense of achievement.

86
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
Yes.

87
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,040
Do you know Shen Xiaozhou?

88
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,480
You are still a temper.

89
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,280
You started chatting before the tea was served.

90
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
Drink tea.

91
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,680
I don't drink tea. Answer the question first.

92
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
You give me a shape.

93
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
I know.

94
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,400
Isn't this in my live broadcast room?

95
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,040
Live broadcast room? Where is it?

96
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,120
It's in the company.

97
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,600
There are more than 30 rooms.

98
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
This Li...

99
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,160
Shen Xiaozhou, right?

100
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
I don't know.

101
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
I don't know.

102
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
I don't know.

103
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
I don't know.

104
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
I don't know.

105
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
I don't know.

106
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,480
Shen Xiaozhou, right?

107
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
She is naturally beautiful.

108
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,360
She has a strong sense of scene.

109
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,000
Her personality is outstanding.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,800
At that time, I thought she had the potential of a big red son.

111
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,720
But it seems that she has only done it twice.

112
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,480
She said she wouldn't do anything.

113
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,080
She won't do it? Why?

114
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,280
The fans are too enthusiastic.

115
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,720
I can't help it if the college students are so proud.

116
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,600
This thing is easy to watch.

117
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,760
Not everyone can do it.

118
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Okay, I understand.

119
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
What's wrong?

120
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
What's wrong with her?

121
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,160
She was killed.

122
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,920
Such a big thing.

123
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,200
It seems that it's spread online.

124
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
You don't know?

125
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,600
You said that we, these gangsters,

126
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,520
work overtime every day.

127
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,360
We are busy with our heads.

128
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,280
These information that has nothing to do with us

129
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,760
doesn't produce a good effect.

130
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
It's a big thing.

131
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,280
It really has nothing to do with time.

132
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,840
You don't know this?

133
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,280
Then why did you find me?

134
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,560
How did Shen Xiaozhou

135
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,000
contact your company?

136
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,400
How did she work for you?

137
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,760
A friend introduced me.

138
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Who?

139
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,120
Her name is Zhang Haoyang.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,600
Zhang Haoyang is your friend?

141
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,120
She used to come to my KTV downstairs.

142
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
I know her.

143
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,800
It seems that we haven't seen her for a long time.

144
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,520
Then how do you

145
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
work as hosts?

146
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Can we see?

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Sure, sir.

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You can watch it.

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,320
It's absolutely legal and expensive.

150
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Are these all the hosts of the big crab house?

151
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Did you find out?

152
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,840
Why are they all the same?

153
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,440
They are all the same.

154
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,960
I really can't tell who is who.

155
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,040
Our company is the same as KTV downstairs.

156
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,960
But the decoration didn't cost that much.

157
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,960
Each room is different.

158
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Come, look.

159
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,720
Thank you for coming, little rocket.

160
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,440
Guys,

161
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,200
let's give the five thousandth host

162
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,360
a show of talent, okay?

163
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Please pay attention to the right corner of the live broadcast room.

164
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Okay.

165
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Give the five thousandth host a show of talent.

166
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Business is good.

167
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
Five hundred thousand.

168
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Leader,

169
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
you are wrong.

170
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Let's not talk about the big place.

171
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,960
It takes a lot of money to train a host.

172
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
How big is the competition now?

173
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
You have to rely on the devil to have strength.

174
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
You have fans,

175
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
you can spread the trend,

176
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
create a business,

177
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
and hold offline meetings.

178
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
It's all about money.

179
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Spread the trend.

180
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
You have to find a water army.

181
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,960
We have a host.

182
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Now, all industries

183
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
fight for the trend.

184
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
The trend is the cost.

185
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
And I have a rule.

186
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
The host can't open a beauty salon.

187
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
At most, open a beauty salon.

188
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
That kind of beauty salon is a trick of the devil.

189
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
We don't need it.

190
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
We don't rely on this.

191
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
We can't cheat the consumers, right?

192
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Come, let me show you this.

193
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Come.

194
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Thank you for the gift.

195
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
You can do the plastic surgery.

196
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
We don't rely on software to improve our beauty.

197
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
We can just use hardware.

198
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
How about I call them out

199
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
and ask them to sign up?

200
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
No need.

201
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Big brother.

202
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Yes.

203
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Kids,

204
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
it's time to go.

205
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Come back soon.

206
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
My sister also went to the bathroom.

207
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
What are you doing?

208
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
The bathroom is the same.

209
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
You are a dragon.

210
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Girls.

211
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
Today,

212
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
two officers came to the company to inspect.

213
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Let's cheer up.

214
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Show your strength.

215
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Sing a song for the leaders.

216
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
Love Peace, Rejoice, Win, OK?

217
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
OK.

218
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Stop singing.

219
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Let them go back.

220
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Or

221
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
let's listen to it.

222
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Thank you for the opportunity.

223
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Are you ready?

224
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Yes.

225
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Ready.

226
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
Go.

227
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Be neat.

228
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Listen.

229
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
If you laugh,

230
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
they will be good at singing.

231
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
They can't sing together.

232
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
OK.

233
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Thank you.

234
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
OK.

235
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Stop.

236
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
They are back.

237
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
They are back.

238
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
They really went to the bathroom.

239
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,960
It's not that big.

240
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
What's going on?

241
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
What's going on?

242
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Why did they come here?

243
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
You know my history.

244
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
When I was a police officer,

245
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
I was a man who was always a man.

246
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
I don't know.

247
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
When I was a police officer,

248
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
you were a murderer.

249
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
I was a police officer.

250
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Police officers always look at the murderer.

251
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Maybe they are afraid that

252
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
others will know their own history.

253
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
History doesn't matter.

254
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
History matters the person

255
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
who turned you into.

256
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Do you know this person?

257
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
It's a little like him.

258
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
But not so much.

259
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Look at his chin.

260
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
His whole face.

261
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
That's right.

262
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
He didn't look like this before.

263
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
His name is Eagle.

264
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
Eagle.

265
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Yes.

266
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
His real name is Xu Ying.

267
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Is Eagle better?

268
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Eagle liked you.

269
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
Yes.

270
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Invite him out tomorrow.

271
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
I don't like him.

272
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Besides, I'm now...

273
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
This is a reconnaissance mission.

274
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Gao Xiaojie

275
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,960
is very good at using water weapons.

276
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Yao Gongbo, the leader of the Wind and Clouds, said that

277
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,960
the water weapons that fired up

278
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Zhang Haoyang's hot iron

279
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
were not made by him.

280
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
I'm sorry.

282
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
I'm sorry.

283
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
I'm sorry.

287
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
I'm sorry.

290
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I'm sorry.

291
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm sorry.

292
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
I'm sorry.

293
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
I'm sorry.

294
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
I'm sorry.

295
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
I'm sorry.

296
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm sorry.

297
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I'm sorry.

298
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
I'm sorry.

299
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
I'm sorry.

301
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
I'm sorry.

302
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
I'm sorry.

304
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
I'm sorry.

306
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
I'm sorry.

308
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
I'm sorry.

309
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
I...

310
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
I made you short of time to work.

311
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
I'm sorry.

312
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
I'm sorry.

314
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm sorry.

315
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
I'm sorry.

316
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
I...

317
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
I'm sorry.

318
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
I'm sorry.

319
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
I'm sorry.

320
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
I'm sorry.

321
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
I'm sorry.

322
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
I...

323
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
I...

324
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
I...

325
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
I'm sorry.

326
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I'm sorry.

327
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
I'm sorry.

328
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
I'm sorry.

329
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
I'm sorry.

330
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
Sorry.

331
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
I'm sorry.

332
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
I'm sorry.

333
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Sorry.

334
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
I'm sorry.

335
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Don't cry.

336
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Sorry.

337
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
It seems that they found out.

338
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
I understand.

339
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
I will do as you say.

340
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,960
Hello?

341
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Hello, Hai Ping.

342
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Hello, Hai Ping.

343
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
I've asked about the child.

344
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
How is it?

345
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,960
The child was born in April 1992.

346
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,760
When he was born,

347
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,760
his mother sent him to the farmhouse to be raised.

348
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
When I was a child, I grew up in a farmhouse.

349
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,960
No one knew when I was born.

350
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,560
I heard I was born in April.

351
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
But when the child was ten years old,

352
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,960
he ran out of the foster home

353
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
and ran away from home.

354
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
I heard someone say that you have seen him.

355
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
What's his name?

356
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,360
I don't know.

357
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,960
His family name is Shi.

358
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
I don't know.

359
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
You really don't eat?

360
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,560
I don't eat.

361
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,360
You eat, I smell.

362
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,360
How is that girl now?

363
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,360
What girl?

364
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Stop talking nonsense.

365
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Hurry up.

366
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,160
She is also a police officer.

367
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,760
She won't mind you working overtime.

368
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
This kind of thing,

369
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
you should settle it early.

370
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,760
Do what you should do.

371
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
When did you become so talkative?

372
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,160
Why are you in a hurry?

373
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Do you want to have a grandchild?

374
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,160
Why am I in a hurry?

375
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,560
I'm not your father.

376
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
I mean,

377
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,560
you should hurry up and not delay it.

378
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,360
You are a grown-up.

379
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
Do you still remember

380
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Ao Xiaoxi?

381
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
I remember.

382
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
What happened to her?

383
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Nothing.

384
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,960
I met her recently.

385
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
Don't follow me.

386
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
Go back to your police college.

387
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,160
That victim is quite pitiful.

388
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
She looks

389
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,560
a bit like Shen Xiaozhou.

390
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,560
You've seen a lot of girls like her.

391
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
If you follow me again,

392
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
I'll jump off.

393
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Don't you understand?

394
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,760
I don't like you.

395
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,560
There's Tang Ge in school.

396
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
I don't like you.

397
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
I don't like you.

398
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
I don't like you.

399
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
I don't like you.

400
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
I don't like you.

401
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
I don't like you.

402
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
I don't like you.

403
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
I don't like you.

404
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,360
I don't like you.

405
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,560
There's a Tang Ge in school.

406
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,360
He's called a criminal and he's called Ren Xue.

407
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,960
That girl is called Ren Xue.

408
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,960
She has a child.

409
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
If you don't take responsibility,

410
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,160
you'll run away.

411
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,560
It's not suitable for you to be a police officer.

412
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
What do you mean?

413
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
You're not serious.

414
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
You're too innocent.

415
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
You're not self-respecting.

416
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
Do you never

417
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,360
like girls like her?

418
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Can you be a little bit human?

419
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,140
I think

420
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,260
that's an impossible question.

421
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,560
How should I respond to my parents' lives?

422
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,360
You're well fed.

423
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,560
Be considerate.

424
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,960
You should take the lessons alive.

425
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Good!

426
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
You're here!

427
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
Look how I beat him!

428
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,760
Sit, has been here!

429
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
Come.

430
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
I can't afford it.

431
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,680
Chief,

432
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,600
how's the talk with Jinhai Group?

433
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,280
When will the building be built?

434
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,480
Is there any plan?

435
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,160
Soon.

436
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,880
I haven't lived in the sea view house yet.

437
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,720
Actually, the sea view house

438
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
is not that good.

439
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,640
It's too damp.

440
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,520
Especially, there's an old man in the house.

441
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,280
He can't live there.

442
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,960
Who will live there?

443
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,440
If it's too bad, he'll sell it to someone else.

444
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,000
It's okay.

445
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,520
I'm not afraid of the sea view house.

446
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,960
The case hasn't been solved yet.

447
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,080
The police won't let us move.

448
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:46,040
Why did he die in our factory?

449
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,160
Well,

450
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,720
do you know what a anchor is?

451
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,880
A anchor?

452
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,320
Is it a company?

453
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,960
No.

454
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,120
Guys, look.

455
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,760
Look.

456
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,600
She's a good girl.

457
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,440
Why did Zhang Zijun ask her for a reward?

458
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,280
Right?

459
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,360
I think she's like a beggar.

460
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,240
Right? Look.

461
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,960
She's pretty.

462
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,920
I'd say she's not as pretty as a beggar.

463
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,720
A beggar should be a smiley face.

464
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,840
This is a twist and a cross.

465
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,240
Yes, a twist and a cross.

466
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,120
A twist and a cross.

467
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,680
Listen,

468
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,080
there's a kind of person

469
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,560
who likes to twist and cross.

470
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,520
He plays the piano and sings.

471
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,040
He's not like that.

472
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,440
Don't let your wife hear that.

473
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,640
When he was young,

474
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,760
he was in our factory.

475
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,200
What's wrong with that?

476
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,920
I'm not afraid of being famous.

477
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm telling the truth.

478
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,000
Yang,

479
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,040
you've been doing this for so many years.

480
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,600
Why are you still so stubborn?

481
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,720
What's the comparison?

482
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
Look at you.

483
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,120
You're so arrogant.

484
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,640
Look at you.

485
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,720
Don't look at his ass.

486
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,640
He's still oppressing you.

487
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,080
You're oppressing an old woman.

488
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,040
I know I'm not a fool.

489
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,480
I'm not a fool.

490
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:03,960
Come on.

491
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,320
You're exaggerating.

492
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,040
What are you talking about?

493
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,440
That's what I'm saying.

494
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
I'm sorry.

495
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,360
What are you doing?

496
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,120
You're not afraid of water.

497
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,560
Come on.

498
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,240
You...

499
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,960
Dad.

500
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
If you go in again,

501
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,760
you won't be able to get out.

502
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,760
Let's go home.

503
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,640
Why is your skin so big?

504
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,720
You're taking the medicine.

505
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,280
Mr. Zhou.

506
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,680
Mr. Zhou.

507
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,440
Don't be so hard on yourself.

508
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,480
I've always been like this.

509
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,280
Do you know that?

510
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,960
You shouldn't have said that.

511
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,480
You should have let me

512
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,560
go to the hospital.

513
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,720
Where did you go

514
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,600
that night?

515
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,440
You must have drunk too much.

516
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,800
Do you remember how you came back?

517
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,480
Let's go home.

518
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:26,160
Dad is still

519
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
Honestly, are you okay?

520
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,520
You...

521
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,160
A spell existence lemon.

522
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,920
Great.

523
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,440
You can eat this.

524
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,200
No, I won't.

525
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,680
Thanks.

526
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,400
you really did what you said back then.

527
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,900
stream.

528
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,560
Look surprised at how considerate he is

529
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,660
and how activist he even is.

530
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,020
Why don't you change something huh,

531
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,580
Is that not fair?

532
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,120
How many times now,

533
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,820
I can't pick in anything,

534
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,100
you do the picking?

535
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,500
Nah.

536
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,780
yield?

537
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,760
I haven't seen him for so many years.

538
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,560
I'm afraid he...

539
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
This is work.

540
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,960
No matter what he does,

541
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,040
you have to take it.

542
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,680
Is he close to Ao Xiaojie?

543
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,880
Yes.

544
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,120
He knew me earlier than I did.

545
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,760
Actually, the Ao I knew

546
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,480
wasn't called Ao.

547
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
He's a good man.

548
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,600
He helped me

549
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,000
when I was homeless.

550
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,040
Although he's not

551
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,600
the No. 3 son of a good boy,

552
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,880
he's a good student.

553
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,680
But I don't think

554
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,240
he's a good killer.

555
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,480
And Shen Xiaozhou became a anchor

556
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,400
a few months ago.

557
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,640
Do you know Ao Xiaojie?

558
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,480
Does he run a so-called cultural company?

559
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,920
Does he let a group of girls

560
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,760
sing for the police?

561
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,680
People change.

562
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,880
You're a police officer.

563
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
He let Huang Bin

564
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,680
delete Shen Xiaozhou's pictures.

565
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,560
There must be a reason.

566
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,000
At least,

567
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,880
he didn't want people to know

568
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,080
that Shen Xiaozhou was a anchor

569
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,160
at his place.

570
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm going now.

571
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,160
I don't know if your brain has changed.

572
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,600
Go ahead.

573
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,320
Go ahead.

574
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,200
Don't leave so soon.

575
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
Serves you right.

576
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,600
You didn't tell the truth.

577
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,080
Okay, go ahead.

578
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,480
Gao.

579
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,880
I have one more thing to tell you.

580
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,480
A good stealer

581
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,280
killed myahou.

582
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,640
A good day.

583
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,280
I won't hurt you anymore.

584
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,600
That's amazing!

585
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,880
I arrived at the wrong place.

586
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,880
Because I'm a good boy.

587
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,040
It seems that

588
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,520
I have another big con.

589
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,400
He was sent home with your family.

590
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,040
Mom.

591
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,720
I want to discuss something with you.

592
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,320
Can we not hold the wedding?

593
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,680
I want to postpone it for a while.

594
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,720
Postpone?

595
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,720
When do you want to postpone it?

596
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,320
I'll do it after the case with Xiaozhou is solved.

597
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,760
As long as you agree,

598
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
I'll talk to Tang Nian.

599
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,320
What are you talking about?

600
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,120
Postpone?

601
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,280
The wedding is in a few days.

602
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,640
The guests are here.

603
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,160
The wedding banquet is set.

604
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,600
Who are you going to beat?

605
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,840
Why are you drinking so much?

606
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,720
Go inside.

607
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,160
Go inside and lie down.

608
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,840
No, I'm right.

609
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,480
I'm telling you, you're the only one who's going to be beaten.

610
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,240
Xiao Tao.

611
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,680
I know you're embarrassed.

612
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,440
But look.

613
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,440
Our family is ready.

614
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,120
The money has been spent.

615
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,600
It can't be changed.

616
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,040
Xiaozhou

617
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,800
will understand.

618
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,360
I'll wait for the bridegroom.

619
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,400
What's the matter?

620
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,960
Will you go to the wedding banquet specifically?

621
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,200
What do we have to show him?

622
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,280
You don't have to report to me.

623
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,960
If daydreaming can't be laid on the bed,

624
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,640
let him stay for one week.

625
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,440
But he said

626
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,440
Hello?

627
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,340
Wang,

628
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,760
oh,

629
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,580
Y Netflix appeared.

630
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,000
That's it.

631
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:40,220
Didn't you see mevisagecomjacESELY

632
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,540
Not aaledcPCSI

633
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,000
Let me go.

634
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,840
You're not going to run.

635
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
I'm not going to run.

636
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,040
I'm not going to run.

637
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,960
Hurry up.

638
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,440
I broke it.

639
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,040
I'm not going to run.

640
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,920
Shi Changguo.

641
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,280
You're not going to play here?

642
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,120
Come on.

643
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,640
You're still going to play?

644
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,680
Yea.

645
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,040
Zheng Zhe?

646
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Ahead.

647
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,720
You two.

648
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,080
And make that twoанный hit at the back.

649
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,000
I think I know how.

650
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
That's good. Right here.

651
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,120
Lin Yitong.

652
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,640
Help me sing this part.

653
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,680
You used to dislike me for being a man.

654
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Aren't you a woman now?

655
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,840
I'm a very strong woman.

656
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,560
Have you forgotten all about me?

657
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,680
Xu Ying.

658
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,080
How could I forget?

659
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,760
You keep thoseae so very carefully.

660
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,040
OK.

661
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,600
Xu Ying.

662
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,440
Check it carefully.

663
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
Come on.

664
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,520
This is the spy across from the Baoyang Building.

665
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,600
They transferred the surveillance video of the night on June 19

666
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,880
to us.

667
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,520
Baoyang Building?

668
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,360
You and Zhao Gang hit a car.

669
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,040
He also wants this surveillance video.

670
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,720
Okay, Hai Tian.

671
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,120
Sit down.

672
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,720
Qiu Ji is right.

673
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,280
The two of you are in a cross-referential situation.

674
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,840
Zhao, tell us more about the situation.

675
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,960
Okay, I'll say it again.

676
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,960
Through the investigation, we found that Wang Yishan

677
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,840
and Jia Beibei

678
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,360
had taken the high-level bandage

679
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,800
from Old Sha and Sha Hongli before they were killed.

680
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,280
This Sha Hongli has disappeared.

681
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,480
Various signs show that

682
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,360
he may have been killed.

683
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,560
Let's go back to Wang Yishan and Jia Beibei.

684
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,800
We found that the purpose of their bond

685
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,320
was to be the anchor for the surgery.

686
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,440
The doctor who had done the dental surgery

687
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,880
and consulted Jia Beibei told me

688
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,760
that Jia Beibei wanted to get the dental surgery

689
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
to be the network anchor.

690
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,440
Then we further visited

691
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,240
Wang Yishan's social relations.

692
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,520
Now we can confirm that

693
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,080
Wang Yishan's purpose for the surgery

694
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,680
was also to be the anchor.

695
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,080
So we conducted an investigation

696
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,600
on the relevant industries in the city.

697
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,480
We found that

698
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,560
a media company called Dao Culture

699
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,680
is the most suspected.

700
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,120
The real person in charge is

701
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,560
Ao Xiaojie.

702
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,760
The address is in Baoyang Building.

703
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,160
What's strange is

704
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,000
that the hospital where Wang Yishan had done the dental surgery

705
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,560
was also in Baoyang Building.

706
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,360
And there is also a Dao KTV in Baoyang Building.

707
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,880
It's also Ao Xiaojie's.

708
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,440
Jia Beibei and Wang Yishan

709
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,520
are the guests of this KTV.

710
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,440
This Mei Yixin is not simple.

711
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,440
It has close relations with this Dao company.

712
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
So we can infer that

713
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
Gao Lidai

714
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,040
went to the dental surgery

715
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,840
to be the network anchor.

716
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,320
It formed a close relationship.

717
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,240
Every anchor of Dao company

718
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,840
is the place that Ao Xiaojie personally selected.

719
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,640
It's very likely that it's in KTV.

720
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,720
So the next investigation target of our group

721
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,400
is the boss of this Dao company,

722
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,520
Ao Xiaojie.

723
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,000
Boss, you made it very clear.

724
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,400
This logic chain is currently established.

725
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,320
You suspect that

726
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,120
Ao Xiaojie is using it as a anchor

727
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,400
to trick them and kill them.

728
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,720
Yes.

729
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,200
We have already implemented 24 hours of surveillance

730
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,920
on Ao Xiaojie.

731
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
We will continue to collect evidence.

732
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,800
Brother Lian,

733
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,120
how did Shen Xiaozhou

734
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,520
find out about the Baoyang Building?

735
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,720
Shen Xiaozhou has also worked as a anchor

736
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,920
in Ao Xiaojie's company.

737
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,120
He did it twice a few months ago.

738
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,320
Later, he quit.

739
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,720
But I always

740
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,920
feel that there is something

741
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,320
that doesn't match the logic.

742
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,720
Shen Xiaozhou and Ao Xiaojie's connection

743
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,520
was a few months ago.

744
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,320
Moreover,

745
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,920
Shen Xiaozhou and Jia Beibei's

746
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,920
victim date is too close.

747
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
So...

748
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Although our current

749
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,320
direction of the investigation has been interlocked,

750
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,720
I still feel

751
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,320
that there are more doubts.

752
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,720
No matter what,

753
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,920
we must keep an eye on Ao Xiaojie

754
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,120
and do our best to investigate.

755
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,520
By the way,

756
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,120
we have already seen Ao Xiaojie.

757
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,320
Sorry.

758
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,320
I know that you just found him.

759
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,920
Brother Lian,

760
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,120
how do you feel about this person?

761
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,720
Smart.

762
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
Good at faking.

763
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,520
He must have something to do with Shen Xiaozhou's case.

764
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,520
Shi Qiangfeng has already

765
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,920
gone to the management to investigate him

766
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,120
through a live broadcast.

767
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,920
Shi Qiangfeng?

768
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,120
Why did you let him go?

769
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,720
Shi Qiangfeng and Ao Xiaojie have known each other for many years.

770
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,120
He wouldn't take the risk, right?

771
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,920
I am willing to believe him.

772
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,120
Do you want to try? I'll treat you.

773
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,120
I want to drink.

774
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,720
Aren't you going to work tonight?

775
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,320
Yes. I can't drink at work.

776
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,920
I'll only show them when I drink.

777
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,320
Then, let's go to the bar.

778
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,920
The bar is already watered.

779
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,520
Wait. I'll go home and get some water.

780
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
What are you doing?

781
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,320
Are you afraid that I'll eat you?

782
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,320
Let's go.

783
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,520
Whatever.

784
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,720
Did you rent this place or buy it?

785
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,120
I bought it.

786
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,120
Is it so important to be a live broadcast host?

787
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,920
I am one of my own, okay?

788
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,320
I've been with him for so many years.

789
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,120
Those newbies are still renting.

790
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,120
You're so strong when you're drunk.

791
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,920
Can we drink beer first?

792
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,520
Can you sit down?

793
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,320
I'll stand here.

794
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,720
Sit down.

795
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,720
Do you have a girlfriend?

796
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
No.

797
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
Then, you saw me last night?

798
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,320
Yes.

799
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
I didn't see you.

800
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,720
You saw me?

801
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,020
Yu Guang saw you.

802
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
How did you get my number?

803
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,320
I'm a police officer. It's easy.

804
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,920
Don't drink anymore. Don't you still have to go to work?

805
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,320
I won't go. I'm still not the only one.

806
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,120
How much will you earn if you don't go tonight?

807
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,520
How much will you earn if you don't go tonight?

808
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,720
How much will you earn as a live broadcast host?

809
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,320
Are the newbies the same as you?

810
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,920
They're different.

811
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
Then, they're all doing the same job.

812
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,520
Will there be any differences?

813
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,320
Let's not talk about these things.

814
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
You came to see me.

815
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,520
Are you here to exchange your old time with mine?

816
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,120
Let's not talk about it.

817
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Liar.

818
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
You have a girlfriend.

819
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,320
You hesitated for a second.

820
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,320
If you can hesitate,

821
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,520
you must be the one you really like.

822
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,720
Don't think I don't know anything.

823
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,720
You used to treat me like a friend.

824
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,320
What kind of person do you like?

825
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,320
How can I not know?

826
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,720
You came to see me

827
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,320
to ask me about something, right?

828
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,920
Do you know?

829
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,520
When I was lying on the operating table in the hospital,

830
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,320
the first person I thought of was you.

831
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,720
I want you to see how I am now.

832
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,320
Actually, I don't care about that.

833
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,320
Later, I also asked around about you.

834
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,320
I knew that you went to the police academy and became a police officer.

835
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,320
I knew that

836
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,720
the path we took was getting worse.

837
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,920
We couldn't go to the top.

838
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
No.

839
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,320
I don't want to be a anchor.

840
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,720
I always use my phone to give out rewards to those big brothers.

841
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,320
Is that still me?

842
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
But do you know?

843
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
There was a fool

844
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,320
who wasted 30,000 yuan

845
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,320
just to eat with me.

846
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,320
He drank 30,000 yuan.

847
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Not only that fool.

848
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Forget about the money from the big brother.

849
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,120
Last year, a child was over 10 years old.

850
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,920
He gave away more than 20 million yuan to his grandmother.

851
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,920
Then his parents went to the police station.

852
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,920
I don't know how much he asked for.

853
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,920
So after the live broadcast, I didn't say a word.

854
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,520
I only danced.

855
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,720
I didn't say a word.

856
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,720
Thank you, big brother.

857
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,120
Can you give me a villa?

858
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,920
What's the difference between a car and a car?

859
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:21,320
You 100%tech wait for someone.

860
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,320
Amazing.

861
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,920
So what?

862
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,920
Compared to them,

863
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,920
I'm not qualified to work in the company.

864
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,920
If you don't want to work, then don't.

865
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,920
But what can I do?

866
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,920
I don't know anything.

867
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Hey.

868
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,920
How about I go to the exam too?

869
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,920
I know that Miss Ah-Zhai is not good to those girls.

870
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,920
Sometimes I feel sorry for them.

871
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,920
What's wrong?

872
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,920
But Miss Ah-Zhai didn't do anything wrong to me.

873
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,920
I can't say anything to her.

874
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,920
You can ask a girl named Xiao-Nan.

875
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,920
She just got hurt.

876
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Xiao-Nan can't leave either.

877
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,920
It's up to you to ask her.

878
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,920
You can go.

879
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,920
I'm going to sleep.

880
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,920
Are you okay?

881
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,920
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

882
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,920
I'm happy today.

883
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,920
I'm fine.

884
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
On the afternoon of June 19,

885
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,920
Ah-Zhai's car left the building at 5.30.

886
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,920
It seems that it's not one person.

887
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Yes, two people.

888
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,920
And a very strong buddy.

889
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
They were together all the time.

890
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,920
Jia Bei Bei was killed that day.

891
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,920
Ah-Zhai's car left the company before 6.

892
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,920
Wang Yishan's case...

893
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,920
It's too early.

894
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,920
Our video can't be kept for so long.

895
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,920
So when Shen Xiaozhou and Jia Bei Bei were killed,

896
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,920
she wasn't in the company.

897
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,920
Yes. But this doesn't mean anything.

898
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,920
I've been checking the surveillance camera for three months.

899
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,920
Every week, one to two days or two to three days,

900
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,920
she would leave with this big brother in advance.

901
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,920
This is not a strong evidence, right?

902
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,920
The girl I met yesterday,

903
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,920
although it was for the investigation,

904
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,920
but there is a situation I still need to tell you.

905
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,920
She liked me before.

906
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,920
No, she doesn't like me now.

907
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,920
She likes me now.

908
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,920
Do you like her?

909
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,920
There's someone. I can't pretend to be someone else.

910
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,920
Then why did you report to me?

911
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,920
Did something happen to you yesterday?

912
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
It's just that...

913
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,920
The clothes are not covered, there were several times

914
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,920
I had to check the camera. I can't avoid it.

915
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,920
Do you want to be punished?

916
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,920
Am I that petty?

917
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,920
You're the most petty.

918
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,920
You even want to see another girl.

919
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,920
She told me.

920
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,920
It's Zhou Xiao Nan, right?

921
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,920
I'll go with you.

922
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,920
You'll go with me?

923
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,920
You don't trust me?

924
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,920
I'm thinking that a girl

925
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,920
can't talk to a man like you.

926
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,920
I'll be easier to talk to.

927
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,920
I haven't figured out how to ask her out.

928
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,920
I can't let Miss Ou know

929
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,920
and I can't tell her in advance. I'm afraid she won't dare to come.

930
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,920
I've already thought about it.

931
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,920
Thank you for supporting the work.

932
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,920
I'll go with you.

933
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,920
It's been 6 hours.

934
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,920
Are youanan speak?

935
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,920
He's with someone.

936
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,920
Justin.

937
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,920
My brother ironed oneising today,

938
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,920
as if we were getting together to eat.

939
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,920
That's right.

940
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,920
