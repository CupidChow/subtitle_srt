1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
Special White House

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,400
Would you like to look for happiness from now on?

3
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,720
It's akerala.

4
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,920
One more is.

5
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Open it.

6
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,360
1 Hours aiming with the speed of light

7
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,620
Two people guard and the others go home

8
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,140
Man

9
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,980
This person is familiar

10
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,020
I...

11
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,740
I... that guy...

12
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,820
Why did he become a cop?

13
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,420
Who is he?

14
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,980
Lian Haiping.

15
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,180
He's a great character.

16
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,180
No one knows him.

17
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,300
He's the one who killed Old Yu.

18
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,620
It's hard to deal with him.

19
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,620
If it's hard to deal with him,

20
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,620
then find a way to deal with him.

21
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,860
I got you a drink.

22
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,500
This time he marine style.

23
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,900
I got you a drink.

24
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,280
Chew it up so it doesn't acoustic.

25
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,500
I found it.

26
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,780
It's this carouselã€‚

27
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,300
It left the city in the morning yesterday.

28
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,820
I'm back at my hometown.

29
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,500
Qingzhou is the black county

30
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,540
of Wuyang Village.

31
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,180
I'll take someone there now.

32
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,060
Black county?

33
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,180
Zhao called just now.

34
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,540
They're working there.

35
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,660
He's still in Qingzhou.

36
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,540
Isn't Zhao's hometown

37
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,500
the black county of Zhao Village?

38
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,740
I'll ask him to go back to see his parents.

39
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,900
He'll come back tomorrow morning.

40
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,060
Wuyang Village.

41
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,860
Ask him to go.

42
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,340
It's not convenient for him to do that.

43
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,300
It's okay.

44
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,260
Lin is there.

45
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,260
Okay.

46
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,300
Are you going?

47
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,420
No need.

48
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,380
Chief Zhao and his friends are in the black county.

49
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,620
Let's check the situation first.

50
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,940
Let's take a rest today.

51
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,980
Go back and take care of yourself.

52
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,900
Did you write the summary report today?

53
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,420
I've already handed it over.

54
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:31,820
Okay.

55
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,980
I can see

56
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,140
three wrong words.

57
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,780
Come on.

58
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,100
Dad.

59
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,620
You...

60
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,980
Hello.

61
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,700
I got it.

62
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,380
No need.

63
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,540
Just take it now.

64
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,500
Really?

65
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,700
It's okay.

66
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Because it's mix food.

67
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,100
I know.

68
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,340
Just eat what I cook.

69
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,580
Keep your appetite high.

70
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,540
You're born young.

71
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,060
Mom.

72
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,860
Next,

73
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,580
This is the female student from game studio,

74
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,060
An Qingcomming.

75
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,860
It's so long.

76
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,980
See you tomorrow.

77
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,980
Brother Feng.

78
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,580
I'm not mistaken. It's you, right?

79
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,980
I'm Ba Chuan.

80
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,980
Ba Chuan?

81
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,980
Wang Ba Chuan.

82
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,780
Brother Feng still remembers me.

83
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,980
It's my honor.

84
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,980
Come on.

85
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,780
The legendary brother Feng, Tie Lu Xin.

86
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,780
Stop.

87
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,980
What are you doing now?

88
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,180
Delivery.

89
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,380
We are all delivery men.

90
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,180
Okay.

91
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,780
Just a serious job.

92
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,180
Brother Feng.

93
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
Can you have a meal with us?

94
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,980
We'll treat you.

95
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,580
Lu Chuan.

96
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,180
Yeah, yeah.

97
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,980
Lu Chuan.

98
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,980
Forget it.

99
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,780
I heard that Brother Feng is a member of the Gong family.

100
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,180
It's embarrassing to be a couple with us.

101
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,980
I'll treat you.

102
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,980
The subscriber you dialed is not available for the moment.

103
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,980
Please redial later.

104
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:14,980
You.

105
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,980
You're the only one.

106
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,980
Okay.

107
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,380
Come on.

108
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,980
Come on.

109
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
Brother Feng.

110
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,980
You're the only one.

111
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,980
Come on.

112
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,980
Come on.

113
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,980
Come on.

114
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,980
Come on.

115
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,980
Come on.

116
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,980
Is the driver reliable?

117
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,980
Lian Haiping is unreliable.

118
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,980
If he's really a driver,

119
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,980
where will we put our face in the next three months?

120
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
Don't be so petty.

121
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,980
The case is more important than face.

122
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,980
The case is more important than face.

123
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,980
Come on.

124
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
Captain Zhao.

125
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,980
The village is a sea of goods.

126
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,980
It's going to be spoiled.

127
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,980
We're all rich and poor.

128
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,980
Today, the whole family is out of work.

129
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,980
They don't do anything.

130
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,980
They ask for money and cars every day.

131
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,980
They say that no car can make people look down on them.

132
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
They can't find a wife.

133
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,980
That's why they're all rascals.

134
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,980
The village head is a rascal.

135
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,980
He broke the legs of the village head.

136
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,980
He really bought a car for him with the compensation.

137
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,980
You're so stupid.

138
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,980
You can't even tell if he's a good person.

139
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,980
He hasn't been home for half a year.

140
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,980
What's wrong with him?

141
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
You didn't see the car.

142
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,980
Did he come back?

143
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,980
No.

144
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
He's the one who's paying attention.

145
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,980
We know he's back.

146
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,980
He only has one house.

147
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,980
That's right.

148
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,980
Hello.

149
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,980
Are you sure you didn't go back?

150
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,980
Okay.

151
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,980
Then you can keep an eye on it.

152
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,980
I went to see a house today.

153
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,980
Jinhai No. 1.

154
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,980
Sister Guo took me to see that view.

155
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,980
But that sea view is really beautiful.

156
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,980
I thought if only we could live there.

157
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,980
There's a 120-square-meter three-room apartment.

158
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,980
It's all south.

159
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,980
Sister Guo said it's especially suitable for us.

160
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,980
So Xiaoshu can have a bigger room.

161
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
You can have a separate study.

162
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,980
I was just thinking.

163
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,980
We just paid a first-aid fee.

164
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,980
We have to use the money Xiaoshu spent on college.

165
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
Buy it.

166
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,980
I don't plan to go to college.

167
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,980
It's no use going to college.

168
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,980
The college's salary is so low.

169
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,980
I can't even get a return on investment.

170
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,980
I don't have to go to college to make money.

171
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,980
But I know you want me to go to police officer college.

172
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,980
I won't go.

173
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
It's no use forcing me.

174
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,980
It's better to save four years.

175
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,980
Start making money early.

176
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,980
I don't want to live a life like yours.

177
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
Where did you learn these ideas?

178
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,980
Who taught him?

179
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,980
What kind of values are these?

180
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,980
You're not at home all day.

181
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,980
Don't worry about me.

182
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,980
I'm responsible for my values.

183
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,980
Do I work for myself every day?

184
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,980
I don't know.

185
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,980
It's not for me anyway.

186
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,980
I don't need the police to save me.

187
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,980
Stop arguing.

188
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,980
I didn't see you angry at an outsider.

189
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,980
How come you've changed after you got home?

190
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,980
Taoer,

191
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,980
you can sleep.

192
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,980
I'll check.

193
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,980
I'm not sleepy.

194
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,980
Take a rest.

195
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,980
You haven't slept all night.

196
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,980
I'm just a simple man.

197
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,260
I've been watching him all night.

198
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,900
Someone saw his car.

199
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,980
A red car?

200
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,100
Yes, a red one.

201
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,780
There's only one red car in our village.

202
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,780
Where is it?

203
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,500
Yes, that's the one.

204
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,980
Stop!

205
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,420
What if he wakes up?

206
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,420
Where are you going?

207
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,140
He can't get out of the house.

208
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,820
If he runs away, I'll beat you up.

209
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,860
Be careful.

210
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Let's go.

211
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Hurry up.

212
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Go.

213
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,980
Stop!

214
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,980
Stop!

215
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
Stop!

216
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,980
Wake up!

217
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,980
Get off the car.

218
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,980
Police.

219
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,980
Hurry up!

220
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,980
What are you doing?

221
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,980
What are you doing?

222
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,980
What's your name?

223
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,980
Wu Bo'er.

224
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,980
Are you Wu Bo'er?

225
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,980
Shut up!

226
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,980
Why are you calling me?

227
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,980
He's not Wu Bo'er.

228
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,980
He's not.

229
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,980
He's not.

230
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,980
He's not.

231
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
He's not.

232
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Where did you get this?

233
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
Change it.

234
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,980
Call again.

235
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,380
Wu Bo'er is not on the city.

236
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,180
He's at his fellow man's house.

237
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,340
He drove home.

238
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,980
Hit his fellow man.

239
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,940
Xia Di.

240
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,540
tai Chi.

241
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,620
Ten

242
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,260
Nin.

243
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,740
Eight.

244
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,100
Seven.

245
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,300
Six.

246
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,460
How did he know?

247
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,560
Didn't touch him.

248
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:17,520
Went to buy the smoke

249
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
This is been vinaged all day

250
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,200
I get it

251
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Another escape

252
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,780
Zheng, the suspect is temporarily out.

253
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,180
He might be back anytime.

254
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,980
You guys hide well and be careful not to be seen.

255
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,780
Roger.

256
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,380
I'll go first.

257
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,780
The suspect is out.

258
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,780
He might be back anytime.

259
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,780
You guys hide well and be careful not to be seen.

260
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,780
You guys hide well and be careful not to be seen.

261
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,780
You guys hide well and be careful not to be seen.

262
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,780
You guys hide well and be careful not to be seen.

263
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,780
You guys hide well and be careful not to be seen.

264
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,780
You guys hide well and be careful not to be seen.

265
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,780
You guys hide well and be careful not to be seen.

266
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,780
You guys hide well and be careful not to be seen.

267
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,780
You guys hide well and be careful not to be seen.

268
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,780
You guys hide well and be careful not to be seen.

269
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,780
You guys hide well and be careful not to be seen.

270
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,780
You guys hide well and be careful not to be seen.

271
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,080
Me stop you.

272
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,580
íš¨

273
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,580
highlighted

274
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,580
Um

275
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,580
geen

276
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,580
Should be

277
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,580
no

278
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,580
It's staring at me

279
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,580
Hup

280
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,580
Can't decrease

281
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,600
The

282
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Focus

283
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,660
Noted!

284
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,420
Bastard!

285
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,120
Bad punishments!

286
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,760
It's a Ð·Ð°kra!

287
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,320
I'll teach you a lesson.

288
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,900
Darn it.

289
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,300
Hold it!

290
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Let's go.

291
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
You're not running?

292
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Don't hit me.

293
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,440
I can kill you with a car.

294
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,440
It's useless to hit me.

295
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,200
Don't move.

296
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
You hit him.

297
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,160
I didn't touch him at all.

298
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,760
The police should follow the rules of the case.

299
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,480
I didn't hit him.

300
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,520
He was lying on the ground when I ran over.

301
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,720
I didn't even turn on the surveillance.

302
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,600
Did you drink last night?

303
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,440
You...

304
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,000
You saw it. How did you know?

305
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You're a police.

306
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,640
You'll be reported for drinking after work.

307
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
I didn't drink.

308
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Go back first.

309
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
Wait for my notice.

310
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
Are you okay?

311
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,680
Captain Lian.

312
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Call an ambulance.

313
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,920
This is a false accusation.

314
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
I have a 25-year police guarantee.

315
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,480
There's no problem with Hai Ping.

316
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,880
I also believe that he was accused.

317
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
I can't take the place of them.

318
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,880
I'm not going to let them take the place.

319
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
I'm not going to let them take the place.

320
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
I have a 30-year police guarantee.

321
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,920
There's no problem with Lian Hai Ping.

322
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
He's not afraid of being caught.

323
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,520
I believe that Lian Hai Ping can be investigated.

324
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
I'm afraid of delaying his case.

325
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,120
This...

326
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Lao Fang.

327
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Lao Fang.

328
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,920
Do you think Lian Hai Ping can take the place?

329
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
It's hard to take the place.

330
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,920
The more he's a person who doesn't dig,

331
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
the more he's a person who's been dumped.

332
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
The more he's a person who's been dumped,

333
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
the more he's a person who's been dumped.

334
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Qi Huang.

335
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Where's Shen?

336
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
He's not seeing anyone.

337
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
He's not talking.

338
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Come in and sit.

339
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Old Shen is

340
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:40,640
very

341
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,640
Uncle.

342
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Chunxia, let me ask you.

343
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,640
Did Xiao Zhao find anyone at school?

344
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Uncle, I really don't know.

345
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
You're good friends.

346
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
You live in the same dormitory.

347
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
How can you not know?

348
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
He didn't tell me.

349
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm sorry, Uncle.

350
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
It's all my fault.

351
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
It's all my fault.

352
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Old Shen.

353
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Don't be excited.

354
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Be careful of your health.

355
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Don't force the child.

356
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
How could he know?

357
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Chunxia.

359
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
I'm too anxious.

360
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Be patient.

361
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Wait for the police.

362
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
They'll find out.

363
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
I can't wait anymore.

364
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
It's too hard.

365
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
I really want to die.

366
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
But before I die,

367
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
I want to see the murderer die first.

368
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Don't die for the child.

369
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
You have to live.

370
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
I'll go.

371
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
For the mirror confirmation,

372
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
we need to do two times

373
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
in addition to our result review.

374
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
It usually takes a week.

375
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
How did you get the sample?

376
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
Is that a rule?

377
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
The cup was put on.

378
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,320
Actually, if it's convenient, you can bring the child.

379
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Child?

380
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
No.

381
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,280
Let me think about it.

382
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
Okay.

383
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,560
And celery.

384
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,880
Hurry up, the meat is getting old.

385
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,280
Where's the salt?

386
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,280
Salt, salt.

387
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,680
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't make a mess.

388
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,920
Don't make a mess when I cook in the future.

389
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
It's salty.

390
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Go.

391
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,480
Hello?

392
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,120
Where did you go? Why aren't you in the team?

393
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,800
I'm eating outside.

394
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,280
You're not being promoted, right?

395
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,360
Who said that? No one.

396
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,320
You hurry up and do a review with the company.

397
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,280
He's nice and smart. He won't wrong you.

398
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay.

399
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,000
From now on,

400
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,760
don't come to my place.

401
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,080
Eat with the girl.

402
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,600
I have a company that often comes to take care of me.

403
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,280
Do you know Lin Hai Ping?

404
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,840
I know.

405
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,680
You're with him now?

406
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,680
You're so lucky.

407
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,240
He's a capable person.

408
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,520
Really.

409
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,760
He's very skilled in everything.

410
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,640
Once he came to our team to investigate the case.

411
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,200
And he analyzed the case.

412
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,080
Just like that surgeon doing the surgery,

413
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,680
he was very accurate and ruthless.

414
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,120
He's the police that I've seen most.

415
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,240
Of course,

416
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,280
he's a little...

417
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,160
insincere.

418
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,320
He thinks it's hard to get along with people.

419
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,720
So many people don't believe him.

420
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,640
But in terms of business capabilities,

421
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,200
I'm absolutely convinced.

422
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,600
You're a big guy.

423
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,720
You should be proud of yourself.

424
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,080
And,

425
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,320
what that girl said was right.

426
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,640
If you didn't make a mistake,

427
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,280
she wouldn't wrong you.

428
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
We found a clue the day before yesterday.

429
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,960
The real owner of the high-level group of fire,

430
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,640
Lao Sha.

431
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,480
Sha Hong Li is hiding in Qingzhou.

432
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,560
We rushed to Qingzhou to catch him.

433
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,520
But it was empty.

434
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,360
No one was there.

435
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,680
We found this receipt

436
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,120
in the trash can.

437
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,240
It was from two days ago.

438
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,680
Whether he escaped or not is currently being investigated.

439
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,680
That's the situation.

440
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,040
The scene is so clean.

441
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,640
There's a bill for the air ticket in the trash can?

442
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,720
We also suspect it's a smoke bomb.

443
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
So, is it appropriate?

444
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,160
Tell me about the situation here.

445
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,480
How's Wu Bo?

446
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,800
He's rescued.

447
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,200
He's still in a coma.

448
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,800
The doctor said

449
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,360
his brain is badly injured.

450
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,080
He might not wake up.

451
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,880
He might not wake up.

452
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,960
He's become a plant?

453
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,000
Wu Bo was hit in the head

454
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,760
during the escape.

455
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,920
He was badly injured.

456
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,040
He was broken

457
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,520
as a bone.

458
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,640
No weapons were found around the scene.

459
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,640
I think Wu Bo was hit

460
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,960
in the head.

461
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,960
So, it's not a gunshot wound.

462
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,560
Who hit him?

463
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,080
Could it be the scene?

464
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,480
Who hit him?

465
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,880
No matter who hit Wu Bo,

466
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,280
we should find him.

467
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,480
After searching,

468
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,480
we found this on Wu Bo.

469
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,600
Student card of Shen Xiaozhou.

470
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,320
It looks like an iron certificate.

471
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,160
But Wu Bo's friend

472
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,200
who's now a resident of Wu Yun Zhong,

473
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,000
said Wu Bo came to me on the night of the 20th.

474
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,480
He said he was in trouble.

475
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,840
He might be arrested.

476
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,440
He...

477
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,560
He did hit that female student.

478
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,960
But he was naughty.

479
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,040
He did nothing.

480
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,160
But he was in prison.

481
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,520
You have records.

482
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,640
He was afraid he couldn't explain it.

483
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,160
Then you...

484
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,200
Wu Bo lives in Wu Yun Zhong's house now.

485
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,760
He plays games every day.

486
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,080
Wu Bo said he did nothing.

487
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,240
Can you believe that?

488
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,560
No matter what he said,

489
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,160
there are two doubts.

490
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,000
One,

491
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,040
Wu Bo has been in Linchuan for less than half a year.

492
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,880
He's not familiar with the virtual reality.

493
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,760
Why would he go there to make a post?

494
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,520
Two,

495
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,800
I checked again.

496
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,600
No. 19,

497
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,360
the surveillance camera around Wu Bo's house

498
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,840
on the night of the crime.

499
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,160
The red car of Wu Bo,

500
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,120
which was about 7.20 p.m.

501
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,960
passed by his house.

502
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,600
He never left.

503
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,520
And,

504
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,760
on March 13th,

505
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,280
Wang Yishan never took Wu Bo's car.

506
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,880
In the whole process of 313 investigation,

507
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,080
Wu Bo never appeared.

508
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,160
What about the student card?

509
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,880
Is it a fingerprint?

510
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,360
The fingerprint was erased.

511
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,200
I think there are two possibilities.

512
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,720
One,

513
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,400
the student card was left by Shen Xiaozhou

514
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,480
in Wu Bo's car.

515
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,080
Shen Xiaozhou didn't notice it when he got off the car.

516
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,880
So,

517
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,960
Wu Bo might be the murderer.

518
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,160
But,

519
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,840
why would Wu Bo wipe off the fingerprint?

520
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,200
There's another possibility.

521
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,600
The person who killed Wu Bo

522
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,920
was on Wu Bo's car on purpose.

523
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,480
This person is the murderer.

524
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,320
This is a bit too much.

525
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,760
How could the murderer know

526
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,880
you were catching Wu Bo

527
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,560
and you could seize such a good chance

528
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,520
to kill Wu Bo

529
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,040
and leave the student card?

530
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,480
Is the first possibility more reasonable?

531
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,080
Shen Xiaozhou pulled the car.

532
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,960
Okay.

533
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,200
Since you think Wu Bo is the murderer,

534
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,120
you have no evidence.

535
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,560
Then continue to investigate.

536
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,720
Shen Xiaozhou took Wu Bo's car

537
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,080
for the purpose of

538
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,720
going to Lv Cheng Environmental Technology Company.

539
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,080
I asked them yesterday.

540
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,880
Lv Cheng said Shen Xiaozhou had never been there.

541
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,600
Tomorrow,

542
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,760
I'll go and investigate

543
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,000
to see if there are any other clues.

544
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,680
Okay.

545
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,600
Are you all

546
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,680
the same murderer?

547
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,200
Do you have any new ideas?

548
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,400
Okay.

549
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,720
Then, according to the current division,

550
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,640
continue to investigate.

551
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,200
Okay.

552
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,240
Let's get to work.

553
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,560
Let's go.

554
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,800
Hai Ping.

555
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,440
I didn't want to affect your case.

556
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,640
But I have to tell you something.

557
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,920
To be honest,

558
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,600
we received an anonymous e-mail

559
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,720
saying we were trying to break into Yu's

560
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,120
and Yu Dayou's underground casino.

561
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,960
It's not easy to handle.

562
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,760
Yes.

563
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,400
It said the final payment for the investigation

564
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,920
was less than 100,000 yuan.

565
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,800
What?

566
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,560
Oh my god.

567
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,240
It's obviously Wu Gao.

568
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,400
That's what I told the Bureau.

569
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,880
But they threatened to

570
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,400
continue to post

571
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,760
if we don't investigate.

572
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,600
So you should cooperate

573
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,360
and tell us what happened.

574
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,160
I've never been in such a situation

575
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,760
in so many years.

576
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,360
Don't worry.

577
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,760
Just answer whatever they ask.

578
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,760
Just change the case.

579
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,360
Don't think too much.

580
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,360
No matter who sent this e-mail,

581
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,040
it must be sent by someone else.

582
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,120
Don't let him succeed.

583
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,040
I will.

584
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,480
Brother.

585
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,920
I'll pay for it.

586
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,920
Come on.

587
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,680
Let me drive.

588
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,720
By the way,

589
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,640
a car hit me when I was chasing Wu Bo.

590
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,760
Otherwise, it would have caught up with me.

591
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,960
What car?

592
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,160
Did you remember the license plate?

593
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,520
That's more than I want to see.

594
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,640
It ran away in the middle.

595
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,600
Don't blame me.

596
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,800
Wu Taijia runs fast.

597
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,600
Forget it.

598
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,360
Just trust me.

599
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,680
I will do it if I haven't wished.

600
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,760
Look.

601
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,600
When did Wu Bo come?

602
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,720
He just showed up here

603
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,840
and threw himself out.

604
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,400
What was his name?

605
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,120
He said

606
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,920
Zhang murderer was the ï¿½ matte we called,

607
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,920
but he married Wu Bo,

608
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,840
which is just Bong Chief incident.

609
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,840
He didn't come.

610
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,080
But I've come to say

611
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,200
we just fear his savior

612
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Did you drink last night?

613
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
I don't know how you saw it.

614
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
They were drinking beer.

615
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
I was drinking cold tea.

616
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
There's a blue-haired guy in the tea.

617
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Do you know who he is?

618
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
I know. His name is Ba Chuan.

619
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
How did you know him?

620
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
I met him before.

621
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Do you know what he's doing now?

622
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
He was a little kid before.

623
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Now he's a delivery man.

624
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
He's on the right track.

625
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Why are you asking him?

626
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
I'm here.

627
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
We're here.

628
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Let's go.

629
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
I'm sorry.

630
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
I was too busy yesterday.

631
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
I can't stand it.

632
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
The person who knows Shen Xiao Zhou the best is...

633
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Really?

634
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Yes. I graduated from the Department of Environmental Science and Technology.

635
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
I'm his senior.

636
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
I hired him.

637
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
He's excellent.

638
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
I wanted him to continue his studies.

639
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,200
But he wants to work.

640
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Maybe it's because his family conditions are not good.

641
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I'm from a poor family.

642
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,200
Let's go.

643
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Do you know why Shen Xiao Zhou came to the company?

644
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
I know.

645
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
He said he wanted to go to the company...

646
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
and get some professional information.

647
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
He wanted to go home and prepare for work.

648
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
He really loves this industry.

649
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,200
He really loves this industry.

650
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
He's focused on his job.

651
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
What time did you make an appointment?

652
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Four and a half.

653
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Did he come?

654
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,200
It's my fault. I forgot about it.

655
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
I was on a business trip that day.

656
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
I don't know if he came.

657
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
I kept asking the reception.

658
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
He came to visit the registration.

659
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
I thought he didn't come.

660
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
Isn't he an employee?

661
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,200
No, he's not an official employee.

662
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
I checked. He didn't come.

663
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
Where were you that day?

664
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Qingzhou.

665
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
There's a real estate project there.

666
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
I'm going to do an environmental assessment.

667
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
I'll be back at two in the morning.

668
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
You're going to take the technicians?

669
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
No, we'll send technicians...

670
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
after we've decided on this.

671
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
So I went there myself.

672
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,200
There's one thing.

673
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
I don't know if it's useful to you.

674
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Go ahead.

675
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
Our company is hiring people.

676
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
I chose Shen Xiaozhou

677
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
from the three candidates.

678
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,200
You probably don't know.

679
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Our environmental expertise

680
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,200
is one of the four major major.

681
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
It's hard and tiring to learn.

682
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
It's harder to find a job.

683
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
I heard about it.

684
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,200
So we're very kind to this position.

685
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,200
For hard-working graduates,

686
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
it's rare.

687
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,200
There's one of the three candidates

688
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,200
who got eliminated.

689
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
It's Shen Xiaozhou's classmate.

690
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
She's very upset about the elimination.

691
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
She even sent an email to the company.

692
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Anyway,

693
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
the words she said were very harsh.

694
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
It's a severe injury

695
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,200
to Shen Xiaozhou.

696
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,200
What's her name?

697
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Her name is...

698
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Chen...

699
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Chen Hui.

700
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Yes, Chen Hui.

701
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
She said that Xiaozhou

702
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
got this job

703
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,200
by using male-female relations.

704
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,200
She also said that we would regret

705
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
and beg her to come back.

706
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
Anyway,

707
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,200
it's quite extreme.

708
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,200
Is there really such a thing

709
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
between male-female relations and who?

710
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,200
It seems that I'm the most suspicious.

711
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
I hired Xiaozhou myself.

712
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,200
But I can't call her

713
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
any male-female relations.

714
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
It's clean.

715
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
I'm one of the founders.

716
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
I'm sure I have

717
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
the sense of self-esteem.

718
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
You can go to investigate.

719
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Does Chen Hui still have the email?

720
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Yes.

721
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
Does Chen Hui have

722
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
Chinese medicine?

723
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
It's too late.

724
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
I thought there was something wrong last time.

725
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,200
Is there such a thing as a greed?

726
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
It seems that she really hates it.

727
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Wait a minute.

728
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,200
You ask.

729
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Me? How?

730
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,200
Just ask.

731
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
I can do it.

732
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Didn't you leave school?

733
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Why is she still here?

734
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,200
She is preparing for the entrance examination.

735
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
Here, leave it here.

736
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,200
You don't have to go in.

737
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
What are you doing?

738
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Nothing.

739
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,200
What's in the box?

740
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
What did you say?

741
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
I said the computer.

742
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
The data is lost and can't be restored.

743
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Do you have evidence

744
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,200
to prove that Shen Xiaozhou

745
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
is involved in these things?

746
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
You go and investigate.

747
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,200
I'm investigating now.

748
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
You said Shen Xiaozhou

749
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
used some male-female relations

750
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
to find a job.

751
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Can you just take it?

752
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
You need to be legally responsible.

753
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200
I saw it.

754
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
What did you see?

755
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
One day I came back from Lvcheng's interview.

756
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
I saw Shen Xiaozhou and a man together.

757
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Who?

758
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Is it the vice president of Lvcheng, Gu Xiangze?

759
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
You see it clearly.

760
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Anyway, that man is driving a luxury car.

761
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
They are all on the same road.

762
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Which road?

763
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,200
The rich man's daughter is looking for a rich man.

764
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,200
What can't be done?

765
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
You really have a good sense of social status.

766
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Even if Shen Xiaozhou

767
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
got into that man's car,

768
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
why do you think

769
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
they are in that kind of relationship?

770
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
I've seen too much.

771
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,200
It seems that the car needs to be picked up.

772
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,200
You don't need to worry about that.

773
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
I'll go to the hospital.

774
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
Okay.

775
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
This situation is very important.

776
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
We'll investigate it.

777
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,680
Is there a gust of wind

778
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,200
that can blow away all your worries?

779
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,520
Is there a firefly

780
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,280
that can smile at the lies from the past?

781
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,680
If I can get close to the darkness,

782
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:44,280
I can fight against the fate.

783
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,120
If I can calm my heart,

784
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,080
I can see the smile from the past.

785
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,000
I want to be the light

786
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,200
that lights up the way.

787
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,000
The truth is invisible,

788
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,480
but there is always a way.

789
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,280
The wind blows away all your worries.

790
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,680
Is there a gust of wind

791
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,880
that can blow away all your worries?

792
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,680
If I can get close to the darkness,

793
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:37,080
I can fight against the fate.

794
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,680
If I can calm my heart,

795
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,080
I can fight against the fate.

796
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,480
The wind blows away all your worries.

797
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,080
Is there a firefly

798
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:58,480
that can smile at the lies from the past?

799
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,880
If I can get close to the darkness,

800
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:07,680
I can fight against the fate.

801
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,280
If I can calm my heart,

802
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:15,280
I can fight against the fate.

803
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,280
I want to be the light

804
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,480
that lights up the way.

805
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,280
The truth is invisible,

806
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,680
but there is always a way.
