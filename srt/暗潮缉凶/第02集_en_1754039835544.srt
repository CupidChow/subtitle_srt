1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
НАMI at Guilin

2
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,400
so he didn't have to put up with it

3
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,220
It looks like it did

4
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,020
Tacoma

5
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,940
Su Xia

6
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
Su Xia

7
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:08,520
Did you bring it?

8
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,180
I brought it

9
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:09,780
Where?

10
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,380
To where?

11
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,380
To where?

12
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,080
At the store

13
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,980
Bei板

14
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,740
The statement

15
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,860
It's by Coach Jiang

16
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,260
Country situation

17
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,240
by ton

18
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,520
not by the people

19
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,440
Weñiang

20
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,620
by the country

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,440
Go

22
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,100
Record all the information

23
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,080
Everything

24
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,520
Remember the fingerprint and detonate

25
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,320
and the 那子

26
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,360
You got it?

27
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,040
Okay

28
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,960
Let's go, Zhijiao.

29
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,640
I hope not.

30
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,000
The scene is so bad.

31
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,720
Is it useful to have blood?

32
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,200
You're new here, right?

33
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,520
Let me tell you.

34
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,120
The case is like a needle in the haystack.

35
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,240
It's useless to have only a tie.

36
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,280
You have to be patient and cry slowly.

37
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,840
Ninety-nine percent.

38
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,960
A little bit of wine.

39
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
It's all for nothing.

40
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,880
Only 0.1 percent left.

41
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
It might not be useful.

42
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,520
Look at this.

43
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,240
Move.

44
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,880
Stop.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,920
What's he doing?

46
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,280
Stop.

47
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,440
Stop.

48
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,600
What are you doing?

49
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,240
Don't move.

50
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,280
What are you doing?

51
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,840
I'm hanging on the stove.

52
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,000
Sis, where are you from?

53
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,000
I was brought a chicken last time.

54
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,640
I didn't turn off the stove.

55
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,440
It's on the stove.

56
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,200
If you don't believe me, go back and have a look.

57
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,680
It's true.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,280
He killed a chicken at the door this morning.

59
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,400
He got a chicken's hair.

60
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,320
Let's go.

61
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,200
Let's go.

62
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,080
The height is 1.65 meters.

63
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,280
Come on, turn it over.

64
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,680
Don't block.

65
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,120
Hurry up.

66
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,280
Slow down.

67
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,880
The initial judgment is the same.

68
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,560
If it's true,

69
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,680
Zhao will be in trouble.

70
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,320
What do you mean?

71
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,360
Who is Zhao?

72
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,360
Zhao is the captain of the second team.

73
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,480
He has a case in March.

74
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,080
She's also a young girl.

75
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
She broke a leg.

76
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,560
There's no broken case so far.

77
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,720
The same murderer.

78
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
We can't make a conclusion yet.

79
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,440
Then this case

80
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,520
will have to go back to the second team?

81
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,240
He's been in the water.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,760
He can't judge the time of death.

83
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,040
The rough calculation

84
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,720
was between 10 p.m. and 12 p.m. last night.

85
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,080
If it wasn't for this incident,

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,440
I really couldn't find him.

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,080
Calm down.

88
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,760
Calm down.

89
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,640
What are you doing?

90
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,920
Don't move.

91
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
If it's true,

92
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,280
the case will be upgraded.

93
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,120
Let's wait for the further test results from Lao Guo.

94
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,720
If Zhao can escape successfully,

95
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,840
he can come back tomorrow.

96
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,640
If the case is upgraded,

97
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,040
I'm afraid it will be a new special case team.

98
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,240
Did the victim's identity be checked?

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,960
It's a friend of the victim's

100
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,000
named Yang Tao.

101
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,600
He's also a son of Xu Zhichang.

102
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
He recognized him.

103
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,680
The victim's name is Shen Xiaozhou.

104
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,800
Shen Xiaozhou?

105
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,520
It's not the case.

106
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,320
The case has been Aufgabe Res ooh that test.

107
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,040
Mr. Zheng,

108
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,560
let's try to find opportunity

109
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,560
to find Yang Tao.

110
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,320
I want to correct this matter.

111
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,600
Please come with us.

112
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
No.

113
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
No.

114
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
No.

115
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
No.

116
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
No.

117
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
No.

118
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
No.

119
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,600
No.

120
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Shi Qian Feng's case.

121
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
The police's judgement is that he's a talented man.

122
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,600
He's been in many competitions and has a good reputation.

123
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
But before he was promoted,

124
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
he had social experiences when he was a teenager.

125
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
What experiences?

126
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
He was a young man who had been in the chaos for years.

127
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
He was good at fighting and was good at fighting.

128
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
But he never did anything bad or joined any group.

129
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been promoted.

130
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
During his time in school, he was very difficult to change.

131
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
He was criticized several times by the media.

132
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
He was almost expelled.

133
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
He's a bad boy.

134
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
It depends on how we make him.

135
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
How is it?

136
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Is it going well today?

137
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
If it doesn't go well,

138
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Zhao will come back and ask him to go back to the second team.

139
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Let Zhao go and do the cleaning.

140
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Captain Lian.

141
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
If the murderer is the same, it's possible that it's not only Liang Qi.

142
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
I'll go to the city bureau to see the murder case that hasn't been solved.

143
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,600
It's only Liang Qi who broke the foot.

144
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
The murderer's technique will upgrade.

145
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Maybe he didn't want to do that before.

146
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Let's wait for the forensic results.

147
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
What are you doing?

148
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I'm going to my classmate's house to write homework.

149
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I saw some students at the door of the community.

150
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
They were discussing where to play games.

151
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
They're waiting for you.

152
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
How could it be?

153
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Answer it.

154
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Open the question.

155
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Go to bed early.

156
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
You slept less last night for two hours.

157
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Today is the last day.

158
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I saw the head teacher.

159
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
She didn't come.

160
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I think Sister Guo can't get along with her.

161
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
She's been complaining about her house being small for a long time.

162
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Where's Yu Yu?

163
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
She's been eating.

164
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
How did you know that

165
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,600
my son slept at 1.30 last night?

166
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
I didn't know.

167
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
I came home at 2.30 last night.

168
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
I checked his phone.

169
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
It's charged at 35%.

170
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
He won't let go of his phone

171
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
if it's out of battery.

172
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,600
It usually takes three hours to charge it once.

173
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
He only charged it for an hour yesterday.

174
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
It means he only charged it at 1.30.

175
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
It's hard to have a father like you.

176
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
He's a good son.

177
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
He's a good father.

178
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
What's this?

179
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Happy birthday.

180
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
You even know to send it?

181
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
You didn't take a picture when you were young.

182
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Now you're old.

183
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
What else do you need to take pictures?

184
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
It's a waste of money.

185
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
The innovation and development of the old industrial district in the coast

186
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
is about to enter a new stage.

187
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,320
the most valuable piece of development.

188
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,800
The overall design of the future coastal area

189
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,320
follows the international standards of green, environmental and sustainable development.

190
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,760
Little boy,

191
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
sit here.

192
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,720
Sit here.

193
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,680
Let's go.

194
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,880
I'll help you.

195
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,000
Little boy.

196
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,800
Little boy.

197
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,680
Wipe it yourself.

198
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,200
Be careful.

199
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,920
Don't get wet.

200
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,200
Through the oxygen play of the health care products and the natural plants,

201
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,560
the construction of a soil-improving district is underway.

202
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,760
As the first project is launched,

203
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,600
the industrial coastline that once was a city

204
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,880
is quietly changing.

205
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,760
Little boy.

206
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,960
Little boy.

207
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,760
Little boy.

208
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,120
Come on.

209
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,640
Little boy.

210
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,280
Xiaozhou,

211
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,640
you're on a business trip.

212
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,560
Business trip.

213
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,040
Business trip.

214
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,280
Business trip.

215
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,880
Thank you.

216
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,960
And this.

217
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,280
Please help me find it.

218
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,280
It's from 1995.

219
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,760
Is it related to the current one?

220
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,480
I want to see it.

221
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,080
The third factory here.

222
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,880
You find it yourself.

223
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,880
You can pick it up yourself if you want to drink water.

224
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
The first factory here.

225
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
You find it yourself.

226
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
You can pick it up yourself if you want to drink water.

227
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
The first factory here.

228
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
You find it yourself.

229
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
You can pick it up yourself if you want to drink water.

230
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
The first factory here.

231
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
You find it yourself.

232
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
You can pick it up yourself if you want to drink water.

233
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
The first factory here.

234
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
You find it yourself.

235
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
You can pick it up yourself if you want to drink water.

236
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
The first factory here.

237
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
You find it yourself.

238
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
You can pick it up yourself if you want to drink water.

239
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
The first factory here.

240
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
You find it yourself.

241
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
You find it yourself.

242
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
You find it yourself.

243
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
You find it yourself.

244
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
You find it yourself.

245
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
You find it yourself.

246
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
You find it yourself.

247
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
You find it yourself.

248
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
You find it yourself.

249
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
You find it yourself.

250
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
Li Aiping.

251
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880
Li Aiping.

252
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:19,900
I don't want you to come back.

253
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:28,120
I don't want you to come back.

254
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,960
Xiaochun is not here.

255
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,640
Xiaochun is not here.

256
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,120
Xiaochun is not here.

257
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,120
Xiaochun is not here.

258
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
Xiaozhou

259
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
is on a business trip.

260
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,640
He's going to work.

261
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Work?

262
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,680
He's going to Beijing.

263
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,600
He's going to Beijing for work.

264
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,120
Xiaochun is in Beijing?

265
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,040
Xiaochun is in Beijing?

266
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,920
Xiaochun is in Beijing?

267
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,000
Xiaozhou is in Beijing?

268
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,120
Xiaozhou is in Beijing?

269
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,520
Xiaozhou is in Beijing?

270
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,400
It's so early.

271
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,040
When did you get up?

272
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,320
It's early in the morning.

273
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,880
I woke up early.

274
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
I've eaten.

275
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
I'm leaving.

276
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,160
Captain Lin.

277
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,360
Did you look in the room?

278
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,560
I did.

279
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,440
There's nothing.

280
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,840
I locked the door.

281
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,200
Xiaoji came to get me.

282
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,640
Where is the first scene?

283
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,880
There's a foot cut off.

284
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,200
There must be a lot of blood.

285
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,600
Could it be

286
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,680
a cut under the water?

287
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,760
No.

288
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,800
It should be an electric tool

289
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,280
to cut the surface.

290
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,480
Then we'll cut it elsewhere

291
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
and transfer it here.

292
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,840
Find it again.

293
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
I'll go back to the team.

294
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,600
Captain Lin.

295
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,240
Zheng Haogang should be back today.

296
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,000
See you.

297
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,840
We should go back.

298
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,360
Qi stitched

299
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,840
a coastline

300
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,140
because a guy

301
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,480
was ankleing me.

302
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,880
Let it get you out of here quickly.

303
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,400
Whose leg?

304
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,680
His.

305
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,840
Okay.

306
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,560
First,

307
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,280
It's the right hand.

308
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,760
That's right.

309
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,680
It's the right hand.

310
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,280
I heard the wind blowing behind my head

311
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,680
It's too late to hide

312
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,000
Captain, head

313
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,680
The head was a few steps away from me

314
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,760
No one arrived, but I arrived first

315
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,040
I heard a crack

316
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,560
I thought my head was cracked

317
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,960
The head didn't even crack

318
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,040
I put the boy down with one hand

319
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,920
What are you talking about?

320
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,040
I'm Chang Biyuan

321
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,520
roll

322
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,800
back

323
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,360
Hai Ping

324
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:50,960
Wang Zhao

325
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,320
Come

326
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,640
go

327
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,800
Where's the hammer?

328
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,480
Master Chang, Liu borrowed it

329
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
The screw fell again

330
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,520
Find a nail and nail it

331
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,040
Use some force

332
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,640
Use some force

333
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
What is the case?

334
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,720
I

335
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,280
I said, Captain Feng

336
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,480
Ask them what case

337
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,920
None of them talk to me

338
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,040
Do you have a conclusion?

339
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,880
Yes

340
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,320
This is the victim of the 313 case this year

341
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,080
Wang Yishan

342
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,440
Your opponent

343
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
Let me summarize the common points first

344
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
Wang Yishan was diagnosed with a rare disease

345
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,480
Shen Xiaozhou's eye mucus

346
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,360
Lungs broken

347
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,720
It should also be a bad omen that leads to a rare disease

348
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,600
Next common point

349
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,600
The victim was cut off one foot

350
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,600
But Wang Yishan is the left foot

351
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Shen Xiaozhou is the right foot

352
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
The third common point

353
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,640
Cutting tool

354
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,920
According to Wang Yishan's case

355
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,560
We can basically judge

356
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,440
Cutting tool is this kind of electric saw

357
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,360
Single-handed and vertical

358
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,240
All are checked

359
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,600
Did not find

360
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,480
Suspicious target of buying this kind of tool

361
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,280
I suspect it is a foreign country to buy or online shopping

362
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,840
We are expanding the inspection area

363
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,960
Wang Yishan's cut face

364
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,040
Should it be more balanced?

365
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,960
You can say that

366
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,040
But the handle is used with a knife

367
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,680
The knife will not be so accurate

368
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,280
finally

369
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,240
Their confidence is different

370
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,320
What Shen Xiaozhou encountered

371
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,080
Not an ordinary confidence

372
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,320
Should be a kind of obligation

373
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
I guess

374
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,560
It should be this kind of multi-face object

375
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,720
Smooth surface

376
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,120
This kind of shape is not common

377
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,400
Should be carried along with the murderer

378
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,880
If it is the same murderer

379
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,840
Its change is a bit strange

380
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,600
What is strange?

381
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,640
Just a pervert

382
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,920
stop

383
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,680
What are you doing

384
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Talking to you

385
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,720
Put down the hammer

386
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,520
Who are you

387
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,640
It's not how you came in

388
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,120
I'm a pervert, who are you?

389
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,800
Who are you

390
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,160
Linzi

391
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,200
Who

392
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,760
Get up

393
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,880
Linzi

394
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,680
Linzi

395
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,480
That's the situation

396
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,640
Both cases have no DNA evidence

397
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,800
Can only be judged

398
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,080
Is it the same murderer?

399
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,920
Everyone, tell me your opinion

400
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,040
I say it must be

401
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,360
Same city, same area

402
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,280
Two killers with electric saws

403
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,760
is it possible?

404
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
There is a possibility

405
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,920
Is it a copy case?

406
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,720
impossible

407
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,880
313 case

408
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,520
No public case

409
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,840
And Wang Yishan

410
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,640
Was found in the abandoned crime scene

411
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,720
If Shen Xiaozhou's case is a copy case

412
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,200
Why bother to carry it to the field

413
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,480
It's convenient to find a sewer and throw it

414
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,240
It's easy to be found in the sewer

415
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,760
If it's a copy case, are you afraid to be found?

416
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,760
Isn't it for the sake of the disaster?

417
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,920
Where is Lei Hai?

418
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,880
do not know

419
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,560
50% possibility

420
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,520
Cut corners

421
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,720
Same tool

422
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,040
And the speciality of choosing tools

423
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,760
Are all more clear marks

424
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,160
Another 50%

425
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
The murderer who killed Wang Yishan wore gloves

426
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,320
On the edge of the Shen Xiaozhou's progress

427
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,120
There are small wounds of the tooth

428
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,720
Directly didn't wear gloves

429
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,120
And Wang Yishan and Huang Yushang

430
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,360
Hand and ankle are tied

431
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,320
Shen Xiaozhou didn't

432
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,720
Shen Xiaozhou just has scratches on his legs and heels

433
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,280
This is the ground

434
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,160
I have a doubt

435
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,760
Control the means of the victim

436
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,520
The difference in the way of sexual intercourse

437
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,240
If it's the same person

438
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,040
What is it

439
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,840
Let him change the habit of the crime

440
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,880
In addition

441
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,960
One is the left foot

442
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,120
One is the right foot

443
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,880
I think there is a possibility

444
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,320
The murderer of Wang Yishan is the left hand

445
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,720
Shen Xiaozhou is the right hand

446
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,040
Which foot is used for which hand

447
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,400
You heard it

448
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,560
What if the victim is lying down?

449
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
All possible

450
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,040
So I said there is no science

451
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,360
Same everywhere

452
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,200
The rest are small problems

453
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,280
The same murderer

454
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,200
The method will not be the same

455
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,080
My attitude

456
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,920
The murderer is the same person

457
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,880
Should be investigated in the same case

458
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
I have this view

459
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,200
Once the case is solved

460
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,000
Establish a case team

461
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,480
Both of your teams have to go

462
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,080
This 313 case is the second team

463
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,040
Still have the second team to be responsible

464
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,120
I recognize the team leader

465
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,840
Zhao Honggang is the deputy team leader

466
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,280
The three teams cooperate

467
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,440
Any comments

468
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,720
No comments

469
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,720
What do you think of the next investigation direction

470
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,920
If it's the same murderer

471
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,480
Then choose the victim

472
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,040
There are two situations

473
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,800
one

474
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,480
Choose the victim you know

475
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,240
So what is the connection between Wang Yishan and Shen Xiaozhou

476
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,000
Wang Yishan

477
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:29,780
Social

478
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,160
I said a situation

479
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,760
We found out

480
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,040
Wang Yishan saw a high-level bandage before he died

481
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,120
Very likely to be closely related to his victim

482
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,640
This time we caught this group of people

483
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,320
These people now pick themselves up clean

484
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,200
I don't admit it at all

485
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,480
They said the actual person in charge was a person called Sha Hongli

486
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,960
People with the nickname old Sha

487
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,200
Just in Linchuan

488
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,080
Hidden

489
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,600
No one knows where he is

490
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,600
Director Chiu

491
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,560
Team leader

492
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,400
I plan to continue following this line

493
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,000
Shen Xiaozhou

494
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,200
Or old

495
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,160
I have a suggestion

496
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,440
Check if he has brought money

497
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,160
Now college students have a lot of loans

498
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,680
Our two groups

499
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Who has progress

500
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,040
Anytime

501
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,880
it is good

502
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,120
That's the arrangement

503
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,160
I

504
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,480
Am i still with the three teams now

505
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,120
Still asking

506
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,680
We are not lacking people

507
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,400
take it

508
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,800
Then follow us

509
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,840
I am coming

510
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,760
Pour a cup of water for me

511
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
soup

512
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,760
cold

513
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,480
I take an orange

514
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,760
I'm not going to tell him.

515
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,760
Let Chunxia come over.

516
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
No.

517
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
I won't tell him.

518
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Once he's done with the school,

519
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,760
I'll know when I get home.

520
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
Director Ye.

521
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Don't move. Don't move.

522
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Why are you here?

523
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
This is the opening of Jinghai No. 1.

524
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
I'm here.

525
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,760
It's my duty.

526
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,760
This is Chairman Li of Jinghai Group.

527
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
Vice President Liang.

528
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
My lover, Du Li.

529
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Hello.

530
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
Please sit.

531
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,760
Sit.

532
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
How is it?

533
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
Nothing serious, right?

534
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,760
No.

535
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,760
I have a headache.

536
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
You can't be careless.

537
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
If you feel uncomfortable,

538
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
tell me.

539
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
I'll find a Beijing expert for you.

540
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
No need.

541
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,760
I'll be discharged in two days.

542
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,760
I'll find the best nurse

543
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
in a special care unit.

544
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
I'll leave it to you.

545
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Don't worry, Chairman.

546
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
I'm sorry.

547
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
I have something to do later.

548
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
I'll talk to Director Yue.

549
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Okay.

550
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,760
Don't move.

551
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,760
Take care.

552
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Take care.

553
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Bye.

554
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Change the ward.

555
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,760
Go and buy some tofu buns.

556
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,760
I can't eat the hospital food.

557
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Okay.

558
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
Go.

559
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Xue Zhi Chang is out of the hospital.

560
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
Now,

561
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
we're in trouble.

562
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,760
I knew it when I woke up.

563
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
I heard that if it wasn't for me,

564
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
you wouldn't have been able to find out.

565
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
A female student died.

566
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
The impact on society is huge.

567
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Parents are old workers.

568
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
Poor kids.

569
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,760
This is a criminal case.

570
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,760
Before the case is solved,

571
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,760
all our plans

572
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,760
will be put on hold.

573
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,760
We can only do this

574
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,760
as a case of investigation.

575
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
But I made a different choice.

576
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,760
I can't do this.

577
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,760
I...

578
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
I'll do this.

579
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Foctimus Regius.

580
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Even if we solve it,

581
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
I still claim CBA.

582
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
I'm telling you the truth.

583
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Chairman,

584
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,480
So, I'll have to do it all over again.

585
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,940
No matter what it is, anyway, never-ending smoothies are no good.

586
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,400
Then my head will be stuck on the railing,

587
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,320
my sesame seed will be其ed,

588
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,200
and the money can be repaid.

589
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,280
That won't work.

590
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,180
We'll make you a gold puzzle with it in the pot.

591
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,420
She is the most important part of this project.

592
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,920
Do you have any opinion

593
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,080
on whether to change the case or not?

594
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:57,880
Yes.

595
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,560
The current situation

596
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
is right for the case.

597
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,480
The joint advantage power

598
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,160
can be used to mobilize more resources.

599
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,040
One plus one is a big deal.

600
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,080
Yes.

601
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,360
We need to check

602
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,280
all the clues about Shen Xiaorou.

603
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,040
We also need to keep an eye on

604
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,960
the direction Lao Zhao is talking about.

605
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,640
Cooperate well

606
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,880
and hurry up.

607
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,160
Okay.

608
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,600
Wait.

609
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,640
I haven't finished yet.

610
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,600
Hai Ping.

611
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,200
Your business ability

612
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,800
is very clear to everyone.

613
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,880
It's very good.

614
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,680
I see that you usually

615
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,840
conduct investigation and interrogation cases.

616
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,560
You are very quiet.

617
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,640
There is no problem with your communication ability.

618
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,400
Why is it so difficult

619
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,600
to make you say one more word

620
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,680
when you don't conduct a case?

621
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,680
There is a need to conduct a case.

622
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,040
This medicine needs to be chewed.

623
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,120
It will stick to your teeth and delay your work.

624
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,840
Hai Ping.

625
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,080
You should

626
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,600
communicate with your comrades more often.

627
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,400
Otherwise,

628
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,680
this is your short-term plan.

629
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,520
Captain Feng.

630
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,840
Do you have anything else?

631
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,640
I'm about to be a coward.

632
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,040
The leader has two people in this position.

633
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,320
You and Zhao Honggang.

634
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,400
Lao Zhao said that

635
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,080
he would be transferred here for only two or three years.

636
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,480
But he hasn't transferred the chain.

637
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,520
This time, he escaped and got injured.

638
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,520
The city bureau leaders all take it seriously.

639
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,920
But you

640
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,640
are too far away from the leaders.

641
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,080
This morning,

642
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,880
I saw you at the gate.

643
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,880
You said hello to the city bureau leaders

644
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,480
and asked them to kill you.

645
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,960
Captain Feng.

646
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,520
You are too introverted.

647
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,080
There are only two people.

648
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,760
You and Lao Zhao.

649
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,360
I'm not biased.

650
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,760
But in terms of the balance,

651
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,120
you are affected by your character in this aspect.

652
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,960
You are a little at a disadvantage.

653
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,160
By the way,

654
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,560
it's good that Shi Qiangfeng is with you.

655
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,400
You should also bring the men's team.

656
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,640
You should beat him well.

657
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,000
You were just the first thing in my mind today.

658
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,440
I just thought the same thing.

659
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,000
Stop worrying yourself.

660
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,440
Goodbye, Mr. 꼬 growth officer Ye.

661
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,160
Leng Xiaochun,

662
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,320
Are you sure you'll let Halloween come to an end in this way?

663
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:38,840
Yes.

664
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,680
But we have to vanilla triangle tomorrow

665
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,920
and learn from him.

666
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,560
Your face is a little selection.

667
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,120
The closest source of the crime scene

668
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,120
is also two kilometers away.

669
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,280
This one, this one,

670
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
and this one.

671
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,320
Which one do you want to see?

672
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,440
Tell me.

673
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,720
According to your guess,

674
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,040
every street

675
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,960
near the crime scene

676
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,760
has a chance of suspecting someone.

677
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,960
How many people are there?

678
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,680
Seventy percent.

679
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
How many people are there?

680
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,680
I don't know how you can calculate it.

681
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,520
These three stalls

682
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,840
have a chance of suspecting someone?

683
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,800
It's too far.

684
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,880
There are many small streets around.

685
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,720
Based on your experience,

686
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,680
how many cars have passed before and after the crime?

687
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,800
There is a concept.

688
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,640
The point is, what car are we looking for?

689
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,000
Car?

690
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,280
Motorbike?

691
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,720
Three-wheeled car?

692
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,760
Or a bicycle?

693
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,840
The crime scene

694
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,600
was stepped on by hundreds of people.

695
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,960
It's not sure about the transportation.

696
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,520
That means

697
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,120
all the cars that can hide people are counted.

698
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,520
The new one,

699
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,760
prepare some eye drops for me.

700
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,200
The most expensive one.

701
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Okay, I'll go buy it.

702
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,080
Come back.

703
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
I'm kidding.

704
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,400
I don't need eye drops here.

705
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,880
Who thought of it?

706
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,040
Here.

707
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,560
The air conditioner is always on.

708
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,480
I'll fix it.

709
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,200
All the communication methods in Shenzhou,

710
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,280
mobile phone, social media,

711
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,080
and everything that you can use,

712
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,000
please check them.

713
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,880
The communication records are easy to check.

714
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,480
But the chat records

715
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,000
are usually kept in the local area.

716
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,480
It's hard to check without the equipment.

717
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,600
It's better to check it.

718
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,520
Besides,

719
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,080
check if there's any contact

720
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,640
with Wang Yishan.

721
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,600
Okay.

722
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,000
Hello, Shen Jiangfeng.

723
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,760
Hello.

724
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,760
It's not working.

725
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,920
Big Hit brought out the uddero dollars forangan.

726
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
ły

727
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,360
Xiaoduo.

728
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,680
Xiaoduo.

729
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,920
Xiaoduo.

730
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,800
Xiaoduo.

731
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,160
Xiaoduo.

732
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,000
Is there a flame

733
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
that can be burned to the ground?

734
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
If I can see through the darkness,

735
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
the fate will be bright and bright.

736
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
If I can calm my heart,

737
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
it will be a dream that I can't wake up from.

738
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
How I wish to be the light

739
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
that can light up the way ahead.

740
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I believe that

741
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
there is a way to the end.

742
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Memories are like the wind

743
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
that cuts through the night.

744
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
The story is painful.

745
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
The old dream on the sword

746
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
is like a road to the old.

747
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm trapped in the rest of my life.

748
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Is there a storm

749
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
that can blow away all the fog?

750
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Is there a night

751
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
that can burn the lies away?

752
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
If I can see through the darkness,

753
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
the fate will be bright and bright.

754
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
If I can calm my heart,

755
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
it will be a dream that I can't wake up from.

756
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
How I wish to be the light

757
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
that can light up the way ahead.

758
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I believe that

759
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
there is a way to the end.

760
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The End
