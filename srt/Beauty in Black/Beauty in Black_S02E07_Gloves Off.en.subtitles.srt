I want you to be all right, all right?
But I don't really know you.

154

Look, um, I'm trying

She's not answering.

158
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,616
Oh, she--

159
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,203
She probably didn't answer 'cause
you're calling from an unknown number.

160
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:56,499
-Ah. Tell her to answer the phone.
-Okay, will do.

Ah. Butler nigga.

[Horace] You can get
what you need. Okay? Um…

00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,681
Tell Kimmie to answer her phone.

167

[Kimmie] Well, I'm about

Don't be early. Make them wait.

180
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,759
Oh. Okay.

181
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,262
[Horace] One thing
they can't stand is waiting.

182
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,722
[scoffs] All right.

183
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,976
Especially that damn Roy.
It's going to agitate the shit out of him.

184
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,853
Got it.

185
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,063
[Horace] You know, Olivia and Norman,

186
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,984
they'll be sitting there,
like snakes in the dark.

187
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,695
You seem to really be enjoying this.

188
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,155
[Horace] I am.

189
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:15,161
'Cause they have no idea who the bitch is
that's about to walk in the door.

190
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,288
I'm glad you got all this confidence.

191
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,625
[Horace] I have all the confidence
and the power.

192
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,210
[coughing]

193
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,879
You good?
That don't sound like power to me.

194
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,297
[coughs]

195
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,882
[sighs]

196
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,593
[inhales deeply]
Let me tell you something.

197
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,095
If I die tomorrow,

198
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,057
it'll be with a smile on my face.

199
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,100
All the shit.

200
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,770
I get to fuck up their lives.

201
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,105
They really must've done something to you.

202
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,441
[Horace] Ah, you have no idea.

203
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,113
Well, um… I will be ready.

204
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,784
I want books, chapters, and verses.

205
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,119
[Kimmie] I will give you all the tea.

206
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,621
[chuckling] Okay?

207
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,997
[Horace] You don't know this yet,

208
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:04,544
but when I get to the facility,
I'm gonna tap into the cameras

209
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,129
so I can see their faces.

210
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,174
I wish I could be there in person.

211
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,968
Well, that's the next best thing.

212
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,053
You don't seem excited.

213
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,846
I'm feeling it out.

214
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,266
[Horace] Own that room, Kimmie.

215
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,142
Own that shit.

216
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,273
I'm trying.

217
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,482
Don't try.

218
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,234
That fucking Jules?

219
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,486
Remember what he did to you?

220
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,489
[spluttering] Shit,
now… now you getting me there.

221
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,949
[Horace] He trafficked you.

222
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,452
And my brother Norman?
That's his business partner.

223
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:42,623
They were making money off of you like
you were from some third world country.

224
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,502
And they were licking their lips
to make even more off of little Sylvie.

225
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,132
All right, you a little too good at that.

226
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,009
-Am I?
-Yeah.

227
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,387
The way Roy humiliated me…

228
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,849
That's my girl.

229
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,685
You want the real Kimmie to walk in there?

230
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,478
[Horace] You damn right.

231
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,814
Go get them motherfuckers.

232
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,027
All right.

233
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,700
[breathing shakily]

234
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:22,371

[personnel chattering]

237
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,304
[tense music playing]

238
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,182
What we got?

239
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,559
One of ours.

240
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,227
Who?

241
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,896
Shake Shake.

242
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,691
And Daga.

243
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,527
[Jules] Where's the new little young girl?

244
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,029
[Trackson] Nowhere to be found.

245
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,240
-[Jules] You think she did this?
-Nah, nah, man. She's just a kid.

246
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,284
Ain't doing nothing like this.

247
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,245
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

248
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,707
You ask me, man,
this looks professional for sure.

249
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,252
Yeah, somebody got that bitch.

250
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,047
Guess she pumped the wrong one.

251
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,008
Well, you know,
Rain was at the club last night.

252
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:16,926
What?

253
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,136
Yeah. I left you some messages.

254
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,599
[keypad clacking]

255
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,226
What was she doing there?

256
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,186
She was just hanging out.

257
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,355
But I definitely saw her
talk to the young chick.

258
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,440
[dramatic sting]

259
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,068
So she did this?

260
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,738
Nah, man, Rain ain't no professional.
She couldn't do this.

261
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,157
Yeah, but she messing with a nigga who is.

262
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,368
-Who?
-Our boss.

263
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,038
[exhales] Damn… Damn, you right.

264
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,082
Who was she with?

265
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,835
Alex was driving her.

266
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,545
Officer Alex?

267
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,462
Yeah.

268
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,549
So this is his work.

269
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,968
Hey, no, Alex a little bitch.

270
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,554
Come on, Jules. You know
Alex ain't doing no shit like this.

271
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,472
You sure?

272
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:04,932
Yes.

273
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,102
You got your thumb on him?

274
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,397
That's my dawg. Alex ain't capable
of doing no shit like this.

275
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,274
No way. Mm-mm.

276
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,402
[Jules sighs]

277
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,697
You find that young girl,
and you bring her to me.

278
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,323
I'm all over it.

279
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,242
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

280
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,871
-Roy was there last night too?
-Yep. Mm-hmm.

281
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,789
What happened?

282
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,501
You know Roy, man, VIP. [chuckling]

283
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,837
Fucking with them hood bitches, huh?

284
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,338
Yeah, man.

285
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,676
He, uh, ended up connecting with Felicia,
and now he got her number and shit.

286
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,927
Ah, shit.

287
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,805
She told me that he promised her

288
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,017
that she was gonna work for him
or somethin'. Like, what?

289
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,811
-There he goes on that bullshit.
-Yeah, yeah.

290
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,356
Listen, I gotta get back to the office.

291
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,650
I need you to stay on this.

292
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,693
Sure, I got you.

293
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,992
[suspenseful music playing]

294
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,622

-[phone rings]
-[horse neighs]

297
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:16,962
Yo.

298
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,049
[Trackson] Man, Jules is asking
all kind of crazy shit about you.

299
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,008
Like what?

300
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:24,094
[Trackson] You know
that Shake Shake and Daga are dead, right?

301
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,179
What?

302
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,180
[Trackson] Yeah.

303
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,600
Okay, so, what's that gotta do with me?

304
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,435
Because you was at the club with Rain.

305
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,853
You was with her.

306
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,773
-Yeah, doing my job.
-[Trackson] Yeah.

307
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,317
The shit that hit them
looks professional though.

308
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,069
Wait, he thinks I did it?

309
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,155
[Trackson] No, I… I told him no
because you… you with me.

310
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,534
I really don't like him asking about you,
though, man. It's making me nervous.

311
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,535
[Alex] Yeah, me either.

312
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,954
Make sure you tell him
where my loyalty is.

313
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,373
Yeah, I know where your loyalty lies,
but, you know,

314
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,917
Jules may be having all kind of crazy shit
going on in his head.

315
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,418
[chuckles] Man, he crazy.

316
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,837
He sure does.

317
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,631
Just… Just tell me what I gotta do.

318
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,967
[Trackson] Just lay low, man.
I'll keep an eye on it.

319
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,469
-I'll let you know.
-Yeah, yeah, do that.

320
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,596
You… You bringing Kimmie
to the office, right?

321
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,722
[Alex] Yeah.

322
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,559
All right, all right.
I'll see you when you get there.

323
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,102
All right, talk to you later.

324
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,273

[horse neighs]

326
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,318
-That's what's up.
-How long do we have to wait for her?

327
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,278
[Rain] I know.

328
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,696
[Sylvie scoffs]

329
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,490
[Angel] Damn. Okay, look at you.

Girl, you better fake it.
They don't know no different.

I'mma try my best. [chuckles]

335
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,920
[scoffs] If Roy's stupid-ass can make it
at that company, you know damn well--

336
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,506
Girl, that don't make me feel no better.

337

[chuckles] Okay, you right.

338

You look strong, big sis.

339
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,929
Thank you, Sylvie.

340
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,640
You sure you don't want me
to come with you?

341
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,185
Nah, I'm good. I gotta do this by myself.

342
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,355
-Okay.
-Shit, well, you look good.

343
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,190
Where you get that wardrobe from?

344
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,818
The boutique.
We went shopping. [chuckling]

345
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,404
Shit, I'm about to do the same ting.

346
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,530
With what money?

347
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,741
Butler nigga said he got
a credit card for me.

348
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:12,202
Angel, you must got that angel--

349
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,079
[Angel] Nah, nah,

350
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,164
-I'm just saying--
-Rain--

351
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,375
All right, all right, I'm about to get
out of here. I will see y'all later.

352
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,753
Okay. You call me
as soon as that meeting's over.

353
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,921
I will.

354
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,132
-All right. Go get 'em, girl. [chucking]
-Bye, y'all. [chuckling]

355
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,092
-Come on, I'll walk you out.
-Bye.

356
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,219
Oh, wait, Sylvie. Um…

357
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,263
When I get back, we need to talk.

358
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,182
-Yeah?
-Okay.

359
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,600
[Kimmie exhales sharply]

360
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,567
Go get 'em, bitch. [chuckling]

361
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,152
-[Alex] Wow.
-What?

362
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,320
You look amazing.

363
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,739
I know.

364
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,116
Open the door.

365
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,868
-[car door opens]
-Thank you.

366
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,411
Go get 'em, bitch!

367
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,248
-Wait, that nigga drives her?
-Yeah.

368
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,459
-Okay, well, I don't trust that nigga.
-[engine starts]

369
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,045
Yeah, but he been trying to prove himself.

370
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,755
Okay, well, he knocked the shit out of me.

371
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,423
You probably deserved it.

372
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,092
[Angel] What?

373
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,928
[Rain] Angel, I don't have time
for this right now. I had a long night.

374
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,263
-I'm going to bed.
-Okay, well, don't trust him.

375
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,849
Where you goin'?

376
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,727
I wanna see the horses.

377
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,773
Sylvie, you know Kimmie
do not want you wandering around here.

378
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:27,569
Well, she's not here, so she can relax.

379
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,032
But how can I relax and go to sleep
if you wandering around?

380
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,452
I'm just going to the barn
behind the house.

381
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,746
-Sylvie.
-I'll keep an eye on her.

382
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,664
You better.

383
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,916
[Angel] I got it.

384
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,503
[door opens]

385
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,005
You walking too fast.

386
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,175
[sighs]

387
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,803
[tense music playing]

388
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,056
-Hey.
-Hey.

389
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,517
I can't believe this.

390
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,227
What?

391
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,813
That he got us with this shit.

392
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,231
[chuckles]

393
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,568
No, he got you.

394
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:14,825
[chuckling] Oh, now you got to admit
this son of a bitch is smart.

395
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,577
Shit.

396
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,496
He ain't that damn smart.

397
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,957
He married a whore.

398
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,917
It worked.

399
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,336
He don't love her.

400
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,047
I know that.

401
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,009
He just did this shit to fuck us up.

402
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,927
And it worked.

403
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,598
[sighs] Look, did you come here
to try to depress me?

404
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,600
Or did you come here for a meeting?

405
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:44,146
I came here to listen
to what this dumb bitch has to say,

406
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,774
and hear how stupid she is,

407
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,525
and come up with a plan.

408
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,529
-[scoffs]
-That is exactly why I'm here.

409
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,201
And to see how this nigga
gonna be trying to tie our hands.

410
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,995
No, he's tied yo hands.

411
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,248
You know, I always got
three or four trains running,

412
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,833
but in your case,

413
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,712
you had three or four trains
being run on you.

414
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,422
[chuckles sarcastically]

415
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,593
Are you done
with your stupid-ass comments?

416
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,262
[laughing]

417
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,517
See, never let your enemy
know what you're doing next.

418
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,018
You damn right.

419
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,687
[chuckling]

420
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,398
But you know what?

421
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,319
Shit, it don't even really matter.

422
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,197
'Cause them cancer patients,

423
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,367
they gonna make
all the difference in the world.

424
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,078
They will take the company down.

425
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,122
Are you in on that?

426
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,461
I swear, Norman,
you and your damn conspiracies.

427
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,213
How in the hell would I be in on it?

428
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,423
I don't know. I don't know.

429
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,136
I can't give nobody cancer.

430
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:02,808
'Cause if I could,
all you motherfuckers would be dead.

431
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,725
Twice.

432
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,395
[chuckles] You are in on it, aren't you?

433
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,396
[scowls]

434
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,650
No, see, you always have
your nasty little hands into everything.

435
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,862
And what you got yo nasty little hands on?

436
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,989
[exhales] I don't know.

437
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,117
I'm just trying to figure this shit out.

438
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,496
See, on one hand, he marries this bitch.

439
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,082
On another hand, he's…

440
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,002
He's talking about this little Latin kid.

441
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:35,424
Yeah, well,
he always did like Latin women.

442
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,925
No. [chuckling]

443
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,636
No, I… See, I always thought that too.

444
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,804
But this…

445
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,140
But this is a man.

446
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,933
What?

447
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,686
He been talking about
the boy stole his watch or somethin'.

448
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,354
I'm not buying that.

449
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,106
I… I… I… I don't get it.

450
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,649
Uh, look, it don't matter anyway,

451
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,027
'cause he killed
the little motherfucker this morning.

452
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,905
-What? You shitting me?
-Nah, nah.

453
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,533
You see… see, I think he's just trying
to cover up that Kimmie shit,

454
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,827
or… or… or… or maybe that car stuff.

455
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,663
But then…

456
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,335
I think the young man pissed him off.

457
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,253
You see what I'm sayin'?

458
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,633
[Sylvie] Can you believe
Black people live like this?

459
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,842
-No.
-[horses neighing]

460
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,801
What?

461
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,929
All this shit ain't fair.

462
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,722
What do you mean?

463
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:27,601
The way that we struggle
and he gets to have shit like this?

464
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,646
-[Sylvie] You mad.
-You damn right I'm mad. I want it.

465
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,940
[Sylvie scoffs] Well, it's not yours.

466
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,359
I know that,
but that doesn't mean I can't want it.

467
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,695
You know, you're strange.

468
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,155
What?

469
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,075
I mean, this man has given us all of this,
and you're mad?

470
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,285
-He ain't given us shit.
-What?

471
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,537
You have to have sex with him.

472
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,999
-Who told you that?
-Kimmie, she told me everything.

473
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,919
Well, she should have told you
that I don't have sex with him.

474
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,504
I just danced for him a couple times.

475
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,090
[scoffs] Okay, well,

476
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,884
must've been a hell of a dance
for you to be here with us.

477
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,011
Look, you got somethin' to say?

478
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,513
No, I just wanna see the horses.

479
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,556
Oh, then look at the horses.

480
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,851
-You got a bad attitude.
-Yeah, whatever.

481
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,937
[pensive music playing]

482
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,023
[chuckles] Hey. I saw you earlier, right?

483
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,025
-[Sylvie] Hi.
-Sylvie, right?

484
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,319
[chuckles]

485
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,407
-Oh, the horse is so beautiful. Can I…
-Yeah.

486
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,075
Uh, his name is Duck.

487
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,536
[chuckling] A horse named Duck?

488
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,289
[chuckling] He's, uh,
Mr. Bellarie's favorite.

489
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,416
Although he doesn't ride anymore.

490
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,710
-Oh, yeah, I guess that's hard.
-Yeah.

491
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,169
Do you ride?

492
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,672
No. I always wanted to.

493
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,175
Well, uh, I take care of the horses.
I could show you.

494
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,261
Who are you?

495
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,097
[chuckles] Uh, sorry.
Uh, my name is Glen.

496
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,766
Sylvie.

497
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,684
Sylvie.

498
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,062
-I like that name.
-Thanks.

499
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,147
So you work here?

500
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,275
Uh, in the summers and on the weekends.

501
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,068
I'm in college at Berkeley.

502
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,404
Oh, okay, I see. [chuckles]

503
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,822
Uh, Jules is my dad.

504
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,159
-Jules?
-He's the head of security.

505
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,661
-Oh yeah. Yeah, I met the head guy here.
-Yeah.

506
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,371
Mm-hmm.

507
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,582
Oh, no, that's… [chuckles] That's Whitman.

508
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,294
Uh, he runs this place.
My dad runs the company.

509
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,047
Oh. Okay. Nice.

510
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,551
Well, uh… I will gladly show you
how to ride if you want.

511
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,387
-Okay.
-Let's go.

512
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,478
Sir.

513
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,646
[Roy] Jules. [exhales]

514
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:41,068
So… I heard you were
at the club last night.

515
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,696
Yeah, I was. [chuckles]

516
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,532
I thought we talked
about you staying away.

517
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,576
[clicks tongue]

518
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:53,538
You know, I don't really give a shit.
You know, because I thoroughly enjoyed it.

519
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,664
It was fun.

520
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,919
And, Jules, let me remind you,
I'm still in this business.

521
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,338
The laundering business.

522
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,090
-Stay out the club.
-Hey.

523
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,760
Jules, I'm going to go
as much as I want to.

524
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,096
-You understand?
-Roy…

525
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,474
Speaking of, I need to, uh…
I need to talk to you.

526
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,476
So sit down, please.

527
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,896
[clears throat] Since we gonna
talk about the club…

528
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,481
[sighs] Well?

529
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,652
So is, uh…
Kimmie really coming to work here?

530
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,030
She's on her way in now.

531
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:31,284
Hm. That's some shit, ain't it? [chuckles]

532
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,204
Okay, since they, uh…

533
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,456
They all wanna play games,

534
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,460
bring people in that's new, I want you
to bring someone else in for me.

535
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,003
Okay.

536
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,632
Like I said, I was at the club, right?

537
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,552
-Officer Trackson told me this morning.
-Yeah.

538
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:53,014
There's this bitch
that, uh, works at the club,

539
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,600
and I want her here.

540
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,853
[scoffs, tsks]

541
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,230
[sighs]

542
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,107
Okay.

543
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,359
I want her here as my assistant.

544
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,738
Roy, you know this girl can't even count.

545
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,367
Well, she… She can count 12 inches.

546
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,245
Because she had 12 inches
down her throat last night.

547
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,788
[chuckles]

548
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,000
Are you talking about you, sir?

549
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,711
Who the fuck else
would I be talking about?

550
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:28,300
I'm just saying, you probably
wasn't just the only one in the club--

551
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:32,596
Nigga, I don't give a shit, okay?
Like I said, I want her here.

552
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,390
You cannot bring her in here.

553
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,766
And why not?

554
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,643
Let me hook you up
with a nice Philly jawn.

555
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,811
I don't…

556
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,981
I don't give a fuck
about no Philly jawn, okay?

557
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,108
I want what I want,
and I told you who I want.

558
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,985
-Make it happen. Look.
-You're not listening.

559
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,654
Look, look, look, let me…
let me… let me break it down to you.

560

561
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,119
and I want what I want, okay?

562
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:00,248
Now, Jules, I've known you
for a long time now. A long time.

563
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,169
I like you. I really do.

564
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,632
But please…

565
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,469
please don't forget who you work for.

566
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:16,681
And when I tell you to go get somebody,
fucking do it, okay?

567
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:20,894
So go get Felicia,
and get her here as my assistant.

568
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,065
Copy?

569
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,026
She can't come in here.

570
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,111
Yes, she can.

571
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,364
Don't do it.

572
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,701
Make it happen.

573
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,412

575
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:50,715
I'm about to have her in here
doing some crazy shit. [chuckling]

576
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,468
[snorting] Ah.

577
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,554

-Yeah, this is Mr. Bellarie's collection--
-Yo, is this a Lambo?

587
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,040
Yes, it is.

588
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,501
Mr. Bellarie said you can drive
any one of these, except--

589
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,752
Can I drive this one?

590
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:29,713
Yes, you can.

591
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,716
-Shit, well, where are the keys?
-They're in them.

592
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,927
[chuckling] Shit.

593
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,221
So Mr. Bellarie
must be pretty fond of you, huh?

594
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,681
Why you say that?

595
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,059
Well, he won't let his sons
touch these cars, let alone drive them.

596
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,354
I just helped him out with a situation.

597
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,272
Oh yeah?

598
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:50,358
Yeah, he was getting robbed,
and… and I stepped in.

599
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,110
Is that right?

600
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,779
Who are you?

601
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,283
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm Whitman.
I'm his head of security.

602
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,995
Oh. Okay.

603
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,873
I didn't know anything
about him getting robbed.

604
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,377
Then you must be shitty
if you're head of security.

605
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,796
Well, I'm head of security
here at the house.

606
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,507
I work directly underneath Jules.

607
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:16,968
Oh, that nigga?

608
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,303
Is there a problem?

609
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:20,722
You tell me.

610
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,808
Nah, there's no problem.

611
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,560
You're a guest of Mr. Bellarie's.

612
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,188
I'm just happy you were there
to help him out.

613
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,649
Hm. [clicks tongue]

614
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,444
Yeah. Well, uh, I wanna take this one.

615
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:38,114
All right, well, we'll have it dropped off
at the front door.

616
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,408
Just like that, huh?

617
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,327
That's how Mr. Bellarie does it.

618
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,205
Hm. Do what you do for him.

619
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,581
Mm-hmm.

620
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,883
Yeah, I might wanna drive three or four
of these things, man. [chuckles]

621
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,135
Yo, look at this convertible.

622

[chuckling] Shit.

Damn.

624
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,685
Hey, get the keys for this too.

625
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,520
Hey!

626
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,188

630
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,833
Hey. Uh, no, not yet.
We're about to pull up soon, though.

631
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,750
[Horace] You ready?

00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,046
Yeah.

634
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,466
I wanna give you
a little more insight on Mallory.

635
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,220
She came to see me after you left.

636
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:43,888
What happened?

637
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,933
[Kimmie] She said she wanted
to welcome me to the family.

638
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,476
She brought flowers.

639
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,019
[Horace] That's nice.

640
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,313
[Kimmie] If you say so.

641
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,691
[Horace] You don't trust her?

642
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,067
Hell no.

643
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,193
[Horace] You're smart.

644
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,739

-She's not just a pretty face.

00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,663
-She don't think I know how bad she is.
-I thought so.

648

00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,480
Appreciate it!

704
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,608
[engine revving]

705
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,319
[tense music playing]

706
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,199
[Mallory] Jules.

707
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,412
Yes, ma'am.

708
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,956
[ambient office noise]

709
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,166
Where's Gillian?

710
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,463
Roy had me remove her.

711
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,507
Mm. And you did so without asking me?

712
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,885
Just trying to keep the peace.

713
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,678
Where's Calvin?

714
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,556
-Same situation, ma'am.
-Mm.

715
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,353
So I have some idiot driving me that
doesn't know where the hell he's going.

716
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:20,688
I'm sorry, ma'am.

717
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,776
Jules, it smells like
he washes his body in ass juice.

718
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,945
And you have him driving me?

719
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,530
I can get you a new driver.

720
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,824
[chuckles] This how
we gonna do this, Jules?

721
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,242
That's what you gonna do?

722
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,745
You gonna have these old-ass niggas
driving me around?

723
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,665
Ma'am, this man is highly trained.

724
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,459
Highly trained in what?
Smelling like a fucking trash can?

725
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,044
Is that his talent?

726
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,213
It's good to see you.

727
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,799
And why are you here already anyway?

728
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,801
I'm here to greet the new COO.

729
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,178
Oh, you're here to greet
the new COO, aren't you?

730
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,974
Then why don't you greet the new COO
downstairs curbside?

731
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,016
Mallory…

732
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,893
What, you too good to do that?

733
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,563
-No, I'm not.
-Bitch, I'm the boss here.

734
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,526
So why don't you go greet the whore
that you gave Roy,

735
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:09,904
that's now both our bosses, curbside?

736
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,199
Yes, ma'am.

737
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,868
Coming up here hiding.

738
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,246
Think I'm fucking stupid?
I run this bitch.

739
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,709
I wasn't hiding.

740
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,169
You were hiding.

741
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,514
[music ends]

742
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,350
[pensive music playing]

743
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,060
Attorney Varney.

744
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,148
Well, hello. [chuckles]

745
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,315
Where is she?

746
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,776
She's not here yet.

747
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,570
Oh, she's not here, huh?

748
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,865
-Not yet.
-So she's late.

749
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,367
You know how much I love that.

750
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,121
Well, I'm sure she'll be here soon.

751
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,040
Soon will be late.

752
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,374
[Varney chuckles]

753
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,794
[sighs] And on her first day.

754
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,756
And on her first day, she's already
annoying the shit out of me.

755
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,675
So have you decided on
how you gonna handle this?

756
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,218
Absolutely.

757
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,597
I'm gonna be the sweet, amazing Mallory,

758
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,807
as I vomit in my mouth
every time I look at her ass.…

759
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,894
[chuckles] That sounds
like a perfect plan.

760
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,688
Do you know that she went shopping?

761
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:29,609
-Hm. Didn't know.
-Lau called me from the boutique.

762
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:33,237
She spent $124,000.

763
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,573
That sounds like somebody else I know.

764
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,242
-On five suits.
-Right.

765
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,286
Well, at least you would've gotten six.

766
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,413
You think I'm in the mood for these jokes?

767
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,956
[chuckles] I'm sorry, forgive me.

768
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,417
Dumb bitch,
she even bought all the wrong things.

769
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,753
She gonna be coming up here
looking all stupid.

770
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,673
This is really testing
everything I know about myself.

771
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,009
Mallory, I'm sure you'll be fine.

772
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,636
I will be fine.

773
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,930
Not that it matters, because she's late…

774
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,140
but is everyone in place?

775
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:06,229
Yeah. Everyone's gathered in the lobby
to meet her as she comes off the elevator.

776
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,272
-Gathered in the lobby?
-Yeah.

777
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,525
-What's this special shit?
-[chuckles]

778
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,194
I didn't get this shit when I came here.

779
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,280
-Who the hell told them to do that?
-Your father-in-law sent an email.

780
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,448
-My father-in-law?
-Yes.

781
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,407
He did what?

782
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,118
-Sent an email.
-Uh-huh.

783
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,702
Telling us all to gather in the lobby,

784
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,621
when she comes
off the elevator, to greet her.

785
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,415
Oh, so my father-in-law
sent a new email for his new wife.

786
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,084
-[chuckles]
-Look at that, his new wife.

787
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,877
He's all excited, huh?

788
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,255
-This special shit. Yeah.
-[chuckling]

789
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,173
Is Roy here?

790
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,883
[Varney inhales deeply]

791
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,886
[sighs] I heard he's here.

792
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,056
Mm. You trying to avoid him?

793
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,810
I can't do that.

794
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,937
Is he still messing with you?

795
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,106
That'll never stop.

796
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,486
Varney, let me tell you something.
The only way it'll stop is if you stop it.

797
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:01,117
I don't know how to do that,
'cause I work for the family.

798
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,827
There are ways, Varney.

799
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,664
Okay, well, I'm a student.

800
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,667
I'll remember that.

801
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,960
Is Charles here?

802
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,379
I don't know.

803
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,882
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

804
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,717
-No, I don't.
-It sounds like you do know,

805
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,302
with the way you said it.

806
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,096
I told him he needed
to be here this morning.

807
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,267
Oh. So you nudged him, or you texted him?

808
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,560
-Mallory…
-I'm just say--

809
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,313
Well, just calm down. Geez, just relax.

810
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:35,818
Well, shall we go out in the lobby
to greet your new mother-in-law?

811
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:41,991
Hm. I'm gonna show you how
to deal with trash in the most polite way.

812
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,995
Mallory… [hesitates]

813
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,163
What?

814
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,207
You sure you wanna do this?

815
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,833
This is my shit.

816
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,586
If this bitch wants to come in here
and play with the big dogs,

817
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,588
then she needs to bring her best.

818
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,424
Now go while I sit here and make her wait.

819
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,260
[chuckling] Okay.

820
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,680
[chuckling]

821
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,807
[horses neighing]

822
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,226
[James sighs]

823
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,312
-Um, James.
-Yes, ma'am.

824
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,980
Have you seen Angel and Sylvie?

825
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,149
Well, Angel is out shopping.

826
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,318
And where is Sylvie?

827
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,195
Sylvie's in the stables.

828
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,948
By herself?

829
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,200
No, no. Mr. Glen…

830
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,744
Who the hell is Glen?

831
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,580
He's a stable boy. She's in good hands.

832
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,124
Oh. [sighs]

833
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,420
[door opens, closes]

834
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,340
[scoffs] Damn, these people are crazy.

835
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,678
[employees chattering excitedly]

836
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,054
Where is she?

837
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,931
She's on her way in.

838
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,267
I thought you were supposed
to pick her up.

839
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,811
I got pulled away.

840
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,104
[Norman] Yeah, figures.

841
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,939
Where's Mallory?

842
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,524
Who gives a shit?

843
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,776
[Olivia sighs]

844
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,863
The tension in this room
is as thick as it comes.

845
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,781
Yeah.

846
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,491
I totally feel it.

847
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,495
Keep your head on a swivel. Be careful.

848
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,496
I got you.

849
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,002
You ready for this?

850
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,755
Look, I know you don't know me that well…

851
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,762
[sweeping orchestral music playing]

852
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,763
Thank you.

853
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,142
[chuckling]

854
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,102
Thank you.

855
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,855
Thank you. Thank you.

856
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,691
Thank you, everybody.

857
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,944
Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you.

858
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,282
Welcome.

859
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,118
Don't you look beautiful?

860
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,244
Thank you.

861
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,204
We're all so glad

862
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,541
that you could join us.

863
00:38:58,794 --> 00:38:59,879
Join you?

864
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,380
Yes.

865
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,841
I came to lead you.

866
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,219
Of course.

867
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,473
The bitch has got teeth.

868
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,933
[scoffs] Yeah.

869
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,936
Everyone, this is Kimmie.

870
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,939
She is our new COO.

871
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,817
Thank you. Uh, my name is Kimmie,

872
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,570
but you all will refer to me
as Mrs. Bellarie.

873
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:32,370
All the shareholders are present,
and the boardroom is all set up.

874
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:33,871
[Mallory] Great.

875
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,083
Right this way.

876
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,879
No. I wanna see my office first.

877
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,677
[inhales deeply]

878
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,054
Right this way.

879
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,055
