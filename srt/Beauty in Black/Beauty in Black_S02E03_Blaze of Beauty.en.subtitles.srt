183
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,714
What the fuck was I thinking, man?

184
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:56,012
With you facing your end, I thought
that you would have a change of heart.

185
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,264
[chuckles softly]

186
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,726
Facing my end

187
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,312
has made me realize

188
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,106
that I don't have a heart.

189
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,525
You did.

190
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,527
You used to.

191
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,323
Stop with the bullshit.

192
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,618
You know I know, don't you?

193
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,578
What?

194
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,582
About you and Jules…

195
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,502
laundering money through the club.

196
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,130
Yeah.

197
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,257
I know it all.

198
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:40,222
And I'm enjoying
knowing about all your crimes.

199
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,309
-I don't know what you talking about.
-Yeah, you do.

200
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,103
It's all the felonies.

201
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,106
Which means, my brother,

202
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,234
you are fucked.

203
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,612
All your shares are gone,

204
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,866
and you are gonna be convicted.

205
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,579
Horace, let me say somethin' to you.

206
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,958
Don't you even try it.

207
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,962
[chuckling] Just stop. Just… Just stop it.

208
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,506
[inhales sharply]

209
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,009
Nigga, I can't believe
you thought this bullshit would work.

210
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,764
But it's over. [coughing]

211
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,225
That's right.

212
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,102
I got you.

213
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,313
[chuckling]

214
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,523
I got you.

215
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,234
[laughing]

216
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,487
I got yo ass.

217
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,280
[guffawing]

218
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,824
[coughing]

219
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,035
[chuckling] I got yo ass.

220
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,578
[breathes deeply]

221
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,665
[cell phone ringing]

222
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,918
Shit.

223
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,756
Hello.

224
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,800
You still upset?

225
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,218
What do you think?

226
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,262
[tsks] Look, don't worry
about my brother, man.

227
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,556
Charles, that's easy for you to say.

228
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,599
Look, I'mma talk to him.

229
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,853
Don't do that. Please don't do that.

230
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,397
-It'll just make it worse.
-Nah, I can fix it, I promise you.

231
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,774
-I'm telling you--
-Charles, just don't do that.

232
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,528
All right, so what you gonna do?

233
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,613
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

234
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,490
I'mma do somethin'.

235
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,451
Something like what?

236
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,871
Something to keep him off my back,
and something to make him leave me alone.

237
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,289
That's what I'm gonna do.

238
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,791
Don't count on it.

239
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,627
You should let me handle it,
I'm telling you.

240
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,214
Charles, what the…
I… I just told you, do not do anything.

241
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,425
Leave it alone. Let me take care of it.

242
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,343
Okay. Okay, fine. I'm headed to the club.

243
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,471
Of course you're headed to the club.

244
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,515
Listen, don't hate
'cause I'm living out loud, all right?

245
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,226
I'm not hating
'cause you living out loud. I'm hating…

246
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,061
[sighs] Um…

247
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,230
I'm hating because, uh…

248
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,233
I'm hating because you know I love you…

249
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,904
and you don't give a shit.

250
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,071
No, not really.

251
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,324
Charles…

252
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,533
[knocking on door]

253
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,243
-[Mallory] Varney.
-Oh, is that Mallory?

254
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,369
Oh, shit. Shit, I gotta go.

255
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,412
No, no, don't hang up.

256
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,164
-I gotta go. Got to go.
-No, don't hang up--

257
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,374
Hey.

258
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,876
Hello, Varney.

259
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,336
Mallory.

260
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,838
[sighs]

261
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,967
-[exhales] So I see you're working late.
-Yeah.

262
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:26,472
I missed most of my day dealing
with all this drama and this marriage.

263
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,516
-[chuckles] Tell me about it.
-Yeah.

264
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,934
[inhales deeply]

265
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,393
How are you feelin'?

266
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,229
Feeling good.

267
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,107
That looks like the will.
I see you have it.

268
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,568
-It is. [sighs]
-Yeah.

269
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,820
You find anything?

270
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,989
I've been going over it, and… [sighs]

271
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,325
…trying to make sure
I didn't miss anything.

272
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,786
You didn't miss anything.

273
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:49,787
Well…

274
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,457
[Varney sighs]

275
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,668
Why don't we go to dinner? Come on.

276
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,671
-Oh, Mallory, listen, I--
-That's not a request.

277
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,382
[scoffs] I have a lot of work to finish.

278
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,510
-I got some things over here--
-Including taking me to dinner.

279
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,971
Come on, I don't have a driver.
You can drive me.

280
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,056
[exhales sharply] What about the, uh…

281
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,517
What about the driver
that's out in the lobby waiting on you?

282
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,311
What driver out in the lobby?
That's a non-factor.

283
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,563
Come on, let's go.

284
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,732
You know, if… if you…
you give me a rain check,

285
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,485
I promise I'll take you
wherever you need to go later.

286
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,571
I'm hungry. Let's go.

287
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,949
[Varney sighs]

288
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,744
What you think? [chuckles]

289
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,497
-You look good.
-Thank you, girl.

290
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,833
How you feel?

291
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,418
I feel good.

292
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,919
No pain or anything?

293
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,421
Mm-mm. Not really.

294
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,338
That's good.

295
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,008
Yeah. They took good care of me
in the hospital.

296
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,342
-They really did.
-Mm.

297
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,429
-[exhales]
-I can't believe this.

298
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,307
Me either.

299
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,892
Don't start.

300
00:14:56,353 --> 00:15:00,149
I just find it strange
that I haven't heard from his son.

301
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,984
-Who, Roy?
-Yeah.

302
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,903
He probably scared of his damn daddy.

303
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,321
He is, but…

304
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,033
Kimmie, just…

305
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,077
We've been through a lot, right?

306
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:16,707
I know you used to running all the time,
but can we just enjoy this moment?

307
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,335
It's hard with my sister here.

308
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,086
She's fine.

309
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,421
[tender music playing]

310
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,841
You know, my mama ain't called once
to check on her?

311
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,676
And she knows she's missing.

312
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,470
[Rain exhales deeply]

313
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,221
You know how your mama is.

314
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,099
[music continues]

315
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:39,146
Rain, I need you to help me
to get Sylvie out of here.

316
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,150
-What?
-She can't stay here.

317
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,985
What you mean?

318
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,490
Since she took her early exit exam,
I want her to go to college

319
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:53,160
so she can be in a dorm
away from all this shit.

320
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,372
You sure about that?

321
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,414
Yes.

322
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,292
You know she's not safe here.

323
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,213
-I don't know, Kimmie--
-Yes, you do, Rain.

324
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,342
Kimmie, we just got here.

325
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,927
Nah, for real. Man--

326
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,223
Stop with the bullshit, okay?
We don't have to do that.

327
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:18,310
Put your hood bitch back on.
You know what this is.

328
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,938
It's kind of hard when you look this good.

329
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,023
-I'm just saying--
-Rain, I'm being serious.

330
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,734
Okay.

331
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,569
-Okay.
-Thank you.

332
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,781
She's fine.

333
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,912
I just need you to get her
to not want to stay here.

334
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,163
Help me.

335
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,165
That's not gonna be easy.

336
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,963
I know, but… she'll never be safe here.

337
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,676
I know what you mean. We can…

338
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,139
[sighs] have a talk, and I'll try
to convince her to go to college.

339
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,182
That's all I need. Thank you.

340
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,854
[smacks lips] We're… We're okay, though.

341
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,481
I hope so.

342
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,524
We will be.

343
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,946
You know, I've been thinking,
though. [exhales]

344
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,284
$500,000 ain't really
a whole lot of money.

345
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,494
What you mean?

346
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,830
I don't want it.

347
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:20,873
Girl, what?

348
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,542
-I don't.
-[chuckles]

349
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,295
You ain't never had
that kind of money before in your life.

350
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,006
Yeah, but it's yours.

351
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,299
I want my own.

352
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:35,554
[tsks] You know damn well you not about
to give me that money back.

353
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,181
I am.

354
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,975
'Cause I want the club.

355
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,020
-The club?
-Yes.

356
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,856
-I wanna run that shit.
-What?

357
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,067
But first, I need to find Daga and Body

358
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,069
so I can make them pay
for what they did to me.

359
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,112
Why would you wanna go back to that place?

360
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,989
For the cash. Hello?

361
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,366
That place bring in money.

362
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,827
And I know how to treat the girls.

363
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,371
You need to leave that shit alone.

364
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,832
Kimmie, I'm not like you, all right?

365
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,835
You smart.
You the boardroom type of bitch.

366
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,754
I'm a street bitch.

367
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,547
I want that club.

368
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,466
Well, it's not even Horace's.

369
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,760
But it can be.

370
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,138
-Just make 'em give it to you.
-Make who?

371
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,431
Jules?

372
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:24,103
[scoffs] That's who
I really wanna get at, Mr. Jules.

373
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,106
I don't know about all that, Rain.

374
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,525
Kimmie, just think about it, all right?

375
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,612
I'll think about it.

376
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:37,199
-[sighs]
-But change out of that. Let's go eat.

377
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,200
Mm-mm.

378
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,328
I'm going out.

379
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,539
Where you trying to go?

380
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,748
To the club.

381
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,666
Rain!

382
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,669
Bitch, I've been cooped up
in that hospital.

383
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,963
I'm trying to go out and have a good time.

384
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,715
You know what? You grown. Whatever.

385
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,467
Yeah, I wanna see what's going on there.

386
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,594
-And don't act like you ain't curious.
-I'm not.

387
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,347
All right, well, can I take Alex
to drive me there? You need him?

388
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,016
Yeah, you can take him.
I'm getting my hair done.

389
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,060
Apparently, when you rich,
they come to the house.

390
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,521
[laughing] Okay, period.

391
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,691
But I do hope he got Angel out of jail.

392
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,442
Yeah.

393
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,115
I wonder what they make to eat here.

394
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,324
[Rain] Mm.

395
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,077
[door closes]

396

397

[bugs chirring]

398
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,004
Why the hell you walking into my house?

399
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,132
Didn't you just walk into mine?

400
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:39,219
And the Lord knows
I wish I hadn't. [scoffs]

401
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,846
Well, you did.

402
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,182
[Roy sighs]

403
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,184
Let me ask you somethin'.

404
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,644
You always do.

405
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,191
How long that been going on?

406
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,193
Why?

407
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,529
It's just… I just… I don't know, I just…

408
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,991
I've been trying to wrap my mind
around it. I just don't get it, you know?

409
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,784
-It's just…
-Say it.

410
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:07,289
He a big, musclehead,
gorilla-looking nigga, and just…

411
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,000
you.

412
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,127
-I don't get it.
-It's sexy, ain't it?

413
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,087
-Hell no.
-Whew.

414
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,882
-Hell no.
-You should try it. I mean--

415
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,926
Don't ever talk to your brother like that.

416
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,221
You see, thou protest too much.

417
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,514
What's that even mean?

418
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,643
[tense music playing]

419
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,811
All that money in boarding school,
you ain't learn shit

420
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,104
but how to do drugs and whores.

421
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,065
And what you learn, how to bang dudes?

422
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,485
-Oh, no, I learned that before then.
-See, you nasty. Nasty.

423
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,988
See, I understand now
why Daddy really can't stand yo ass.

424
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:40,989
[Charles] Hm.

425
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,700
Yeah, well, that makes two of you.

426
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,121
[groans]

427
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,916
What's the matter?
You don't wanna smoke it?

428
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,419
Shit, not after where your lips been.

429
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,671
So let me get this straight.

430
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,341
You can bang 10, 20, 30,000 whores,

431
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,636
plus you… you married, right?

432
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:07,432
And it's a problem
if I bang one dude, or a couple?

433
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,351
-Hey, look, why you even here?
-[exhales]

434
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,853
Mm, it's just to make your life suck.

435
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,314
Nigga, my life sucked
since the day you was born.

436
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,024
Well, there's never enough of that.

437
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,901
You are disgusting, you know that?

438
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,903
Are you annoyed?

439
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,364
You fucking right, I am.

440
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,076
Then my work here is almost done.

441
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,412
[sighs] Good thing I got a cigarette.

442
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,038
[scoffs] You're fucking nasty.

443
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,249
Roy, you need to leave
Attorney Varney alone.

444
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,834
[laughs]

445
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,795
Oh, shit, you serious.

446
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,131
[chuckles] And what you gonna do? Hm?

447
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,718
You gonna protect your big-ass girlfriend?

448
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,054
Don't tell me… Please don't tell me
you fell in love with the nigga.

449
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,931
Niggas like you fall in love?

450
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,642
Roy, I'm trying to protect you.

451
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,102
-Protect me?
-Mm-hmm.

452
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,646
Me? [laughing]

453
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,316
You funny as shit.

454
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,695
You need to know that family members
can't kill out here.

455
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,614
But there's nothing in that will
that says he can't.

456
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,450
I wish that motherfucker would.

457
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,244
And what he gonna do?
What… What, scratch my eyeballs out?

458
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,581
He prissy-hissy?
What he gonna do? [chuckling]

459
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,541
You niggas really funny.

460
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,794
I'm telling you, Roy, he has a mean streak
that'll blow your mind.

461
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,048
Little brother, I am not scared
of no nigga that bangs dudes.

462
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,134
Just ain't in me, you know?

463
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,135
[inhales deeply]

464
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,637
Okay, Roy,
but don't say I didn't try to warn you.

465
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:32,392
And don't say I didn't warn you
not to bring his ass back around here.

466
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,602
You got that?

467
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,938
Have a good night, Roy.

468
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,279
Talking about I'm scared of that bitch.
Man, you stupid as hell.

469
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,698
Sure.

470
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,868
It's gonna be all right, little bro.

471
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,162
Tell her I said hi.

472
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:55,082

[Jules sighs, clears throat]

477
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,642
He knows.

478
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,102
I know.

479
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,398
No, no, Horace knows everything.

480
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,441
-We talked about that.
-Yeah.

481
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,069
[sighs]

482
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,447
That fat sucker's gotta go.

483
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,118
[sighs] I'm on it.

484
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,747
-I'mma take care of it myself.
-What is up with this family?

485
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,000
How… Why does everybody
always wanna get their hands dirty?

486
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,753
-Man, I… I need this one.
-Why, Norman?

487
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,507
Look, man, that sucker
is fucking with my shares.

488
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,134
Maybe…

489
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,221
Maybe call him,
maybe have a nice little conversation.

490
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,474
I'm not taking the chance
that I'mma get blindsided.

491
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,978
[Jules] Hm.

492
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,274
What's your plan?

493
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,072
Does he have any evidence on me?

494
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:10,991
No.

495
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,786
-You're sure?
-Positive.

496
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,830
See, you don't know him.

497
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,958
Very simple dude.

498
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,252
Tells his wife everything.

499
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,006
You think she knows?

500
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,549
Absolutely.

501
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,469
He goes and gets a little bit on the side,

502
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,347
he goes straight home and tells his wife.

503
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,349
Like a little bitch.

504
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,022
Well, he was the only one
that would work with us.

505
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,107
Yeah, I got it.

506
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,569
Norman.

507
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,364
Yeah?

508
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,950
Can't be messy.

509
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,706
It won't be.

510
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:04,669
Norman, all you do is loud and messy.

511
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,505
I got it, man.

512
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,176
Remember, he's still a judge.

-Good evening.
-You're taking me out.

520
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,382
I'm sorry?

521
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:54,135
[slowly] You are taking me out.

522
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,845
I'm here for Kimmie.

523
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,181
Who?

524
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,225
Mrs. Bellarie.

525
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,810
Right.

526
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,980
She's staying in,
you're taking me to the club.

527
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,108
-Okay, but I have to stay for--
-Japanigga.

528
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,945
I already don't like nor trust you.

529
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:15,574
Please do not test me.
You do know where the club is, right?

530
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,077
-Yes, I do.
-I thought you forgot that too.

531
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,707
Open this motherfucking door
and take me to the club.

532
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,417
Yes, ma'am.

533
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,459
Thank you.

534
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,798
Konnichiwa, bitch.

535
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,174
[Alex] Mm.

536
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,056
[exhales sharply]

537
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,687
[engine starts]

538
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,107
[rap music playing on stereo]

539
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,825
[scoffs] You know, you're on the Internet.

540
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,493
What?

541
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,829
Yeah, your marriage.

542
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,707
-Really?
-Yeah.

543
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,335
And it's got all these comments too.

544
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,046
I bet. [exhales]

545
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,255
Mrs. Bellarie.

546
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,634
-Mr. Bellarie's on the line for you.
-Thank you.

547
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,302
Yeah.

548
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,721
Hello?

549
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,598
-Hi.
-[Kimmie] Hey.

550
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,641
How are you?

551
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,478
I've had better days.

552
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,021
I'm sure.

553
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,815
Did you get Angel out yet?

554
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,400
I'm… [sighs]

555
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,778
I'm working on it.

556
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,489
Now I know why he's not calling me back.

557
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,241
Yeah. Maybe.

558
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,243
I wanna talk to him.

559
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,789
-He's not up.
-I wanna talk to him.

560
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,460
Sylvie would like to speak with you.

561
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,046
Kimmie.

562
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,756
Just… Just for a sec.

563
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,635
I'm really not up to it, Kimmie.

564
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,011
Here she is.

565
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:03,890
Shit.

566
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,350
Hey, it's Sylvie.

567
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,728
[sighs] Hi.

568
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,689
Okay, so how are you feelin'?

569
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,942
[shuddering] Not the best.
[hesitating] I'm…

570
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,112
I'm sorry, but I… I really need
to talk to your sister.

571
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,864
Okay, but I gotta tell you
about this place I found online.

572
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:24,869
Look, they say they have great success
taking care of people with cancer.

573
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,038
And look, it's in Thailand.

574
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,749
-They also have another place in Italy.
-Oh, okay, great.

575
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,460
Okay, so I'll send you the information?

576
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,129
Okay, okay, um…

577
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,506
Can… Can I talk to your sister now?

578
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,718
Yeah, yeah,
but you're gonna read it, right?

579
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,469
Yeah, yeah.

580
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,055
Um, Kimmie will give you my number.

581
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,766
Okay, great.

582
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,646
He said for you to send me his number
so I can send him the information.

583
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,605
Okay.

584
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,523
Hello?

585
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,567
-Kimmie.
-[Kimmie] Yeah.

586
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,819
Look, I… [exhales]

587
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,780
I need you to come see me in the morning.

588
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,616
Okay. I can do that.

589
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,870
There's a lot we need to go over
so you can be ready.

590
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,540
All right, I'll be there.

591
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,834
Okay, um…

592
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,379
Uh, I gotta go now.

593
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:22,385
Okay. And when Angel gets out,
I'll make sure he comes too, all right?

594
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,303
Yeah.

595
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,096
[inhales deeply]

596
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,556
You do that.

597
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,684
Okay, bye.

598
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,359
You hear me talking to you?

599
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,737
[upbeat ambient music playing]

600
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,533
Don't think you are all that shit.
'Cause you ain't.

601
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,535
I could get another one…

602
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,162
You're not eating much.

603
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,247
Yeah, well, I'm not hungry.

604
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,418
Does this have anything to do with Roy?

605
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,254
I don't know, should it?

606
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,466
He told me.

607
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,344
I see.

608
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,097
But I didn't believe him.

609
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,603
-Good.
-Until I saw that look on your face.

610
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,690
-Mallory--
-So you and Charles…

611
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,359
-Mallory.
-Varney, what… [spluttering]

612
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,861
Normally, I get this type of shit right,
let me tell you.

613
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:26,616
Like, I… I thought about it,
and then… then I was like, nah.

614
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,869
Mm-mm. I said no. But you know what?

615
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:34,499
What got me was when I asked you
to go get a suit for Charles.

616
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,876
Right? Because we all thought he died.

617
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,837
You had a key to his house.

618
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:45,635
And I caught it right then,
the sadness in your eyes, Varney,

619
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:48,471
when I told you Charles had died.

620
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:52,517
Mallory, first of all,
I've worked for this family a long time.

621
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,811
And I needed a key.

622
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,105
-Access to--
-Oh, quit it. Quit it.

623
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,775
You're married to Roy, so I don't come
in your house. But Charles, you know…

624
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,652
And we all thought he'd died.

625
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,820
All right.

626
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,822
And I was as sad as…

627
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:11,160
I should be for someone that
I worked with and watched for so long.

628
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,662
-Mm-hmm.
-And known.

629
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,788
Watched what?

630
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,832
You need to quit it. [chuckles]

631
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,126
Okay? Because the tears
you were crying was like,

632
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,753
"That was my honey pookie child,
love of my life."

633
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,006
-Mallory--
-That wasn't a normal cry.

634
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,132
-Okay?
-Mallory.

635
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,551
-You need to quit that.
-[sighs]

636
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,261
Don't know who you lying to.

637
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,599
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-You know.

638
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,393
[chuckling] Shit,
I just feel great about it. I mean…

639
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:37,896
You do?

640
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,522
I feel fantastic.

641
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,816
Let me tell you why, Varney.

642
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,611
Because when I hit on you,
when I asked you to fuck me,

643
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,196
and you were like, "No,"
I thought something was wrong with me.

644
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,033
And I never feel that way.
I never get turned down.

645
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,076
-So when you said no, I thought…
-[chuckling]

646
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,829
…maybe I was getting old or something.

647
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,458
Come to find out, the D don't pick the P.

648
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,502
[chuckling]

649
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,587
[Varney scoffs]

650
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,590
Why do you look so uncomfortable, Varney?

651
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,675
-Well, because I am.
-Why?

652
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,845
Varney, if you are gay, be gay.
Shit, what's wrong with that?

653
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,223
It's not that. I don't care about that.
I work for your family.

654
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,851
And your father-in-law… Come on.

655
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,896
He's homophobic,
and he says it all the time.

656
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,023
I know. No, that I know. He's homophobic.

657
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,944
Well, if you know that, then you know that
that's what makes it strange.

658
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,112
-[sighs]
-Okay? That makes me uncomfortable, so--

659
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,532
I… Okay, I… I get it.
He's very homophobic, I get that.

660
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,994
But you have to feel good
that you're out now, no? I mean…

661
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,580
[splutters] What do you mean, "out now"?

662
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,499
-You're out.
-Mallory.

663
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,086
First of all, it's nothin' about
being out, but I'm not out.

664
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,505
-Okay?
-How are you not out?

665
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,216
-Well, the family doesn't know, so good.
-Oh, come on, now,

666
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,803
you know, uh, it's a matter of time
that Roy tells the whole family.

667
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,429
He's probably telling them right now.

668
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,807
You know my husband.

669
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,101
He's truly an asshole.

670
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,562
Can I ask you a question?

671
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,816
Why are you with him?

672
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,403
Love, darling.

673
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:10,780
I see.

674
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,700
Nah, you really believe that bullshit?

675
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,828
I'm with that nigga for the money.

676
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,831
And only the money.

677
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:20,748
Well…

678
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:25,253
he's gonna make my life hell
until I figure out a way to help him.

679
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,713
Help him do what?

680
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,924
He wants me to help him
take Kimmie out of the will.

681
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,677
And that's impossible.

682
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,594
Well…

683
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,139
Attorney Varney…

684
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,809
the way you get a devil off your ass

685
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,061
is to be a bigger devil.

686
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,648
As long as you been around this family,
you should know that by now.

687
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,526
You know what? I need to get laid.

688
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,446
Ah, don't even…

689
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,449
[chuckles] Don't even worry about that.
I'm never making that mistake again.

690
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,367
Good.

691
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,285
I just…

692
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,997
I just need to get laid discreetly.

693
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,416
-[chuckles]
-Understandable.

694
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,837
Never mind.
Shit, I'll figure it out myself.

695
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,008
[bugs chirring]

696
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,346

[foreboding music playing]

698
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,683
I wonder who that could be.

699
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,519
I'm not expecting anyone. Are you?

700
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,437
I'm not.

701
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:25,813
Let's see.

702
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,734
[knocking on door]

703
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,320

I'm so sorry to hear about your wife.

713
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,889
Yeah, thank you. Um…

714
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:03,476
Well, we were just having dinner.
Can I add a plate for you?

715

-No, no. I just came to--
-[Gloria] No, mm-mm, uh,

I didn't say anything, man.

[inhales sharply] So…

736
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,869
I have one question.

737
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:04,745
What's that?

738
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:10,209
Is there anything that would create
a paper trail back to me?

739
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,045
No. I swear.

740
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,632
What about to you?

741
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,176
No. Nothing.

742
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,554
[shuddering] I made sure
I was very careful, man.

743
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,808
-That can mess with my shares.
-I know, man.

744
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,685
We talked about that.

745
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,688
So you know
I wouldn't have made any mistakes.

746
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,275
Horace doesn't seem to think so.

747
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,403
No, man. You know better.

748
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,782

It's not who I trust…
