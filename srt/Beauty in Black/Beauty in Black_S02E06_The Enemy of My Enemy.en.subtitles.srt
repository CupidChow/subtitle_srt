00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,801
Seem like this nigga
gonna be asleep all day.

185
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,595
Well, shit, that's all the better.

186
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,013
All right, bet.

187
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,182
Nigga, you on the burner phone?

188
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,392
-You know I already got the burner.
-[Andy] Okay.

189
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,727
Then be patient.

190
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,645
Shit. I got this.

191
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,605
All right.

192
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,696
-[Roy grunting]

193
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:14,702
[Felicia moaning]

194
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,664
[Roy moaning, grunting]

195
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,625
[Roy breathing heavily]

196
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,585
Shit. Mm.

197
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,588
Damn, Daddy.

198
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,468
Come on, get up. Get up.

199
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,802
Get up. Get up.

200
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,055
-[Felicia] Mm.
-Oh shit.

201
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,182
[exhales]

202
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,352
[groans]

203
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,605
Oh shit.

204
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,982
Hand me my cigs.

205
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,777
Ah, shit.

206
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,071
That shit felt amazing. [chuckles]

207
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,073
-So good.
-Uh-huh.

208
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,242
[Felicia chuckles]

209
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,118
[Roy] Mm.

210
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,079
Real good.

211
00:08:59,163 --> 00:08:59,997
[inhales]

212
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,416
You hos wash my dick.

213
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,210
Bitch, hurry up.

214
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,045
Go get the soap and water.

215
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,341
Now you doin' it like that?

216
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,842
Shit, somebody got to.

217
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,678
Uh-huh. [chuckles]

218
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,721
But damn, Daddy,

219
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,516
you fucked the shit out of us.

220
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,268
I know. [exhales]

221
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,895
Shit, I ain't never had it
like that before, baby.

222
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,065
I know. Roy is fucking back. [laughing]

223
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:30,194
[chuckling] You was doing
all kinda shit to me.

224
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,238
I gotta see you again.

225
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,615
[Roy inhales deeply]

226
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,367
What time is it?

227
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,120
-Who cares?
-No, I said, "What time is it?"

228
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,413
Shit, I don't know.

229
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,623
[tsks] Hey.

230
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,166
Yeah.

231
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,543
[Felicia] What time it is?

232
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,545
It's, uh, 3:30 in the morning.

233
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,131
What, you got a clock to punch?

234
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,882
I make the fucking clock.

235
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,636
Mm, I know that's right. My kind of nigga.

236
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,722
Hold on, that shit way too hot.
Way too hot.

237
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,307
-Way too fucking hot.
-Bitch!

238
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,435
[chuckling]

239
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,354
-What?
-You a crazy motherfucker, you know that?

240
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,524
-Shit, she gotta be doing it right.
-Yeah. [exhales]

241
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,401
-Fuck is wrong with you?
-Hmm.

242
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,194
Put the cold water in there.

243
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,197
And don't be fucking it up.

244
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,786
I like you.

245
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,914
-Shit, I like you.
-Well, shit.

246
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,666
[laughing]

247
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,752
[inhales, sighs]

248
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,421
Open your mouth.

249
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,800
You got some nice teeth.

250
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,802
[chuckling] I be going to the dentist.

251
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,471
[Roy] Mm-hmm.

252
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,765
-[giggles]
-I see. Shit. [scoffs]

253
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,894
[exhales]

254
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,481
Do you know Kimmie?

255
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,358
[clicks tongue] Yeah. Why?

256
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,526
What was she like?

257
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,112
That old stale-ass bitch.

258
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,531
Shit, I don't like her.

259
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,327
They say she got hooked up
with some sugar daddy.

260
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,954
Man, I can't stand her ass.

261
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,123
She fucking set up.

262
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,501
She don't give a shit about that nigga.

263
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,628
Wait, you know him?

264
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,632
Fuck you.

265
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,801
[grunts]

266
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,552
Wait.

267
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,845
I'm sorry, Daddy.

268
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,014
I said somethin' wrong?

269
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,476
Bitch, this was yo fault.

270
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,437
Scary-ass bitch.

271
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,525
Why aren't you opening the door?

272
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,652
We can go in the back way.

273
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,821
-Why?
-'Cause you got blood on you.

274
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,614
You can't go in the house like that.

275
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,701
You can come to my room
and change and shower.

276
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,286
Japanigga, you ain't slick.

277
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,206
[pensive music playing]

278
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,632
Watch your step.

279
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,804
[sighs] Shit.

280
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,598
I just moved in.

281
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,060
The bathroom's in here.

282
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,898
There's, uh, some towels and soap
you can use in here.

283
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,362
You've done this before.

284
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,156
Yeah.

285
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,992
That wasn't a question.

286
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,829
I could tell by the way
you killed those people,

287
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,956
you've done this before.

288
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,375
[drink pouring]

289
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,669
I do what I gotta do.

290
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:38,632
[somber music playing]

291
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,926
[Rain exhales]

292
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,557
You know we shouldn't
have let her live, right?

293
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,770
[sighs] She ain't gonna say nothing.

294
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,689
And how do you know?

295
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,820
She's just like me and Kimmie.

296
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,282
We've been through so much shit.

297
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,328
You know what they've done to us.

298
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,624
Yeah, I… I know.

299
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,921
So… she's just happy to be free.

300
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,882
I can see it in her eyes.

301
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,471
I hope you're right.

302
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,473
I am.

303
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,981
That's fucked up.

304
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,902
How much they did to so many of y'all.

305
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,824
How much did you see?

306
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,371
I saw way too much.

307
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,416
Obviously, it didn't bother you.

308
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,344
Just because I didn't say anything,
or do anything,

309
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,722
doesn't mean it… didn't bother me.

310
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:14,019
But you could just walk into a room
and kill people.

311
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,022
I don't mind killing people
that do bad shit.

312
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,150
Shake Shake was doing some bad shit.

313
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,529
So you Robin Hood?

314
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,322
No.

315
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,285
I'm just trying to get
as far away from this shit as I can.

316
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,745
As soon as I can.

317
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,500
Now I understand that.

318
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,052
So you know I'm with you then.

319
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,807
I know you a killer.

320
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,269
Come on, Rain.

321
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,356
What do you want me to say?

322
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,277
I want you to say…
that we're in this all together.

323
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,655
Me, you, Kimmie.

324
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,491
Even Angel.

325
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,330
So you know he's alive.

326
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,334
Yeah, I do.

327
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,421
But speaking about him…

328
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,090
What?

329
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,885
Oh, he hates me.

330
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,931
I… I beat his ass and…

331
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,267
So he's gonna just be talking
a lot of shit.

332
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,188
I can handle Angel.

333
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,527
So you'll let me in then?

334
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,572
No.

335
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,283
This is just a start.

336
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,619
That's all I'm saying.

337
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,831
All right. Well, I'll take a start.

338
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,920
Look, this shit ain't coming out.

339
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,756
I'm just gonna have to go in
when everybody go to sleep.

340
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,175
You want another drink?

341
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,177
No.

342
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,687
[music stops]

343
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,856
[bugs chirring]

344
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,656
[uneasy music playing]

345
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,329
[breathing heavily]

346
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,716
Hey, what the hell you doing?

347
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,594
What's it look like I'm doing,
you piece of shit?

348
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,763
I'm sorry, Mr. Bellarie.

349
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,057
Then get the fuck on then. Go.

350
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,185
-Excuse me, sir--
-What do you want? What do you want?

351
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,187
Your father doesn't want anybody
on the property.

352
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,773
My father doesn't want anyone
on the property. Really? [scoffs]

353
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:10,029
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you rent-a-cop-looking motherfucker?

354
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,115
-I gotta ask you to leave.
-How much he paying you?

355
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,783
Let's not go there, Mr. Bellarie.

356
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,078
-And you the head of security?
-I am the head of security.

357
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:22,458
Ah. And you're working for this bitch?

358
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,377
-Let's keep it respectable.
-Respectful. [chuckles]

359
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,964
-Do you even know who that is?
-None of my business, sir.

360
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,175
I'm sorry, Mr. Bellarie,
but you gotta leave.

361
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,761
Hmm. Well, let me inform you.

362
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,262
She was a two-bit whore that was…

363
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,890
[loudly] …sucking my dick last weekend.

364
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,642
-Mr. Bellarie--
-No, no, no, no, you don't fucking get it.

365
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,852
I need you to calm down.

366
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,396
And now,
she's living in my father's house.

367
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,773
Ain't that some shit?

368
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,194
-You gonna go?
-Fuck you, nigga. You are…

369
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,320
[groaning angrily]

370
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,906
You better be careful.
You better calm down.

371
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,532
Calm down? I don't like you.

372
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,284
-You know that?
-[Whitman] Yeah, yeah.

373
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,535
You don't wanna see me.

374
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,495
-For real?
-For real.

375
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,871
-It's like that?
-It's like that.

376
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,706
Is there a problem here?

377
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,125
No, ma'am, everything's fine.
Right, Mr. Bellarie?

378
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,503
[panting]

379
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,047
Look at you, huh?

380
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,007
And speaking of problems…

381
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,592
[Whitman] Sir.

382
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,886
I'm gonna need assistance over here.

383
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,680
-Looks to me like you the problem.
-[Roy] Mm.

384
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,810
How'd you do it, bitch?

385
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,146
-I did it well, motherfucker.
-Ah.

386
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,732
Now, is that any way
to speak to your stepmother? Ugh.

387
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,110
[Whitman] Hey, let's calm down, okay?

388
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,155
You not gonna be able to talk to him
when he high like this.

389
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,033
You gotta take drastic measures, like…

390
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,119
-pushing him out of a window.
-Hm.

391
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,745
[chuckles]

392
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,374
-You think I forgot about that shit?
-Oh, I know you haven't.

393
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,461
You really think
he gonna protect you, huh?

394
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,338
No.

395
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,174
But he is gonna be pissed
that you're here.

396
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,344
You think I give a fuck about that nigga?

397
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,262
'Cause…

398
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,764
he'll be dead by morning.

399
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,224
That's what you think?

400
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,810
That's not what I think, it's what I know.

401
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,854
And when he is dead,

402
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,689
I'm saving all my piss

403
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,567
to piss on that motherfucker's grave.

404
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,609
[chuckling]

405
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,403
You're disgusting, Roy.

406
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,196
What did you just say?

407
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,115
[dramatic music plays]

408
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:22,870
Hell nah.

409
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,914
He said he gonna piss on your grave.

410
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,125
[Horace] Yeah.

411
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,088
I think he did say
he wanted to piss on my grave.

412
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,507
Don't worry, Mr. Bellarie.
We got this handled.

413
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,759
[sinister music playing]

414
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,969
Hold him down.

415
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,055
I'm too weak to fight.

416
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,766
Take him down and hold him down.

417
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,351
Yes, sir.

418
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,478
-[snaps fingers]
-What you gonna do, huh?

419
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,689
[grunting] What the fuck? Let me go!

420
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,357
-Get down there.
-Motherfucker.

421
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,276
Nigga, show him why I pay you.

422
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,195
My pleasure, sir.

423
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,280
[grunting]

424
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,284
-He's down.
-[Roy] Get off me! Get the fuck off me!

425
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,162
-Nigga--
-Hold him right there. Hold his ass.

426
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,623
-Get the fuck off me! [grunts]
-Hold him, hold him.

427
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,124
[Roy] Shit.

428
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,794
[groans] Ah, shit.

429
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,087
[chuckles]

430
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,339
Hold this, Kimmie.

431
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,551
[Roy] Okay, Pop. Okay. Fuck.

432
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,054
-Okay.
-So you gonna piss on me when I'm dead?

433
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,723
Don't you fucking dare, Pop.
Don't you fucking dare.

434
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:25,891
[urinating]

435
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,352
[groans] Fucking nasty fuck.

436
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:32,272
[groaning] Get off!

437
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,608
Fuck.

438
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,694
[breathing heavily]

439
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,781
You nasty piece of shit.
You fucking bitch.

440
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,783
[Horace] You bring your Black ass
over here again,

441
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,787
and piss will be the last thing
you'll be worrying about.

442
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,414
[tense music playing]

443
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,378
Here. Come on.

444
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,255
[Horace breathing heavily]

445
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,839
[Kimmie groans] Come on.

446
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,508
[Roy] Fuck you, motherfucker.

447
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,719
Okay.

448
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,058
You may wanna take a shower.

449
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,937
[Roy panting]

450
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,233

455
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,538
Okay. [grunting]

456
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,123
All right.

457
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,211
[Horace exhales deeply]

458
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,170
You okay?

459

[Horace breathing heavily]

460
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,965
[Kimmie] All right.

461
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,263

[Horace breathing heavily]

463

Oh f--

464
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,775
Can I get you anything?

465
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,153
No, uh…

466
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,071
James and the staff will…

467
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,199
get me what I need.

468
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,084
[door closes]

[knocking on door]

471
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,552
Who the fuck is it?

472
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,512
[Norman] Norman.

473
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,514
[tsks] Shit.

474
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,893
[Norman] Open the damn door, woman.

475
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,061
Shut up.

476
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,271
[birds chirping]

477
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,900
[scoffs] The fuck are you doing
at my door?

478
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,861
-I need to talk to you.
-About what?

479
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,031
I see you had one hell of a night.

480
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,326
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

481
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,161
[chuckling]

482
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,415
You got drunk at that restaurant.

483
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,000
Shit.

484
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:01,046
It's that stupid bitch
who owns the place told you that.

485
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,340
Did you get the email?

486
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,385
[tense music playing]

487
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,511
What email?

488
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:11,932
Horace wants us to meet our new boss,

489
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,769
and his new wife,

490
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,354
at a board meeting.

491
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,482
And you know
if we don't show up, we get fined.

492
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,317
Shit.

493
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,987
-[sighs]
-Yeah, so I just wanted to come by

494
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,281
and make sure that you were ready to go.

495
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,368
You didn't come over here to help me.

496
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,744
No, I did.

497
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,539
[tsks] Oh, Norman, you so…

498
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,753
I know what you did.

499
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,839
I saw the news.

500
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,800
Harold and Gloria?

501
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,387
-What?
-[chuckling] Oh shit.

502
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,764
I know that was you…

503
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,227
'cause that's the kind of shit you do.

504
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,312
[Olivia scoffs]

505
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,148
I don't know what you talking about.

506
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,482
[clicks tongue] Oh.

507
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:06,111
Norman, don't come over here
playing no games.

508
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,696
I'm not in the mood.

509
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,199
Look, all you need to know
is that it was done.

510
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,869
And you're telling me this why?

511
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,830
'Cause what you think you know,

512
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,248
you wrong.

513
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,503
Norman, I don't give a damn

514
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:27,841
about you running anything
through no strip club.

515
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:31,511
Then why'd you ask the accountant
to ask me for some money?

516
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,181
[sinister music playing]

517
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,516
'Cause I just wanted to borrow some money.

518
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,312
[chuckling] Bullshit. Not that much.

519
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,271
Shit.

520
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,108
You were gonna leverage that
to blackmail me.

521
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,696
Now, what is it? Is it your mortgage?
Are you gambling again?

522
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,907
Just tell me so I can help you.

523
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,326
You don't wanna help me.

524
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:59,331
Look, any time I can help
the enemy of my brother,

525
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,208
it's just good for my soul.

526
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,251
-[scoffs]
-So tell me.

527
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:10,008
You and all your little
stupid-ass games, Norman.

528
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,637
I know you already know.

529
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:19,518
-[chuckling]
-[mimics chuckling]

530
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,978
-I do know.
-Yeah, I know you do.

531
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,189
Yeah, you owe about a million dollars.

532
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,944
See, I knew it was more to you
hiding in that little church

533
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,612
than you just getting right.

534
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,114
I was.

535
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,617
Yeah, right.

536
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,703
So, what you doing now?

537
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,708
Now I am trying to get even.

538
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,005
With who?

539
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,258
Horace.

540
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,803
That nigga gonna be dead in a month or so.

541
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:59,599
Yeah, and here he is
getting that little old girl to take over,

542
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,143
who doesn't even mean anything to him,

543
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,230
so he can haunt us after he's dead.

544
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,358
But I'll tell you one thing.
I can promise you this.

545
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,403
She is not gonna take what's mine.

546
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,823
It don't belong to you no more.

547
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,324
Hell it don't.

548
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:20,203
-You spent it all.
-It's mine.

549
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,038
It's all mine.

550
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,207
It's still mine.

551
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,877
Half of every dime he owns is mine.

552
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,881
-My father put that shit in the will--
-Oh, fuck your father.

553
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:36,011
Shit, he's the reason
we in this position we in today.

554
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,095
[Norman sighs]

555
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,143
Olivia, never wanting to take
responsibility for her own shit.

556
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:49,983
And you are the same lowlife motherfucker.

557
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,069
[sighs]

558
00:26:54,529 --> 00:27:00,452
Now I want you to get your ass up
and get out of my damn house.

559
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,788
[chuckles]

560
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,793
One million dollars. [laughing]

561
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,920
It'll be three soon.

562
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,590
-[chuckles]
-[door opens]

563
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,342
-[scoffs]
-[door closes]

564
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,552
[birds tweeting]

565
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,805
[pensive music playing]

566
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:22,932
Hey, girl.

567
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,810
[scoffs] Hey.

568
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,775
-[sighs]
-You just getting in?

569
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,736
Girl, long night.

570
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,407
-Horace is here?
-Yeah.

571
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,869
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

572
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,748
I don't know. What you thinking?

573
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:51,628
What does that mean for us
if he gets better?

574
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,341
Nah, I wasn't thinking that.

575
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,969
I was thinking, "Bitch, you got a prenup."

576
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,846
Yeah, but if he gets healthy, then--

577
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,600
Girl, you said his ex-wife
is still around.

578
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,228
-And he hate her, right?
-Yeah.

579
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:11,064
Okay. Stop worrying about that shit.

580
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,193
I'm trying, okay?

581
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,448
What was all that noise last night?
Who was that?

582
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,784
Oh, Roy.

583
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,870
[scoffs] What the hell was he doing here
in the middle of the night?

584
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,872
And I saw him at the club last night.

585
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,874
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

586
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,334
He ain't see me, though.

587
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,712
So what was he doing here?

588
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:38,466
Girl, he was having a fit
'cause I'm living in the house now.

589
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,262
[chuckling] As he should.
You need to torture his ass.

590
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,307
And I'mma enjoy that every day.

591
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,350
[chuckles softly]

592
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,437
Girl, did you get any sleep last night?

593
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,731
You gotta go in the office today,
don't you?

594
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,732
Yep.

595
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,152
And you ready?

596
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,447
Actually, yeah.

597
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:05,368
Horace has been setting up
all this shit for me to learn,

598
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,580
and he told me to just walk in there.

599
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,040
-[chuckles]
-Okay, that's good.

600
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,126
[crow cawing]

601
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,085
What's wrong?

602
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,129
Nothing.

603
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,007
You might've did
a little too much last night?

604
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,552
[chuckles] Yeah, that's probably it.
I need to go to sleep.

605
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,345
Okay.

606
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,475
[exhales] What time is Horace leaving?

607
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,769
Uh, I don't know.

608
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:34,105
I wanna talk to him about the club
before he goes. You think that's okay?

609
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,107
Yeah, I don't care.

610
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,275
[sighs]

611
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,903
Uh-uh. What's wrong with you?

612
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:40,862
Nothing.

613
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,616
Something happened
that you not telling me.

614
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,533
No.

615
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,620
[crows cawing]

616
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,663
I'm about to go get some sleep.

617
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,332
Good night.

618
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,083
In the daytime.

619
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:59,756
[somber music playing]

620
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,267
[sighs]

621
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,813
Fucking slob.

622
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,692
Ew.

623
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,445
The hell is… [sniffs]

624
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,405
Oh, this nasty ass…

625
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,491
[tense music playing]

626
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,333
[sighs] Gosh.

627
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,928
[sighs]

628
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,222
Get up.

629
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,892
Get up.

630
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,186
[exhales]

631
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,523
Man, what the hell wrong with you, man?

632
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,566
Roy, get up.

633
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,776
[Roy groans] Mm.

634
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,071
Mallory, it's 6:45 in the morning.

635
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,490
That's when regular niggas get up
and get ready for work.

636
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,702
And everything about you
is regular and ordinary, so get up.

637
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,745
-You know--
-[splutters]

638
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:16,165
Don't shove me, man.
Does anything about me look regular?

639
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,043
-No, you're very irregular.
-Mm.

640
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,546
Very irregular person.
Nothing normal about you.

641
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,382
[Roy chuckles] I know.

642
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,843
-Let me ask you something.
-[groans]

643
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:30,638
How does a grown-ass man
come in this house pissing on himself?

644
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,557
I didn't piss myself.

645
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,894
Well, your clothes smell like piss.
They're covered in piss, Roy.

646
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,485
Roy, did you have one of your whores
piss on you, you nasty bastard?

647
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,280
That's my father's piss.

648
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,160
You know what?
I don't even wanna know about this.

649
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,454
-Just get up and get ready for work.
-[sighs]

650
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:58,416
-And why would I do that?
-Your whore is coming to the office today.

651
00:31:59,042 --> 00:31:59,918
What?

652
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,670
I got an email from your father.

653
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,466
He wants her to meet
the entire staff, today.

654
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,636
-You fucking kidding me?
-No, I'm not.

655
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,804
So get your ass up and get ready for work.

656
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,557
Mm. [smacks lips]

657
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,642
[inhales deeply]

658
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,478
-I guess I'll get ready then. [sighs]
-Yeah.

659
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:22,607
Did you even shower
when you got pissed on by your "father"?

660
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,277
Of course I did, honey.
You think I'd really keep that piss on me?

661
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,863
Then why the hell do you still stink?

662
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,532
Because I lay next to you, honey.

663
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,035
Fuck you.

664
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,412
See you at the office.

665
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,705
[groans]

666
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,667

[sighs]

670
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,632
Damn.

671
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,342
[horse neighs]

672
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:54,973
Oh hey.

673
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:56,849
You like it?

674
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,311
[chuckles] I love it.

675
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,108
Kimmie up?

676
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,526
I haven't seen her.

677
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,319
James.

678
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,947
-Yes, sir.
-Get Kimmie, please.

679
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,366
Yes, sir.
We have breakfast ready if you'd like.

680
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,743
No, I… I can't eat anything.

681
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,161
[James] Yes, sir.

682
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,375
How, uh… How do you feel your chances are?

683
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,713
A lot better than staying here for sure.

684
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,298
Yeah.

685
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:32,844
What is it?

686
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:40,476
I can see something's dancing
in your head. [chuckles]

687
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,519
I, um…

688
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,314
I just don't know how to feel
about all this. You know?

689
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,903
Just stay with Kimmie and you'll be fine.

690
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,281
Well, what about you?

691
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:59,037
I may not be here,
but, uh… Kimmie's protected, and…

692
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,582
I took one to protect you.

693
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:03,833
So I'm free?

694
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,795
Yeah. Free as the day you were born.

695
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,674
And I can leave anytime?

696
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:15,428
Yeah, but I got a feeling
you won't do that.

697
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,221
Why not?

698
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,099
Look around you.

699
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,185
[horse neighs]

700
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,687
And I can stay here?

701
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,481
Yes.

702
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,483
[scoffs]

703
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:32,445
There are cars out in the carriage house.

704
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,572
Cars?

705
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,617
Yeah, they'll tell you
which ones you can drive.

706
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,243
The others are off-limit.

707
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,704
[chuckling] Okay.

708
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,582
But don't touch my fucking watches.

709
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,002
I won't. I learned my lesson.

710
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,589
Although, um…

711
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,927
you can have this one.

712
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,806
[chuckles] For real?

713
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,682
It's cheap.

714
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,144
[scoffs]

715
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,439
You've done enough, man. I…

716
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,399
You've done enough.

717
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,526
Negro,

718
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,863
are you really trying to play
this false modesty on me?

719
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,615
Take it.

720
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,284
Something to remember me by.

721
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,329
But you… you coming back.

722
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,208
I don't know.

723
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,839
I wish I could go with you, man,
but I don't have my passport.

724
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,342
Even if you had it,
you wouldn't wanna go with me.

725
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,760
Save the bullshit.

726
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,845
[Angel scoffs]

727
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,014
[chuckles] No, man.
I'm… I'm really loyal. I…

728
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,851
I appreciate all this. For real.

729
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,687
-Yeah, well…
-This shit is crazy.

730
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,315
Good morning. Hey.

731
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,236
Hi. Angel, uh, give us the room.

732
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,654
All right.

733
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,073
You leaving already?

734
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,117
[sighs] Yeah.

735
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,537
You ready?

736
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,539
Um…

737
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,208
As ready as I'll ever be.

738
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,919
Okay, um…

739
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,547
I'm gonna be on the plane.

740
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,134
Call me and tell me how it goes.

741
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,135
Okay.

742
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,096
And it's all set up.

743
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,349
Attorney Varney will be by your side.

744
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,894
-And remember…
-I know.

745
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,856
Call and verify with the other firm
everything that he said.

746
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,274
Yeah.

747
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,609
I got it.

748
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,320
Okay, um…

749
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,449
I'll see you. Um…

750
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,368
If I come back.

751
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,371
I hope you come back.

752
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,751
I almost believe you.

753
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,796
And remember, get your sister.

754
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,965
I'm working on that today.

755
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,425
Good.

756
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,805
Well, um… I'm about to leave.

757
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,975
Eh-- Horace.

758
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,355
I do hope you come back.

759
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,359

760
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,820
[sighs]

761
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,322
See you soon, man.

[serene music playing]

763
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,793
You think he's coming back?

764
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,671
I don't know.

765
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,465
-[engine starts]
-[chuckles] This shit right here?

766
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,093
-I still can't wrap my mind around it.
-[chuckles]

767
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,595
-Shit, yeah, me too.

[pensive music playing]

769
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,617
Hey.

-Hey, getting up?
-[inhales sharply]

771
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,127
Come on, you should.

772
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,921
Hey, you need to get out my house.

773
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:19,839
Nah.

774
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,509
I don't gotta leave right now. Like…
I'll be quiet. My bad.

775
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,885
You can go back to sleep.

776
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,346
No, leave. [sniffles]

777
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,140
I… I can't. I came with you.

778
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,892
Well, call a car.

779
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,103
-Okay, well, I was think--
-No.

780
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,148
-Go.
-Look, I'mma let you sleep, all right?

781
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,318
-What did I just say?
-You know what? I'mma let you sleep.

782
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,322
Nigga, leave.

783
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,116
Look, I'mma be right out here. You good.

784
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,617
I'm chilling. Lay down.

[door closes]

787
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,499
Fuck it.

789
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:11,015
Ooh, that good shit. [chuckles]

[ominous music playing]

792
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,024
You scared me.

793
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,234
Who the fuck are you?

794
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,362
Dustin.

795
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,572
Dusty?

796
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,656
Dustin.

797
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,493
I said it right. Dusty.

798
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,204
The fuck named you
that old thirsty-ass name?

799
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,330
Excuse me?

800
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,707
Never mind.
Fuck you and your name. Let's go.

801
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,417
And who are you exactly?

802
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,669
I'm the nigga telling you to get yo shit.

803
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,380
Now let's go.

804
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,799
Well, I'm sorry to tell you, but…

805
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,926
[scoffs] …he don't want me to leave.

806
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,346
I don't care what he wants.

807
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,140
-I said get yo shit and let's go.
-[chuckling]

808
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,058
-Come on.
-Hey--

809
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,769
Nigga, if you don't get
yo ho ass hands off of me…

810
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,938
Think that shit works on me?

811
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,315
Know how much this costs?
Get yo little ass out--

812
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,442
-What you doing to me, nigga?
-Shut up. Get over here.

813
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,693
[Dustin] Aw, come on.

-[Varney] Get yo shit. Come on.
-What the fuck?

816
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,368
-Nigga--
-Get yo shit.

817
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,245
Whoa, what the hell is going on here?

818
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,913
I'm putting this nigga out.

819
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,958
I told you to leave.

820
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,126
Well, he didn't.

821
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,545
Varney, I'm not here
for your shit today, okay?

822
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,462
Good.

823
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,214
Get out.

824
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:28,134
You don't tell my guest to leave.
He's staying.

825
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,177
I heard you telling him to leave.

826
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,346
Now that I'm saying it,
you want him to stay?

827
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,015
That's what I said.

828
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,226
You see? You see, that's that bullshit.

829
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,645
You need to get up
and get yo ass to the office.

830
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,355
[clicks tongue] I ain't going in there.

831
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,983
Charles, your father has set
a mandatory meeting

832
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:47,319
for you to meet your new mother-in-law
and greet her at the company.

833
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,239
Now, you know that sound like
a bunch of bullshit.

834
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,117
All I know is that you have to be there.

835
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:54,952
Or what?

836
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:58,414
Charles, there are fines in place
for not showing up to these meetings,

837
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,374
and I know you can't afford it.

838
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,128
Come on!

839
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,423
Get out of my house, Varney.

840
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,430
I don't even know why I try.

841
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,643
I gotta go change anyway.

842
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,771
Why the fuck do I care?

843
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,317
Exactly, nigga, then get the fuck out.

844
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,236
Bye! Goofy-ass nigga.

845
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,613
Shut up, bitch.

846
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,364
Slap the shit out of you.

847

-[door opens, closes]
-You need to get yo ass out too.

848
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,708
-Come on, man.
-No, what did I say?

849
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,877
I got an idea.

850
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,756
-You sure I can't stay a little longer?
-[underwear drops]

851
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,134
That can get you to stay a little longer.

852
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,302
Come take a nap.

853
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:09,193
[Horace coughing]

854
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,402
Are you okay, sir?

855
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,239
[clears throat]

856
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,244
Why the hell
would you ask me that question?

857
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,079
You know I'm dying.

858
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,249
I'm sorry, sir.

859
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,961
Just get me to the damn plane. [sniffling]

860
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:27,878
Yes, sir.

861
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,422
[Horace breathing heavily]

862
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,590
[clears throat]

863
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:35,844
And I need you to keep an eye on them.

864
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,556
-[sniffles]
-Absolutely, sir.

865
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,435
Where did Rain go last night?

866
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,522
She went to the club, sir.

867
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,107
The strip club?

868
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,442
Yes, sir.

869
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,028
Why the hell would she do that?

870
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,156
I'm not sure, sir.

871
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,200
Shit.

872
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,288
You'd think that'd be
the last place they'd wanna be.

873
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,332
I'd have to agree, sir.

874
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,919
They come out of all that shit.

875
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,382
You put them in the lap of luxury,

876
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,885
and their skin crawls.

877
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,888
I wouldn't say that, sir.

878
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:20,889
What?

879
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,433
[hesitates] I'm sorry.

880
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,935
May I speak freely?

881
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,354
What is it?

882
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,567
You live an amazing life, sir,
and you grew up in this.

883
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,111
All we know is the club

884
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,280
and this grind.

885
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:41,577
So are you saying
they won't be able to learn?

886
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,661
No, sir.

887
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,664
Uh, I'm saying they just…
They'll just need some time.

888
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,750
I know that.

889
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,713
Time is a luxury they don't have.

890
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:55,633
Yes, sir.

891
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,802
Keep an eye on them.

892
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,222
I need you to tell me what's going on.

893
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,225
My loyalty is with you, sir.

894
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,518
Bullshit.

895
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,395
Your loyalty is with you.

896
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,814
And don't ever lie to me again.

897
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,733
My apologies, sir.

898
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,195
How much longer?

899
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,740
We're 25 minutes out.

900
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,701
Hurry up.

901
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,078
Yes, sir.

902
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,623
[Sylvie] You know
you were using the wrong fork.

903
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,875
[Kimmie] Hm? What do you know about forks?

904
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,960
-[Angel] I don't care.
-I know etiquette.

905
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,213
Which one? What, this one?

906
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,215
Mm-hmm. Right there.

907
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,300
-[Kimmie mimicking]
-[Sylvie chuckling]

908
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,595
I wish y'all would've woke me up
to at least tell him goodbye.

909
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,597
He'll be back.

910
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,766
You hoping he does?

911
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,602
I do.

912
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,064
-Good. I--
-Hey! Can I get more of them croissants?

913
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,899
-Damn, Angel.
-[James] Yes, sir.

914
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,235
-[Angel] What?
-The man is right there.

915
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,238
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I know you're having breakfast, but…

916
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,489
What is it?

917
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,241
Mrs. Bellarie's here to see you.

918
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,326
I'm Mrs. Bellarie.

919
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,495
Mallory Bellarie.

920
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,873
Oh shit.

921
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,167
Where is she?

922
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,712
She's in the living room.
Shall I have her come out?

923
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,549
Um… Uh, yeah. Yeah, uh, do that.

924
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,508
Yes, ma'am.

925
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,595
Would you look at that?

926
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,555
What?

927
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:28,767
You was waitin' to see her on stage,
and now she here to see you.

928
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:30,728
[Angel] Who's she?

929
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,397
She runs the company.

930
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,816
[Rain] She used to run the company.

931
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,569
Damn. This her?

932
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,446
[Kimmie] Yeah, that's her.

933
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,282
[tense music playing]

934
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,702
Good morning.

935
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,413
[Kimmie] Hi. Good morning.

936
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,331
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

937
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,625
And let me remember.

938
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,003
You are Rain.

939
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,212
Yep.

940
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,923
-And you are Sylvie.
-[chuckling] Yeah.

941
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,427
-And I don't think we've met yet.
-[clears throat] Angel.

942
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,053
Angel.

943
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,765
-Hi, I'm Mallory.
-[Angel] Hey, Mallory.

944
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,434
I didn't mean to interrupt your breakfast.

945
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,852
The setting is lovely.

946
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,479
Would you care to join us?

947
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,606
[Mallory chuckles] Oh, no, no, no.

948
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,316
I have to go to the office.

949
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:21,737
Our new COO will be there
meeting the staff,

950
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,989
and we're all very excited.

951
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,575
Are you really?

952
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:27,701
[scoffs]

953
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,330
[chuckling] Absolutely. Of course I am.

954
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,540
I can't wait to speak with you
and learn a bit,

955
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,794
and hear all of your fascinating ideas.

956
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,214
Well, we'll see, won't we?

957
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,633
Of course we will.

958
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,262
[inhales deeply]

959
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,307
So how has it been here so far, huh?

960
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,476
I know it hasn't been long, but…

961
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,520
It's been perfect.

962
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,104
Perfect.

963
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,233
Perfect is a good word.

964
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,486
So how was last night?

965
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,949
I know the house
can be a bit overwhelming.

966
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,451
It's old and heavy.

967
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,619
Large.

968
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,121
The decor and all.

969
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,289
Excuse me?

970
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,291
My father-in-law, he likes antiques.

971
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,377
He likes old… [chuckles]

972
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,546
…used,

973
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,881
and dark.

974
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,221
Antiques, you know? [chuckles]

975
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,098
The decor and all.

976
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,938
But you seem like a young lady
that likes nice things.

977
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,733
Am I wrong?

978
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,237
I mean, I kind of like it.

979
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,114
[scoffs] You just proved my point.

980
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,116
Men, right? [chuckles]

981
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,785
Speaking of men, how's your husband?

982
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,537
Excuse me?

983
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,247
Your husband.

984
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,040
[Mallory chuckling] My husband.

985
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,877
-You haven't met him yet.
-Oh, I did, at the hospital.

986
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,380
At the hospital?
Oh, yes, you did meet him at the hospital.

987
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,132
-He's well, thank you.
-[Rain] That's great.

988
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,926
Uh, I'm sorry.
Do you… Do you need anything else?

989
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,011
Or…

990
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:13,307
can it wait until I'm in my office?

991
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,058
[scoffs]

992
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,271
Your office? Your office. [chuckling]

993
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,856
I love the excitement.

994
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:21,982
Look at that.

995
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:26,069
I think whatever I have to say
can wait until I get into my office.

996
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,114
Great.

997
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,910
Well, you ladies, and gentleman,

998
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,287
you have a lovely breakfast.

999
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,663
We will.

1000
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,377
And, Kimmie,

1001
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,214
welcome to the family.

1002
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,508
Mm-hmm.

1003
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:55,807
She seems nice.

1004
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,435
[Angel chuckles] Yeah.
She's fucking beautiful.

1005
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,062
Watch your mouth.

1006
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,940
-What'd I say?
-Be respectful.

1007
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,533
This bitch think I'mma deal with
this bullshit. She got me fucked up.

1008
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,536
Where to, ma'am?

1009
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:23,377
Nigga. If you don't know my schedule,
you need to get your ass down the road.

1010
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,922
-Sorry, ma'am, it's my first day.
-Oh, your first day? It's your first day?

1011
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,675
Look at this face.
Does it look like I give a fuck?

1012
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:32,052
Your first day's gonna be your last.

1013
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,137
Now, Jules gave you this job?

1014
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,305
Yes, ma'am.

1015
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,848
Well, look… look at me.

and juices and berries.

Do me a favor.

1022
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,947
Keep the windows down up front
and put your stupid head out the window,

1023
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:52,990
and drive.

1024
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,574
