1
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,688
Why you always at me?
You never talked to me before.

2
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:22,897
[man] We could be friends.

3
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,358
I know he got a safe,
and I know it's loaded. We can take him.

4
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:29,487
Angel must have pissed him off,
because Horace had him killed.

5
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,740
-What?
-And he will do the same to us.

6
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,907
You tried to have me killed?

7
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,076
-That was you?
-No.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,536
We're supposed to be talking--

9
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,621
We're not talking about nothing.
I want to leave.

00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,165
-[tires screeching]
-[Rain] Stop!

11
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,958
Kimmie, stop it!

12
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:43,752
Who is that?

13
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,170
Ah!

14
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,379
[grunts] No!

-[Kimmie] No!

18
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,513
-We gotta get out of here!
-Shit!

19
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,098
Are they coming over here?

20
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,266
[tires screeching]

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,684
[Kimmie] No!

22
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,937
[shuddering] Are they gonna kill us?

23
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,983
[suspenseful music playing]

24
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,902
Going somewhere, Kimmie?

25
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,782
[tires screeching]

26
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,409
-Stop! Stop! You're stuck!
-[Kimmie shrieks]

27
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,619
-Okay?
-No!

28
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,953
No. Just… Just…

29
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,206
-Just let them go. Okay?
-What are you talking about?

30
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,333
-Just let them go!
-[Whitman] Nobody's holding you.

31
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,293
You're gonna hurt somebody.

32
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,336
Damn it.

33
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,588
What the hell's going on?

34
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,132
[sinister music playing]

35
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,884

[car door closes]

37
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,055
Kimmie, what's going on?

38
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:38,932
Angel?

39
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,226
[dramatic sting]

40
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,604
What are you doing?

[dramatic sting]

42
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,943
Oh, shit. I need to lay down.

43
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,695
-Okay. All right.
-[Whitman] Okay, Mr. Bellarie.

44
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,613
Take Mr. Bellarie.

45
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,281
-Come on! Hurry up!
-Open the door!

46
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,450
-[Kimmie] Okay, okay! Okay.
-[Angel] Hurry up! Come on!

47
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,911
Don't worry about the truck.
I'll get the truck out the ditch.

48
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,288
[Angel] Come on! He's really bad. Come on.

49
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,207
-Please hurry.
-[Kimmie] Sylvie, come on.

50
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,834
[Angel] Rain, hurry the hell up!

-Slow down.
-Okay, okay, okay.

56
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,610
You want to sit over here?

57
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,033
[sighs]

58
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,118
What the hell?

59
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,036
What?

60
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,040
-This house.
-This your first time here?

61
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,000
[Angel] Yeah.

62
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,669
Yeah, it's crazy.

63
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,379
[scoffs]

64
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,923
What the fuck?

65
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,886
Y'all wanna tell me what just happened?

66
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,054
So this is Angel?

67
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,806
Yeah.

68
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,099
I thought you said--

69
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,017
-Stop.
-But you--

70
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,186
-That's what she said.
-Well, that's what Ale--

71
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,901
What are you doing here?

72
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,781
I didn't wanna die in the hospital.

73
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,700
You should check out that place.

74
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,579
I am. I'm leaving in the morning.

75
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,207
I hope they can help you.

76
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,541
Yeah.

77
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,251
Me too.

78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,381
But y'all wanna tell me
where the hell you were going?

79
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,134
That's a good question for Kimmie.

80
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,970
-I'm going back to bed.
-Sylvie.

81
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,057
-Sylvie.
-Let her go.

82
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,935
-See you in the morning.
-Okay, wh… what's going on?

83
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,479
Well, first of all,
we thought you were dead.

84
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,816
Apparently, he gave the word to have
the kid killed who they caught in the car.

85
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,154
That was for you.

86
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,617
Yeah. He didn't know it was me,
but they still came for me.

87
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,286
Well, it… it's all over now.

88
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,038
[splutters] Now, y'all wanna tell me…

89
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,791
wh… wh… where were you going?

90
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,586
When I heard that
you gave the word to kill Angel,

91
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,340
I thought surely
you would do the same to us.

92
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,635
So you… you were leaving.

93
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,137
Yes.

94
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,768
You don't believe a thing I tell you.

95
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,562
I have to look out for my sister.

96
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,148
No. You don't believe me.

97
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,528
Is that why you took
the… the million out the account?

98
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,572
-A million?
-[Kimmie] I… I was, um…

99
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,199
You don't believe me.

100
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,493
Horace, you gotta give me a break. Okay?

101
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,120
All this shit is insane.

102
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,580
She's right. This… This house is insane.

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,209
Help me up.

104
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,210
Horace…

105
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,963
-Help me.
-Okay, all right, all right.

106
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,424
Horace. I just…

107
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,096
Shit.

108
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,018
I think he's pissed.

109
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,729
Well, he gonna have to get over it.

110
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,814
[sighs] You should go talk to him.

111
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,525
-No.
-Kimmie.

112
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,904
No, I… It's too much right now.

113
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,115
-It's too late.
-Okay, what's going on?

114
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,950
She'll fill you in. I'm going to the club.

115
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,453
-What the fuck? God.
-Are you serious?

116
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,413
I don't wanna hear that
right now. Okay, Kimmie?

117
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,081
The car is in a ditch.

118
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,958
They have other cars.

119
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,211
-Damn!
-[door opens]

120
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,298
Kimmie, what the hell is going on?

121
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,549
-[door closes]
-Tell me.

122
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,051
I… I… I cannot.

123
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,345
Okay, will somebody tell me something?

124
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,471
[Kimmie] Mm-mm.

125
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,472
Hello, sir.

126
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,974
Who are you?

127
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,643
Oh, I'm James.
James the butler, Mr. Angel.

128
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,686
Okay, well…

129
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,855
Can I show you to your room?

130
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,983
-My room?
-Yes, sir.

131
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,612
I… [scoffs] I got a room here?

132
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,155
Yes, sir.

133
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,450
[spluttering] Yeah, nigga.
Show me my room.

134
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,619

-What?
-[Olivia on phone] Roy.

141
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,891
-What?
-Is that how you answer your mother?

142
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,102
Well, my mother is a--

143
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,437
What? I… I… I dare you.

144
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,688
I double dare you.

145
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:43,444
I will drive over to that house
and burn it down, with you in it.

146
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,489
[Roy] Wait, wait, wait. Are you drunk?

147
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,160
I don't think that's the question
that you should ask me.

148
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,871
See, I ain't got time for the games, Ma.
You drunk. What you doing?

149
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,790
[Olivia] Don't… Don't talk
to me like that.

150
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:59,877
But you know the question
that you should be asking me?

151
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:04,006
-I really don't know. I really don't care.
-What do you think the question should be?

152
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,591
Good. Now I'm hanging up.

153
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:11,139
[Olivia] It should be driving up
to your place any minute now.

[sinister music playing]

155
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,103
Okay, fine. What is it?

[inhales deeply] Uh…

158
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,316
Where's your wife?

159
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,778
Uh, that's a good question. Uh…

160
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,697
Mallory.

161
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,367
Yeah, I don't know.

162
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,285
[Olivia] I do.

163
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,870
Good for you, Mom.

She is fucking Attorney Varney.

Mom.

167
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:47,508
-I just saw them at the restaurant.
-They was fucking at the restaurant?

168
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,093
No, idiot.

169
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,721
No, they… they dropped me off.

170
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,055
Why? Because you was drunk?

171
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,475
[Olivia] Would you listen, damn it?

172
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,687
Now, they brought me home,
but, uh, he… he…

173
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,648
he was opening the doors for her.

174
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,151
Yeah, and every damn thing.

175
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:10,281
[chuckling] I'm telling you, I know…
I know they fucking. I… I can sense it.

176
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,657
Well, he's not.

177
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,495
-I'm telling you, he is!
-You know what you need to do, Mom?

178
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,624
I want you to go to bed, put on
your favorite movie, and sleep it off.

179
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:26,422
Who in the hell you think you talking to
with all the drugs yo ass do?

180
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,591
[Roy] He's not fucking her, Mom.

181
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,889
[scoffs] Fine. Don't listen to me.

182
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,850
And when he takes her from you--

183
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,936
He's fucking Charles.

184
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,106
Hm?

185
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,609
[Roy] Yes. Now get off my damn phone.

186
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,445
Wait, what… Wait, what? Charles?

187
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,364
Yes.

188
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,451
What the fuck he just say?

189
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,287
[suspenseful music playing]

190
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,333
-Some excitement tonight?
-Not enough.

191
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,501
You going somewhere?

192
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,710
Back to the club.

193
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,254
Okay.

194
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,383
[dogs barking]

195
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,018
What are you doing?

196
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,145
Walking you to the door.

197
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,940
No, you're not. That bastard's in there.

198
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,569
-No, it's fine. I'm… I'm--
-No, it's not, Varney. Go home.

199
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,072
Okay.

200
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,032
But are you, like, going home?

201
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:36,993
Yes.

202
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,954
Why don't you go to Charles' house?
It's right down the street.

203
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,832
[sighs] I'm not gonna
talk about this with you.

204
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,333
Varney, you're fucking.

205
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,128
Go to Charles' house.

206
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,923
-So your father-in-law can see my car?
-He's in the hospital.

207
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,968
But what about the security guard?
He'll call him, and he'll tell him.

208
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,846
Were you worried about this shit
when you were fucking him? That's what…

209
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,181
[scoffs] I mean, suit yourself, Varney.

210
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,224
[Varney scoffs]

211
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,144
Go ahead. Go drive all the way to Chicago.

212
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,979
Okay. Good night.

213
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,188
You do that.

214
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,399
Good night. Tell Charles I said hi.

215
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,609
[Varney scoffs]

216
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,865
[Roy] Mm.

217
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,165
[Mallory clears throat]

218
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,293
Where you been?

219
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,004
-With my man.
-Shit.

220
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,298
[Roy chuckling]

221
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,801
Not with that big bitch
that just dropped you off.

222
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,055
-You don't know if he goes both ways.
-Shit. [inhales sharply]

223
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,015
That man is a one-way street. [chuckles]

224
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,224
Whatever.

225
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,976
[Roy sighs]

226
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,519
My mother called. [grunts]

227
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,980
Oh, did she?

228
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,692
She was able to put the bottle down
long enough to give you a call.

229
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,278
-I can't believe it.
-[chuckles] That's a good one.

230
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,406
[scoffs] She was so drunk,
she couldn't even see straight.

231
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,409
Looks like she's back to her old ways.

232
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,620
What is that supposed to mean?

233
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,665
Well, it was bad when I was younger.

234
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,167
Guess the church ain't helping.

235
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,421
How could the church help her
when she gave birth to Satan?

236
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,759
I mean… [splutters] if I was your mother,
I'd be doing crack, heroin,

237
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,511
and… and black tar heroin.

238
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,388
Fentanyl…

239
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,683
Nigga, I would be trying to kill myself
if I was your mother.

240
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,520
Where is… I can't even find…

241
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,773
I just gave away my last fuck to give.

242
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,360
I have no more fucks to give about you
and your bitch-ass, drunk-ass mother.

243
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,444
Mm.

244
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,322
So I don't give a shit.

245
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,491
[Roy scoffs]

246
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,036
[pensive music playing]

247
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,835
-Why you closing the door?
-'Cause I'm about to take a shower.

248
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,297
So I can't watch?

249
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,135
No, you can't. Why do you wanna watch?

250
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,138
So you can get all hot and bothered
and nothing happen?

251
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,141
Hm. You know, I, um…

252
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,809
I always get what I want.

253
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,186
Not with me, you can't.

254
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,149
You know, now that I think about it,
I don't know no nigga that

255
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,443
wants anything from his wife.

256
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,945
'Cause you don't know decent people, Roy.

257
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,530
Hmm.

258
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,116
Now I'm closing the door. Get out.

259
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,246
I said leave the door open.

260
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,915
You know, sometimes,
when you're not a bitch…

261
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,753
you can be quite beautiful. You know that?

262
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,504
You know what?

263
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,965
-I will leave the door open.
-Mm-hmm.

264
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,677
But you know what?
Let me… Let me ask you one question.

265
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,095
Shoot.

266
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,181
[chuckling] Damn,
you beat me to the punch.

267
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,307
[Roy chuckles]

268
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,227
You did, that's the problem, Roy.
You can't shoot or get hard.

269
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,229
You have too many
damn drugs in your system.

270
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,773
-Hm.
-[tsks] Ah.

271
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:58,068
So even if I do leave the door open,
ain't shit gonna happen.

272
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,696
You still gonna be a little wet willy.

273
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,784
Crooked little Roy.

274
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,993
Hm.

275
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,537
That's not what the hos say, baby.

276
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:10,998
Only you.

277
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,709
-Get out.

[huffing] Shit.

286
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,204
You live right down the street.

287
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,128
Nah, hell no.

[inhales deeply]

289
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,508
You brought me
this raggedy bitch. [exhales]

290
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,094
I'll just get my own. That's what I'll do.
I'll just get my own.

291
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,931
Find someone to get me… Shit.

-Shit.
-Who's that?

Somebody I don't wanna talk to right now.

298

[chuckling] Oh! It's your mom. Pick up.

299
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,621
I'm not.

300
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,541
You know she gonna keep calling, right?

301

[sighs]

302
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,253
Pick up the phone.

303
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,379
Shut up.

How you… How you doing that?

311

Okay, Mama, don't make me hang up on you.

-Bye, Mama.
-Who is on the bottom?

[chuckles]

319
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,004
So…

320
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,590
Wanna take me home tonight?

321
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,468
I'm still deciding.

322
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,386

326
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,690
We can go back and do some more.

327
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,652
Yeah.

328
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:49,740

331
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,915
Now, the thermostat
works on a remote over here.

332
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,458
We've also got some towels.

333
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,627
There's a toothbrush
in the bathroom for you.

334

What the hell is going on?

00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,440
Impressive, ain't it? [sighs]

342
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,358
Yeah.

343
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,443
What is this?

344
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,405
[clicks tongue] I married him.

345
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,449
What?

346
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,494
I married Horace. [chuckles]

347
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,081
Wait, wait, wait. You…
You and… and Horace are…

348
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,499
Well-- No, no, no.

349
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,502
He just doesn't want his sons
to get his fortune.

350
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,170
But, yeah.

351
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,132
Nah, hold on. So… So you…

352
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,260
[chuckling] You and Horace
are… are together, or you're a thing?

353
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,303
Okay, so long story.

354
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,390
I married him without a prenup,

355
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,809
Rain is losing her mind,

356
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:02,104
and he wants me to run the company.

[hesitating] Yeah, I guess.

363

What?

364
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,209
I know, it's a lot.
It's a lot. [chuckling]

365
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:29,256
[chuckles] What the fuck is happening?
Is this what I missed?

00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,885
You missed a lot. [chuckles]

367
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,678
Wow.

368
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,931
He hates his sons that much.

369
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,184
He don't want them to have nothing.

370
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,978
[scoffs] So much
that he'll give it to a stranger.

371
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,855
And his piece of ass.

372
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,274
I told you that ain't happening.

373
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,861
Angel, his dick don't work.
You don't even have to worry about that.

374
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,154
I ain't fucking him.

375
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,990
-So cut that shit out.
-Chill-- Relax, all right?

376
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,242
You've done worse for less.

377
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,874
So, what, he gave me this room
'cause you and him are--

378
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,668
He wants you to live here, stupid.

379
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,462
What?

380
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,713
Duh. [chuckling]

381
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,009
Well… So… So we're out

382
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,512
Yeah.

383
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,264
Well, what… what's he saying about this?

384
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,934
I don't know. I haven't talked to him.

385
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,520
Or my stepson.

386
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:29,066
[chuckling softly] Holy shit.

387
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,154
I know, it's… a lot to take in. [chuckles]

388
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,073
So we're living here now?

389
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,993

531
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,498
Him to take it?

532
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,458
No.

533
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,920
Then get your fucking head in the game.

534
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,048
I hear you.

535
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:09,382
No.

536
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,301
You gotta do more than hear me.

537
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,640
The shit I've learned
has taken me a lifetime to learn.

538
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,686
[groans] And if this shit
don't work, then…

539
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,981
[sighs] Then you're on your own.

540
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,818
I chose you…

541
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,365
because you're smart, ruthless,

542
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,741
and calculated.

543
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,120
You can read people. I know that.

544
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,414
That's why I chose you.

545
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,417
But you…

546
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,295
you gotta get yo shit together.

547
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,174
Okay.

548
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:56,471
But if you wanna leave, fucking leave.

549
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,641
I don't wanna leave.

550
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,478
You sure?

551
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:07,816
[shuddering] I just got scared
when I heard about Angel.

552
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,777
They told me that you were the one
that gave the word.

553
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,445
You understand what I'm saying?

554
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,907
I understand that.

555
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,702
Okay, then.

556
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,871
But I gotta ask you something.

557
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,209
How do you feel about Sylvie being here?

558
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,169
[tsks]

559
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,838
She's gotta go.

560
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,464
What?

561
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,466
She's got to go.

562
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,136
[splutters] What does that mean?

563
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,054
I'm… I'm not gonna hurt her.

564
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,764
Oh, I know that.

565
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,976
You see that? That's what I mean.

566
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,272
She's too much of a liability.
You wanna protect her too much.

567
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:54,738
Listen, you can't love anything
or anybody in this seat.

568
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:00,368
You keep what you kill and want.

569
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,957
You worry too much about dying,
then… then… then you will be killed.

570
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,001
This is the game.

571
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,962
Hunter and prey.

572
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,049
[tense music playing]

573
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,302
What are you saying?

574
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:24,559
Look… you, Rain, and Angel
are protected in my will.

575
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:29,731
You gotta get Sylvie somewhere else
until this addendum is done…

576
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,569
and she is added and protected.

577
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,992
Well… I want her to go to college.

578
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:41,951
Good.

579
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,746
[spluttering] Now, that's good.

580
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,289
Get that done.

581
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,834
Yeah. That's the play.

582
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,588
Yeah. Now you talking.

583
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,551
That's the play. Um…

584
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,262
I'm gonna be leaving in the morning,

585
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:06,518
and, uh, I want us
to have breakfast before I go,

586
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,186
if I'm up to it.

587
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:14,693
Uh, I got a book that I… I wanna
walk you through. Uh, get it.

588
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,653
It's… It's… It's in that box over there.

589
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,656
[music continues]

590
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,845
Now, this book will explain

591
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:46,725
how the company is divided
and how it runs.

592
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:55,358
So I understand an organizational chart,

593
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,319
but… what I'm not understanding

594
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,073
is why the CEO and the COO
have the same amount of shares

595
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,326
when one is clearly in charge.

596
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,495
Damn.

597
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:08,955
What?

598
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,001
That's because I was both.

599
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,462
But now that we're married,

600
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,465
you are the COO,

601
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,426
and we have equal shares.

602
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,054
Oh.

603
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,475
What do you know about business?

604
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,353
Just some stuff I read.

605
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,106
Well, shit.

606
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,820
[breathing heavily] Tell me more.

607
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:47,285
Well, okay, so, for one, this research
and development, this is outdated.

608
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,498
[ambient city noise]

609

[grunting]

612
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,180
Looks like the lot's full, nigga.

613
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:11,893
Ah, well, for you, Mr. Bellarie,
hey, we got you.

614
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,479
Don't say my name, nigga.

615
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,897
Sorry, sir.

616
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,982
Uh, we got a spot for you up front.

617
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,400
I don't wanna be up front.

618
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:25,156
Okay. Uh, well, uh, you know, we got
real privacy and VIP in the back.

619
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,742
And what's that mean?

620
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,244
[chuckles]

621
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,914
Look, just go around back, okay?
They have whatever you need.

622
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:33,998
[man] Hey, girl!

623
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,084
I wanna see the girls first.

624
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,087
Well, the best way to do that
is to come in.

625
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,506
Just park my car, nigga.

626
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,633
Yes, sir.

627
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,428
-[woman] Hey, girl!
-[man] Yo, what up, man? Holla at ya boy.

628
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,390
Come on, park the car.

[club music playing]

630
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,768
-Mr. Bellarie.
-The fuck you doing here?

631
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,687
[Alex] Just working, man.

632
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,940
[patrons chattering]

633
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,149
[Roy] Look at that shit.

634
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,277
-Is Kimmie here?
-No.

635
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,072
-[Roy] You driving her, though, right?
-Yeah, yeah.

636
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,448
I'm here with Rain.

637
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,742
-That bitch that was with her?
-Yes, sir.

638
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,743
Where she at?

639
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,829
She's here somewhere.

640
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,498
-Need me to get her?
-Nah, nah. I don't need you to get her.

641
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,793
So this is where Kimmie
was working at, huh?

642
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,503
-Yes, sir.
-This hood-ass shit? [chuckling]

643
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,546
[Alex] Mm-hmm.

644
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,591
She a ghetto-ass bitch,
I'll tell you that.

645
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,176
They got cameras in here?

646
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,636
Nah, just over the bar.

647
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,932
None in the VIP. Niggas film in there,
we break their fucking fingers.

648
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,851
Good, 'cause if I see myself…

649
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,810
You won't, you won't.

650
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,271
Nigga, you'll have
your fingers broken, nigga.

651
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,439
Yes, sir.

652

And I ain't got amnesia.
You the motherfucker that got me served.

653

You lucky your motherfucking legs
ain't broken.

654
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,072
Sorry about that, sir.
Let me make it up to you.

655
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,824
You can't make shit up to me.

656
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,159

659
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,539
[Trackson] That's Felicia.

660
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,583
I can get her in VIP for you.

661
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,043
Do that.

662
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,047
And, uh… get her.

663
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,176
-Definitely get her.

-I'm leaving with him.

You and two others.

-Look, if I get there--
-Nah. Mm-mm.

00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,538
Look, I need pictures.

675

I'mma get you the pictures,
but I know they got a safe.

676
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,004
Think you that good
you can get him to tell you?

677
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,548
I don't gotta be that good.
He over there getting fucked up.

678
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,884
I can get whatever I want out that nigga.

679
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,262
Yeah, all right.

680
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,931
All right, be ready.

681
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,434
Shit.

682
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,813
-[Trackson] What the hell is going on?
-[Alex] He's never here.

683
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,898
-[Trackson] Fucking crazy.
-What's going on?

684
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,110
Man, fucking Jules
ain't answering the phone.

Yeah. Yeah, man.

Shit. Does Jules know?

689
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,995
Well, I told him, and I also told him
that Rain was here.

690
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,663
Yeah, I get it.

691
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,458
I tried to give him a call, but he's
not answering. I guess he's asleep.

692
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,961
-Man, he never sleeps.
-He must be doing something.

00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,775
[sighs] Come on.

883
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,571
You're gonna be looking so good, okay?
Here, drink this.

884
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,573
[baby fussing]

885
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,075
You're gonna be good.

886
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,536
[coughing]

887
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,915
I'm nervous.

888
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,416
[Shake Shake] They all are.

889
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,127
You don't got nothing to be nervous about.

890
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,049
I'm a nurse.

891
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:45,145
[Shake Shake] Yeah, I'm telling you.
You seen me, and you seen Body.

892
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,606
I did all of 'em.

893
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,067
And you just saw Rain today.

894
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:51,986
What?

895
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,531
Rain?

896
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,367
Yeah, she was at the club.

897
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,412
What did she say?

898
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:04,248
[hesitating] I… I don't… I don't know.

899
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,625
-[banging on door]
-[gasps]

900
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,836
-Who the fuck is that?
-I don't know.

901
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,756
-It's Rain. Open the door.
-What the hell?

902
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,718
[dramatic sting]

903
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,220
["The Hottest" by Life's Luckii plays]

904
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,931
[music fades]
