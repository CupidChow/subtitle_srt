1
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,355
I need you to add Sylvie,
Rain, and Angel to my will

2
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,399
so they can be protected from the others.

3
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,443
I don't know nothing
about running a company.

4
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,862
I got the right people in place
that will help you.

5
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,405
-Who is Alex?
-That would be me.

6
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,157
What do you want with him? He's my driver.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,283
Get another one.

8
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,119
[Horace] You should head to the house.
My butler is there.

9
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,455
He's got the place
all set up for all of you.

10
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,749
-What is it you wanna tell me?
-That I love you.

11
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,167
Oh, that. Excuse me.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,668
Why do I fuck with you?

13
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,962
[Charles] Don't you wanna fuck me, Varney?

14
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,631
[Roy] What the fuck did I just hear?

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,717
[dramatic sting]

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,055
[serene music playing]

17
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,891
[birds tweeting]

18
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,851
May I take your hat and coat?

19
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,186
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

20
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,145
Thank you.

21
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,523
Yes, ma'am.

22
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,192
Step in.

23
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,446
[Rain and Sylvie snickering]

24
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,491
[Kimmie whispering]
Just relax. Just relax.

25
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:15,950
This way.

26
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,704
Damn!

27
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,623
[Kimmie] I know.

28
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,709
-Wow!
-What in the hell?

29
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,835
I told you.

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,215
-Uh, this is his house?
-Well, it's your home now.

31
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,761
This way.

32
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,388
Now, this is the dining room.

33
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,475
Mr. Bellarie hasn't had many meals here
since he's been living here,

34
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,311
but he may wanna redo that tradition
now that you're all here.

35
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,146
And what's up there?

36
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,316
Those would be the bedrooms.
Shall I show you to yours?

37
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,735
-Hell yeah.
-[chuckles] Right this way.

38
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,781
-I… I got my own room?
-Yes, you do, Miss Sylvie.

39
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,782
Wow.

40
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,493
-And there's horses?
-[chuckles] Yes, there is.

41
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,830
Mrs. Bellarie,
shall I show you your room first?

42
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,083
Uh, no, let's see Sylvie's room first.

43
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,376
[chuckles] Right this way.

44
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,757
[Rain] Oh. Who's that?

45
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,802
Mr. Bellarie.

46
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:16,928
Nigga, come here.

47
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,721
[tense music playing]

48
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,973
Hurry the fuck up.

49
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,228
I'mma ask you again.
What the fuck did I hear?

50
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,521
Mr. Bellarie, sir--

51
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,022
Don't fucking "sir" me.

52
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,694
I'm having a conversation
with your brother. I just…

53
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,906
"I'm just… I… I…" Get it out, nigga.

54
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,951
-I'm talking to… I'm having a conversa--
-Having a conversation.

55
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,412
I hear that. I'mma hear that.
But I heard somethin' different.

56
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,205
What did I just fucking hear?

57
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,417
You heard me talking to… to Charles,
so I had just…

58
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,171
That didn't hear like no talkin' to me.
Ain't no regular talkin'.

59
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,299
Uh, we just doing some business.
Making sure everything is good with--

60
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,843
Why is your shirt open? Hm?

61
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,387
Can you explain that
if you were just talking?

62
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,889
-I'm hot. Uh…
-[laughing] You're hot?

63
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,515
-You're hot.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

64
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,101
-What the hell is going on in here?
-Look at this nigga.

65
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,978
-Your brother is--
-What you doing in my house?

66
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,731
I'm about to throw up on your couch
after the shit I just heard.

67
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,358
Well, if this can make you throw up,
I got some videos--

68
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,819
-You are disgusting, brother.
-Why are you here?

69
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,825
Okay.

70
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,327
I'll leave.

71
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,749
[door opens]

72
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,793
Shit.

73
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,045
[door closes]

74
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,757
What the fuck? Charles.

75
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,552
He… He never comes here.

76
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,471
He heard everything.

77
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,973
Shit! [huffing]

78
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,394
-Well, good. I mean…
-No, nigga, it's not good.

79
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,190
Look, Varney, you need to relax.

80
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,942
Charles. God.

81
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,986
We needed to stop hiding this anyway.

82
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,450
Charles, did you do this?

83
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,372
Did I do what?

84
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,374
Did you set me up?

85
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,378
This is rich.

86
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:17,590
I'm not fucking around, Charles.
Did you do this on purpose?

87
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,511
No.

88
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,182
Did you send him a text
and tell him to come over?

89
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,934
Didn't I say no?

90
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,397
And I don't talk to his ass
unless I have to. You know this.

91
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,359
Let me see your phone.

92
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,531
-I'm not giving you shit.
-Let me see your motherfucking phone.

93
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,618
You wanna take it?

94
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,873
Come take it, then.

95
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,723
Let me find out…

96
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,811
that you set me up
and you did this shit on purpose.

97
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,397
[tsks] What yo ass gonna do?

98
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,987
[door closes]

99
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,031
[music continues]

100
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,812
Wait. Wait, what?

101
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,439
Is there something wrong?

102
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,274
No, no, it's just…

103
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,819
[chuckling] I… I've never
really had anything like this.

104
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,112
Is this really mine?

105
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,947
[James] Yes. Yes, it is.

106
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,452
Kimmie, this is like as half as big
as the trailer we grew up in.

107
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,370
I know.

108
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,955
[chuckling] This shit is lit, Sylvie.

109
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,540
Wait, and I got my own bathroom?

110
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,793
[James] Yes.
And… and should you need anything,

111
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,045
just press that button on the nightstand.

112
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,547
Okay, thanks. [squeals]

113
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,258
Shall I show you to your room, Miss Rain?

114
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,427
Hell yeah, nigga. Shit, let's go.

115
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,720
[chuckles] Right this way.

116
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,181
[birds chirping]

117
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,270
[tense music playing]

118
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,774
[crows cawing]

119
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,362
[sighs]

120
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,490
[dramatic sting]

121
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,658
[inhales deeply]

122
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,034
Fuck!

123
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,412
I know that motherfucker did this.

124
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,704
Shit!

125
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,879
Who you talking about?

126
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,342
Um. Sir, I was, uh…

127
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,346
talking to the tires.

128
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,641
Talking to the tires?
Oh, shit, talking to the tires, huh?

129
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,853
If I didn't know any better,
it sound like you were talking about me.

130
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,481
Ah, no. No, sir, I wouldn't…
I wouldn't talk about you.

131
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,777
And here I was thinking
that you were banging my wife.

132
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,197
Excuse me, sir?

133
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,407
[groans]

134
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,366
Don't "sir" me, nigga.

135
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,494
I told you to stop doing that shit.

136
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,999
You in there doing that nasty,
disgusting shit with my brother.

137
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,043
I was on the way to go tell my father,

138
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,046
tell him everything,
and then I thought to myself,

139
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,882
"Why even tell him?"

140
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,760
[exhales] Thank you.

141
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,805
[chuckling] Not for you, nigga,
but for me.

142
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,016
Sir?

143
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:58,186
You know like I know,
leverage is everything in this family,

144
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,606
and you just gave me a lot.

145
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,524
See…

146
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,694
they all think I'm dumb,

147
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,404
but I'm not.

148
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,451
You think I'm dumb, don't you?

149
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,955
-No, sir.
-No, admit it.

150
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,542
You can admit it. Admit it to me.
You think that, don't you?

151
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,086
No. I don't think you're dumb.

152
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,838
Admit it, you stupid bitch.

153
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,549
[sighs]

154
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,180
I think you are one
of the smartest people I know.

155
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,182
What you doing,
fucking flirting with me, nigga?

156
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,142
I will break every tooth in your face.

157
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:42,021
No, sir.
You asked if I thought you were smart.

158
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,024
You're lying, just like every lawyer.
Actually, let me back the fuck up,

159
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,610
'cause I smell dick
on your breath actually.

160
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,530
You and my brother are fucking disgusting.

161
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,115
But speaking of lawyers,

162
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,246
this is where it gets really, really good.

163
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,248
You know what?

164
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,376
What, sir?

165
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,506
You about to be my bitch.

166
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,009
Excuse me?

167
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,094
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

168
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,347
I mean, not like the shit
you do with my brother, not that shit,

169
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,057
but you about to be my bitch, yeah.

170
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,646
So you better make sure I'm protected,
and you better make sure I get my shares.

171
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,773
And another thing…

172
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,570
-What's that?
-Get that bitch out of my father's house.

173
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,989
And if you don't do that shit,
I'mma fuck you up for real.

174
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,073
Do you hear me?

175
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,576
-Yes, sir.
-No, Varney.

177
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,081
I said, do you hear me?

178
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,003
-I hear you, sir.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

179
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,796
Nigga, when I say "do you hear me,"

180
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,841
I need you to acknowledge
that you are my bitch.

181
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,594
-[hesitates] Sir, I--
-Say it, nigga.

182
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,220
I want you to fucking say it. Say it.

183
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,682
-Say… Say what? I… I… I--
-That you my bitch.

186
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,273
-I'm your bitch.
-No.

187
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,066
No, no, no.
That's not fucking good enough.

188
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,485
I need to hear it.
I need to feel your energy. Say it.

189
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,906
-I'm your bitch.
-No, that's not good enough.

190
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,618
Look at me in my fucking eye and say it.

191
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,786
I'm yo bitch.

192
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,205
Varney, you a big ass nigga.
You a gorilla nigga.

193
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,791
-Say it with your fucking chest!
-[shouting] I'm your bitch!

I want the whole fucking road to hear it!
Say it again!

199
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,889
Calm down, big--
Hey, calm down, big bitch. Calm down.

200
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,893
Anger don't look good on you, man.

201
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,979
Stop breathing so hard.

202
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,065

205
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,320
You mad?

206
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,155
You mad.

207
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,698
Get the fuck out of my face, nigga.

208
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,494
You know what?
This is about to be real, real fun.

209
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,834
Ah! Lucky day. [chuckles]

210
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,880
[garage door opening]

211
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,135
We'll be in touch, Varney.

212
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,972
We'll be in touch. [chuckling]

213

[gasps]

219
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,585
[shakily] Girl…

220
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,047
Is this real?

221
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,175
[sniffling] Yes, it is.

222
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,969
Well…

223
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,849
Kimmie, it's real, okay?

224
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,476
All the shit we've been through,
this is real.

225
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,396
I hear you, Rain.

226
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,897
We gotta believe it.

227
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,317
It's real. Look.

228
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,861
[James] It is real, Miss Rain.

229
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,197
Look at this bed.
We never had no bed like this.

230
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,824
I know.

231
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,119
Well, the sheets are Egyptian cotton.
I hope that's okay, ma'am.

232
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,706
Yeah, it's just so nice.

233
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,208
[James] Well, only the best
for the Bellaries.

234
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,211
Shall I show you to the master,
Mrs. Bellarie?

235
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,297
-Um--
-Yes.

236
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,548
Show us.

237
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,841
[James] Right this way.

238
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,801
[exhales]

239
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,017
And this is your master bedroom.

240
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,606
And here are your closets.

241
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,943
She ain't got enough clothes to fill that.

242
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,070
[James] Yes, we are aware.

243
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,531
And that's why Mr. Bellarie
wanted you to have this.

244
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,909
[Kimmie] Thank you.

245
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,494
That's a black card.

246
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,578
Yeah, I know.

247
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,330
With yo name on it.

248
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,706
That is your credit card.

249
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,043
And your account numbers
for your debit card are on the back.

250
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,004
So you got your own bank account?

251
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,756
That is what we were instructed.

252
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,674
Okay, then.

253
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,885
-Thank you.
-[chuckling] Yes. Okay.

254
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,596
We can arrange for Alex
to take you shopping

255
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,598
as soon as you're all settled in.

256
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,184
Mm, yes. Yep. Thanks. Yep, please.

257
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,686
You must be hungry.
I'll have lunch prepared.

258
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,607
Oh, and please also have Alex
prepare to take us to the mall.

259
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,858
The mall, ma'am?

260
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,486
Yeah, so we can go shopping.

261
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,072
Perhaps he could take you
to a few boutiques.

262
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,407
You might find that
a little more appropriate.

263
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,993
Oh, okay, that's fine too.

264
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,788
-Perhaps lunch near the pool?
-Wait, they got a pool?

265
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,373
Sylvie…

266
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,457
[James] Yes, Miss Sylvie.

267
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,709
[gasps] Oh my God,
are you guys seeing this?

268
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:59,964
-[chuckles] Mr. Bellarie's favorite spot.
-Thank you, James. That would be great.

269
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,007
It won't be long.

270
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,846
-Bitch, are you seeing this?
-Yeah, I am.

271
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,057
[sighs] Life is finally looking up for us.

272
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,268
-Oh shit.
-I'm not so sure.

273
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,227
Kimmie.

274
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,270
I just…

275
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,023
I don't know if I can trust this.

276
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,067
[scowls] Don't start that shit.

277
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,402
Nah, for real.

278
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,989
All the shit that we've been through.

279
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,827
And it's just supposed to get… easy now?

280
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,372
Ain't nobody say it was gonna be easy.

281
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,374
He told you that.

282
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,550
I guess this shit is easier than the club.

283
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,678
-Hello?
-[exhales]

284
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,179
You need to chill the hell out.

285
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,598
We about to enjoy this shit.

286
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,184
We going shopping today.
Bitch, we going to a boutique.

287
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,604
[scoffs] I hear you.

288
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,105
You need to get with it.

289
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,275
All right.

290
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,904
And you know what else we gonna do?

291
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,532
-Put some cash to the side.
-Put some cash to the side.

292
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,868
See, that's why you my girl.

293
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,038
We gonna put some cash to the side,
'cause when the shit goes left…

294
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,539
We can keep rocking and rolling.

295
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,457
Yup.

296
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,542
Let me see that card.

297
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,377
-Mm.
-[chuckling]

298
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,630
I ain't never had a card before.

299
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,549
Girl, we gonna swipe the black
off this bitch.

300
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,468
[both chuckling]

301
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,012
Kimmie Bellarie. Ooh.

302
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,972

-Jules.
-[Jules] Yes.

306
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,778
I need a driver.

307
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,905
[Jules] I have one on the way.
He's close by.

308
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,281
Where is Calvin?

309
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,492
[Jules] Your husband had me move him.

310
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,868
I want him.

311
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,578
[Jules] Can't do that.

312
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,621
Jules.

313
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,248
[Jules] Mallory, come on.

314
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,793
We got a lot going on.
We need to keep Roy calm.

315
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,253
-[sighs]
-I have a driver waiting for you.

316
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,047
Bye, Jules.

317
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,299
[Roy sighs]

318
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,136
That nigga ain't driving you.

319
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,930
You can't tell me who's driving me.

320
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,640
Well, he's not.

321
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,934
[scoffs] First you think
I'm fucking Attorney Varney,

322
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,852
now you think I'm fucking the driver?

323
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,856
Well, I know for damn sure
you ain't fucking Attorney Varney.

324
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,942
You wanna bet?

325
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,613
What… What you doing? You ain't… you don't
even do that shit right. You just…

326
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,948
Fuck you.

327
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,158
Nah, nah, nah.
I got something to tell you, though,

328
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,369
that even you might not believe.

329
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,329
What is it? I don't care.

330
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,455
[inhales deeply]

331
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,750
Well, it's kind of hard for me to admit
that… that I saw this, but, um…

332
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:45,546
I saw Attorney Varney…

333
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,132
fucking Charles.

334
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,675
What?

335
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,676
Yep.

336
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,513
-You're such a liar.
-I wish I was lying. Shit.

337
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,431
Okay.

338
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,393
It was, uh… horrifying.

339
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:03,188
-It was… Are you done?
-Ask Charles. I'm telling you the truth.

340
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,816
I don't wanna hear this shit.
I'll drive myself.

341
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,028
You know what happened
last time you drove yourself.

342
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,113
You know what, motherfucker? You…

343
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,240
[dramatic sting]

344
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,995
I fixed the shit that you did.
That's what happened last time.

345
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,456
You really killed that woman, Mallory.

346
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,833
Murderer. [chuckling]

347
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,045
[chuckles] Are you done
with this bullshit?

348
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,130
I'm telling you, Attorney Varney is…

349
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,965
-I don't give a fuck.
-…not the way you think.

350
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,592
-Bye, Roy.
-Where you going?

351
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,428
I'm going to go fix this shit
because obviously you can't.

352
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,263
No, I already got it figured out.

353
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,347
[Mallory] Whatever.

354
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,059
Attorney Varney does not wanna fuck you.

355
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,232
[tense music playing]

356
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,360
[birds chirping]

357
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,156
Ma'am.

358
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,283
Who are you?

359
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,660
I'm Andy. I'll be your driver.

360
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,997
[chuckles] Oh, no, you're not. Shit.
Move this damn truck.

361
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,833
-Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.
-Did you hear me?

362
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,587
Move your truck.
You're not gonna be my driver.

363
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,632
Yes, ma'am.

364
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,010
[under breath] Fuck.

365
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,807
[engine starts]

366
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,064
[engine starts]

367
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,412
[line ringing]

368
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,330
Jules.

369
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,790
What?

370
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,583
Mallory won't let me drive her.

371
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,502
-[Jules] Then follow her.
-Yes, sir.

372
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,254
But not too close.

373
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:51,922
Copy.

374
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,424
Shit.

375
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,385
[cell phone ringing]

376
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,220
[horse nickering]

377
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,555
This is Officer Alex.

378
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,931
Hey, man, is it true?

379
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,476
-[Alex] Yeah.
-They pulled you to drive Kimmie?

380
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,019
Yeah, sure did.

381
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,312
[Trackson] I just heard.

382
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,897
What the hell is going on?

383
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,940
I have no idea.

384
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,235
-[Trackson sighs] And he married her?
-Yeah, he sure did.

385
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,987
Damn, man, that's crazy.

386
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,823
-Yeah, I know.
-[Trackson] What does that mean for us?

387
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:18,991
What do you mean?

388
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,450
[Trackson] Our side shit.

389
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,578
You know how much we owe Jules.

390
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,079
Yeah, yeah, I know, man, but…

391
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,623
[sighs] We gotta figure this out.

392
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,251
Honestly, too much is going on, man.

393
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,253
I just want out all this.

394
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,337
Yeah, I know.

395
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,339
You know what else is crazy?

396
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,465
What's that?

397
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,425
Angel is here.

398
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,051
For what?

399
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,637
Lakeland's father-in-law
was in the back of the car Kimmie took.

400
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,931
They caught Angel in it.

401
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,184
Damn, that's kind of crazy.

402
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,352
-Yeah.
-[Alex] Does, uh…

403
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,687
Does Kimmie know?

404
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,397
[Trackson] Shit, I don't know.

405
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,523
[incoming call beeping]

406
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,317
[horse sighs]

407
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,818
Hold on, Jules is calling me.

408
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,904
-Hey, don't tell him I told you.
-[Alex] I won't.

409
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,280
I won't. I got you.

410
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,740
[horse nickers]

411
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,534
Yes, sir.

412
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,620
-Alex.
-[Alex] Yes.

413
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,413
What is going on?

414
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,332
Nothing much, sir.

415
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,793
Alex, are you with me?

416
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,296
-Of course I am, sir.
-[Jules] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

417
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:18,091
Are you really with me?

418
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,593
Yes, sir.

419
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,971
Now, what the hell is going on?

420
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,431
He chose me to drive her, sir.

421
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,434
-[Jules] And why would he choose you?
-I have no idea.

422
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,937
What is that bitch doing?

423
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,813
-She's just in the house.
-[horse neighs]

424
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,899
I'mma need you to stay close to her.

425
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,737
-I will.
-And I need to know every damn thing.

426
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,113
Yes, I got you, sir.

427
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,115
-[Jules] Don't fuck me on this.
-I would never.

428
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,951
'Cause you know where you would be.

429
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,953
Sir, you don't have to say it.
I'm with you.

430
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,331
Something's up,
and I need to know what's going on.

431
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,792
Soon as I know anything,
you'll be the first to know.

432
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,627
-[Jules] Okay.
-[horse neighs]

433
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,878
We'll see.

434
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,964
[sighs]

435
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,549
That sounded intense.

436
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:01,927
It was Jules.

437
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,972
Good. You're not lying to me.

438
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,932
No, I'm not.

439
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,350
What did he want?

440
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,727
Look, he wants to know
what we all wanna know.

441
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,980
-What the hell is going on and why?
-[scoffs]

442
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,731
Yeah, I wanna know that too.

443
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,775
[sighs]

444
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,570
Look, I know you don't trust me.

445
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,448
And I don't trust you either.

446
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,411
And I definitely don't trust Jules.

447
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,581
Look, Kimmie,
there's too much shit going on.

448
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,292
But we're all in this.

449
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,796
You'll have your chance
to prove yourself one day.

450
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,339
Good.

451
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,176
'Cause then you'll know
I want out of all this shit too.

452
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,470
We'll see, I guess.

453
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,598
Oh, we will.

454
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,269
I was told you're taking me shopping
after lunch.

455
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,395
Yes, I am.

456
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,148
Well, let's go.

457
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,484
[exhales] The truck's ready.

458
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,653
[horse neighing]

459
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,155
[under breath] Shit.

460
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,240
[sighs]

461
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,993
[foreboding music playing]

462
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,495
[woman speaking indistinctly over PA]

463
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,621
[monitor beeping]

464
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,706
[door closes]

465
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,623
[Harold] Hey, man.

466
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,251
[Horace] Don't give me
the fucking pleasantries.

467
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,377
I'm sorry.

468
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,129
How you doing?

469
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,256
What did I just say?

470
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,383
I'm sorry.

471
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,677
You're late.

472
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,096
I came when you called.

473
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,516
So you and my brother

474
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:37,230
have been laundering money
at the club for Lakeland.

475
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,399
Horace.

476
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,610
I know all about it.

477
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,944
Get him on the phone.

478
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,197
I ain't in the mood for your bullshit.

479
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,824
Every breath I take hurts.

480
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,412
[exhales sharply]

481
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,541
[line ringing]

482
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,293
This is Daniel.

483
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,503
[Harold] Hey, Daniel.

484
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,213
I'm here with Horace Bellarie.

485
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,132
[Daniel] Jesus, I'm in Paris.
What does he want?

486
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,801
[sighs] Just a second.

487
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,597
[Horace] Daniel.

488
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,265
I heard you were dyin'.

489
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,184
I still got some life in me.

490
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,020
Well, you must, because you know
I don't fuck with you.

491
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,146
[Horace] Well, good.

492
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,400
Because you're about to fuck
with someone that I love,

493
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,193
and that's a problem.

494
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,903
What are you talking about?

495
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,740
[Horace] You listen to me.
I'm only gonna say this once.

496
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:34,788
I know that you and my brother
have been running money through the club.

497
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,706
They're doing it through you.

498
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,209
What… What are you talking on this phone?

499
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,879
[Horace] You know damn well how I roll.
All this shit is secure.

500
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,423
Now, look,

501
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,259
my new wife made a mistake,

502
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:50,470
and she's very important
to what I have going on,

503
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,056
and she's off limits.

504
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,058
So what are we talking about?

505
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,560
[Horace] She took the car.

506
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,396
She didn't know your father-in-law
was in the back seat.

507
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,066
Now, I need that to go away. Now.

508
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,903
Fine. You stay out of my way,
and I'll stay out of yours.

509
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,780
That'll be fine.

510
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,408
But my wife, she's gonna want
somebody for doin' this.

511
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,243
I gotta give her somethin'.

512
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,871
All right.
Harold will be in touch with something.

513
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,955
[inhales deeply]

514
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,123
[sighs]

515
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,667
There's this kid, a gangster.

516
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,212
He was arrested in the car.
He's still at the jail.

517
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,797
That'll work.

518
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:27,924
All right.

519
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,302
Get him released,

520
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,512
and give him to Daniel.

521
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,430
Done.

522
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:38,935
But make sure he knows
that me and mine are out of this shit.

523
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,395
Like it never happened.

524
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,689
Okay.

525
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,774
Is there anything else I can do?

526
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,027
Do you know her?

527
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,862
Know who, sir?

528
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,490
Kimmie. Do you know her?

529
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,533
No.

530
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,618
Harold.

531
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,620
[sighs]

532
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,290
All right. She was one of the girls
that came in front of me.

533
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,752
And you gave her the job
to work at the club.

534
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,046
Yeah.

535
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,965
But I promise, man, I never touched her.

536
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,176
Get the fuck out of here.

537
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,347
And, Harold?

538
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,264
Yes, sir?

539
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,434
Your days are fucking numbered.

540
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:24,898
[door opens]

541
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:27,984
[door closes]

542
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,029
[rap music playing on stereo]

543
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,239
[dog barking]

544
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,281
Damn!

545
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,658
Why you come so early?

546
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:35,700
Bitch, I'm a ho.

547
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,452
She's talking to Felicia.

548
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,830
-[Jules sighs] That bitch.
-Anyway, you got my money?

549
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,924
[siren blaring]

550
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,552
[sighs]

551
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,349
So where my money?

552
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:03,770
Mm-hmm.

553
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,568
Let me count it.

554
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,861
-Girl.
-What?

555
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:12,946
Shit, I don't know you.

556
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,156
I know you don't,
but I'm surprised you can count.

557
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,659
[tsks] Girl.

558
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,078
It's all there.

559
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,664
Mm-hmm. I'm countin'.

560
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,458
[shuffling bills]

561
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,876
Are you satisfied?

562
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,920
Mm-hmm.

563
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,800
-So, what you wanted to know?
-I don't have time for this.

564
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,719
-[Felicia chuckles]
-You know.

565
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,762
Okay, chill.

566
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,307
-I was at the club last night.
-Mm-hmm.

567
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,142
Kimmie was there too.

568
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,520
And Jules told me
to beat her ass. [chuckles]

569
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,438
Jules?

570
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,440
Yep. Mm-hmm.

571
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,191
How does Jules know her?

572
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,735
Jules is our pimp.

573
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,361
[dramatic music playing]

574
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,573
Go on.

575
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,075
Wait, you know this, right?

576
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,243
Yeah.

577
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,245
-Mm.
-Go on, continue.

578
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,080
Jules run the club.

579
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:08,084
We all owe him and… this other dude.

580
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,420
Some… Some judge or somethin'.

581
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,796
What judge?

582
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,048
-Girl!
-No--

583
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,716
Stop this shit.

584
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,718
[tsks] We all owe Jules.

585
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,262
He arrested everybody at some point.

586
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,431
Then we seen this judge,

587
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,932
the judge got us off,

588
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,519
so now everybody
just work for Jules at the club.

589
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,689
Either that or jail.

590
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,982
Okay.

591
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,569
They be keeping most of my money, though.
Ain't that somethin'?

592
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,030
So is this what happened to Kimmie?

593
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,908
-Yep.
-What about her sister, Sylvie?

594
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,202
Kimmie wasn't acting right…

595
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:46,665
[chuckling] …so Jules took her sister
and he pimped her out.

596
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:50,335
[snickering] Oh gosh. That's what she get.

597
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,836
What about Angel?

598
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,757
Uh-uh. You asking a lot
for just three grand.

599
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,635
You know how bad your box
has to get beat up for three grand?

600
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:00,845
Talk, bitch.

601
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,013
[tsks]

602
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,308
Angel a little bitch.

603
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,102
Mm, I can't stand him.

604
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:11,690
He was trying to hide Kimmie's sister,
and Jules found out,

605
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:15,860
and, ooh, they went
to beatin' his ass. [laughing]

606
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,654
Oh, gosh, girl.

607
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,906
Until that old man came up in there.

608
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,282
What old man?

609
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,326
Girl, I don't know.

610
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:28,748
[snickering] But when he came up in there,
Jules and everybody was scared as hell.

611
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,750
He told them to leave,

612
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,421
baby, they all went runnin'. [laughing]

613
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,257
Whew, you had to be there.

614
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,635
Is this him?

615
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,304
Yeah, that's him.

616
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,223
You know…

617
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,811
he old, but he cute.

618
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,605
Shit, he could get it. [giggles]

619
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,066
-Anybody can get it from you.
-[tsks]

620
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,569
Girl, I'm not messin' with you.

621
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:58,653
I'm leaving.

622
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,280
Wait, wait.

623
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,907
You got a nice car outside.

624
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,826
I wanna go for a ride.

625
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,244
[chuckles] Where we goin'?

626
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,538
No, bitch, you smell like
you wanna be alone.

627
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,999
[door closes]

628
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,792
[Andy] So what do you want me to do?

629
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,003
[Jules] I need you to find out
what they talked about.

630
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,755
Uh, I can… I can do that.

631
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:20,341
[Jules] No, you know what, actually?
Sit on this for a second.

632
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,427
Just, uh, stay on her.

633
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,345
Shit.

634
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,848
[Jules] What?

635
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,600
Mallory, she's walking to the car.

636
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,601
[Jules] Who?

637
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,518
[Andy] Mallory.

638
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,272
-[Jules] Ah, shit.
-[sighs]

639
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,940
Open the fucking window.

640
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,402
[dogs barking]

641
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,530
Give me the phone.

642
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,536
Jules, who are these idiots?

643
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,997
If he's supposed to be
following me on the low,

644
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,791
he's doing a horrible fucking job.

645
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,417
Are you a cop?

646
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,169
Yes, ma'am, I am a cop.

647
00:29:56,252 --> 00:30:00,256
[chuckling] The fuck is this, Jules?
You can do better than this.

648
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,842
[Jules] Why are you talking to Felicia?

649
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,594
You and I need to meet.

650
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,263
[Jules] Yes, but why
are you talking to Felicia?

651
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,891
I said we need to meet.

652
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,268
Meet me at the office now.

653
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,853
I got buses at the precinct, so--

654
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,105
Motherfucker, I don't care
if you have surgery scheduled

655
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,816
to save your fucking life.

656
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,901
Meet me at the office now.

657
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,986
[suspenseful music playing]

658
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,452
So, what do you want me to do, sir?

659
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,787
[Jules] If you got a gun…

660
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,123
blow your fucking brains out.

661
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,837
[chuckling] Shit.

662
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,966
-[giggling] We finna do some damage!
-How much is my limit on this thing?

663
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,593
Girl, that thing is black. Ain't no limit.

664
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,304
You got a debit card too?

665
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,889
What bank is it?

666
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:50,849
[Kimmie] Uh…

667
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,227
It's the bank
that the Bellarie family uses.

668
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,521
-[cell phone ringing]
-We gotta go there too.

669
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,024
Oh. Hold on. It's Horace.

670
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,735
Hello?

671
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,653
Hi.

672
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,154
Hey.

673
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,532
[inhales] How's the house?

674
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,659
It's… It's great. [chuckles nervously]

675
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,828
[chuckles] Good.

676
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,663
How are you?

677
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,999
[Horace sighs] I'm alive.

678
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,459
Did you find Angel?

679
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,629
No, we, um, we haven't found him yet.

680
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,840
I keep calling him, but he not answering.

681
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,050
[Horace] So he skipped out on me?

682
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,093
No.

683
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,930
Or, I mean, I don't… I don't think so.

684
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,475
But I'm kind of getting worried
'cause it's not like him to not answer.

685
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:39,522
[sighs] Okay, well, I…
I'll get somebody on it.

686
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,357
You need me to do anything?

687
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,275
[Horace] Nah.

688
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,486
Officer Alex and James

689
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,280
have all the instructions.

690
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,284
Your problem with the car, I handled.

691
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,201
For real?

692
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,538
Kimmie, you still doubt me?

693
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,334
Yeah. [scoffs]

694
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,210
Well, one day you won't.

695
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,587
I'm getting there.

696
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,882
Hopefully it's not after I'm dead.

697
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,634
[scoffs]

698
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,219
Come see me
after you get everything ready.

699
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,641
-I need to give you some instructions.
-Okay, I will.

700
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,600
Bye.

701
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,352
Bye.

702
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,062
What'd he say?

703
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,106
He wants me to come see him later.

704
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,359
He got more stuff to tell me.

705
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,277
How's he doin'?

706
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,279
He didn't sound good.

707
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:29,781
