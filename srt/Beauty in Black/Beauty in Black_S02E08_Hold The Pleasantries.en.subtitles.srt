So this is his work.

6
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,653
Make sure you tell him
where my loyalty is.

7
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,612
Sylvie, right?

8
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,199

-Is he dead?

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,017
-I don't know!
-Is he dead?

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,311
Shit, I don't know!
Who gives a fuck? He was raping you!

22
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,063
You need to get your shit together.

23
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,523
[whimpering] He wasn't raping me.

24
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,026
[horses neighing]

25
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,235
He wasn't.

26
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,780
[sighs] Sylvie, what?

27
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,698

Shit.

32
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,506
-I can't look at him. I can't.
-Wake up!

33
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,425
-We need to call an ambulance!
-No! Sylvie, shut up!

34
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,302
What? Why not?

35
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,471

nobody, okay? He's dead.

36
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,016
-Shit.
-I can't… I can't do this.

Hello.

54
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,906
How was your flight?

55
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,491

I sure hope so.

65
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,389
Can you walk?

66
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,602
Yes, but I'm weak.

67
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,936
Yes, of course.

68

69
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,565

75
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,999
Yes, we did.

76

[shuddering] It's Rain.

85
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,447
-Okay.
-You can't talk right now?

86
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,698
Yeah, not really.

87
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:05,078
I got a, um… A situation here.

88
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,746
Oh yeah?

89
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,998
[Rain] A boy was raping Sylvie, and I…

90
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,126
I pushed him off
the… the second floor of the barn.

91
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,128
Ah, okay.

92
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,507
[Rain] Who you with? Officer Trackson?

93
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,716
Yep.

94
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,802
Shit. [shuddering]

Um…

97
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,892
I… I dragged him on the side of the barn.

98
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,227
Okay, um…

99
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,647
Yeah, I'll take a look at it
when I get back. It's all good.

100
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,898
[smacks lips] Who was it?

101
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,567
I don't know. It was some boy. Um…

102
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,612
He worked for Horace.

103
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,656
Oh.

104
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,033
Yeah, that's not good.

105
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,118
[Rain] What?

106
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,120
Yeah, it's his son.

107
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,955
Whose son?

108

[Alex] Yeah.

114
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,758
Are you fucking kidding me?

115
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,344
[Alex] Nah, just…
But just hold it down till I get there.

116
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,263
Um, we can take care of it. No worries.

117
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,056
[shuddering] Shit.

118
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,643
-Okay.
-Yeah, I'll call you later.

119
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,146
Wait, wait, wait.
I need to talk to Kimmie.

120
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,398
No, no. Not yet. Not yet.

00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,191
Shit. [inhales deeply]

122
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,736

You got this. Talk to you later.

127
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,704
-Who is it?
-[Angel] It's Angel.

128
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,041
-No, it's not.
-[Angel] What?

129
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,585
Come on, Yolanda, open the door.

00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,135
[breathing heavily]

134
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,678
-I…
-What the hell?

135
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,348
-I… I thought you were dead. My…
-What?

136
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,308
My brother said that… Oh my God.

137
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,352
-That you got shot at the bus stop.
-I'm… I'm… I'm…

138
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,394
I'm not dead.

139
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,396
Why would he lie?

140
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,275
I mean, they… they shot at me,
but I'm good.

141
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,861
You sure?

142
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,071
Yes.

143
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,239
Fuck, Angel.

144
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,366
Shit.

145
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,618
Are you upset?

146
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,787
Is this some game
y'all are playing or something?

147
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,954
No.

148
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,457
You're trying to get me to feel sympathy.

149
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,044
-That's not what's happening here.
-Yes, it is.

150
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:19,921
[sighs]

151
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,547
Why can't you just say you care?

152
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,593
'Cause you always cheatin'
with some bitch.

153
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,514
Can you just be happy I'm alive and here?

154
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,519
Where you get these nice clothes from?

155
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,771
I went shopping.

156
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,775
I got some things for you and Junior.

157
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,652
Wanna go shopping with me?

158
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,904
Where'd the money come from?

159
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,323
Come on, girl.

160
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,283
You know I'm on the hustle.

161
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,245
Angel, you got shot behind this shit.

162
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,913
I didn't.

163
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,498
Well, you almost did.

164
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,708
Where'd the money come from?

165
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,211
Don't worry about it. Here. It's for you.

166
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,963
I don't want it.

167
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,383
-Yolanda, take the money.
-I don't want it.

168
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,260
I don't want you.
Come on, you gotta leave.

169
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,720
Why you being like this?

170
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,682
'Cause you came in here
scared to death last time.

171
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,309
You are not about to get me
and my baby killed.

172
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,355
Yolanda… [scoffs] I'm not
gonna get y'all killed, okay?

173
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,649
Get the fuck out, Angel.

174
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,320
I'm not gonna tell you this again,
but I got a gun.

175
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,489
What you doing with that?

176
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,908
Well, you scared
the shit out of me last time,

177
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,702
so I got a gun for protection.

178
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,537
I don't need you no more.

179
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,666
Damn.

180
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,627
Don't make me get the gun
and shoot yo ass.

181
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,379
You ain't got no fucking gun.

[suspenseful music playing]

183
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,761
I don't have what?

184
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,973
Can I at least see my son first?

185
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,018
You can't see shit.
Get the fuck out, Angel.

186
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,982
I can't believe your ass.

187
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,864
[door closes]

188
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,866
[sighs]

189
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,497
Fuck.

190
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,752
What the hell is taking so long?

191
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,794
I don't know.

192
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,047
Well, I'mma go find out.

193
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,673
Give it a second.

194
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,720
He can get pushed
out of a window in a second.

195
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,557
Would you, uh… be angry about that?

196
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,771
Actually, no.

197
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,814
I'll wait a second.

198
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,109
[upbeat music playing]

199
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,446
[Roy groans, sniffles]

200
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,489
Nice.

201
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,242
Masculine, but nice.

202
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:56,786
[knocking]

203
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,787
Come in.

204
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,874
Hi, my name's Marcy.
I'll be one of your assistants.

205
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,668
May I take your coat and purse, please?

206
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,836
[Kimmie] Thank you.

207
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,589
Thank you.

208
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,135
[Roy sighs]

209
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,974
Drinking on the job, I see.

210
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,101
[Roy sighs, grunts]

211
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,936
Hm. You know what?

212
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,397
Keep it up.

213
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,775
It'll make it easier for me to fire you.

214
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,485
[chuckles]

215
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,073
You can't fucking fire me.

216
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,951
You wanna bet?

217
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,037
Look, I know
you feeling yourself right now,

218
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,959
but let me tell you one more time, bitch,
you won't and can't fire me.

219
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,713
Bitch?

220
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,756
Did I stutter?

221
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,801
Who's a bitch?

222
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:55,886
You a bitch.

223
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,764
I know… I know you not talking about me.

224
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,727
I do think…

225
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:09,275
I'm gonna make you… my bitch.

226
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,235
Your bitch?

227
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,988
You ain't gonna do shit, Kimmie.

228
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,117
I have been spending

229
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,873
hours on hours with your father…

230
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,461
to learn exactly what I need
to do just that.

231
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,382
And by the way, he is better
in bed than you. Much better.

232
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,552
Apparently, he's…

233
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,764
better at everything.

234
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:47,813
So that, coupled with the fact
that you're impotent…

235
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,273
Oops. [scoffs]

236
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,151
I meant "incompetent."

237
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,155
But really, you could pick either one,
'cause they both apply.

238
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,910
…yo weak ass just makes it
that much easier for me.

239
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,952
Hmm.

240
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,915
Bitch, I'm gonna make
your life a living hell.

241
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,628
Love the new you.
This confidence looks good on you.

242
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,754
You know that?

243
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,215
Keep talking shit.

244
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,136
'Cause you ain't gonna do a fucking thing.

245
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,515
Careful.

246
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,810
There's windows all around this building,

247
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,187
with no balcony to catch you.

248
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,857
So you got jokes now? Hm.

249
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,360
This new Kimmie is, uh…

250
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,529
is different.

251
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,156
I'm not fucking joking.

252
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,617
Hm.

253
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,414
-We shall see.
-[footsteps approaching]

254
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,082
We'll see what you do.

00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,501
[door opens]

257
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,003
Did I say you can come in?

258
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,590
[Mallory] I'm sorry.

259
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,052
I came to tell you that we're waiting
in the conference room for you.

260
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,595
Step the fuck out.

261
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,013
[dramatic music playing]

262
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,850
[Roy] Mm.

263
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,728
[scoffs] Pardon me?

264
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,525
What do you not understand
about "step the fuck out"?

265
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,695
[tense music playing]

266
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,325
It's pretty simple.

267
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,414
Of course.

268
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:30,833
Of course.

269
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,628

[footsteps recede]

271
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,926
How long does this bitch
expect me to wait for her?

272
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,680
Why don't you just sit here and relax?

273
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,057
You know I'm not doing this.

274
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,059
Olivia, just…

275
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,645
Perhaps I can go check for you.

276
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,818
Your hips may swing faster than mine,

277
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,697
but I am more of a man than you are.

-What the hell did you do to her?
-[door closes]

282

Sir?

283
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,759
Oh.

284
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,346
She tried to fuck you.

285
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,474
Excuse me?

286
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,227
[chuckles]

287
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,104
Yeah. Yeah, she tried to fuck you.

288
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:38,108
You know, if you turn her down,
you become her enemy.

289
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,110
You should've asked me.

290
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,614
But you should've tapped that ass.

291
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,075
[chuckling]

292
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,913
Speaking of tapping asses…

293
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,500
Don't fuck with me, Uncle.
I am not in the mood.

294
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,877
That's not what the men say.

295
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,005
Attorney Varney, I need to talk to you.

296
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,133
The meeting is getting ready--

297
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,511
Attorney Varney,
I need to talk to you now!

Now.

[music fades]

303
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,405
Are you gonna go see
what that bitch wants?

304
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,450
The meeting is getting ready
to start, sir.

305
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,996
Shit. This meeting
ain't hardly about to start.

306
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,164
She's in there stalling, my man.

307
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,669
I guarantee you
my brother told her to make us wait

308
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,046
just to fuck with us.

309
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,133
They don't know what the fuck they doing.

310
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,638
Well, as I said, I'm good here.

[Norman snickering]

313
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,271
You better go see
what that little bitch wants.

314
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,364
What happened in there?

315
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,533
[Olivia] What is taking so long?

316
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,913
Do you not hear me talking to you, Jules?

317
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,291
-Yes, Miss Olivia.
-What is taking so long?

318
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,251
She wanted to talk to Roy.

319
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,628
Why?

320
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,795
I don't know.

321
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,172
Where are they?

322
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,924
In her office.

323
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,800
Her office?

324
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,970
Mr. Bellarie's office.

325
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,599
[chuckling] I am not dealing
with this shit.

326
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,396
I made you come in here…

327
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,816
'cause I wanted to tell you something.

328
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,902
[tense music playing]

329
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:50,991
I really am a nice, caring, loving person.

330
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,497
But all the shit that I've been through…

331
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,000
has made me a motherfucker.

332
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,756
And I owe you…

333
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,551
as a big part…

334
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,388
in the shit that…

335
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,849
not only happened to me…

336
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,144
but my sister.

337
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,398
And now…

338
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,025
every time I see you…

339
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,321
you trigger me.

340
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,452
And I said all this to say…

341
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,831
I promise…

342
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,626
you will regret the day…

343
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,630
that you've ever crossed me.

344
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,677
Hm.

345
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,015
Are you done?

346

[music intensifies]

347
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,977
I'm only beginning.

[scoffs]

349
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,482
You see…

350
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,902
Kimmie, the thing about a, uh…

351
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:11,905
a threat…

352
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,202
is you better be ready to back it up.

353
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,291
You damn sure better know I'm ready.

354
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,959
[door opens]

355
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,461
Excuse me.

356
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,337
I'm in a meeting right now.

357
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,175
Well, actually, dear,
the meeting is down the hall,

358
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,135
and we are all waiting for you.

359
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,472
And?

360
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,807
Excuse me?

361
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,102
I said I'm in a meeting right now.

362
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,355
Roy, go to the meeting.

363
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,857
[Kimmie] Roy, don't go anywhere.

364
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,317
I'm your boss.

365
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,528
Roy, go to the meeting now.

366
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,823
We're not done, Roy.

367
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,210
No, you're done now.

368
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,754
I have a lot to do today,

369
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:13,092
and I really don't have time
for this drama, young lady.

370
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,844
Now, you need to get to this meeting.

371
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,056
So you gonna try me too?

372
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,102
[scoffs] Um, I'm sorry.

373
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,646
We haven't officially met.

374
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,856
I'm Olivia.

375
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,651
And I know that you are new here,

376
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:35,739
but I am the original bitch.

377
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,701
Now, the thing about the original bitch

378
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,579
is that she is at the foundation.

379
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:49,044
And the thing about the foundation
is that it holds everything up.

380
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:54,550
So you see, if the foundation
shakes or gives way,

381
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,262
the entire building comes down.

382
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,644
You are making me unstable.

383
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,691
And in my mind, that is
a dangerous place to be, little girl.

384
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,069
Now, I promise you…

385
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,447
I know where all the bodies are buried.

386
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:22,411
And this new lifestyle
that you think you have

387
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,623
will be at your feet in ashes.

388
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,792
Now…

389
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,962
let's start this again.

390
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,967
I'm Olivia, and I'm here for a meeting.

391
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,845
So perhaps we should start now?

392
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,142
[laughing]

393
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,060
Hm? Something funny, dear?

394
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,688
Ah. [chuckling]

395
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,149
Yes, very much so.

396
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,692
-And what would that be?
-[sighs]

397
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,987
Mm. [chuckles]

398
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,617
[spluttering] So,
my husband, he… [chuckles]

399
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,410
…he told me all about you guys,

400
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,246
and he could have wrote
that monologue down to a T.

401
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,998
[chuckling] Thank you for that.

402
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,917
Thank me?

403
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,793
Yes, thank you.

404
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,172
I was just testing you, you see.

405
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,883
And so far,

406
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,802
all of you have been

407
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,515
just as predictable as my husband says.

408
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,059
Your husband?

409
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,810
My husband.

410
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:33,023
Mm. Careful, little girl.

411
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,233
Ah, yes.

412
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,569
Careful.

413
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,738
That's right.

414
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,585
[music stops]

415
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,003
Jules. Jules.

416
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,130
[ambient office noise]

417
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,597
Hey, I need to… I need to talk to you.

418
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,974
What is it?

419
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,308
[tense music playing]

420
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,728
I, um… I… I got a problem. Um…

421
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,899
You need to be in that meeting.

422
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,985
[whispering] This is serious.

423
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,570
More important than that meeting?

424
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,243
I need to know if I can trust you.

425
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,912
How long I been
taking care of this family?

426
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,622
And you gonna ask me that question?

427
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,457
Yes, and that's the problem.

428
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,044
Okay, what is it?

429
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,424
Okay, I, um…

430
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,097
Never mind.

431
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,599
Charles…

432
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,186
Never mind.

433
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:54,980
Charles.

434
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,815
[footsteps receding rapidly]

435
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,692
[footsteps slowly approaching]

436
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,907
What's that all about?

437
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,243
I don't know.

438
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,997
Usually, he's not
the drugged-up, paranoid one.

439
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,624
Yeah. [chuckles] I know which one that is.

440
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,917
Yeah, we all do.

441
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,796
Mrs. Bellarie.

442
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,635
Jules.

443
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,139
How are you?

444
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:31,975
I'm incredible.

445
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,271
Yes. I can see that.

446
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,484
After I'm done,
I wanna see you in my office.

447
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,319
Of course.

448
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,696
Long time coming.

449
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,199
Yes…

450
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,701
it is.

451
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,667
You know what?

452
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,630
Get the fucking door for me.

453
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,383
Yes, ma'am.

454
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,557
[tense music building]

455
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,728
[Mallory] So…

456
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,397
So you just gonna ignore me?

457
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:24,069
-Charles, I am trying--
-You're being a little bitch.

458
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,529
Not today, Charles.

459
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,700
-I needed you.
-Just like all the times I needed you.

460
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:35,205
Well… we are all here.

461
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,915
Let's do this.

462
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,127
[pensive music playing]

463
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,341
Man, you know this is some shit, right?

464
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,385
-Who you telling?
-[sighs]

465
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,637
I got money on Kimmie.

466
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,763
What?

467
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,516
-I don't know, man.
-Don't say no shit like that.

468
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,477
Jules already looking at you sideways.

469
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,480
You know this is all a game.

470
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,065
Yeah, I know, but shit, man.

471
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,525
Look, so who you got?

472
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,152
Not no damn Kimmie.

473
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,779
-[scoffs]
-Okay.

474
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,699
-Let's put a hundred on it.
-I'll take the old bitch.

475
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,618
-Olivia?
-Hell yeah.

476
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,456
That's actually a good bet.

477
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,999
You know I'd fuck her, right?

478
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:20,917
What?

479
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,752
[chuckling] Look at her. She fine as hell.

480
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,130
Damn. [scoffs]

481
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,593
-I've been trying to get her attention.
-You better try harder.

482
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,678
Ah, man, she ain't trying to holla at me.

483
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,890
I did not know you were into older women.

484
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,726
Yeah. For their money. [snickers]

485
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,060
[Alex sighs]

486
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,272
Is somebody gonna get this chair for me?

487
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,900
[tense music playing]

488
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,364
[Varney sighs]

489
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,991
Thank you.

490
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,668
So… welcome to the company.

491
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,923
We are so excited
to have you lead and join us.

492
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,092
Mr. Bellarie's asked us to prepare
the state of the company for you.

493
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,595
We did just that.
Would you like to start there?

494
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,431
Sure, let's do it.

495
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,724
Okay, great.

496
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,519
I think we can start with the vision
of the company for this…

497
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,563
I can see you. Uh, nod if you can hear me.

498
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,359
Great.

499
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,611
-Good.
-[Mallory] Let's do it.

500
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,779
We have a presentation…

501
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:35,075
Look, all that shit does--
Kimmie, it's just fluff and bullshit.

502
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,078
Tell 'em you wanna get down to business.

503
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,788
This is all fluff.

504
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,501
We need to get down to the real business.
Where are the financials?

505
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,671
[Horace chuckling] Damn.
That's what I was gonna tell you next.

506
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,631
Hello?

507
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,635
-Why did she hang up?
-[door opens]

508
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,515
[in Italian] Sir, we talked
about this and the use of your phone.

509
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,142
Yes, yes, I hear you.

510
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,894
[sighs]

511
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,192
[Mallory] Okay.

512
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,570
Well…

513
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,702
So we have a lawsuit
that doesn't look like it's gonna settle.

514
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,037
A Lena Norris Walton.

515
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,665
It looks like she's planning to file.

516
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,667
Well, let that bitch file.

517
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,630
[Varney] Well, we'd like
to get her to settle if we can.

518
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,091
But she's not budging off of her numbers.

519
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,678
If she files, she loses her leverage.

520
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,973
The plaintiffs aren't concerned
about that, sir.

521
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,143
-They're more concerned with just--
-Well, I need to pay her a visit.

522
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,147
-I don't think that would be a good idea.
-Well, I think--

523
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,858
I need to see
all that she has on the company.

524
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,360
I also want to see all of the people.

525
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,446
The people?

526
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,906
Oh, you mean the plaintiffs.

527
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,783
Yes, them.

528
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,828
-And what are you gonna do?
-Roy.

529
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,496
[Roy] No, I wanna know.

530
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,373
Obviously, what none of you can.

531
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,419
-[chuckling] This motherfucker…
-This what?

532
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,297
What… What he's trying to say is that…

533
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,258
we've done all that we can do.

534
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,261
I don't think it'd be a good idea
to meet with her

535
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,888
without counsel being present.

536
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,099
Well, you're the counsel, right?

537
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,269
Yes, I am.

538
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,521
Then be present.

539
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,738
Okay, so what I'm gathering

540
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,784
is you all have run the company
down the damn toilet.

541
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,202
Yeah?

542
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,120
Let's see why.

543
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,666
So to start…

544
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,589
This ad campaign is old as shit.

545
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,008
-It's out of date.
-[Mallory] Mm.

546
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:01,137
I just finished it.
It's considered a classic.

547
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,891
[chuckling] What is this, the '80s?
It's out of date.

548
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:05,934
[Mallory] Mm.

549
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:10,230
You think it's out of date?
You have a better idea?

550
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,107
A few, actually.

551
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,109
[Mallory] You have a few ideas?

552
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,444
Then please, let us know.

553
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,947
If you don't mind.

554
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,532
I don't.

555
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,328
So right now, we have no online presence.

556
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:30,500
We're putting ad dollars
into some old Black radio station

557
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,878
when it's clear that radio
is not what it used to be.

558
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,839
So the ad dollars
should be way less than that.

559
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,300
We've been putting money
in that radio station for years.

560
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,802
Well, not anymore.

561
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,555
No, listen, I don't think
we should go past this.

562
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,306
Norman, right?

563
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,976
Yes.

564
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,479
Yes, Norman, we're not doing that anymore.

565
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,189
Listen, young lady, we have been doing--

566
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,568
Norman, I said we're not doing it anymore.

567
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:01,740
And we're also not giving any more
ad dollars to that funeral home.

568
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,782
Wait a minute.

569
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,453
That funeral home,
it's one of the oldest in the city.

570
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,164
I mean, they bury
Black people there, and they--

571
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,041
And they can keep burying
Black, yellow, white, I don't care.

572
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,336
But we're not putting any more
of our dollars there. You understand?

573
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,464
What the fuck is she doing?

574
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,549
[Kimmie] What we're gonna do is

575
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:24,429
move 75% of that money
to Black online companies.

576
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,890
Which is mostly owned by white people.

577
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:32,061
Yes. But it'll increase
our visibility by 82%,

578
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,773
and that should generate
a lot more growth to the product.

579
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,358
It'll also save us $7.2 million a year.

580
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:41,988
We take that $22 million to pay off
this insurmountable debt

581
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,115
to the suppliers that you all have chosen,

582
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,243
who are charging us
19% interest, by the way.

583
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,579
That oversight is ridiculous.

584
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,373
Who… Who's responsible for that?
The CFO? Fire them.

585
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,043
I was on the phone with them earlier,

586
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,087
and I said you must come down
on the interest rate,

587
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,966
or we're taking our business
to another company, in China.

588
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,384
In China?

589
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:07,055
[chuckling] What? That's ridiculous.

590
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,264
Yes, China.

591
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,017
Their rates are discounted by 30%.

592
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,436
Now, if we did that for four years,

593
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,523
we'd reduce the company's debt
by about $18 million.

594
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:20,068
Now, since you guys have run the company
so far down into the ground,

595
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,029
if we're aggressive and cut
both expenses and expenditures

596
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,490
by 34% for just four years,

597
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,742
the company will be
completely debt-free in five.

598
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:34,290
That just leaves this lawsuit situation,
which I've already been looking into.

599
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,670
So… are we all clear on what we're doing?

600
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,046
[Olivia] Well, the funeral home,

601
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,006
-I think we just need to pause--
-Olivia.

602
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,258
Olivia.

603
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,176
It's Miss Olivia.

604
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,512
[scoffs] Olivia.

605
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,974
Uh, what is Yellow Smalls, LLC?

606
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,685
So disrespectful.

607
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,813
How in the hell would I know?

608
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,024
So you never heard of it? At all?

609
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,277
No, I have not.

610
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,864
Okay, we'll come back to that.

611
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,781
Norman.

612
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,449
Yes.

613
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:13,246
What is, um, Poker Stipend, LLC?

614
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,500
I don't know.

615
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:19,878
You sure?

616
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,964
What are you saying, young lady?

617
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:27,427
I'm asking questions, that's all.
Trying to get a feel for my first day.

618
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,095
-Attorney Varney.
-Yes.

619
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:33,057
Would it be possible for you to find out
who these companies belong to?

620
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,225
Well, I can, unless--

621
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,937
Unless they're shell companies
parked offshore.

622
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,023
[sinister music playing]

623
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,066
[clicks tongue] Yeah.

624
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,401
[Kimmie] Mm-hmm.

625
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,569
Okay.

626
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,946
Well, just get back to me on that, ASAP.

627
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,989
Absolutely.

628
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,911
Mm-hmm. Okay, well,
we have our marching orders.

629
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,371
Let's get to it.

630
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,261
My office, now.

631
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,304
[snaps fingers]

632
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,222
[Alex] Damn.

633
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,516
[Trackson] Looks like she won.

634
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,476
Yeah.

635
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,895
Look at all their faces.

636
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,940
Shit, man, how'd you know?

637
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,734
Man, when we were driving here,

638
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,363
Kimmie was on the phone with a bunch
of folks asking all types of questions.

639
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,364
Shit.

640
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,326
-Here's your hundred dollars.
-That's right.

641
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,416
Well, thank you, everyone.

642
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:45,588
-Varney, can I see you in my office?
-No, he needs to see all of us.

643
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,173
[Mallory] Miss Olivia.

644
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,718
-And I need to see him first.
-No, no, I need to see him too.

645
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,053
Okay.

646
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,722
-I'll wait for you in my office.
-Okay.

647
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,393
We… are waiting in your office.

648
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,489
[Varney] Yes?

649
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:18,246
What the hell is this LLC business?

650
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:21,833
I don't know.

651
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,543
Shit.

652
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,253
But I can look into it.

653
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,921
Yeah, you do that.

654
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,257
I can make some calls
to find out who's who.

655
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,675
Is that legal?

656
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,010
Well…

657
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,261
No, it's not.

658
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,388
Well, then don't do it.

659
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:36,848
Excuse me?

660
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,141
You heard me.

661
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,727
-Sir, I work--
-Motherfucker, you heard what I said.

662
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,438
[Olivia] Uh, he heard you, Norman.

663
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,233
He heard you,
and he wants to look into it.

664
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,737
Well, I don't know, Olivia.

665
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,280
Oh, he won't.

666
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,785
'Cause I know something
he doesn't want any of us to know.

667
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,747
[Norman] Well, what is it?

668
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,418
Let him talk about this shit,
and you'll see.

669
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,258
[Norman inhales deeply]

670
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,551
[Norman sighs]

671
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,851
[door opens]

672
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,023
[door closes]

673
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,192
Charles, I don't wanna deal
with this shit.

674
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,155
I called you for help one time.

675
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,532
For what?

676
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,578
Think about it.
I never asked you for anything ever.

677
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,916
-Called you today 'cause I needed help.
-For what?

678
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:47,919
[tsks]

679
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,381
Fuck it, and fuck you.

680
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,177
I'm on my own in this family.

681
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,392
[door opens]

682
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,941
[Jules grunts]

683
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:16,364
This is nice. Ah.

684
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,282
This looks good on you.

685
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,911
How are you?

686
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,287
Hm?

687
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,289
Okay, Kimmie.

688
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,877
[tense music playing]

689
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,420
Kimmie…

690
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,381
[groans]

691
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:35,925
Kimmie…

692
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,718
[moans]

693
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,804
[exhales]

694
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,313
Mrs. Bellarie.

695
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,078
I don't know why you hos keep trying me.

696
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:11,169
There was a saying that I used to hear
all the time growing up…

697
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,881
that I never really understood

698
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,383
until now.

699
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,095
And what's that?

700
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,683
"It's no fun when the rabbit got the gun."

701
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,518
[dramatic music playing]

702
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,728
That's how it goes?

703
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,563
And you're the rabbit?

704
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,358
Well, you surely not.

705
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:40,198
In this case… you're more like the hunter,

706
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,700
and I'm being hunted.

707
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,413
Yeah, that's it.

708
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,375
Look, I don't know
what you planning, Kimmie…

709
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,461
Mrs. Bellarie.

710
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,506
…but let me share a few things with you.

711
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,053
I don't need to know nothing
that you got to say.

712
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,472
I know all that I need to.

713
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,099
No, you don't.

714
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:14,440
Well, I know enough
to know that you and Norman

715
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,861
were the ones running the club
and trafficking all of us.

716
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,989
I don't know what you talking about.

717
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,827
Good. That's good.

718
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,330
Keep playing stupid.

719
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,791
Let me save you some time.

720
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,712
You know, I've been doing security
for this family for a very,

721
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,006
very long time.

722
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:45,304
And if you think I didn't take out
any insurance to protect my interests,

723
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,140
you would be wrong.

724
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,811
I got folders on everybody.

725
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,688
Hm.

726
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,189
Which means

727
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,318
I got this family by the balls.

728
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:05,491
Which also means I got you by the balls.

729
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,368
So…

730
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,954
you should enjoy all this.

731
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:13,749
I mean, go behind your seat,
sit back, play big girl.

732
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,336
But don't come for me and mines.

733
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,172
'Cause I will make it nasty.

734
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,468
And you know just how fucking nasty
I can make it.

735
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,639
Well, you see, Jules…

736
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,726
the difference is…

737
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,814
I don't care.

738
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,277
This shit, all this shit?

739
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,655
This shit don't mean nothing to me.

740
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,157
[dramatic whoosh]

741
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,493
I'm the type of bitch

742
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,413
that'll burn the house down

743
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,166
with me in it

744
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,170
just to get to a motherfucker
that's my enemy.

745
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,839
Choose wisely.

746
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,508
The choice has already been made.

747
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:06,886
Hmm.

748
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,015
How's Delinda?

749
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,894
I don't know. You tell me.

750
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,271
How's Body?

751
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,900
Oh, that's right, she's in the hospital.
Oh, no, no, no.

752
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,153
She's dead.

753
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,365
See, it'd be a bad thing

754
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,284
if that investigation was opened again.

755
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,552
[clears throat]

756
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,097
Hello?

757
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,307
Hi! [chuckles]

758
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,017
This is Mrs. Bellarie.

759
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,854
No, the other one. Horace's wife.

760
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,731
Uh-huh. Mm.

761
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,192
He forgot to tell you. Men. [chuckles]

762
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:04,902
Oh.

763
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,862
Ye--

764
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:10,825
Yeah. I would love
to come over for dinner.

765
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,037
You know, Jules spends
so much time here with us.

766
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,541
I'd love to get to know
you and his beautiful daughter more.

767
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:20,918
What?

768
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,004
You never told me
you had a son that was in college

769
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,297
from a previous marriage.

770
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,924
No, he left that out. [chuckles]

771
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,468
Yes, absolutely. Here he goes.

772
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,887
It's your wife.

773
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,271
Hello?

774
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,023
Hey, honey. Yes, yes.

775
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,234
Mm-hmm.

776
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,986
Yeah, of course.

777
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,864
Of course we'll have her over for dinner.

778
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:51,866
Mm-hmm.

779
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,618
Okay.

780
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,830
-I'll get you her number when I get home.
-She has it.

781
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,041
Oh, really? This morning?

782
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,337
Okay.

783
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,423
All right.

784
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,176
I love you too.

785
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:12,803
Bye.

786
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,642
[phone clatters]

787
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:22,480
So you and Angel wanna threaten my family.

788
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,566
You threatened mine.

789
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,818
My son and my daughter
mean everything to me.

790
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:32,031
[scoffs] And apparently your outstanding
reputation in the community, I guess.

791
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,032
Kimmie.

792
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,783
Do I need to slap
the shit out of you again?

793
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:38,329
You can come after me,
but not my children.

794
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,664
You came after my sister.

795
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,583
That was Body.

796
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,251
And she was your bottom bitch.

797
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,046
Take some responsibility, for once.

798
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,217
I'm telling you, don't come after my kids.

799
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,555
Jules, we all are somebody's kids.

800
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,101
You have been warned.

801
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,854
And I've warned you.

802
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:11,904
[door opens]

803
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:14,990
[door closes]

804
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,661
[upbeat techno playing]

805
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,830
Yeah, I'll take these.

806
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,416
Take that too.

807
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,335
Excuse me.

808
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,212
[sucks teeth]

809
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,838
Oh yeah, I like this one.

810
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,757
[cell phone ringing]

811
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,262
-Hello?
-[Rain] Angel.

812
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,681
-Yeah.
-[Rain] Where the fuck are you?

813
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,432
[Angel] I'm shopping.

814
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,268
[Rain] You left her by herself?

815
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,270
[tsks] Man, she was being a little bitch.

816
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,647
-[Rain] Get back here now.
-What happened?

817
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,483
[Rain] I need you back here. This is bad.

818
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,360
What is it?

819
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,362
[Rain] Just hurry and get back here.

820
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,030
Rain, what the hell is going on?

821
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,576
Shit.

822
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,619
Can you make this quick?
I gotta get out of here.

823
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,037
And give me these too.

824
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,415
And this one.

825
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,084
Damn, I like these.

826
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,335
Give me these too.

827
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,088
Hurry up!

828
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,717
[cell phone ringing]

829
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:18,971
Hello?

830
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,391
[Horace] I missed your call.
Uh, I was asleep.

831
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,810
Oh, you're good. Um…

832
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,562
You feeling okay?

833
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,857
[Horace] I don't know
if this shit is working…

834
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,235
[chuckling] …or if I'm just hyped up
on natural herbs and shit.

835
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,614
[chuckling] Well, maybe it's working.

836
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,657
[Horace] Maybe.

837
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,200
So what the hell happened?

838
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,536
They saw I was on the phone,

839
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,914
and I didn't want them to think
that I needed you.

840
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,042
[Horace] Well, clearly you didn't.

841
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,128
No, I didn't.

842
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:55,507
[Horace] What were… What were
these LLCs you were talking about?

843
00:43:55,591 --> 00:44:00,179
Oh, so Norman and Olivia
have shell companies.

844
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,263
They're parked offshore,

845
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,891
and they're getting
all the kickback from advertising.

846
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,976
-[Horace] Is that so?
-Yeah.

847
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,978
[Horace] How did you know that?

848
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:14,943
So I used to work in this finance job,
and I learned a lot of shit there.

849
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,780
But I still know some hos
that work in the records room.

850
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:21,659
For a couple hundred bucks, they gave me
all the backdoor information I wanted.

851
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,827
[Horace] That's pretty good.

852
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,704
[Kimmie] Yeah.

853
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,291
You don't sound surprised
about the kickbacks.

854
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,211
[Horace] Because I already
knew about them.

855
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,505
I've been adding this up for years.

856
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,174
I was just waiting for the right time
to let them know that,

857
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,301
but you already did.

858
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,720
Why would… Why would you wait?

859
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,723
[Horace] Kimmie, timing is everything.

860
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:49,061
When I hit them with this,
they're gonna be so in debt to the company

861
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,021
that I will charge them interest.

862
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,774
They would have to forge
their shares, but…

863
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,527
I'm sorry, Horace.

864
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:01,031
[Horace] No, no.
Uh, I underestimated you in some ways,

865
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,117
but I'm glad you're on it.

866
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:06,829
Thank you.

867
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:11,333
[Horace] So was it
as good for you as it was for me?

868
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,419
More.

869
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:14,962
[both chuckle]

870
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,505
[Horace] Tell me all about it.

871
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:19,049
How much time you got? [chuckles]

872
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:23,262
[Horace] Well, I'm just lying here
waiting to die, so uh, go on, tell me.

873
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:26,473
-I had them shook, okay?
-[Horace chuckling]

874
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,350
They were all running scared.

875
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,854
When I walked in, their faces? Oh!

876
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:35,065
-[Horace] Oh, go on. Go on.
-Okay, so when I walked in…

877
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,944
[somber music playing]

878
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,375
Hello, ma'am.

879
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,169
-Hey.
-I'll take that.

880
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,087
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

881
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:01,175
-I trust you had a great day?
-Yeah, it was fine.

882
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:02,968
Uh…

883
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,095
Where… Where is everybody?

884
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,306
Well, Miss Sylvie is up napping,

885
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,768
Mr. Angel's out shopping,
and Rain is in the stables.

886
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:14,146
Oh, okay. All right.
I'm gonna change my shoes and go find her.

887
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,648
I can get them for you, ma'am.
Which would you like?

888
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:20,194
Um, I'll get them,
but you can put that in the office.

889
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,570
-Thank you.
-Yes, ma'am.

890
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,616
[tense music playing]

891
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,286
[sighs]

892
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,498
Oh shit.

893
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,250
[muttering]

894
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,462
Rain.

895
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,256
-[Rain] Hey.
