[grunting]

00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,068
[breathes deeply]

4
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,154
Are you okay?

5
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,157
[exhales sharply] No.

6
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,325
Do I need to get the doctor?

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,493
No, no.

8
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,661
[inhales deeply]

9
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,246
You can't help me.

10
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,290
[chuckles] But you just did.

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,208
Are you sure about that?

12
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,626
Are you kidding me?

13
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,380
Do you know how much joy
this has given me? [chuckles]

14
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,716
I… I mean, I can't really tell right now.

15
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,219
[inhales deeply] Oh no. My, uh…

16
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:58,475
My cancer's eating away at my body,
but my soul is happy.

17
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,685
[chuckles softly]

18
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,563
Did you see the look on their faces?

19
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,273
Yeah, I did.

20
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,818
They looked like
they were devastated to me.

21
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,655
And that makes me wanna fight to live

22
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,450
just to see that every damn day.

23
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,412
I got those sons of bitches.

24
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,581
All of them.

25
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,792
Are they that bad?

26
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,252
You have no idea.

27
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,213
[breathes deeply]

28
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,048
Kimmie's gonna be all right?

29
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,800
[inhales deeply]

30
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,051
[exhales deeply]

31
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:37,180
My father, there's a lot
of stipulations in his will.

32
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,810
Anything happens to her,
they won't get their shares.

33
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,686
They won't touch her.

34
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:51,111
If not, I would have been dead
a long time ago.

35
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:57,325
Okay, that's fine for me,
but what about my sister and Rain?

36
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,328
Don't worry.

37
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,287
No.

38
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,749
I need them protected,
and I want it in writing.

39
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,501
Okay, um…

40
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,756
My father's will, uh,
can't be touched or objected to…

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,178
but mine can be.

42
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,140
Okay, I'll, uh…

43
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,059
I'll add them to be protected.

44
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,562
That's… That's what I wanna do.

45
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:27,981
And Angel?

46
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,191
Um…

47
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,694
Angel is good. Yeah.

48
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,405
Where is he?

49
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,032
I actually don't know.

50
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,909
[Horace] Well, you should find him.

51
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,953
Um, I wanna see him.

52
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:43,788
All right.

53
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,789
I'll call him.

54
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:51,212
[gasps] Also, we need to talk about
you saying I'm their new boss.

55
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,257
[chuckling]

56
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,342
[coughing]

57
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,763
Ah, did you see their faces
when I said that part? [snickers]

58
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,140
Yeah, I did, but--

59
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,267
You want her to run the company?

60
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,229
Horace, I don't know nothing
about running a company.

61
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,567
It's all right. I got the right people
in place, uh, who will help you.

62
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,527
And who is that?

63
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,070
[hesitates]

64
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,699
I'll fill you in,
but I… I… I need to rest now.

65
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,243
All right.

66
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,205
[sighs] And, um, find Angel.

67
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,333
He's not answering.

68
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,168
We'll find him.

69
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,045
Find him.

70
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,632
Okay, you should head to the house.

71
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,134
The house?

72
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,719
Yes. Uh…

73
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,849
Um, James, um, my… my butler, is there.

74
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,018
-You have a butler?
-[Horace] Yes.

75
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,648
He's got the place all set up,
um, for all of you.

76
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,649
Wait, what?

77
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,485
[inhales sharply] Yes.

78
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,987
[chuckling] Shit, I'm getting out of here.

79
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,908
There's a driver out there.

80
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,662
His name is, uh, Alex,
and, uh, he works for Jules.

81
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,164
-Oh, hell no.
-[Horace] Hold on.

82
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,541
I've had him checked out.

83
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,337
He's a real cop. He just got caught up.

84
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,049
But yeah, he's got some, uh…
some special skills I wanna use.

85
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,761
Nah. I don't wanna be around nobody
that works for Jules.

86
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,679
Right.

87
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,097
[Horace] No, you two listen.

88
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,100
It's not about who you can trust,

89
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,311
'cause you can't trust
none of these motherfuckers.

90
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,522
It's about leverage,

91
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,732
and we've got a lot on him.

92
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,359
Okay?

93
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,362
Now… [inhales deeply]

94
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,657
…the first thing I'm gonna teach you

95
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,954
is gonna be the hardest
for you and Angel to learn.

96
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:56,838
It's easy to play games with a nigga
who looks at what's in front of him,

97
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,301
but I'm gonna teach you
how to look around corners

98
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,344
and into the future.

99
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,015
Leverage is the way.

100
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:12,186
[unsettling music playing]

101
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,188
Son of a bitch.

102
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,690
[Olivia] Who is that girl?

103
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,193
-I don't know. You wanna tell your mother?
-Mallory, chill.

104
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:23,573
-Well, somebody better tell me something.
-[Mallory] Oh, what about you, Jules?

105
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,991
You have the pleasure.

106
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,245
Maybe we should go to your place
to discuss this.

107
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,496
I would agree.

108
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,625
-That's fine.
-I don't want your Black ass at my house.

109
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,878
-Roy--
-How the fuck did you let this happen?

110
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,379
Because I didn't know.

111
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,797
[contemplative music playing]

112
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,882
Bullshit.

113
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,509
-He didn't.
-You would know that, huh?

114
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,304
He didn't know, okay? He tried to warn me.

115
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,599
Well, if he didn't know,
how did he try to warn you?

116
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,935
I… I, uh, certainly didn't know
it was all of this.

117
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,897
I found out this morning
just like the rest of you.

118
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,482
[Norman] This is some bullshit.

119
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,401
My wife dies, and he gets married.

120
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,529
Now, I wanna know who she is.
I wanna know everything about her.

121
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,032
And what is this shit
about her being our boss?

122
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:07,950
Yeah, that part.

123
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:13,247
She is his wife, and he can put anyone in
as CEO that he wants.

124
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,875
Even though she doesn't know a thing
about what that means?

125
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,543
Or how to spell it.

126
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,089
-I've seen her somewhere before.
-Where?

127
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,259
I don't know, but I have.

128
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,345
[scoffs] I can't believe this bullshit.

129
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,140
As I suggested before, maybe we should go
somewhere else to discuss this.

130
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,102
[intriguing music playing]

131
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:41,943
Rain.

132
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,736
Jules.

133
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,322
How are you?

134
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,492
How do I look?

135
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,578
Alive.

136
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,291
That's more than I can say for some.

137
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,045
Do you two know each other?

138
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,214
[Rain] Oh, yeah.

139
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,300
We go way back.

140
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,220
So perhaps you should remember that
in your tone.

141
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,888
Yeah.

142
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,849
Okay, who is Alex?

143
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,934
That would be me.

144
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,811
Come with me.

145
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,691
What do you want with him? He's my driver.

146
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,234
Get another one.

147
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,029
He works for me.

148
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:31,367
And you work for Kimmie now.

149
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,452
Wow.

150
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,745
Right, Jules?

151
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:39,917
[suspenseful music building]

[inhales deeply]

153
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,804
Kimmie.

154
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,639
Mrs. Bellarie, motherfucker.

Oh my goodness, the language.

158
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,695
She got more where that came from.

159
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,490
Are these your sons?

160
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,659
[chuckling] Unfortunately.
No, yes, they are.

161
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,496
Then I'm sure you've heard worse
than that shit.

162
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,124
[unsettling music playing]

163
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,962
I don't think we've met.

164
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,298
Hi, I'm Mallory.

165
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,510
I know who you are.

166
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,137
Welcome to the family.

167
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,140
[Charles] Now I remember.

168
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,352
Didn't I see you shaking your ass
on a pole at Delinda's?

169
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,687
Didn't I see you coming out
of the bathroom

170
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,105
with one of the male dancers

171
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:47,026
with traces of coke on your nose,
wiping your mouth?

172
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,366
-Oh, she quick. I might like you.
-[Kimmie scoffs]

173
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,036
All right, bitch, I like you. [chuckles]

174
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,287
I got your bitch.

175
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,124
Horace wants to see you.

176
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,543
Who? Me?

177
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,419
I'm looking at you.

[music continues]

179
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,725
Go talk to the doctor, and I'll be back.

00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,994
[dramatic sting]

181
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,582
[music fades]

182
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,752
-That bitch really took my fucking driver.
-That's not all she's gonna take.

183
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,797
-This shit don't make no damn sense.
-[chuckling] I'll say.

184
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,757
It is… [inhales deeply]

185
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,883
[sighs loudly]

186
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,137
-What's funny?
-This… This family.

187
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,763
Mm. [chuckles]

188
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,266
-Then why are you a part of it, Mallory?
-Go to hell.

189
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,643
Oh, shit, that's right. That's right.

190
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,479
'Cause you broke as shit.
If you didn't have me, you would--

191
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,149
Nigga, please. If I didn't have you, what?

192
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,443
-What?
-You heard me.

193
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:14,280
I heard yo ass. I'd be sitting on a yacht
with a billionaire if I didn't have you.

194
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,865
[Roy chuckles] Hmm.

195
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,283
[Mallory muttering]

196
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,368
-Sitting on a yacht with a billionaire?
-I would be.

197
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,454
-Oh, shit. Uh-huh.
-That's what I would be doing.

198
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,914
-What you doing?
-You have my permission. Do that.

199
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,000
Why'd you take your ring off?
What the hell? I will…

200
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,462
You know, you underestimate
the power of a beautiful woman, Roy.

201
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,130
-I don't.
-That's what the hell you do.

202
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,131
-Not shit.
-Whatever.

203
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:36,135
You know what?
You'd be on that yacht for a day. A day.

204
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,180
Then he'd throw your ass overboard
before you even finished your first drink.

205
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,349
Look at… Look at my darn husband.
Look at you though.

206
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,975
[chuckling] This is some funny shit.

207
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,855
You were sleeping with a whore
that was sleeping with yo damn daddy.

208
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,649
-[chuckles]
-Ew. What's that…

209
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,150
How you let Jules do that to you?

210
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,402
-He didn't do shit.
-How you let him do that to you?

211
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,114
And he did do shit, because you asked him
to set you up, and that's what he did.

212
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,659
He set you up. That's what he did.

213
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,036
-Will you shut up, Mallory?
-No, I'm not gonna shut up.

214
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,873
Jules a nasty-ass bastard.
Look at… [chuckling] He a nasty-ass.

215
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,334
He got you and Horace

216
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:12,046
running up in the same whore
that works at a strip club.

217
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,341
Isn't that nasty? You better tell me
every fucking thing too.

218
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,759
And I mean everything.

219
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,136
I ain't saying shit to you.

220
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,181
-You know I'mma find out anyway, right?
-Then do it.

221
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,474
-Like I always do.
-Then do it.

222
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,476
Stop with the threats.
Just… Just fucking do it.

223
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,062
If you gonna do it, do it.
You got all these threats.

224
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,980
-There ain't no threat.
-All you do is threat.

225
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,107
But now we got this bitch…

226
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,983
-Then do it, Mallory.
-…coming to the company,

227
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,028
and I gotta see her ass every day.

228
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,323
-She ain't gonna do shit. She's not.
-She's gonna come to the company.

229
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,910
She's gonna be in your daddy's office
that's right across from mine.

230
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,413
I wish she would. I'd throw
her ass out the fucking window.

231
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,081
-Oh, like she did yo ass?
-Damn right.

232
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,167
If you throw her out the window,
then all our shares are gone.

233
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,087
[tense music playing]

234
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,965
You know whose fault this really is?
It's that big musclehead-ass nigga.

235
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,718
-That's whose fault it is.
-Ain't no big musclehead. It's your daddy.

236
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,388
It's Horace.
He did this because your ass taunted him.

237
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,347
It ain't my fault.

238
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,849
-It is your fault.
-Shit.

239
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,643
When your ass was laying
in that hospital bed taunting him,

240
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,729
I told you he would do this.

241
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,441
-Are you through?
-I'm not.

242
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,402
I'm actually not at all,
'cause I bet your ass a million dollars

243
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,488
that he's gonna make sure
you and Charles are out that damn will.

244
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,491
-He can't do that.
-He can. You didn't think he'd do this.

245
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,036
-I wish that nigga would die.
-Don't… Don't say that.

246
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,163
You don't want that.

247
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,456
-Yes, I do.
-No, you don't.

248
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,042
Because then we'll be stuck with that
whore Kimmie running the damn company.

249
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,253
And trust me, you don't want that.

250
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,923
I can't believe this shit.

251
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:43,095
[ominous music playing]

252
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,641
[music fades]

253
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,642
[Kimmie] Thank you.

254
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,353
Um…

255
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,816
I'm gonna go check on Rain and my sister.

256
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,985
No, no. Hold on.

257
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:04,700
Attorney Varney, I need you to add
Sylvie, Rain, and Angel to my will

258
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,453
as part of our family.

259
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,371
Yes, sir.

260
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,750
So they can be protected from the others.

261
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,543
Yes, sir. Will do.

262
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,712
And I need it tight.

263
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,841
I'll use the same language
your father used, sir.

264
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,885
-It'll be airtight.
-[Horace] Good.

265
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,221
When can you do it?

266
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,599
I can get on it
as soon as I leave here, sir.

267
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,644
Okay. I need it done today.

268
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,145
Absolutely.

269
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,689
[foreboding music playing]

270
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,485
I want you to tell her everything.

271
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,861
Wait.

272
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,322
How do I know
if he's gonna tell me everything?

273
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:48,202
[siren wailing in the distance]

274
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,289
You can leave.

275
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,336
Yes, sir.

276
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:11,392
Kimmie, I told you not to ask me questions
like that in front of other people.

277
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,603
You can't trust
none of these motherfuckers.

278
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,565
Now, I'm gonna be in yo ass.

279
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,694
You got a lot to learn before I die.

280
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,529
I'm not gonna be here that long.

281
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:29,577
And I don't have time to worry about
hurting your feelings. You got me?

282
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,453
Yeah.

283
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,163
[breathing shakily] Yes.

284
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,920
Now, what he doesn't know

285
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,756
is that I've got another firm.

286
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,928
Everything that he tells me,
I have three lawyers verify it.

287
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,973
Let him tell you everything.

288
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,727
Pay attention. Record it if you have to.

289
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,898
Then you go to the firm
and you ask them questions.

290
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,983
You play 'em against each other.

291
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,610
Okay. Got it.

292
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:08,282
They don't like him because he's so smart,
but you verify everything.

293
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,035
Got it.

294
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,914
Did you find Angel yet?

295
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,916
No, not yet.

296
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,752
Okay, you should…

297
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,463
You should go to the house.

298
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,132
I have one more issue.

299
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,759
What?

300
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,138
That night when Jules was chasing me,
I stole a car.

301
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,058
There was a man in the back seat,

302
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,811
and he's the father-in-law
of someone named Daniel Lakeland.

303
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,231
How do you know that?

304
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,611
Angel saw it on the news.
That's why I have on this hat and coat.

305
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,405
Where's the car now?

306
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,033
It was in the parking garage last I knew.

307
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,201
What?

308
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,328
Angel went to go check on it.

309
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,747
All right, y-y-you, uh…

310
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,709
You head to the house,
and… and, uh, I'll… I'll handle it.

311
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,128
Okay.

312
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,546
Thank you. [sighs]

313
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,799
[Kimmie breathing shakily]

314
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,518
[music fades]

315
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,561
Call Charles.

316
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,522
[line ringing]

317
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:26,443
[phone buzzing]

318
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,778
[sighs]

319
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,032
What?

320
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:32,992
Are you there?

321
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,660
[tense music playing]

322
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,161
Mm, am I where?

323
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,498
At your brother's house, Charles.

324
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,209
-I ain't going over there.
-[Varney] Charles.

325
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,753
Look, I need to get some rest.
I'm going to the club tonight.

326
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,547
Are you taking this seriously?

327
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,175
Well, shit, he married her.
What can I do? It's done.

328
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,011
Charles, you need
to be thinking about this.

329
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,639
I don't need to think about shit but
where my next piece of ass is coming from.

330
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,392
I also think I want Chinese tonight.

331
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:00,853
Charles…

332
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,813
[Charles] Look, Varney,

333
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,565
you told me.

334
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,900
You tried to warn me.

335
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,694
Why did you tell them that?

336
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,612
Well, you did.

337
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,865
Yeah, but I told you in confidence.

338
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,577
Well… [inhales deeply]

339
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,538
Charles, you can't tell them
the shit that I'm telling you.

340
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,790
Okay, I'm sorry.

341
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,959
Maybe I just won't tell you shit.

342
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,128
That would be great.

343
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,131
-Charles…
-[Charles] Look, I gotta go.

344
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,800
Charles, are you going over there or what?

345
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,261
Look, I got another call
on the other line.

346
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,222
You don't have anybody
on the other line, Charles.

347
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,059
It's not a telephone line,
it's a line of coke.

348
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,644
Okay.

349
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,313
Bye, Varney.

350
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,731
Bye.

351
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,484
[inhales deeply]

352
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,526
[sighs]

353
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,864
[thunder rumbling]

354
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,282
[woman] Well, you're doing better.

355
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:56,992
So we can discharge you.

356
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,163
-That's it? That's all I need?
-Well, we'll need to do a follow-up.

357
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,624
-Okay, I'll come back.
-Stay on the blood thinners,

358
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,834
-and if you have any pain…
-I'll come back to see you.

359
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,919
Okay, good.

360
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,254
Oh, did I come with any clothes?

361
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,052
Uh, no, actually. But I'll have the nurse
bring you something to wear home.

362
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,304
-Okay. Thank you.
-[doctor] Sure.

363
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,431
Hey.

364
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,058
Home?

365
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,102
I can't wait to see what that looks like.

366
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,145
-Yeah, it looks crazy online.
-Let me see.

367
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,772
[Sylvie] You see the horses?

368
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,148
-That's nothing.
-[Rain] Wow.

369
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,900
Wait till y'all see it in person.

370
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,611
-Well, shit, let's go. I'm ready.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

371
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:37,116
How do you feel about
this driver situation?

372
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,450
The Alex dude?

373
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,453
Look, we in this shit now.

374
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,874
He said to trust the man, so we just gotta
see what he's talking about.

375
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,876
I don't know, Rain.

376
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,089
Kimmie, the man just married you
without a prenup.

377
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,091
If this is even all legit.

378
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,634
[Rain] It is.

379
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,929
Things are finally going good for us.
Can we just go with it?

380
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,851
I'll go with it when he makes sure
you two are straight.

381
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,435
He will.

382
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,815
You say he will like you know him, Rain.
You do not know this man.

383
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:14,486
Kimmie, I know we gotta trust somebody.
Shit. I'm ready to do this.

384
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,657
This man got a mansion and horses
we can ride without getting paid.

385
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,700
Let's go.

386
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,244
Let's get out of here.

387
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,413
[Rain] Hey, nurse, where my clothes at?

388
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,374
[hip-hop beats playing]

389
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,630
-This place is far out.
-[music halts]

390
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,008
Yeah, but it's worth it.

391
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,676
Why you say that?

392
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,888
Well, when you see it, you'll know why.

393
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,392
So how long have you worked for Jules?

394
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,479
I'm a cop for the city of Chicago, ma'am.

395
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,734
-Should I ask him again?
-Yeah, you should.

396
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,737
How long have you worked for Jules?

397
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,572
[suspenseful music playing]

398
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:02,534
I don't work for Jules.
I work for the Bellarie family.

399
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,953
[scoffs] Okay, so he on that shit.

400
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:05,871
What?

401
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,165
Nothing.

402
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,085
-Why are you speaking to him like that?
-'Cause this nigga don't wanna talk.

403
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,046
He's Japanese.

404
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,881
He's a nigga.

405
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,300
Only niggas work for Jules.

406
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,220
What is your racial background?

407
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,222
I'm Japanese.

408
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,100
Nah, you got some soul in there somewhere.

409
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,311
[tense music playing]

410
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,938
I'm Black and Dutch.

411
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,315
See? Nigga.

412
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,859
Japanigga.

413
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,821
You do know I know who you are, right?

414
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,783
You mean besides my name?

415
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,079
I was at Delinda's, hiding behind a couch

416
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,958
the night that you
and the other so-called cop

417
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,044
came in there
looking for somethin' for Jules.

418
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,505
I heard y'all talking.

419
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:02,302
Well, if you remember correctly,
I was telling Officer Trackson

420
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,805
that everything you'd been through,

421
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,224
I don't blame you for what you did.

422
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,853
What did she do?

423
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,316
She broke a very expensive table,
young lady.

424
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,948
You know, I think you're gonna
really love the house.

425
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,242
They live a really lavish lifestyle.

426
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,536
Save all the small talk.

427
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,246
We keeping an eye on you.

428
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,832
I'm glad you are.

429
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,085
We don't like or trust you.

430
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,171
I can understand that.

431
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,631
One wrong move…

432
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,549
Yeah.

433
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:42,884
I got it.

434
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:50,684
And who been running the club
now that Delinda's…

435
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,687
table is broke?

436
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,108
There's a lot of broken furniture here.

437
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,819
[Alex] Nobody really.

438
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,656
We were there last night
trying to hold it all together.

439
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,366
[Rain] Hm.

440
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,701
"Hm" what?

441
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,620
-Nothing.
-Nah, what?

442
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,706
[Rain scoffs]

443
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,749
I know you.

444
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,417
I know you do.

445
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,006
So this table can't be repaired?

446
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,007
[Kimmie tsks]

447
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,759
Not a chance.

448
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,927
What about Body?

449
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,513
Body's in the hospital.

450
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,515
She in the hospital?

451
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,309
[Alex] Yeah.

452
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,518
She's alive?

453
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,896
Yeah, from what I heard.

454
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,689
[Rain] Hm.

455
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:41,818
I guess her table didn't break as bad.

456
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,613
More broken ta-- What are y'all doing?

457
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,782
Where these tables come from, IKEA?

458
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,952
Well, I guess we gonna have to pay
somebody a little visit.

459
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,663
No, we don't.
We ain't visiting nobody, Rain.

460
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,875
Kimmie, you got unfinished business
with her, and I do too.

461
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,460
And I'll handle it.

462
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,506
No, you already done broke a table.
Can I at least break a chair?

463
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,216
What the hell are y'all talking about?

464
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,843
Amazon orders, girl. Be quiet.

465
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,179
[mouthing]

466
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,015
You know Daga?

467
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,685
Daga? No.

468
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,022
They call her the Pump Queen.

469
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,567
No, I don't, but I can find her.

470
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,612
Yeah, you do that.

471
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,740
I need to have a word with both of them.

472
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,451
All right, I'm on it.

473
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,413
[pensive music playing]

474

[music fades]

475
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,131
Where the hell are they?
Left before I did.

476
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,048
Call them.

477
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,007
I did.

478
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,593
Why the hell are we meeting here anyway?

479
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,596
Because we need to figure this shit out.

480
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,182
What we need to figure out
is how to take his ass down.

481
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,225
Oh, Norman.

482
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,770
Oh, wait a minute.
Didn't you try to rob him?

483
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,064
-Are you still on that?
-Huh?

484
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:05,068
You know damn well he don't carry
that much money at that safe house.

485
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,154
-Just get out of my face.
-Are you broke?

486
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,030
[scoffs] Hell no.

487
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,492
You are broke, aren't you?

488
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,454
You never did keep your money very well.

489
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,788
Are you gambling again?

490
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,958
Is this a conversation
you want to have with me?

491
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,462
-This is a conversation we having.
-I am not broke.

492

[chuckling]

493
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:30,677
Wait, so you are over-leveraged,

494
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,472
and you need that money every month.

495
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,223
Are you done?

496
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,184
Come on, you can tell me.

497
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:41,646
You know what? Maybe if I ran
an illegal operation out of a strip club,

498
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,733
I'd have extra cash too, just like you.

499
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,569
Okay, okay, this is about greed then.

500
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:52,073
You know the last motherfucker
who said that to me had to get in the bag.

501
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,868
You still doing that old-school shit
I taught you?

502
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,954
Do you want me to get a bag for you?

[tense music playing]

504
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,626
How much money do you need?

505

All of it, you greedy motherfucker.

506
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,340
Just like you want it all,
and you will stop at nothing to get it.

507
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,800
Baby, we both in the will.

508
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,678

523
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,343
-You're nasty.
-Shut up.

524
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,096
Excuse me. He wanted to see me.

525
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,222
About what?

526
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,850
Well, he wanted to add
some people to the will.

527
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,854
-What?
-He wanted to protect them from you all.

528
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,024
Well, you better make sure
that shit is airtight for us.

529
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,817
You need to ask the right questions.

530
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,028
And what are the questions, dear? Hm?

531
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,905
Why the fuck he protecting them?

532
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,743
The question is,
who are the people, Varney?

533
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,788
Well, the people you saw in the room,
and someone named Angel.

534
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,374
-Who? Angel?
-Yeah.

535
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,794
-Hm.
-He didn't have his last name for him.

536
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,173
-Okay, that's odd.
-But he's gonna get it for me later.

537
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,384
And what does this Angel look like?

538
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,136
I have no idea.

539
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,264
Hm.

540
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,934
What is it, little brother?
Is that name turning you on?

541
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,645
Well, the Angel I know does some--

542
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,105
Look, look, I do not wanna hear
no disgusting shit right now.

543
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,858
He works at the club with Kimmie.

544
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,568
-What?
-[Charles] Yeah.

545
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,071
Well, what kind of club is this?

546
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,574
-I could take you there.
-[Olivia] Will you just stop it?

547
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,784
This is serious.

548
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,786
I am too. I'm going tonight.

549
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,455
We don't wanna hear this shit.

550
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,666
You old nigga.
Do your ears even work? Shut up.

551
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,710
Look, you little motherfucker, I'll come
over there and whoop your mother--

552
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,338
-Norman, please.
-Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

553
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,465
-Calm down.
-[Olivia] Lord, have mercy.

554
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:59,803
I cannot believe that he married
some whore just to get even.

555
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,596
No, he did it to get ahead.

556
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,184
Well, then we all know that it isn't love,
so surely we can challenge it.

557
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:10,772
-You know, that's what we should do.
-Let's hear what the attorney has to say.

558
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,234
Mallory, don't talk to me
like I'm fucking stupid.

559
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:17,904
Well, I don't want the attorney,
Varney, in here.

560
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,990
-You just shut the fuck up.
-He's a damn quack, Mom.

561
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,410
Listen, can we contest it?

562
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:28,206
Have… Have the man committed
and say he's incompetent.

563
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,668
That's exactly what we should do.
He don't even know this bitch.

564
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,754
Attorney Varney.

565
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,047
[inhales]

566
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,846
Well, that's why he wanted
the witnesses there…

567
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:48,017
and a judge to do a cognitive test
to prove that he's in his right mind.

568
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,895
Obviously, he's not in his right mind

569
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,189
if he doing this stupid-ass shit
with that bitch.

570
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,276
Okay, so there's nothing
that we can do legally?

571
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,153
I'm afraid not.

572
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,030
He protected his shares
and diluted some of yours.

573
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,158
This son of a bitch.

574
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,701
How much?

575
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:08,830
Well, him being the eldest son,
he exercised his 10%.

576
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,625
Well, it's not as bad
as I thought. [sighs]

577
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,169
From each of you.

578
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,712
Each of us?

579
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:16,713
-Shit.
-I'm afraid so.

580
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,840
-What?
-10% for me is…

581
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,843
Do you know how much money I'll be losing?

582
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,261
No, that's all of us.

583
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,723
This motherfucker.
This shit is not over with.

584
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,892
Who is this bitch?
I wanna know everything about her.

585
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,977
This is only the beginning.

586
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,813
You know what?

587
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,399
-I'm not standing for this.
-[door opens]

588
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,777
Hell no. I am not doing it.

589
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,737
[Mallory clears throat]

590
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,197
[door closes]

591
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,616
Okay, well, um… [sighs]

592
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,493
[clicks tongue]

593
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:50,455
I guess you'll explain to me
how this messes with my money.

594
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,458
-I'll get you those numbers later.
-[Charles] Great.

595
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,085
Ooh, can you make it soon, please?

596
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,630
'Cause I'm going out tonight.

597
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,841
So… Excuse me.

598
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,719
-Thank you.
-[Roy clears throat]

599
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,723
[suspenseful music playing]

600
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,478
Are you a fucking mannequin, nigga?

601
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,355
Why you still standing there?

602
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,649
Go ruin someone else's life, man.

603
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,652
That'll be all, Attorney Varney.
Thank you.

604
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,778
Thank you.

605
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,197
Just give me a call
if you learn anything else.

606
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,156
Will do.

607
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,699
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

608
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,161
Don't call her, nigga. Call me.

609
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,830
Excuse me?

610
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,916
Did you not hear me, nigga?
Don't ever call my wife again.

611
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,127
Now bounce, bro.

612
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,004
Bounce. What…

613
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,048
-[Mallory] Why are you such an asshole?
-Damn.

614
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,342
-Hm. Let me ask you something.
-[door opens, closes]

615
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,680
Did you know that big nigga
was fucking my wife?

616
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,223
-What?
-[Roy] Yeah.

617
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,559
Why don't we just
all hop on this lie train?

618
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,227
-I'm not telling no lie.
-You are a liar.

619
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,104
But why don't we get to the truth?

620
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,106
The truth is, like I told you in the car,

621
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,401
the motherfucking bitch
that you were sleeping with

622
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,237
is now married to your father!

623
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,783
Isn't this some sick shit?

624
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:13,413
You and your daddy
fucking the same piece of pussy.

625
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,081
[Roy chuckles softly]

626
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,543
[inhales sharply] Let me talk to you.

627
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,378
-Sure.
-[Mallory] Uh, um…

628
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,005
-[Jules] In my office?
-Garage.

629
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,132
No, you don't. Not in private.

630
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,842
-Mallory, what--
-What did I say?

631
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,052
You better be careful.
Your mother's not here.

632
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,679
What the fuck that supposed to mean?

633
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,641
And what is that,
your… your resting bitch face?

634
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,601
No.

635
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:38,980
This is my "I'm looking
at a stupid motherfucker" face.

636
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,357
-I'm stupid?
-You stupid motherfucker.

637
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,110
I wanna know everything about this bitch.

638
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,155
-And I mean every damn thing.
-Wha… What are you, the president?

639
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,491
No, I'm the fixer,
and I fix all your shit.

640
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,620
I fix your father's shit,
I fix your mother's shit,

641
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,913
the company shit.

642
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,497
So I am the shit.

643
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,834
Are you done?

644
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,379
Yeah, I am. I'm done with you. Years ago.

645
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,799
But, Jules,
there is one thing I couldn't fix.

646
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,927
How's your erectile dysfunction going?

647
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,846
It works perfectly, with another woman.

648
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,432
-Like I said, let's talk.
-No, the fuck--

649
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,185
-I'mma follow right behind your ass.
-Mallory, let me talk to him.

650
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,394
But you know what, Jules?

651
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:22,815
Do you know how disappointing it is
to have a man with a dick that curves?

652
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,068
-You should--
-I don't know anything about that.

653
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,861
Let me just talk to him for a second.

654
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,156
-No.
-Let… Let me just-- Please, please.

655
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,033
-Let me--
-Fine. Fuck it. Talk.

656
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,123
[exhales]

657
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,250
Jules, Jules, Jules.

658
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,461
-I know, I know, I know.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

659
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,921
No, no, you don't know.

660
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,133
-Did you set him up?
-What did I tell you?

661
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,512
I don't give a damn what you told me.
Did you put that bitch in his bed?

662
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,056
Why would I do that?

663
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,727
Yeah, you did it. Mm-hmm.

664
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,272
Just think about it. I wouldn't do that.

665
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,234
No, no, you would do some shit like that.
That's the thing, you would.

666
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,737
Roy, you need to calm down, all right?
I can always get you another girl.

667
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,448
That's the thing,
I don't trust you no more.

668
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:18,246
Matter of fact,
I've been working on one for you.

669
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,790
You gonna love her.

670
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,751
Submissive, do anything you want.

671
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:28,506
You said that about the last girl,
and look at the situation we in right now.

672
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:32,135
Yeah, I know, but this one
is a for sure, for sure. I'm telling you.

673
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,054
Yeah, if you say so.

674
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,307
Come on. You know me.

675
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,396
I do know you, Jules. I do.

676
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:47,150
And like I said, look at
the fucking situation we in right now.

677
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,610
She literally lives
with my fucking father.

678
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,487
Let me just set it up.

679
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,905
Go to the hotel.

680
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,951
You gonna love her.
Just give me a couple of days.

681
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,163
A couple of days, huh?

682
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:01,956
Roy.

683
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:06,044
Roy, you need to calm down.
I know you got a lot going on.

684
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,424
I do.

685
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:16,637
So do what you need to do,
and get in the hotel and just do your job.

686
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,016
Okay?

687
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,518
Done.

688
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,188
And another thing,

689

I told you it was special.

Are you James?

00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,240
Yes, I'm James. James the butler, ma'am.

I'm told that you have no bags.

897

No, we don't.

898
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:09,248
Well, Mr. Bellarie wanted me to assure
that you have all that you need.

899
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,627
Let me introduce you to your staff.

900
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,422
Lydia, she's your chef.

901
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,132
John is your sous chef.

902
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,551
Margaret is the head of housekeeping.

903
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:25,180
And this is Glen. He and his team
take care of the grounds and the stables.

-Oh, what's that old shack doing up there?

906

Look kind of out of place.

907
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,693
Well, that's actually the house
that Mr. Bellarie's father grew up in.

908
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,863
His great-grandfather
bought all this land.

909
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,490
Quite a feat for a former slave,
wouldn't you say?

910
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,704
And all the family's mansions
are built on this property.

911
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,248
All the mansions that we just passed?

912

[James] Yes.

913

That's all the family's?

[James] Yes, ma'am.

915
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,798
Wait, so Roy lives on this road?

916
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,925
He's the first house
that you pass on the right.

917
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,344
He and his lovely wife Mallory live there.

-Yeah.

935
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,185
Okay. Well, come on.

936
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,395
I'll show you the ropes
and where you'll be staying.

937
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,232
All right, let's go.

938
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,193

You know you need to get
some curtains for this house, right?

945
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,127
There's not another house
that can see in here.
