All right? I'm not keeping
my sister around this shit.

172
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,209
Okay, I understand. Just let me come back
so we can talk about it.

173
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,711
I'm leaving.

174
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,130
Just wait. Kimmie, damn.

175
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,339
And I'm not waiting neither.

176
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,467
[Rain] Let me just come to the house,
and we can--

177
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,677
You trying to get me to stay.
I'm not dealing with that.

178
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,805
I'm not trying to do nothing, okay?
I just wanna talk to you first.

179
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,308
Then you need to come back now,
and I mean right now.

180
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,350
[Rain] Kimmie, wait--

181
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,978
Or you just gonna
have to catch up with us later.

182
00:07:59,061 --> 00:07:59,979
[Rain] Kimmie?

183
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,564
[Kimmie] Shit.

184
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,567
[sighs]

185
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:05,943
[tsks]

186
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,615
Alex!

187
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,617
Come on, let's go.

188
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,749
You don't wanna go in?

189
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,502
If I wanted to go in,
I wouldn't say "let's go."

190
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,253
We're heading back to the house. Come on.

191
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:25,838
Yes, ma'am.

192
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,551
Hi, Mr. Bellarie.

193
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,056
-Hi.
-I came as soon as I got your call.

194
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,808
[breathing heavily] Thank you.

195
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,144
-I know it's late.
-Are you kidding?

196
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,438
Everything you've done for this hospital?

197
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,649
Thank you.

198
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,234
You're sitting up.

199
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,902
It can't be comfortable.

200
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,530
[breathing heavily]

201
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,199
Laying here waiting to die is worse.

202
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,617
I'm so sorry.

203
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,660
So…

204
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:57,912
how am I doin'?

205
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,456
You want the truth?

206
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,125
Have I ever wanted anything else?

207
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,253
You're not doing well.

208
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,047
I can show you here on the tablet.

209
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,967
Just tell me.

210
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,510
[somber music playing]

211
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,803
It's progressed.

212
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,390
Worse than it was?

213
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,476
And moving quickly.

214
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,777
And there's nothing you can do
to slow it down?

215
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,029
We've tried everything.

216
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,906
So how long do I have?

217
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,451
It could be weeks, maybe a month or two.

218
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,580
Weeks?

219
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,581
I'm sorry.

220
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,748
[Horace scoffs]

221
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,459
You know… [inhales sharply]

222
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,295
funny thing is, uh…

223
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:53,634
I don't remember wanting to live
as much as I do right now.

224
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,219
You have a lot to live for.

225
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,347
Your family, your new wife.

226
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,390
Yes.

227
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,726
That is a reason to live.

228
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:09,650
My new wife to see the faces
of my sons every day

229
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,946
as they embrace her
and all that she brings.

230
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,073
That's beautiful.

231
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,742
Yeah.

232
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,497
[winces] Speaking of my new wife…

233
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,208
her sister…

234
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,711
she sent me this.

235
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,674
[breathing heavily]
You know kids on the Internet.

236
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,010
[chuckles] They believe anything.

237
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,139
But I just thought
I'd let you, uh, take a look.

238
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,310
Yeah, she… she researched
this on the Internet.

239
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,730
Some cancer treatment in Italy.

240
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,192
[sniffling]

241
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,322
Why are you smiling?

242
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,659
I've actually seen this before.

243
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,785
And you have too.

244
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,287
I showed you this place when, uh,

245
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,915
we realized that we couldn't do
anything else here.

246
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,459
[spluttering] Uh, I didn't hear that.

247
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,962
Well, actually you did. You said…

248
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:12,880
What?

249
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,635
You said, "If I'm gonna die,
I wanna die in my own bed."

250
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,054
[chuckling]

251
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,890
Yeah, that sounds
like something I would say.

252
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,601
But, uh… [sniffles]

253
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,187
sometimes shit happens that…

254
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,065
makes you wanna live.

255
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,318
Now listen, this is all Eastern medicine.

256
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,779
I don't know if it's going to be
successful for you.

257
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,322
I have seen some patients

258
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,367
who have the means to go to this place
have some success.

259
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,202
Do you think it's worth it?

260
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,331
The question you should ask is,
do you think it's worth it?

261
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,500
I know you're in a lot of pain.

262
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:56,382
Well, can you patch me up
long enough to help me get there?

263
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,885
Italy's closer than Thailand.
They have facilities in both places.

264
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,097
But it'll still be
a long flight either way.

265
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,474
Um, I have a plane.

266
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,226
[chuckles] Of course you do.

267
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:12,523
That'll make it easier,
but it's still really risky.

268
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:18,320
Yeah, well, what else am I gonna do?
Just die here?

269
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,741
How soon can you get it set up?

270
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,703
Well, actually,
it's early in the day there.

271
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,288
I can call right now.

272
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,540
Thank you, doctor.

273
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes, sir.

[door opens, closes]

277
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,053
Sylvie?

278
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,556
[bugs chirring]

279
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,023
[shuddering] Shit.

280
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,488
[inhales deeply]

281

[cell phone rings]

284
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,205
Hey.

285
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,415
How far out are you?

286
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,293
About 30 minutes.

287
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,129
[sighs] All right.

288
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,172
[Rain] Are you okay?

289
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,591
No.

290
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,010
Did you get Sylvie up?

291
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,678
[Kimmie] Not yet.

292
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,265
I'm sitting here watching her sleep.

293
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,268
She's so peaceful.

294
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,645
[Rain] I know.

295
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,774
No, Rain, I keep…
I keep putting her in this shit.

296
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:40,194
You didn't get her into nothing.
We gonna be okay. We gonna get out of--

297
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,320
Uh-uh. Don't.

298
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,656
Don't say nothing with him around.

299
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,199
[Rain] I'm not.

300
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,992
'Cause you know he's listening.

301
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,786
I know.

302
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,830
[Kimmie] But we're getting out of here.

303
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,082
Yeah.

304
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,043
But you do need to ask him about the car.

305
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,711
And… And the keys.

306
00:13:59,129 --> 00:13:59,964
[Rain] Yeah.

307
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,132
[Kimmie] Do you know how you gonna do it?

308
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,385
You know I know how to do that.

309
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,971
[Kimmie] All right.
I'll see you when you get back.

310
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,556
-Bye.
-All right.

What… What y'all looking at?

I'm not talking to you.

318
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,743
Come on, hurry up!

319
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,207
Y'all trying to act like
you ain't seen me sittin' here?

No, we were--
I was actually coming up to say bye.

321
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,256
And laugh.

322
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,301
[spluttering] Why would I laugh?

323
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,345
Ah, you such a fake ass.

324
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,599
Ma'am? [scoffs]

325
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:57,938
You know what? You got one more damn time
to call me "ma'am."

326
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:02,276
'Cause I… I know you think
that shit is funny, don't you?

327
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,153
No, I don't. It's a form of respect.

328
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,656
No, it's not.
You were talking about my age.

329
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,824
I was not.

330
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,870
Think yo ass is such hot shit.

331
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,457
You keep living, if you can.

332
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,667
Miss Olivia, we're gonna get out of here.

333
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:24,131
You wait for me at the fucking front door.
Okay? Right over there.

334
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,842
You skedaddle, bitch.

335
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,724
You ain't shit.

336

And you ain't never gonna be shit.

337
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,562
Just 'cause you… you…

338

[chuckling] I can get
a lot of youngins just like you.

No, better than your ass,
'cause you been slipping, you know.

And… And get… get… get my purse.

Right down here.
I can't bend down to get it.

342
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,995
Will you get the f… damn purse?

343

-[sighs]
-God, I have to ask shit a dozen damn…

344
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,463
And you, you find your way home,

345
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:08,258
'cause you ain't driving
the car that I bought you.

346
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,885
Not tonight.

347
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:18,268
I'm telling you somethin', little nigga,
don't you knock on my door tonight.

348
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,356
Unless I call you. [scoffs]

349
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,067
I said wait! I'm coming.

350
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,111
You…

351
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,323
You are driving me home,

352
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,368
'cause that little nigga
done pissed me off.

353
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:40,541
You… You know these little young,
big dick motherfuckers ain't loyal.

354
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,376
They ain't loyal.

355
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,378
Come on, I need you to take me home.

356
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,757
Miss Bellarie, he's taking me home,
so you can ride with us.

357
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,636
Where do you live?

358
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,805
He lives downtown.

359
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,350
I'm talking to him.

360
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,145
I live, uh, downtown.

361
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,022
Chicago?

362
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,607
Yeah.

363
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,571
And you gonna drive her
all the way to Indiana?

364
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,616
Yes, ma'am.

365
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,166
[scoffs]

366
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,002
You two are fucking.

367
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,464
And I'm gonna tell my son.

368
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,551
-No, ma'am, we're not.
-Oh, sure, yes, you are. Yes, you are.

369
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,178
She got a driver.

370
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,972
What would she need you for?

371
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,682
Roy got rid of my driver.

372
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,687
Just shut up. You such a fake ass lying…

373
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,567
I want you to drive me home, okay?

374
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,320
Because that little nigga pissed me off.

375
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,490
You know what? I bought him that car.

376
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,786
But I swear, I'm telling you,
he gonna… he gonna die in it.

377
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:03,082
Pissing me off. Listen, Mallory,
we will see you tomorrow.

378
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:03,999
Come on.

379
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,460
No, no, no, Miss Bellarie,
we'll drive you together.

380
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,544
Hmm, yes.

381
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,298
Fake ass…

382
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,509
[whispering] Thank you.

383
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,472
[Alex] I'm sorry about Angel.

384
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,308
[Rain sighs] Yeah.

385
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,477
I know how much
he meant to you and Kimmie.

386
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,854
Okay.

387
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,733
You're not gonna give me an inch, are you?

388
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,196
Okay.

389
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,698
How long you been driving him?

390
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,244
I've been driving him for a while.

391
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:49,253
So… if I wanted to go
for a drive by myself,

392
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,964
what would I need to do?

393
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,259
Well, I, uh…

394
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,137
[Rain] What?

395
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,515
I just haven't really seen
anybody do that.

396
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,724
What you mean?

397
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,937
Look, all the houses
are on the private road.

398
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,357
If you go out the main gate,
you gotta get out the private road,

399
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,900
and they have that monitored.

400
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,445
So…

401
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,491
it's like a prison. We're stuck there.

402
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,203
I wouldn't say that.

403
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,415
What, 'cause it's more sophisticated?

404
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,754
Um, I'm just saying
they stop people on the road.

405
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:42,431
[sighs] So… Kimmie and I
can't just go for a drive?

406
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,851
They'll have you tailed.

407
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,646
She was right. We are trapped.

408
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,609
Look, I'm just telling you what I know.

409
00:19:55,277 --> 00:20:00,073
So since you know so much,
why did Horace give the word on Angel?

410
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,701
I don't know.

411
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,120
[sighs] Okay.

412
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,748
But I can find out.

413
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,916
[suspenseful music playing]

414
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,833
How?

415
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,462
You know Officer Trackson will tell me.

416
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,422
All right.

417
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,216
Call him.

418
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,718
Yeah.

419
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,803
[suspenseful music continues]

420
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,223
[line ringing]

421
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,265
Speaker.

422
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,351
[line rings louder]

423
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,353
At the tone, please record your message.

424
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,104
-It's voicemail.
-[voicemail beeps]

425
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,815
Yo Tracks, this is Officer Alex.
Give me a call when you get this.

426
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,900
I got a question.

427
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,694
[unsettling music playing]

428
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,738
[both sigh]

429
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,700
[bugs chirring]

430
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,118
[dogs barking]

431
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,204
[music stops]

432
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,831
[Kimmie breathing shakily]

433
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,083
-Sylvie.
-Hm?

434
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,252
[Sylvie groans]

435
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,296
-Sylvie, you need to get up.
-[groans] What?

436
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:01,468
I don't… Oh, this bed
is so comfortable, Kimmie.

437
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,595
I know, but um…

438
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,764
[inhales sharply] We, uh…

439
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,516
[Sylvie] What?

440
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,351
[tense music playing]

441
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,728
[sighs] Don't tell me we need to leave.
I don't wanna.

442
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,357
Sylvie, it's for the best, okay?

443
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,859
So that's all we're gonna do?

444
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,530
We just gonna be
running around all the time?

445
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,200
No, we're not… We're not running.

446
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,911
-I just think--
-What?

447
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,413
Just… Just say it.

448
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,416
We're not safe here.

449
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,461
[scoffs, inhales deeply]

450
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,964
That… That man
is not gonna hurt you.

451
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,925
You don't know him.

452
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,052
I can see it in his eyes.
He's not gonna hurt you.

453
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:44,970
Sylvie.

454
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,890
I know our stepdad,

455
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,893
and I do not see that in his eyes.

456
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,689
You don't know this life.

457
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,401
Well, how will I know
if you don't tell me it?

458
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:04,072
All you need to know
is that we need to go.

459
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,703
Look, I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me what I need to be afraid of.

460
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,830
Sylvie, why are you making this so hard?

461
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,582
I'm not going.

462
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,628
[inhales sharply] These people
are not good people.

463
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,255
All right?

464
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,258
I've been around bad people before.

465
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,471
Not like this. Not like them.

466
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,015
Like I wasn't at the club?

467
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,769
Kimmie, they were trying
to have the men rape me.

468
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,105
And I'm sorry.

469
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,483
[Sylvie] So…

470
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,570
you… you just owe me the truth.
I'm not a child.

471
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,448
What do you wanna know?

472
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,825
Don't do that.

473
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,494
Just tell me everything.

474
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,500
[breathing shakily]

475
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,668
After Mama kicked me out,

476
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:03,799
me, Rain, and Angel got caught up.

477
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:09,429
We were at an airport selling drugs,
and we got caught.

478
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,391
The police officer that arrested us

479
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,686
said we could either go to jail,
or we could work for him.

480
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,356
So we chose to work for him.

481
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,111
He had us strip,

482
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,030
have sex with people,

483
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,532
all kind of things.

484
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,829
One of the men who I…

485
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,706
worked for…

486
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,625
was Roy.

487
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,755
Horace has a son named Roy.

488
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,799
That's the one.

489
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,594
Hold on… No, he's married to Mallory.

490
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,723
[tense music playing]

491
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,475
You wanted the truth.

492
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,811
Go on.

493
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:03,108
So… Horace isn't even into women.

494
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,360
He's into Angel.

495
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:10,365
And he would come to the club,
and I would get Angel for him.

496
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:15,620
And then Horace
had this crazy scheme to marry me

497
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,874
because he doesn't want his sons
to have the company.

498
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,586
So he's not in love with you?

499
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,797
This is business.

500
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,341
No, no. This is crazy.

501
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,342
No, no, no.

502
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,595
You wanted to hear the truth.

503
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,933
What's crazy is that
Angel must have pissed him off,

504
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,935
because Horace had him killed.

505
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:39,853
What?

506
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,646
[snaps fingers] Just like that.

507
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:47,068
And he will do the same to us
if one of us pisses him off.

508
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,614
He don't seem like
that kind of man, Kimmie. He don't.

509
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,032
[scoffs]

510
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:57,370
You have so much to learn,
little sister. Okay?

511
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,208
Now, I put money in your account.

512
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:06,338
You need to pack what little you can,
and I mean little,

513
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,800
and we are getting the hell out of here
as soon as Rain gets back.

514
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,179
Are we clear?

515
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,181
[breathes deeply]

516
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:19,935
Yes.

517
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,854
So wipe those tears from your eye.

518
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,773
You wanted the truth.

519
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,358
[sniffling]

520
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,068
This is the truth.

521
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,278
[Sylvie sniffles]

522
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,158
[Sylvie weeping quietly]

523
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,830
[fast-paced suspenseful music playing]

524
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,833
[indistinct chatter]

525
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,210
[siren chirps]

526
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,880
[woman] Get across the street!

527
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,976
[siren wailing]

528
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:08,942
Hello?

529
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:09,859
Yo.

530
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,154
-That's what you called me to say?
-I tried to call you earlier.

531
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,824
I was busy. What is it?

532
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,286
-Delinda's son just came up here.
-Her son?

533
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,663
Yeah, uh, it's, uh… uh, Giovanni?

534
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,915
I didn't know she had a son.

535
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:28,003
Yeah, man. He, uh, said that
she got a will and that he wanna get his.

536
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,379
[scoffs]

537
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,300
What was that raggedy bitch
doing with a will?

538
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,343
I don't know, man.
People surprise you nowadays.

539
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,511
[Jules] What'd he want?

540
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,597
[Trackson] That he wanted
to get in her office.

541
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,348
And you didn't, right?

542
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,516
[Trackson] Hell no.

543
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,811
Good. Good.

544
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,189
You're proving more and more
to be a good soldier.

545
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,482
That's me for real.

546
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,318
[Jules] What else he say?

547
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,820
That, uh, he was gonna come up here
with a lawyer or something.

548
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,447
[Jules] A lawyer?

549
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:01,536
I need you to make sure
you look into this kid real good.

550
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,455
I got you. I got you.

551
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,874
-Good.
-All right.

552
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,753
[exhales]

553
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,380
[unsettling music playing]

554
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,091
[sighs]

555
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,640
[line ringing]

556
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,975
Norman.

557
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,560
What?

558
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,853
[Jules] This is a mess.

559
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,399
Yeah? Okay.

560
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,068
Have you looked at the news?

561
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,527
[Norman] Oh, it's on there?

562
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,112
It's everywhere.

563
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,198
[Norman chuckling] Wow.

564
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,533
I told you to let me handle it.

565
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,119
Yeah, well, you know how I do.

566
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:47,540
[Jules] Yeah. We just gonna keep doing
the same thing over and over again.

567
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,003
And get the same result.

568
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:52,962
Exactly.

569
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,881
Chaos.

570
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,842
Yeah, well, look,
if that's all you got, man, um,

571
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,928
I need to get some sleep, all right?

572
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,346
You know…

573
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:04,891
you better hope--

574
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,518
[Norman] What? I better what?

575
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:11,481
We better hope that this cleans it all up.

576
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,692
Yeah, it does, okay?

577
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,402
[Jules] Are you sure?

578
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:21,574
Jules, unlike you, I know how
to take care of my business, all right?

579
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,410
[Jules] I hope so.

580
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,621
But you know the club
is in Delinda's name, right?

581
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,622
[Norman] And?

582
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,916
Her son came by.

583
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:30,959
[chuckling] Okay.

584
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,211
He's talking about selling it.

585
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,588
To who?

586
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,092
Doesn't matter.
We can't be anywhere near it.

587
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,218
[Norman] Huh.

588
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,304
Well, go talk to him.

589
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,599
You know how to be persuasive.

590
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,687
Norman, let--

591
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,857
[siren wailing]

592
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,654
[Yolanda] Yeah, it's all good.

593
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,989
[door closes]

594
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,575
-Um, I'm gonna call you back.
-[man] Hang up the phone.

595
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,870
What is it?

596
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,705
They shot Angel.

597
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,789
What?

598
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,877
Yeah, he… he… he was at a bus stop,
and they fucking shot him.

599
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,045
-Who? [shuddering]
-I don't know.

600
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,756
[breathing shakily] Is he dead?

601
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,217
[whimpering] What? Oh.

602
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,803
Oh, shit, he was telling me to run.

603
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,805
Wait, what do you mean
he was telling you to run?

604
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,265
We… We gotta get you out of here.

605
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,309
[sobbing] I, um…

606
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:32,395
No, no, no. Listen, listen,
you don't know what he was running from.

607
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,938
These people are dangerous.

608
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,565
-Yeah, but, we don't…
-No.

609
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,651
He said that they were coming here,
so we need to go, okay?

610
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,196
-[blubbering]
-Hey. Hey, you're not listening to me.

611
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,573
-Wait!
-Yolanda, we have to go right now.

612
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,700
Is he really dead?

613
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,869
Let's go.

614
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:53,041
[crying]

615
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,752
[tense music playing]

616
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,671
Am I dead?

617
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,882
Are… What?

618
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,926
Am I dead?

619
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,136
No.

620
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,972
I'm so sorry.

621
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,766
For what?

622
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,352
I had you killed.

623
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,481
-What?
-[chuckles]

624
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,276
-So you really are an angel.
-No, what'd you say?

625
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,323
-Angel.
-Yeah, yeah, man. What'd you say?

626
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,787
I don't know what kind of drugs
they got your ass on.

627
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,542
What the hell's going on?
How are you here?

628
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,169
No, what'd you say about having me killed?

629
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,965
[spluttering] I… I… I don't know
what you're… you're talking about. What…

630
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,050
How… How are you here?

631
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,219
[siren wailing]

632
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,679
You know what? Fuck this shit.

633
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:51,057
No, wait, wait. If you walk out that door,
you are dead.

634
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,602
Are you saying you tried
to have me killed? That was you?

635
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,397
No.

636
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,232
Okay, well, you said you just did.

637
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,942
So, what are you… what are you saying?

638
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,987
-What happened?
-I don't know, nigga, you tell me.

639
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,740
Nigga, I'm not doing this shit. Tell me.

640
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,703
I was at the bus stop, and I got ambushed.

641
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,623
But someone fell on top of me,
so I played dead.

642
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,209
Shit.

643
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,919
But you just said you did it.

644
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:24,716
Look, they told me
I needed to give them somebody

645
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,593
so I could clear Kimmie.

646
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,969
So you gave them me?

647
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,723
I didn't know who that somebody was.

648
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,725
Why were you in jail?

649
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,394
'Cause I was at the car,
and I got arrested.

650
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,647
-Got it.
-[scoffs]

651
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,359
So you said it was okay to kill me.

652
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,069
Did I stutter?

653
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,573
Okay.

654
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:52,535
But if you walk out that door,
and they find you,

655
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,079
you are dead.

656
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:59,459
You better stay with me
until I get this all clear.

657
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,629
Or until I pin it on somebody else.

658
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,424
No, no, no. They're after my son
and my baby mama. I'm not staying here.

659
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,594
They're not gonna touch them.
They… They think you're dead.

660
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,305
Are you sure?
'Cause Jules just threatened them.

661
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,222
Jules?

662
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,224
Yeah, he threatened to kill 'em.

663
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,685
Where are they?

664
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,813
I don't know. That crazy-ass bitch
won't listen to me.

665
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,649
-[sighs]
-So what do I do?

666
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,904
Okay, uh, give me your address. Now.

667
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,781
Are you sure?

668
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,700
Look, nigga,
we ain't got a lot of time. Come on.

669
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,205
Yeah, I mean, I… I got it on my phone.

670
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,082
Can I, uh… Can I use your charger?

671
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,044
You trying to set me up?

672
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,004
[siren wailing]

673
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,339
It's a charger, man.

674
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,805
[Olivia] This is a real nice car.

675
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,974
Thank you, ma'am.

676
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,477
How much did it cost?

677
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,437
Uh, it's a lease.

678
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:06,234
[scoffs] That… That ain't
answering the question.

679
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,447
It didn't cost that much money, ma'am.

680
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,658
You lyin'.

681
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:17,286
[chuckling] We pay your ass
too much money.

682
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,957
I have other clients, ma'am.

683
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,419
Yeah. Whatever.

684
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:31,801
You know, I… I wish my… my son Charles

685
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,846
was strong like you.

686
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,264
Okay.

687
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:41,144
You know, I don't know
why in the hell that boy turned gay.

688
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,229
How's the church going?

689
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,815
[trip-hop music playing]

690
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,608
You trying to be funny?

691
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,737
-No, I was just, um--
-You just what?

692
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,781
I… I was just wondering.

693
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,742
Ah, you trying to be funny.

694
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,660
Nope, not at all.

695
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,498
I… I… I used to be like you.

696
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:07,962
All dressed up every day
when I came into the office.

697
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,299
[chuckles] I was fire, bitch.

698
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,592
[chuckles]

699
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,801
