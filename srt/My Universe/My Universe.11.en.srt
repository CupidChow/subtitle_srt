00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,360
♫Just a single glance, from your eyes straight to mine,♫

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,920
♫and my heart starts to melt.♫

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,840
♫As I come closer, I talk to you,♫

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,160
♫ I tremble, till I'm almost breathless.♫

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,200
♫ A restlessness overwhelms me, losing myself in the tide.♫

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,520
♫Is this what they call symptoms of love,♫

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,800
♫It happens every moment,♫

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
♫when I get a glimpse of you,♫

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,880
♫Are you feeling like me, perhaps,♫

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,920
♫A burning, restless whirl within the heart, do you feel so?♫

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,680
♫Every symptom shows, do you tremble too, just how much,♫

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,240
♫Feeling good, alike maybe?♫

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,440
♫then we can weight the chances in our hearts,♫

♫Are you feeling like me, perhaps,♫

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,960
♫As if I can't control myself,♫

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,920

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,480
♫Tell me, when I meet you,♫

18
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:19,680
♫Are your thoughts the same as mine,♫

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,400
♫ that we are in love?♫

20
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,400
[Camp, we can't go see you anymore.]

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,000
[Had a little trouble at Jeh-Mek's bar last night.]

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,960
Huh!?
Are you out of your mind?

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,520
It's not funny!
Are you trying to piss me off?

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,039
[Sorry, man. Can't make it.]

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,280
Can't make it? Seriously?
Why the sudden change?

26
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,560
No, wait.
Why am I the only one who didn’t know?

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,400
[Chill, dude.]

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,160
Chill?
I’m not heated.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,560
Just get over here.

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,280
[Sorry, really.
I'll buy you drinks at Jeh-mek's next time.]

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,560
Drinks?
I don't even drink!

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,000
Better come,
or say goodbye to our thesis collab.

33
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,920
[Aww, come on, mate!
It's just not possible today.]

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,520
[Think of it as a mini-vacay.]

35
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,760
[Plus, you'll finally meet that person you've been chatting with.
It's been months, right?]

36
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,079
[Enjoy your trip.
You might even find your cutie better half there.]

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,120
Cutie!? What the heck?
I'm giving you a chance here.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,560
Okay, you get one free hit.
But we're still on for the thesis, right?

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,800
Nah,
crossing all your names out.

40
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,640
And not coming because
you’re with your girlfriend, right?

41
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,480
I'll complain to your mom
for leaving me alone here.

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,440
[Alright, alright! I’ll tell your dad too,
that you're off with some guy.]

43
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,560
You'd do that to me?

44
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,800
Just scout out the thesis spot, okay?
Cheers, mate!

45
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,280
Darn it!

46
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,320
[You have a new message from C.]

47
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,720
[C: I'm here.]

48
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,280
[C: I'm here.]
[Camp: My friends just bailed on me. It's just me now.]

49
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,720
[Camp: If you feel uncomfortable, feel free to leave. I’m sorry.]

50
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,600
[Camp: If you feel uncomfortable, feel free to leave. I'm sorry.]
[C: I came here for you. Let's meet.]

51
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,160
[C: I'm near the massive tree inside. Avoid the entrance drama.
Bad vibes there.]

52
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,080
[Camp: Got it ^_^]

53
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,040
Talay!

54
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
You're Camp?

55
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,320
Talay: How's life?
Camp: How'd you sneak in here, badass?

56
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,600
Badass?

57
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,280
Yep, Mr. Badass.

58
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,320
Wait, I am your senior.

59
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,320
Yeah, I know.

60
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,159
I graduated after you.

61
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,400
Also, I'm older than you.

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,080
Yeah!
Just by a few months, right?

63
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,600
Not even a full year.

64
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,480
Asking for it?

65
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,880
I'm just stating facts.

66
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,520
You used to be formal.
Earlier you even called me nicely huh?

67
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,320
Why so fuckin demanding?

68
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,720
You hadn't respected me either.

69
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,200
So, why can't I call you badass?

70
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,160
Ah, you're the guy on the phone
causing a scene at the entrance.

71
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,520
Not true!

72
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,159
How the heck did you get here?

73
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,960
Who's your company?

74
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,960
June!

75
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Looking for her?

76
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,080
You’re annoying!

77
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,920
Keep your distance!

78
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,760
[I'm here, carrying a guitar on the dock].

79
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
Why did you come back?

80
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,120
Oh shit!

81
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,200
I wasn't expecting you.

82
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
You can leave, you know?

83
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,040
I like traveling alone.

84
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,520
Why should I leave?
I like traveling alone too.

85
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,280
You're free to leave if you wish.

86
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,640
Too distant?

87
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't want to be close.

88
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,560
Maybe you should back off more?

89
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,559
If I could, I would.

90
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,440
Annoying kid!

91
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
So vain!

92
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,640
Oh, so damn free.

93
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,600
What do you suggest?

94
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,640
Need help, kiddo?

95
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,600
Oh, I'm perfectly all right man!

96
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,200
Just relax and keep those joints safe.

97
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,040
When you stretched earlier,
it sounded like cracks.

98
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,240
Geezer!

99
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,840
Got noodles and eggs here!

100
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,680
Vendor: Want anything?
Talay: Hello!

101
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,360
Can I get two instant noodles
and two eggs, please?

102
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,880
Sure thing.
Want different flavors?

103
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,640
Here you go,
seafood and Tom Yum.

104
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
And two eggs for you.

105
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,280
Got some chopsticks here too.

106
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,040
It’s 60 baht.

107
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Here it is.

108
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,520
Watch out for those eggs. You look so good.
Hope to see you around.

109
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,240
[Camp!]

110
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,880
[Camp!]

111
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,680
[Gotcha!]

112
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,840
You look like you've seen a ghost.

113
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,560
Scared, huh?

114
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,080
What?
I wasn't scared.

115
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,920
See this face?
Is this how a scared person looks?

116
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,280
Don't be scared!

117
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,000
I'll take care of you.

118
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,280
What's wrong with you?

119
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,840
What’re you doing?

120
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,360
Shouldn't I be asking you?
Why'd you grab me?

121
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,960
You were moaning like a puppy.

122
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,280
That's why I grabbed you
to see if everything was okay.

123
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,240
Who said I needed help?

124
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,360
Really?

125
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,480
You were shivering.
I thought you were cold.

126
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,520
Then suddenly, you screamed.

127
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,920
I thought it was a ghost.

128
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,760
So, what happened?

129
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,640
Bad dream?

130
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,520
Yeah.

131
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,160
It's alright, kiddo.

132
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,520
Your big bro's here.

133
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,080
Jeez, give here.

134
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,600
Step aside!

135
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,720
Can't even start a fire?

136
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,240
Watch yourself first, big bro.

137
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,880
Actually, I could have done it

138
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Talay: Just trying to...
Camp: Doesn't matter to me.

139
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
I was just finding the angle.

140
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,200
It’s up to you.

141
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,480
I don’t want to know.

142
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,280
[Camp!]

143
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,040
[Camp!]

144
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,800
Forgot your flashlight?

145
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,440
Got a flash on my phone.

146
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,400
Isn't it heavy bringing it?

147
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,360
And the guitar wasn't?

148
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,320
I'm off.

149
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,680
That gang is a real drag.

150
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,480
I haven't had a bite yet.
Hope you guys run into a ghost.

151
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,160
What?

152
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,800
Shower together?

153
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,320
Why would I do that with you?

154
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,880
Got other friends?

155
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,280
I can go alone.

156
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,520
But it's across the field.

157
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,440
And...

158
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,920
there’s no light.

159
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,360
[Camp: Damn it!]

160
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,200
[Camp: What the heck is this!]

161
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,240
You lead.

162
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,880
Alright.

163
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,280
No lights.

164
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,960
Barely any water.

165
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,600
This is the only bathroom I can use?

166
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,560
Complaining too much?

167
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,840
Any bucket there?

168
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,400
Can you pass it?

169
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,160
Nah.
I just used my hands.

170
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,440
Camp!
C'mon, your room has a bucket!

171
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,320
Just hand it over!

172
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,400
Shampoo's in my eyes.
I'll return it soon.

173
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,440
I said, hands.

174
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
What on earth are you doing?

175
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,720
Hey!

176
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,520
Talay!

177
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,280
You still there?

178
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,280
Man!

179
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,520
Oh, damn it!
You took off already?

180
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,680
Don't hog all the water!

181
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,440
I'm not done yet.

182
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,680
Pass it!
I still need it.

183
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,120
Oh, shit!

184
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,760
Can you tell me
if it is a flashlight?

185
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
Holy shit!

186
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,400
What the heck are you doing?

187
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,880
Why’d you touch it then?

188
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,040
You harass me!

189
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,280
You're the one harassing me.
breaking into my bathroom like this.

190
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,040
And what's with the erection?

191
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,320
What’re you talking?

192
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,840
I'm not erect yet.

193
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,360
In this this cold, are you?

194
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,880
Out of the way!

195
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,080
Move!

196
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,960
Damn bragger!

197
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,240
Are you kidding?
I've got bigger to show but I don’t.

198
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,880
[Mimic]
I've got bigger to show but I don’t.

199
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,960
[Why did you touch it then?]

200
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,960
[You harass me!]

201
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,040
[You're the one harassing me.]
Breaking into my bathroom like this.]

202
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,680
And what's with the erection?

203
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,080
I'm not erect yet.

204
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,040
In this this cold, are you?

205
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,680
Uh, so...

206
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,680
Ever camp solo before?

207
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,600
Twice.

208
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,040
Counting this one,
it’s my third time then.

209
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,480
How about you?

210
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,120
First time.

211
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,840
I knew it.
You look like I felt my first time.

212
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,000
Were it that bad the first time?

213
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,080
Probably worse than this.

214
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,840
Worse than this, huh?

215
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,800
Yeah, right.

216
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,400
Weird, right?

217
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,600
I just realized we can talk nicely without arguing.

218
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,680
Why the name C.?

219
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,800
From the chat?

220
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,560
Yeah!

221
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,760
Sounds like the sea [Talay].

222
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
With an S though.

223
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,800
Isn’t it the same?

224
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,280
But yours is with a C.

225
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,000
But you pronounce it as sea, anyway.

226
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,320
Yeah!

227
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,880
But I didn't know it referred to you.

228
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
You never asked.

229
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,920
But deep down,
you knew it was me, right?

230
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,960
Nonsense!
How was I supposed to?

231
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,960
I had a hunch.
But it seemed unlikely.

232
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:42,920
We never share photos or social networks, so...

233
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
What's so funny?

234
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,040
Suddenly, I remembered when taking a shower.

235
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,320
You were yelling forever.
Couldn't see?

236
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,760
Yeah,
my eyes sting so much.

237
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,680
You had a bucket,
and you didn't let me use it.

238
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
I just wanted to tease you.

239
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,760
You know I was scared the whole time.

240
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,080
You scared?

241
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,640
A little.

242
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,200
It was funny though.

243
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,840
Are you hungry?

244
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,760
I hear there's BBQ here.
Shall we eat?

245
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,720
That's my stomach talking.

246
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,480
Bro, wanna join me for some BBQ?

247
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,560
Bro?

248
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,320
You’re calling me 'bro' now?

249
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,840
Yeah!

250
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,520
If you're not hungry,
I'll just eat by myself.

251
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,200
Can you call me 'bro' again?

252
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,360
Talay: Come on, call me 'bro,' please!
Camp: Cut it out, you're being annoying.

253
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,920
Seriously, just call me 'bro.'
Quick!

254
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,760
This campground is a disaster.

255
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,120
The store’s closed.

256
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,200
No bucket in the bathroom.

257
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,760
There are even ghosts.

258
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,840
Ghosts?
I haven't seen anything.

259
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,240
If you want a hug,
just say so.

260
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,880
Eww!
Who said I wanted a hug?

261
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,400
I'll peel the egg for you.

262
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,280
Did you bring eggs too?

263
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,960
I bought them while the shop was still open.

264
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,840
Let's eat together.

265
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,840
You go ahead and eat.
I'll peel the egg for you.

266
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,640
I'll peel another one for you.
Ouch!

267
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,880
It’s hot.

268
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,680
Here, I'll do it for you.

269
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,360
Give me that!

270
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Look at this!
Your fingers are turning red.

271
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,120
They might blister.

272
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,480
♫Is this what they call symptoms of love,♫

273
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,400
♫It happens every moment,♫

274

♫when I get a glimpse of you,♫

275
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,400
This might help a bit.

276
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,280
♫Are you feeling like me, perhaps,♫

277
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,640
♫A burning, restless whirl within the heart, do you feel so?♫

278
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,520
♫Every symptom shows, do you tremble too, just how much,♫

279
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,120

00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,520

287
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,480
You're such a newbie!

288
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,840
I know.

289
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,640
If you'd let me help from the start,
you'd be snoozing by now.

290
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,640
Well, if you wanted to help,
you could have just jumped in.

291
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,800
In daylight,
you treat me like a stray dog.

292
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,280
If I jumped in without asking,
I'd get bitten,

293
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,920
I'm human.

294
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,160
Are you still scared of the dark?

295
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,280
If I could overcome it,
I would.

296
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,440
When I found out in the chat,
I didn’t think you'd be this scared.

297
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,200
It takes me back to that time
in the storage room.

298
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,680
When you mentioned a close mate
afraid of the dark in our chat,

299
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,200
was that about me?

300
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,720
Back then, it didn't feel like we were close.

301
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,800
I wished we could've been closer,
if it weren't for the June matter.

302
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,000
We both had a crush on the same girl,
what were our options?

303
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,400
Chasing after the same girl
so intensely...

304
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,880
Every time we've met,
it's always been on bad terms.

305
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,360
What were we supposed to do?

306
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,840
June’s genuinely beautiful.

307
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,360
And she has a great personality,
so incredibly charming.

308
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,080
Exactly!

309
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,800
That's why I like her.

310
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,280
I really did.

311
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,720
Hmm, I see.

312
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,960
But you ended up dating her.

313
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,520
How did that go?

314
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,960
I’m kinda jealous.

315
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,520
Are you upset or something?

316
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,240
No, I’m not.

317
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,760
Just jealousy.

318
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,880
I'm also curious...

319
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,520
If I had been the one dating her,

320
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,120
what would you have been that day?

321
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,120
Are you still angry?

322
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,280
I’m not.

323
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,680
It's not anyone's fault.

324
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,120
What could we have done?
She made her choice.

325
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,000
Hey,
are we seriously rehashing this?

326
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,440
Why?

327
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,800
You're the one who kept bringing her up.

328
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,400
Me?

329
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,680
Since I got here,
I haven't mentioned her at all.

330
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,280
Why?

331
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,080
What's wrong with her name?

332
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,800
Don't act like you never liked her.

333
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,960
I won't lie about it.

334
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,240
And I admit,
I'm into guys now.

335
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,720
But I wouldn't bring up an ex
when meeting someone new.

336
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,440
Someone new?

337
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,480
Excuse me!

338
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,520
We're not labeling anything yet.

339
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,200
Are you assuming?

340
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,720
Hold up!
We've been chatting for quite a while.

341
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,200
All those "I miss you" texts,
were they just for fun?

342
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,480
Okay, got it.

343
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,480
It’s good to know.

344
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,000
I'll mingle with others.

345
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,000
It’s your call.

346
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,520
You can do it now.

347
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:12,960
Go for it!

348
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,120
Don't dare!

349
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,600
♫Do you know how challenging it is?♫

350
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:45,080
♫Countless millennia, not knowing when we’ll meet similar stars.♫

351

353
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:06,280
♫You transform the misty air into the sweet scent of flowers.♫

354
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,160
♫You change the silent stars into those from my dreams,♫

355
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,240

♫in a universe filled with love.♫

361
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,400
What's up?

362
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,840
Why did you rush in here like that?

363
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,840
There's someone outside.

364
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,120
Their feet were bloody.

365
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,320
I don't see anything.

366
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,840
You're delusional.

367
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,880
I saw it, I swear!

368
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,280
A ghost, maybe.

369
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,360
Stop it!
It's creeping me out.

370
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,520
Maybe you really did see...

371
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,080
Talay: an actual ghost!
Camp: I said stop. I’m scared.

372
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,600
If you want to sleep in my tent,
just tell me.

373
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,200
Oh, who would think of that
at a time like this?

374
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,520
Talay: Here, come closer.
Camp: Ugh, no!

375
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,440
Back off.
You're more terrifying than any ghost!

376
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,400
I saw you were scared,

377
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,080
just trying to cheer you up.

378
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,800
But for real,
someone's out there.

379
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,640
Alright,

380
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,440
I believe you.

381
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,400
Sleep already.

382
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,920
You're safe here.

383
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,520
[C: I'm right beside you.
Don’t be scared!]

384
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:02,920
Camp!

385
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,960
Did you close the door?

386
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,320
The door can't be closed.

387
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,040
If you close it, it will lock.

388
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,920
It needs to be opened from outside.

389
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,040
I wasn't aware.

390
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,080
No doubt.

391
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,640
With your dumb face,
how would you know anything?

392
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,240
And your face seems very smart, huh?

393
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,720
Bright enough to see in the dark.

394
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,120
Whoa!

395
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,840
You can see that in this dark?

396
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,880
My face must be very impressive.

397
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,040
Oh, it is...

398
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,960
but in a bad way.

399
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:53,920
Don’t be afraid!

400
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,560
Your big brother is here.

401
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,880
I'm not afraid at all.

402
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,560
Why're you sneaking around
in this old room?

403
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,920
Grabbing some cones.

404
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,080
They’re for a PE test.

405
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,320
And you?

406
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,320
Napping.

407
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,440
Manop's class, right?

408
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,320
Skipping the class again?

409
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:39,960
How'd you know?

410
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:44,960
June's in there.

411
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,160
They mix grades in that class.

412
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:00,920
You're well-informed.

413
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:02,800
Why?

414
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,640
Into June?

415
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,080
Thought you had eyes for me?

416
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,360
People like you,
stop bullying me and my friends.

417
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,600
If I stop bullying,
will you have feelings for me?

418
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,400
♫Just a single glance, from your eyes straight to mine,♫

419
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:09,520
♫and my heart starts to melt.♫

[Next episode]
Do you really like June?

424
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,320
Why did you break up with her?

425
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,960
Who said I was dating June?

426
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,840
So, when I was courting June,
you two weren't together?

427
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,000
So why didn't you tell me?

428
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,400
I didn't see the point in telling.

429
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,960
What the hell's wrong with you?

430
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,720
You disrespect me again.

431
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,880
Help!

432
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,720
Camp!

433
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,800
Talay!
