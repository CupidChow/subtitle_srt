00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,000
♫Just a single glance, from your eyes straight to mine,♫

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,840
♫and my heart starts to melt.♫

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,880
♫As I come closer, I talk to you,♫

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,200
♫ I tremble, till I'm almost breathless.♫

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,240
♫ A restlessness overwhelms me, losing myself in the tide.♫

00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,560
♫Is this what they call symptoms of love,♫

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,880
♫It happens every moment,♫

8

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,880
♫Are you feeling like me, perhaps,♫

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,480
♫A burning, restless whirl within the heart, do you feel so?♫

♫Every symptom shows, do you tremble too, just how much,♫

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,120

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,880

[Meen: Why didn't you answer the phone?]

[Meen: Why didn’t you answer the phone?]
[Meen: Who are you with?]

22
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,440
[Meen: Why didn’t you answer the phone?]
[Meen: Who are you with?]
[Meen: Will you keep not answering me?]

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,120
[Red Cloud]

24
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Thank you,
I hope you come back soon.

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,680
We are closed...

26
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,600
Oh, Meen!

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
Why are you so drunk?

28
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,720
Where's Noll?

29
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,800
Come up first.

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,880
Come on up.

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,240
Why like this?

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,720
Sit here!

33
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,920
I’ll get you some water.

34
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,400
Have his first to sober up.

35
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,280
How did you drive here in this state?

36
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,160
It's a miracle you didn't die on the way.

37
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,040
Don't let me see this again.

38
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,480
So, what’s going on here?

39
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,920
Share with me...

40
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,880
I broke up with Noll.

41
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,720
What?!
How come?

42
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,800
He didn't care about me.

43
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,200
He disappeared for days,

44
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,440
didn't answer calls or texts.

45
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,800
So I broke up with him.

46
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,760
Hold on!

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,120
Did you broke up because of just this?

48
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,320
Should you go talk to him first?

49
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,640
It’s not just this.

50
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,839
Damn people saw him with someone else.

51
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,880
Asshole!

52
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,440
Promiscuous!

53
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,280
He's been fucking around!

54
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Darn it!

55
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,040
If that’s true, then just quit.

56
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,320
Seriously, Noll? I’ve always supporting you.

57
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,000
Why so absurd?

58
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,720
Hey, Meen!
You should count yourself fortunate.

59
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,480
Thanks God!

60
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,159
Come here!

61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,360
It’s alright.
Just let it go!

62
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,040
For you, it’s not hard to find someone new.

63
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,280
I don’t want to find anyone anymore.

64
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,440
Jeh-Mek: Alright!
Meen: That's bullshit!

65
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,680
Then don’t find.

66
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,880
When the time is right,
you’ll find the right one.

67
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,760
But for now,
eat before the soup gets cold.

68
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,120
What’s this?

69
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,440
It´s called Kiam Boey Moo Sab.
(Minced pork with sour plum soup)

70
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,560
Huh?

71
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
Kiam Boey Moo Sab.

72
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,360
It is made by my new chef.

73
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,920
He’s only been working for a few days.

74
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,440
At first, I asked him what his best dish was.

75
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,640
So, he suggested this one.

76
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,680
Never had one this delicious elsewhere.

77
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,200
He could do it so aromatic, delicious and so mellow.

78
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,520
I think I could use it as a new recommended menu

79
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,760
Do you think so?

80
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,840
Wow, it tastes good.

81
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,680
I never had anything like it before.

82
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,600
Anyway, where did the old chef go?

83
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,720
Darn it, it’s so annoying.

84
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,560
The old chef has left suddenly without notice.

85
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,520
Luckily I found a new one to replace him.

86
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,000
Right!
Is this clashing year or what?

87
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,240
There is only bullshit.

88
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,520
Makes me want to vomit.

89
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,320
Hang on, Meen!

90
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,720
I only allowed you to eat,
not to vomit here!

91
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,159
Go vomit outside!

92
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,159
Go out,
don’t throw up in here.

93
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,480
Go, Dude!

94
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,640
Damn it!

95
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,680
Hey! What are you doing?

96
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,760
What's it to you?

97
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,400
It's my bike.

98
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,680
That’s my bike.

99
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,680
Fuck!

100
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,000
What next?

101
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,960
What can I do?

102
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,080
I already kicked it.

103
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,320
Any problem?

104
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,520
Asking for it?

105
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,960
Hey, asshole!

106
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,640
Can’t you talk properly?

107
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,960
Did you talk properly to me?

108
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,200
You have stirred me.

109
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,440
Do you want to fight, huh?

110
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,760
Bring it on!

111
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,880
Come on!

112
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,400
Damn Jeng, Meen!
Stop it!

113
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,080
Why are you fighting?

114
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,520
Stop!

115
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,520
I said stop!

116
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,600
Bring it on!

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,600
Still staring at each other?

118
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,880
He kicked my motorbike first.

119
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,320
I said it was a misunderstanding.

120
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,240
Misunderstanding?

121
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,960
And you still fucking stir me up?

122
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,360
Oh, stop!

123
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:05,800
That’s enough.

124
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,960
Speak nicely, both of you!

125
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,360
If you're drunk, don't act like shit.

126
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,680
You act shit too.
You also kicked my motorbike, right?

127
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,760
But you started it.

128
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,840
What you want then?

129
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,960
Oh, enough.

130
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,120
I said enough, both of you!

131
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,480
Jeng, you go home now.

132
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,640
Go!

133
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,720
Calm down and we´ll talk tomorrow.

134
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,880
Both of you!

135
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,840
You too, Meen!

136
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,120
You act like crap when you're drunk.

137
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,560
Why act like this?

138
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
This is absurd.

139
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,440
Tonight you should sleep here.
Don’t go anywhere.

140
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,440
I want to go home.

141
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,880
What’s up with you!

142
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,160
If you leave now, book your funeral for tomorrow.

143
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,080
Dying's not a big deal,
but hitting someone? What then?

144
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,800
Go to sleep!

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,520
[Meen: Why didn’t you answer the phone?]
[Meen: Who are you with?]
[Meen: Will you keep not answering me?]

146
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,280
[Meen: Will you keep not answering me?]
[Meen: Then we don’t need to be together!]
[Meen: I’m breaking up with you.]

147
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,240
[Wednesday, May 20, 2020 Restaurant is open.]

148
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,320
[Use this, you'll look good...
Madam Mek]

149
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:47,040
[Where are you!
You skip class without telling me!
Not answering my call!
I’ll have the trans senior yell at you!
Call back when you’re free.]

150
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,600
Exactly,
I knew it.

151
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,160
Look what he’s done.

152
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,320
You'd better break up with him.

153
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,640
To go on like this is to waste your life.

154
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
You still love him, don’t you?

155
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,760
If we're dating,

156
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,440
shouldn’t we love each other?

157
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,240
But it seems I’m the only one who loves him.

158
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,000
Exactly!

159
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,560
He treats you like you’re nothing.

160
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,280
He stays and shows up as he pleases.

161
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,840
After this, you can just start loving yourself.

162
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,520
Here, it’s my lecture note.

163
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,600
Lucky there is no quiz at the end of the class.

164
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,080
Hmm, thank you so much.

165
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,560
You’re welcome.

166
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,600
You're the only one on campus friendly with a weirdo like me.

167
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,880
So, don’t need to be formal.

168
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,520
Alright.

169
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,000
The subject is really tough.

170
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Meen: You mean this one?
Porche: Yeah

171
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,360
Woah, Meen!
 Is it Covid?

172
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,680
What the heck covid?

173
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,360
It’s Jey Mek's ice bucket.

174
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,400
She splashed water,
and it smacked me on the head too.

175
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,680
So why did she splash you?

176
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,680
Are you guys playing Songkran festival?

177
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,240
No, it’s not.

178
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,000
Hold on!

179
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Oh, what happened to your face?

180
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,720
Don’t tell me that...

181
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Noll hit you?

182
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,440
No, it wasn’t him.

183
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,880
Then who!

184
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,080
You dog!

185
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,720
Who’s he?

186
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,720
He's handsome!

187
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,240
I thought I smelled something delicious!

188
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,680
It smells good.

189
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,560
Jeh-Mek asked me to cook this for you.

190
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,880
Did he give you a purgative?

191
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,920
Weed killer!
Eat it or leave it?

192
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,640
Delicious!

193
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,600
I don’t mind the weed killer.

194
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,440
If you are not eating, I will.

195
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,040
Let me try.

196
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,320
I thought you weren't going to eat!

197
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,400
When did I say that?

198
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,480
I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.

199
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,520
Why does it have to be so tasty?

200
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,080
Is this a new dish from Jeh-Mek?

201
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,920
It's so delicious;
it should sell well.

202
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,440
Will you eat alone?

203
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,680
Oh, you can ask for more.

204
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,960
This is mine.

205
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,840
Please take a look first.

206
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,880
I have just renovated it myself.

207
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,400
Please consider it again.

208
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,760
I know that you've invested a lot in decorating the place.

209
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,320
But I can’t do that.

210
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,120
I’ve already negotiated with them.

211
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Please don't burden me anymore.

212
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,560
I should go now.

213
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,680
But please, before the contract ends,
make sure everything is in order.

214
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,520
What was that all about?

215
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,200
Who was that anyway?

216
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,600
That's Mr. Prem,
the building owner.

217
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,760
He refuses to renew the lease.

218
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,400
So I asked him to check out the place,
hoping he'd change his mind.

219
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,880
But it seems like there's no hope.

220
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,000
Then, why won't he renew the lease?

221
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,200
He said he's giving the space to a convenience store.

222
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,920
They probably offer more money.

223
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,280
How can I compete with them?

224
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,240
Money issues are always so complicated.

225
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,920
What will you do then?

226
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,200
If we truly can't renew the contract,
I'll have to find a new place.

227
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,880
But that's a big move.

228
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,240
It’s hard to find a good location that our regulars can still visit.

229
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,760
Building prices around here are going up also.

230
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,600
Plus, there are renovation costs.

231
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,920
I’ll have to start from zero again.

232
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,880
Do you still have a hangover?
Are you better now?

233
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,680
I'm better,
 but it feels like I'm getting sick.

234
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,360
Your ice bucket was so brutal.

235
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,440
Weakling.

236
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,320
What's with you two, huh?

237
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,320
Always fighting.

238
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,160
If you fight again this time,
I will use hot water.

239
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,000
Is this the dog you were talking about?

240
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,720
I’m willing to be bitten.
He’s such a handsome.

241
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,120
I guarantee you.

242
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,600
Meen: Go there and get bitten.
Porche: Sure, I’ll go.

243
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,120
No matter what,
you were wrong.

244
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,120
You're so bad when you get drunk

245
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,280
I was very ashamed of you.

246
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,040
Come on, you’re my friend.

247
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,640
Side with me for once.

248
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,040
Meen, a good friend doesn't support wrong actions.

249
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,360
So annoying.

250
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,800
Let's give a toast!

251
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,040
Porche: Friday nights are really good for the eyes.
Meen: That’s right.

252
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,800
By the way,
it's a pity for Jeh-Mhek's place.

253
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,680
It is nicely decorated and always full.

254
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,520
That’s true.

255
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,720
I want to help, but I'm not sure how.

256
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,800
You should start by helping to serve customers.
We're swamped!

257
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Is this alcohol free?

258
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,880
Free for the whole table.

259
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,000
Hurry up!

260
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,760
Meen: Let’s go!
Jeh-Mhek: Hurry up!

261
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,400
She told me I’d help serve?

262
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
If you can't fry, just go serve.

263
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,000
Who told you I couldn't fry?

264
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,680
Shoot!

265
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,000
Are you okay?

266
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,320
I’m sorry.

267
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,440
Apologizing, really?

268
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,520
I studied to be a chef.
This doesn't irritate my skin at all.

269
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,880
If a chef screamed at everything,
the food would never be ready.

270
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,920
When did I scream?
You damn kid!

271
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,640
When you say it like that, do you want to be fried?

272
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,080
The oil is just hot enough.
I’ll just throw you in the pan.

273
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,600
What a stupid joke.
Are you serious?

274
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,320
Well, I was kidding.
How can I put you in the pan?

275
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,920
Even your toes are bigger than the pan.

276
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
So, will you do it or not?

277
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,560
If not, just go serve outside.

278
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,120
I´ll do.

279
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,840
What are you looking at?

280
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,760
Now I got it.

281
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,280
I was wondering why it tasted so bitter.

282
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,000
How could you serve this to me?

283
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,920
I'm afraid of getting cancer from this!

284
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,520
Losing money is fine,
but I can’t lose face from frying fries.

285
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,400
I told the chef it was edible,
so I gave it to you.

286
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,920
Then why didn't you eat it?

287
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,720
No, thanks.

288
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,120
Porch: Eat it.
Meen: No, I'm afraid of getting cancer.

289
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,280
That’s enough!

290
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,560
Look at this, all burnt!

291
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,160
Meen, don’t even think about answering his call.

292
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,280
You'll end up forgiving them soon enough.

293
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,840
I don't want you to go back to him.

294
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,560
I know...

295
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,040
I'm not going to pick it up.

296
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,720
Damn! You drink like a demon.

297
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,480
Aiming to be full, huh?

298
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,400
Tonight, you're losing that V-card for sure.

299
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
I´ll be right back.

300
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,760
I´ll get some fresh air.

301
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,640
Let me have one.

302
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,680
Cigarette?

303
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,720
Yes.

304
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,680
I'm out.

305
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,000
Then give me one of yours.

306
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,080
Hey, if you ask someone else,
just ask nicely.

307
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,640
Please, bro!

308
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,120
What's the matter?

309
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,840
Nothing.

310
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,560
Can you cook that dish for me.

311
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,640
Which one?

312
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,400
That one.

313
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,800
It´s called Kiam something.

314
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,720
Kiam Eee?

315
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,400
It sounds like puke.

316
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,080
Kiam Uoo?

317
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,280
You’re hilarious.

318
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,040
Kiam Aaa?

319
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,600
Kiam Beng, maybe?

320
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Boil yourself in it too.

321
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,360
Do you think I’m an animal?

322
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,760
You are stirring up a drunk person.

323
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,000
It’s called Kiam Buey.

324
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,600
Remember it next time.

325
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,280
Man!

326
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,880
It's so damn hard to pronounce.

327
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,000
Hey!

328
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,760
Are you’re going to finish the whole?

329
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,480
Maybe I should give you something else to smoke.

330
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,040
Why you’re so drunk?

331
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,480
You’ve just left the kitchen.

332
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,880
I downed half a bottle, bro.

333
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,320
Hey!

334
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,280
Can you stand still?

335
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,960
I'm getting dizzy.

336
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,000
I’m standing still now.

337
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,400
Meen, you're drunk again.

338
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,480
Noll!

339
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,320
Why didn't you take my call?

340
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,920
Why are you doing this to me?

341
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,480
Do you see me as a joke?

342
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,960
You're so cruel.

343
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,400
You're cheating on me,

344
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,720
and you make it so obvious.

345
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,080
I'm willing to be the fool just to be with you.

346
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,920
Can you give me the priority,
like the one I gave you?

347
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,280
Wait!

348
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,640
Wait for what?

349
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,120
C'mon!
Let’s go in.

350
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,440
Bring him in.

351
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,720
Slowly!

352
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,120
Be careful!

353
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,520
Too heavy!

354
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,480
Put him here.

355
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,760
Hold on!

356
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,480
You all, please help remove his dirty clothes off first,
also plants; they’re all messed up.

357
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,960
Yes, take me off!

358
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,680
Man, the pants too.

359
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh, what are you drunk on, dude?

360
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,520
You just have to be careful, Porche!

361
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,800
You go take a shower first, Jeng!

362
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,240
You can’t go back like this?

363
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,960
Look, it’s all messed up.

364
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,320
Then, I’m going to take a shower.

365
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,520
I’ll go down and help.

366
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,920
No worries,
You’d better look after Meen.

367
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,400
Guests are getting fewer now.

368
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,760
As for you,
come with me.

369
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,400
No need to stay with him.
Let’s go.

370
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,040
You idiot!

371
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,400
Who's the damn idiot?

372
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,240
You idiot!

373
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,080
Anybody in the bathroom?

374
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,440
Yes, I’m in.

375
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,960
Come out!
I’m going to puke.

376
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,240
Go somewhere else.

377
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,080
Now I can't hold it in,
I'm going to puke.

378
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,480
I’m washing my hair.

379
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,560
Hey, the door isn't locked.

380
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,680
I'm coming in.

381
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:05,840
Hey!

382
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
Damn!

383
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,880
Leve or not?

384
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,159
Leave!

385
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,000
You won’t leave, right?

386
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,199
Meen: Get away!
Jeng: Leave or not?

387
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,920
Jeng: You wanna see it?

388
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,960
Jeh-Mek: I think it’s all done.

389
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,400
How it is?

390
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,520
Checking the stock here.

391
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,720
What’s new, dude?

392
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,840
You were a total disaster.

393
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,920
Meen, you've been drunk for two days straight.

394
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,320
Maybe take it easy for once?

395
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,560
Alright, ma'am!

396
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,440
Sorry about last night.

397
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,960
Um, it’s alright.

398
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,640
Oh, I’m about to order some stuff.

399
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,080
I've checked our stock;

400
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,040
Can you check if we need anything else?

401
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,160
French Fries?

402
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,240
Shouldn't the one who fried them all pay the bill?

403
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,440
Then I'll take care of the French fries expenses,
and any other damages.

404
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,040
Just tell me the total.

405
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,520
No need, we are acquaintances.

406
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,360
Are you going to eat anything?
I’ll cook it for you.

407
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,280
Anything.

408
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,880
So, would you like Kiam Buey Moo Sab?

409
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,000
You'll feel better after the hangover.

410
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,800
But Jeng should be the one who make it.

411
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,960
I want to see you be the one who makes it.

412
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,480
I'd like to see how the dish turns out
after sharing the recipe with you.

413
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,720
Really?

414
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,720
Okay then, wait a bit.
I'll make it for you.

415
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,680
Thank you.

416
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,400
Would you like to hit the road and buy stuff together?

417
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,520
Didn't you already order them?

418
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,680
I thought maybe you'd like to go out,

419
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,280
because here you are always obsessed.

420
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,120
I'm too lazy to go out.

421
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,400
Look, it’s so hot.

422
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,880
Earlier, you mentioned compensating for other damages.

423
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,640
Did you mean my stuff too?

424
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,920
What do you mean?

425
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
Well... the thing you saw of mine.

426
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,680
You crazy!
What the heck!

427
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,920
Today, would you like to switch from French fries to frying sausages instead?

428
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,840
Don´t be lewd!

429
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,640
Jeng: It's a foot-long sausage!
Meen: Stop it!

430
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,360
Jeng: It’s so crispy.
Meen: Enough!

431
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,760
Jeng: Really, it’s so crispy.
Meen: Stop, I don’t want to hear.

432
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,040
It’s a foot-long one.

433
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,160
Jeng: Don’t you want to try.
Meen: You go over there!

434
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,040
You crazy!

435
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,360
Noll!

436
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,520
Why didn’t you answer my call?

437
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,880
When I called you, you didn’t answer either.

438
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,720
I've always been like this.

439
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,040
I've always been like this.
Why so serious?

440
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,680
Serious? Me?

441
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,080
I’m just doing the same as you did.

442
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,640
Do you understand how I feel now?

443
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,320
All this fuss for what?

444
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,400
Who is that?

445
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,720
Jeh-Mek’s chef.

446
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,720
Why I've never seen him before?

447
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,640
Why so curious?

448
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,000
He's the new chef.

449
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,480
I'm not like you, fucking around with people.

450
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,560
Fucking around with people?
Me?

451
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,120
Who did you hear that from?

452
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,320
When I disappeared,
it was because I was creating models.

453
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,200
I don’t even have time for you.

454
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,080
I don't want to talk to you right now.

455
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,640
Go back!

456
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,840
I'm not ready to talk.

457
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,320
So now you don't trust me?

458
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,160
What have you given me to trust?

459
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,120
Are you really breaking up like this?

460
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,040
Can you stop blaming me for onece?

461
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,560
Ever since we started dating,
have you ever nicely apologized to me?

462
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,480
So when I called you, wasn't it because I wanted to apologize?

463
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,040
You say it out loud!

464
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,000
Speak up!

465
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,200
Let's go back! I'll take you home.
Don't bother her anymore.

466
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,680
I won’t go back until you say those words.

467
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,160
Okay then,
I’ll go.

468

Oh, Noll came to you?

476
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,240
Did you finish talking to him?

477
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,120
Why is it so difficult to apologize?

478
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,800
If he truly apologizes,
will you easily forgive him just like that?

479
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,920
You talk like someone who has never been in love.

480
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,600
You should also learn to love yourself.

481
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,560
How do I look like I don't love myself?

482
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,800
Meen, are you thinking of going back to him?

483
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,440
Not really.

484
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,600
At least not now.

485
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,800
Jealous?

486
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,160
Did he get jealous of you?

487
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,600
Oh, don't tell me you and Jeng...

488
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,120

So, when you’ll be ready?

492
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,760
We broke up and it's over.

493
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
I won’t brake up.

If you guys want to make out,
go elsewhere.

I wasn't going to make out here.
