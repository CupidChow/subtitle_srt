00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,720
♫Just a single glance, from your eyes straight to mine,♫

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,040
♫and my heart starts to melt.♫

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,040
♫As I come closer, I talk to you,♫

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,800
♫ I tremble, till I'm almost breathless.♫

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,200
♫ A restlessness overwhelms me, losing myself in the tide.♫

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,520
♫Is this what they call symptoms of love,♫

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,640
♫It happens every moment,♫

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,080
♫when I get a glimpse of you,♫

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,800
♫Are you feeling like me, perhaps,♫

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,720
♫A burning, restless whirl within the heart, do you feel so?♫

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,720
♫Every symptom shows, do you tremble too, just how much,♫

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,440
♫Feeling good, alike maybe?♫

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,600

00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,480

♫Tell me, when I meet you,♫

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,960
♫Are your thoughts the same as mine,♫

♫ that we are in love?♫

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,280
Talay!

21
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,039
How'd you sneak in here, badass?

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,680
I’m your senior.

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,640
Geezer!

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,960
[Camp: Damn show-off!]

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,960
Such a poser!

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,960
I gotcha!

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,320
You look like you've seen a ghost.

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,039
Scared, huh?

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,960
I'll take care of you.

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,440
I said stop.
I’m scared.

31
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,720
If you want to sleep in my tent,
just tell me.

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,320
[Camp!]

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,920
[Camp!]

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,360
[Camp!]

35
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,400
June!

36
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,320
You know I've got feelings for you, right?

37
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,159
I know.

38
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,560
I really like you.

39
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,000
Will you be my girlfriend?

40
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,960
I'm sorry, Camp.

41
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,720
I've already got someone I like.

42
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,400
Understood.

43
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,320
It's alright.

44
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,840
Then, I'll get going now.

45
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,240
Okay.

46
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Just watching?

47
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
If you're not helping,
go wash your face.

48
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,160
I dreamed about you, bro!

49
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Do you like me that much?

50
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,400
Not exactly.

51
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,560
I dreamed about you and June.

52
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,480
Can't get it out of your mind?

53
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,440
Talay: I already told you...
Camp: June’s a ghost.

54
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,520
You're overthinking.

55
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,240
Being scared, memories of June,
and your feelings for me.

56
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,280
It all got mixed up in that dream.

57
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,200
What do you mean?

58
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,880
[C: Did you freeze last night?]

59
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:06,880
[C: Don't think you would've,
since I held you tight.]

60
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,200
Hey, bro!

61
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,760
Wake up!
I'll get my stuff.

62
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,840
Let’s go!

63
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,680
Go where?

64
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,240
Got plans?

65
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,640
What about you?

66
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,800
And yourself?

67
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,720
Wanna come with me?

68
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,400
Didn’t we stay together?

69
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,440
Carry it if you’re coming.

70
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,320
Oh, such a poser.

71
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,520
So, what's the topic of this thesis?

72
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,840
Nothing.

73
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,120
Just scouting locations
and proposing to the prof.

74
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,040
You're dodging my question.

75
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,960
Let me ask you then.

76
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,560
Why'd you and June split?

77
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,080
Who said I was dating June?

78
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,640
You mean, back when I was into June,
you weren't dating her?

79
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,400
Nope!

80
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,280
We were just good friends.

81
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,200
Then why didn't you say so?

82
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,000
Had I told you,

83
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,760
you wouldn't have approached me, right?

84
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,000
Who said I approached you?

85
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,080
I approached June.

86
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,760
Seen June lately?

87
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,800
Don't you know?

88
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,600
Know what?

89
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,680
June... she left us years ago.

90
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,320
Are you joking?

91
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,200
It's not something to jest about.

92
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,360
Seriously,

93
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,280
I'm not joking.

94
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,960
June drowned during
our freshman year party.

95
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,720
It was all over the news.

96
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,280
I even went to her funeral.

97
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,800
Eating at a time like this?

98
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,000
Because of June's memory?

99
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,160
Still have feelings for her?

100
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,640
Nope.

101
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,520
I'm just reeling...

102
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,840
Camp: Knowing someone I cared for is gone...
Talay: It hit me hard too.

103
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,480
I even went to look for you at school,
thinking I'd tell you.

104
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,800
But you never did?

105
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,960
Didn't see the point.

106
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,760
What the hell do you mean?

107
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,880
You disrespect me again.

108
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,200
It’s such an important matter.

109
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,120
You should've told me.

110
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,960
And if I had?
what would you do?

111
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,800
You'd have stormed off to the funeral?

112
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,400
Maybe,

113
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,680
that would be my business, right?

114
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,200
So, not telling you is my business too.

115
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,160
Stop talking bullshit!

116
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,560
Camp, let's keep it civil.

117
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,760
Hear yourself!

118
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,040
You're the one talking bullshit first.

119
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,840
Fine!

120
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,640
After graduation,
were you still close with June?

121
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,600
Not really.

122
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,440
So, why tell you?

123
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,080
Even if we weren't close,
you should've.

124
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,160
What should I have told you?

125
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,800
Since you weren't close
to June anymore?

126
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,000
We weren't close either.

127
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,760
But if I died,

128
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,640
June would've let you know.

129
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,840
You’re still into June, right?

130
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,360
Why ask again?

131
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,040
Who can't let go?
You or me?

132
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,280
Or it’s not true?

133
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,720
You keep asking about June.

134
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,600
Do you like her that much?

135
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,520
What the hell do you want to hear?

136
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,360
Yes, I still like her.

137
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,400
I still do like her.
Are you fuckin happy now?

138
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,800
Damn it!

139
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,120
Damn!

140
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,680
[Camp!]

141
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,000
[Camp!]

142
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,000
[Camp!]

143
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,760
[Camp!]

144
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,720
Who's there?

145
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,040
Talay, you?

146
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,640
Stop joking!

147
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,200
[Camp!]

148
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,320
[Camp!]

149
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,240
[You guys will never be together.]

150
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,200
Camp: Help me!
Talay: Camp!

151
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,760
Talay: Camp!
Camp: Someone, help!

152
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,840
Camp!

153
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,200
Help!

154
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,880
Camp!

155
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,400
Camp, hold my hand!

156
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,600
Did you see June?

157
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,840
You saw June, didn't you?

158
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
Just like I did.

159
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,320
Just tell me!

160
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,280
June might be holding a grudge.

161
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,200
Why?

162
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,320
Against me?

163
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,400
What did I ever do?

164
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,200
It's not you.

165
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,120
She might hold a grudge against me.

166
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,040
What's the reason?

167
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,880
That day, when June died,

168
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,400
I was there.

169
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,720
You said you had something to talk about.

170
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,560
What was it?

171
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,480
I have feelings for you.

172
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,080
Is that so shocking?

173
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,640
Say something!

174
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,680
You're just a friend to me.

175
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,160
What do you mean?

176
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,920
After all our moments in school?

177
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,200
I'm into Camp.

178
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,640
Wait.

179
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,200
Both you and Camp were flirting with me,

180
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,960
and you two clashed because of me, right?

181
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,360
When did you start falling for him, huh?

182
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,080
I've always had a thing for Camp.

183
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,720
I just didn't want him to be with you.

184
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,720
Then why did you do this to me?

185
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,200
Is it funny?

186
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,200
I poured my heart out to you!

187
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,360
I’m sorry.

188
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,640
If there was no Camp,

189
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,680
would you have given me a chance?

190
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,760
What the fuck!

191
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,600
How could you do this shit to me?

192
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,720
I fucking love you; you own me the same love.
You’re selfish!

193
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,040
June: Love me back, you jerk!
Talay: Stop it!

194
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,480
Let's talk later,
when you calm down.

195
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,360
No more chats,
I wanted something real.

196
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,200
June: Be with me, now!
Talay: June!

197
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,960
I thought my apology was clear.

198
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,600
You're a piece of shit!

199
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,280
I'm aware.

200
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,680
I'm truly sorry.

201
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,720
You don’t need to apologize to me.

202
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,680
Apologize to June.

203
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,840
If I could, I would do it.

204
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,160
When you had the chance,

205
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,360
why didn't you make it right?

206
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,160
I did my best, Camp.

207
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,960
From what I heard,
I don't think you've done shit.

208
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,240
What should I do then?

209
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,200
Should I die for her?

210
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,120
Should I die for apologizing to her?

211
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,240
Give it a try!

212
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,240
Dare you?

213
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,760
I don't think so.

214
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,320
Did I ask her to die for me?

215
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,240
♫Do you know how challenging it is?♫

216
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:28,320
♫Countless millennia, not knowing when we’ll meet similar stars.♫

217
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,520
♫Do you know, with just a blink of an eye, just once,♫

218
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:42,200
♫how much the universe and my life can change.♫

219
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,440
♫You transform the misty air into the sweet scent of flowers.♫

220
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:58,000
♫You change the silent stars into those from my dreams,♫

221
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,080
♫You turn a fleeting second into eternity,♫

222
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,360
♫Today, my love for you is the most precious.♫

223
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,560
♫Because... it's you.♫

224
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,280

♫even a universe is too few?♫

232
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,520
You've had feelings for me all this while?

233
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,400
Yes, even now.

234
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,520
All those chats,
you knew it was me, didn't you?

235
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,520
No, I didn't.

236
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,880
I didn't know it was really you.

237
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,560
I was even too ashamed to meet you.

238
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,080
Is that why you didn't tell me about June?

239
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,160
Why's it on me?

240
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,560
Why did June harm me?

241
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,480
Maybe she didn't want us together.

242
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,760
Do you resent me for my actions?

243
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,000
If it was back then,
absolutely.

244
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,640
And even now.

245
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,960
But it's more of anger.

246
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,960
Remember...

247
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,200
I once felt that spark with you too,

248
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,240
in the storage room at school.

249
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,240
That was the moment.

250
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,679
But that was it.

251
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,560
Then we never saw each other again.

252
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,719
And what about now?

253
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,719
I like you, more than before.

254
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,840
I like you.

255
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,320
So...

256
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,480
can we be more than just friends?

257
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,760
Hmm, how about a bath first?

258
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,800
I'm feeling sticky.

259
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,520
I want the flashlight this time.

260
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,200
Camp: Oh, I feel so clammy now.
Talay: Alright.

261
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,680
I’ll get it for you.

262
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,200
Camp, what's going on?

263
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,360
Blood!

264
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,480
June!

265
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,880
You caused my death.

266
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,280
Without you,
Talay could've been mine.

267
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,560
June, I’m sorry.

268
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,520
I’m deeply sorry, June.

269
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,080
Please, leave Camp alone.

270
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,880
Don’t do anything to him.

271
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,440
If you're going to do anything,
do it to me.

272
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,880
Please, June!

273
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,280
June!

274
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,800
Camp!

275
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,960
Camp!

276
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,640
[Director: Cut! That’s a wrap.]

277
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,800
Thank you all for today's effort.

278
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,800
Joy, Bo, help the actors freshen up.

279
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,800
Come on!
Fantastic job today!

280
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,040
Go wash up with him.

281
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,200
Damn, Camp!
Head to the showers with him.

282
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,680
I want to review the footage first.

283
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,000
Alright, follow me, Talay.

284
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,480
I'll go with Camp then.

285
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,960
Sure, but be quick.

286
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,880
Everyone, start packing.
I'm eager to head home.

287
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,280
If you have expenses,
submit them now.

288
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,800
Thank you, bro.

289
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,280
So, can I exchange the thank you
for compensation?

290
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,600
Sure, what's your rate?
I will ask my friend.

291
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,280
Maybe...

292
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,760
being my boyfriend?

293
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,480
What’s that, bro?

294
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,080
Why?
Are you shy?

295
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,720
I'm serious.

296
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,280
Be my boyfriend.

297
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,960
You know, that scene earlier,
with the tears...

298
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,080
I felt it so much.

299
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,960
Even when I fell to the ground,

300
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,040
I felt the authenticity.

301
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,680
How did you do that?

302
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,120
I just thought,

303
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,520
‘How would life be without you?’

304
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,560
and I let everything out.

305
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,840
Whose boyfriend is this?
You're too talented.

306
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,200
What about you?

307
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,320
If it were me,

308
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,920
would you miss me?

309
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,600
I might be sad even more than you did.

310
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,760
♫Just a single glance, from your eyes straight to mine,♫

311
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,200
♫and my heart starts to melt.♫

312
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,560

313
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,720

315
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Of course, bro!
My team used several bottles of red syrup.

316
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,480
Honestly, no need the syrup.
You’re sweet already.

00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,920

318
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,160

323
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,640
June: What the fuck! How could you do this shit to me?
Taley: June!

324
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,280
Talay: June!
June: You’re selfish.

325
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,840
[Director: Cut!]

326
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,520
June, can you channel more rage?
Act like a psychopath

327
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,800
Just a tad more intense.

328
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,480
Like "Holy shit!!!",  like this.

329
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,840
How could you do this shit to me!!?,
along those lines.

330
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,200
Let’s try.

331
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,920
June: Holy shit!!!
Director: Exactly that.

332
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,520
Just like that.

333
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,040
Come on!
Shoot from the top.

334
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,040
Oh man!
Is this your first time working?

335
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,720
The mic should never be on the cam.

336
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,720
Director: Get it right next time.
Cameraman: Understood.

337
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,760
Everyone ready!

338
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,200
Action!

339
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,760
I gotcha...

340
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:09,880
Camp!

341
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,120
Action!

342
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,200
Ahh!

343
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,120
Cut!

344
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,640
[Director: That wasn't good at all!
You need to be more startled than that!]

345
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,720
I told you to find someone else to play.

346
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,440
You don't have to argue with me,
I'm the director.

347
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,200
I draw the director paper, you as an actor,
so you have to play.

348
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,520
Camp: Alright!
Director: One more time.

349
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,120
Oh!

350
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,000
[Director: Believe in me!]

351
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,680
It's so cool.
I'll go watch it with me in the cutting room.

352
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,240
Camp: About last night...
Director: No, you believe in me.

353
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,040
Director:  I actually directed it myself, especially the ghost scene.
Camp: I see.

354
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,480
Camp: What about Job? Won't he get confused?
Director: You've got to trust me.

355
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,560
Come and see for yourself.
Deal?

356
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,600
Well, I'll have to pack a few things.

357
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,480
Staff: Follow me later then.
Camp: Sure, I will.

358
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,840
Can I trust you, huh?

359
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,040
Why are you smiling?

360
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,960
Do you have more work?

361
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,360
Yes.

362
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,640
I need to help my team with some editing.

363
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,280
Some scenes were changed suddenly,

364
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,560
so my friend might get confused.

365
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,440
When you finish packing,
you may go home.

366
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,880
Go home safely!

367
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,800
Call me when you get there.

368
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,120
Sure.

369
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,000
Worn out?

370
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,720
Yes, I am.
And you?

371
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,720
When I played the ghost,
was it frightening?

372
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:16,920
Totally.

373
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,760
Crew: Cheers! / Thanks! / Goodbye! / Safe travels!

374
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,080
Talay, how you heading back?

375
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,760
I may be sticking around.

376
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,560
Love the vibe here.

377
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,120
Might camp out a couple of nights.

378
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,760
Staying more?

379
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,760
Why'd you decide to do so?

380
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,240
Well,

381
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,800
This is where Camp and I meet,

382
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,080
and chose to be a couple?

383
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,440
You two are official now?

384
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,000
Wow, showing off, huh?

385
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,240
Okay, I’ll go ahead then.

386
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,320
June: Catch up later!
Talay: Alright.

387
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,960
Take care yourself.

388
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,640
See you later.
Bye!

389
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,080
Can two people fit in this tent?

390
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,560
Absolutely!

391
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,960

[Team: Oh, Pun!]

404
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,400
We only took a break for two weeks,

405
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,720
and many of your statistics have dropped.

406
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,320
Especially you, Pun!

407
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,560
Want to be a reserved player till you graduate?

408
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,280
Hey, anyone checked on Pun?

409
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,320
I've gotten used to being scolded.

410
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,320
It’s  okay, Man!
There's always a next time.

411
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,000
I'm good, really!

412
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,240
Guys, I'm freaking tired.

413
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,120
I just can't anymore.

414
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,120
Want to be a reserved player
till you graduate?

415
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,880
Where'd Pun go?

416
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,760
Exactly.
Where is he?
