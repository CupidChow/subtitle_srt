[Previous episode]
Hey, are you okay?
You've been looking glum since morning.

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,440
I ran into Ta yesterday.

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,280
Seemed like he wanted me to make love with me.

24
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,880
-I cut it off and told him...
-Tell what?

25
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,400
-I already got a boyfriend.
-Huh...you got a boyfriend?

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,120
Give him a shot.

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,440
Phol!

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,160
I'm Peem.

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,479
Can I get your number?

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,160
Done talking?

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,520
Damn, so rude.
You think you're handsome or what?

32
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,880
-Hey Ink, Tide!
-Hey, what's up!

33
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,160
Focus on your studies, okay?

34
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,960
I gotta go now.

35
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,280
Bye, beb!

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,880
Take care, beb!

37
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,760
Bye!

38
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,280
Hey, what's going on?
Tell us!

39
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,480
Nothing much.

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,200
Just that suddenly Phol talked to me
and now we're a thing.

41
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,440
Why's he hiding like that?

42
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,600
Your mom sent some food over.

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,320
Thanks, Dad.
Tell Mom she doesn't have to, though.

44
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,440
Just in case, so you don’t go hungry.
It's your favorite menu, so you'll get chubbier.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,840
Dad, you can head back.
I'm planning to stay and read more.

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,000
Dad?

47
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,720
When do you want me to pick you up next time?

48
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,960
Next week's good, Dad.

49
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,280
Or if I'm not coming home, I'll call.
So you don’t have to drive here.

50
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,440
No problem, take your time.

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,040
And hey, if you need more rice or anything, just call me.

52
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,400
-I’ll bring it for you.
-Sure, dad.

53
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,080
-You should get home, it's late.
-Alright then.

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,880
Take care, eat well.

55
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,800
-Call me when you get home, okay?
-Will do, don't worry.

56
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,760
So, where did you go for good luck?

57
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,840
Ugh, a guy like me relies on charm, not luck.

58
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Let's talk in my room.

59
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,680
It's quieter there.

60
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,200
Send me your location.

61
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,400
Come on, we're late for class.

62
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,440
Really need to follow me this much?

63
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,520
There is no one here.
No need to follow me perhaps.

64
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,040
Oh, I just wanna see your daily routine.

65
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,320
It's up to you then.

66
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,080
Is this your secret for clear skin?

67
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,080
No wonder you have so many fans.

68
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
Tough face!

69
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,040
Oh, your skin's so dry...

70
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,920
You should moisturize your skin.

71
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,159
The forehead too.

72
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,680
Want more?

73
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Ink, I think we'd better change the table.

74
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,680
Yes, I stink of love.

75
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,840
Let’s go.

76
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,680
Keep that in mind!

77
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,600
That one looks good.

78
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,880
Peem!

79
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,120
Phol! Over here!

80
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,560
What's up?

81
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,640
-Are your classes done?
-Yeah, come on up. I'll give you a ride.

82
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,440
Come on, don't take too long, my dear boyfriend.

83
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,000
Wow... what's all this?
You moving or something?

84
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,800
Yep.

85
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,640
Hurry up!

86
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,080
About moving house...
You're not actually moving in here, are you?

87
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,800
Exactly.

88
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,800
-Are you serious about staying here?
-Yeah, just moving up.

89
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,200
So why are you leading the way,
know where my room is?

90
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,240
-Hurry up, then.
-This box is heavy. What's in it?

91
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,600
Do we really have to live together?

92
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,680
Yeah, dude.

93
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,920
Gotta keep it real. Don’t want any slip-ups yet.

94
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,440
You can sleep up there; I'll sleep down here.

95
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,840
That’s cool of you.

96
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,440
Seriously, ever had a boyfriend before?

97
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,440
Nope. Why?

98
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,760
Just curious.

99
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,560
If you had a boyfriend, my being here might cause drama.

100
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,880
Don't you think you're asking a bit late?

101
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,120
-Here, have a drink.
-Cheers, mate.

102
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,960
Make yourself at home.

103
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,000
Think of it as your own room.

104
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,840
Still not sleeping?

105
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,840
How studious you are.

106
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,000
You're up?

107
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,400
Go take a shower.

108
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,680
Nope, I'm too lazy.

109
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,280
Slob.

110
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,360
What do you like to do in your free time?

111
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,920
I love reading.

112
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,440
Reading again?

113
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,960
Makes sense. Studying science must be tough, huh?

114
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,200
If I were in your faculty,

115
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,960
I'd probably fail too.

116
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,360
Haven’t had dinner yet?

117
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,840
Wait a moment.

118
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,800
Let me help.

119
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,400
No need.

120
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,600
Just chill there.
Don't mess up my room.

121
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,400
It's ready.

122
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,320
-Enjoy your meal!
-Wow... it looks so delicious.

123
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,680
Mom's cooking is always the best.
Give it a try.

124
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,880
Hmm, this is really good.

125
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,960
Beats the uni canteen, for sure.

126
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,680
Told you so.

127
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,640
Join me?

128
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,520
Come on, I'll feed you.

129
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,280
No thanks.

130
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,040
I'm good.

131
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
You eat. I’ve already eaten.

132
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,640
Just tell me when you're done.

133
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,160
I'll wash up after.

134
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,160
Hey, don't bother.

135
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,080
I’ll wash it myself.

136
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,600
Come on, it's my room.

137
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,800
Just eat quick and don’t get food stuck.
It would trouble me again.

138
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,120
It's up to you, but I'll take my time.

139
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,480
Sure you don't want to eat together?

140
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
You wanna eat?

141
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,640
If not, I'll take it.

142
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,520
I’ll eat then.

143
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
[I got the exam in the morning.
Gotta go now. :)].

144
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,560
What kind of guy is he?
So darn cute.

145
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,040
What’s that smell? Smells good.

146
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:45,200
Looks great, both the meal
and the one who warmed it up.

147
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,720
This event is pretty impressive.

148
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,840
It's spectacular. This faculty must have a hefty budget.

149
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,800
Wanna eat something?
I’ll grab something for us.

150
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,080
-Awesome.
-Me too.

151
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,440
Phol!

152
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,800
Can you handle this?

153
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,120
Absolutely, leave it to me.

154
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,640
-Hey Peem!
-Hi there, Ta!

155
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,360
Pretty cool event.

156
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,880
Didn’t think you could organize something this good.

157
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,480
I’m good at everything.
You know that right?

158
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,080
Beb!

159
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,000
And who's this?

160
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,400
Oh, this guy...

161
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,640
This is Ta, an old friend, but we're not that close anymore.

162
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,560
Ouch, saying that right in front of him?

163
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,280
Ta...

164
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,800
This is Phol, my new boyfriend.

165
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,000
This is Yeen,

166
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,880
my boyfriend.

167
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,080
-Hello Peem and Phol.
-Hello!

168
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,160
Good luck, Yeen.

169
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,440
Peem, why'd you say that?

170
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,320
We should get going.

171
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,960
Have fun, you two!

172
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,160
Can I get 4 glasses, please?

173
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,240
And some popcorn, thanks.

174
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,440
-Thank you.
-Let’s go!

175
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
Here they are.

176
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,240
Hey, thanks a lot.

177
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,520
Just met Ta and his boyfriend.

178
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,960
Really? How were they?

179
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,240
Good, I guess.

180
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,960
They seem to love each other.

181
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,880
Maybe he's finally being honest.

182
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,560
Well, good for him. He'll leave you alone now.

183
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,040
You don’t have to worry anymore.

184
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,040
So what are we waiting for?

185
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,840
Let's all toast.

186
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,320
Everything alright, Peem?

187
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,480
I'm cool, just relaxing.

188
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,880
You seem a bit tipsy.

189
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,280
No, I am not drunk.

190
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,720
Peem, can we talk a sec?

191
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,760
What's up? Say it.

192
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,240
Now you act all jumpy at a touch.

193
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,720
We used to touch more than that.

194
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,840
Can we stop this already?

195
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,080
We both have partners now.

196
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,320
If you're so free, go look after your own partner.

197
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,800
Seriously, are you dating Phol?

198
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,800
Didn’t you see us?

199
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,440
Why even ask?

200
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,400
How long have you been together?

201
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,440
For a while.

202
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,560
Are you sure about getting serious with him?

203
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Why do you ask?

204
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,280
Phol's awesome.

205
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,680
Handsome, smart, rich family...

206
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,840
Who wouldn't be into him?

207
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,720
Heard... once you chased after Phol too.

208
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,240
Too bad it didn’t work out for you.

209
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,480
True,

210
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,440
I didn’t become his boyfriend,

211
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,760
but I got something else.

212
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,080
Wondering what? Ask Phol yourself.

213
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,440
Didn't you tell him we already had something?

214
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,160
Peem!

215
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,840
What's wrong?

216
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,680
You're so quiet.

217
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,240
Drunk?

218
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,280
Need some warm water?

219
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,840
What's up now?

220
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,920
Hungry, maybe?

221
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,440
This isn't funny.

222
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,960
Umm...

223
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,600
let's talk when you feel better.

224
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,800
Phol...

225
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,000
What did Ta whisper to you?

226
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,280
What was that about?

227
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,240
Just spill it.

228
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,120
Say it already.

229
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,360
Oh, Peem, you alright?

230
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,240
Watch out, Peem!

231
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,800
All good?

232
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,640
Feeling alright, Peem?

233
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,720
Be careful with your head.

234
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,640
You okay?

235
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,520
Get up, it's dirty here.

236
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,520
Up you go!

237
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,680
Rise up!

238
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,320
Stand up, it's dirty here.

239
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,120
Stand up carefully.

240
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,760
Come on, stand up.

241
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,360
This floor's not clean.

242
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
I said leave me alone.

243
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,560
What the hell are you doing?

244
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,600
So you sober up and come to your senses!

245
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,680
Stay still!

246
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,920
If you stayed still, you wouldn't be drenched.

247
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,880
Move a bit.

248
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,880
Take it off.

249
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,160
Now this side, be careful.

250
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,880
Why so many layers?

251
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,680
Wanna be cool, huh?

252
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,160
Are you alright?

253
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,240
Feeling cold?

254
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Are you alright, Peem?

255
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,440
Watch your step.

256
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,680
Alright, lay down here.

257
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,400
Move over a bit.

258
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,560
Lie down gently.

259
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,160
Feeling better?

260
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,800
What are you doing to me, did you do the same with Ta?

261
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,040
Phol!

262
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,280
Why so quiet? I need answers.

263
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,560
-I want to know.
-Hey, Peem!

264
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,760
Why won't you tell me?

265
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
Come on, Phol, spill it.

266
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,040
-Damn Phol!
-Hey!

267
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,000
It's not your concern, right?

268
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,440
We'll break up soon anyway,

269
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
why the hell do you care so much?

270
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,480
Yeah,

271
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,440
you’re right.

272
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,120
Your actions are none of my concern.

273
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,600
We're parting ways soon.

274
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,280
What the fuck do I want to know?

275
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,120
Peem hasn't come to class for 2 days now. Something up?

276
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,280
Exactly. And he's ignoring my texts.

277
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,000
Maybe we should check with Phol at the science faculty at lunch.

278
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,719
Sure, let's wrap up this class first.

279
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Alright.

280
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,679
What's up with him?

281
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,719
No clue.

282
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:09,280
Today's lesson is on sound and how it's made.

283
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:19,520
Sound comes from things colliding together.

284
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,960
Traveling from one point to another.

285
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,240
If you're not feeling well, go freshen up.

286
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,920
But make sure to come back quickly.

287
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,040
Hey, why are you parking here, old man?
This is my usual spot, you know?

288
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,720
Just for a sec. I'll move it soon.

289
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,960
A second is too long. Move your damn car now.

290
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,160
Actually, it's a free spot for anyone,

291
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,960
Hey, what's his problem?
Does he not want to get old or what?

292
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
It’s a common area, everyone knows it.

293
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,840
As far as I know, this is my regular spot.

294
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,200
You're being a nuisance.

295
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,200
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

296
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,320
Oh, is this guy your driver?

297
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,120
Next time, teach your driver not to hog spots,

298
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,520
But what he said is right.

299
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,840
This isn't your personal spot.

300
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,200
It's a public area,

301
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,560
open for everyone to park.

302
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,240
I don't mind parking here regularly.

303
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,200
and no one else seems bothered by it.

304
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,680
Hey, Phol's in trouble.

305
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,840
-Huh? Where?
-Over there, quick.

306
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Let’s go!

307
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,080
What? Did I hear right?
Phol's in trouble?

308
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,720
Hey, Peem!  Hold on...

309
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,720
Don't take video clips, please back up.

310
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,720
Please!

311
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,640
No videos, please.

312
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,360
Hey, Phol!

313
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,800
Phol!

314
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,160
You alright?

315
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
I’m okay, but...

316
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,840
-I’ll take the driver to the medical room first.
-Hey, let us help take him.

317
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,200
Better report this to the university office.

318
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,520
Phol, you gotta be fine.

319
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,240
Then I will take him to the university office.

320
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,000
-You two, look after the driver.
-Got it, no problem.

321
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,560
You’ve got lots of witnesses, Phol. Don’t be scared.

322
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,200
-Let’s go, uncle!
-Thanks.

323
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,080
-I appreciate it.
-Get up carefully, sir.

324
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,600
Please take care of him!

325
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,280
The medical room is over there.
Be careful, sir!

326
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,760
Let’s go sir.

327
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,040
Do you feel hurt?

328
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,840
Thanks, Peem.

329
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,080
No problem,

330
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,360
it’s nothing.

331
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,920
Feeling any pain?

332
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,040
I’m alright.

333
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,760
And don't worry about your dad,

334
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,560
Ink texted me that he’s safe now.

335
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,600
I didn’t want my dad to go through this or deal with it.

336
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,080
You know, I’m not from a rich family.

337
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,680
My family lives in the countryside.

338
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,040
My parents had to sell some of our land  to get me into school.

339
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:25,200
They believe the people we hang with shape who we are.

340
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,800
To have a good life, we need to relate
to well-off people, don't we?

341
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,360
But I freaking hate this idea.

342
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,920
But what else could I do?

343
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,920
I just want them to be at ease.

344
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,000
so I follow along.

345
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,400
Every day, I try hard to finish my studies,

346
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,120
then find a job to support my family,

347
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,480
so I won't need to fake it anymore.

348
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,240
I understand.

349
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,480
But I wasn’t always like this.

350
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,880
You once asked about Ta.

351
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,880
I admit, back when I was bad,

352
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,600
I had something with him.

353
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,080
But I'm a different person now.

354
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,840
I didn’t want to tell you because

355
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,160
I was afraid you wouldn’t be okay

356
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,600
Now that you know,

357
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,480
If you want to leave, I get it.

358
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,440
Mom, Dad!

359
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,280
Here's my friend.

360
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,320
Good afternoon, sir.

361
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,400
Good afternoon, ma'am!

362
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,960
Um, good afternoon to you too.

363
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,000
Good afternoon!

364
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,800
Peem, I’ll save my lecture for later.

365
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,320
You wanted to know if I understood you, right?

366
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,080
Here's what I think.

367
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,920
You and I, we're a lot alike.

368
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,280
The only difference is, I'm chasing wealth, a better life,

369
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,320
so I've convinced myself...

370
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,240
to do whatever it takes to look rich,

371
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,240
to satisfy my ambitions.

372
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,560
And I also believe that...

373
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,960
if we tell ourselves in the mirror every day
that we hope to find good things,

374
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,120
do what we love,

375
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,120
our future will be as we wish.

376
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:04,360
Man, finding someone as compatible as us is rare, isn’t it?

377
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,600
And don’t be afraid.

378
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,920
Your secret is safe with me.

379
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,520
Forever!

380
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,400
Same here.

381
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,960
I'll keep your secrets too...

382
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,880
from today until the end.

383
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,960
It’s so beautiful!

384
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,920
[Next episode]
Do you think fish can cry?

385
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,320
Can we really leave a place we think is good?

386
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,960
Does being here feel wrong to you?

387
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,600
Mom, if I don't go to Bangkok for studies,

388
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,360
would you be upset?

389
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,920
Everyone has their own journey.

390
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,880
But if they did cry, who would notice, right?

391
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:58,640
