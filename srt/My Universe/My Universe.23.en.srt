00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,520
♫Just a single glance, from your eyes straight to mine,♫

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,239
♫and my heart starts to melt.♫

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,400
♫As I come closer, I talk to you,♫

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,760
♫ I tremble, till I'm almost breathless.♫

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,840
♫ A restlessness overwhelms me, losing myself in the tide.♫

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,040
♫Is this what they call symptoms of love,♫

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,320
♫It happens every moment,♫

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,760
♫when I get a glimpse of you,

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,840
♫Are you feeling like me, perhaps,♫

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,320
♫A burning, restless whirl within the heart, do you feel so?♫

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,280
♫Every symptom shows, do you tremble too, just how much,♫

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,640
♫Feeling good, alike maybe?♫

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,600

21
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,360
Good morning, I'm Thanachot Wongkawin,
but you can call me Pond.

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,040
I hold a degree in Communication Arts
and currently, I'm 27 years old.

23
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,240
-So, content creation, is that your thing? Ever worked in that field?

24
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,400
I've been crafting content since my college days, so that’s five years now.

25
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,520
I'm all about the freelance life, haven't been under any company.

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,840
I can manage everything from start to finish on my own.

27
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:41,880
My work spans various brands on platforms like IG, Facebook, TikTok, and community websites.

28
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,120
That's it.

29
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:57,320
Today's interview day for content creators. If we are interested, we will contact you again.

30
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,920
Mrs. IMI, any more questions?

31
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,800
No, thank you.

32
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,800
How about you, Mr. Tua?

33
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,080
Um, I don't... I don't know him.

34
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,880
-Really?
-Just wanna peek at more of your past work.

35
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,200
-Sure, our team will have a look and get back to you.
-Got it.

36
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,000
Thank you so much for today.

37
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,640
- Much appreciated. I look forward to working with you soon.
-Thank you.

38
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
-Good bye!
-Thank you!

39
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,440
Mac, I'm feeling really good about this one.

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,200
Alright.

41
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,120
Hey!

42
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,280
Not even a bit excited for me?

43
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,400
Sure I would be, if you hadn't said that a hundred times already.

44
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,480
This one feels different, like they really dug my portfolio.

45
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,080
-Really?
-Yeah!

46
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Those lip-sync vids with barely a hundred views?

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,320
Nah, I've got a variety, like shabu reviews and branded stuff too.

48
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,160
My latest lip-sync hit two hundred views already.

49
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,720
You mean the 'dog's dinner' shabu review and those failed brands?

50
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
So, what job did you apply for?

51
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,440
This time, you can't poke fun at me.

52
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,640
But it´s true as you said...

53
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,400
Aiming for a chic, cool, creative role in the city's heart is too soon.

54
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,680
That's why I went for this one.

55
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,480
And what role is that?

56
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,280
Content Creator, man.

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,720
Um, social media is trending now, might even get into podcasting.

58
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,760
Seriously? You never showed any interest in school.

59
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Why? ‘Cause it's cool.

60
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Just cool, and that's it?

61
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,600
Yeah, cool and loaded. A million by 30,

62
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,280
home and car ownership, marriage at 35. Oh, and financial freedom by 40.

63
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,360
-That's my plan.
-Gosh!

64
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,920
I guess you should stop daydreaming first.

65
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,120
Success comes from learning from the pros, you know.

66
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,520
Whoa!

67
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,720
I'm telling you, stop following those life coaches

68
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,760
nobody believes them anymore.

69
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
If you really want to succeed,

70
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,760
Start by getting real about life.

71
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,720
Find something you're good at or start training from today.

72
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,159
If you're serious about content creation,

73
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,440
you've gotta figure out the difference between a 'content creator' and an 'influencer.'

74
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,240
You're never easy on me, are you?

75
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,440
-Hello there!
-Good afternoon!

76
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,920
Please, come on in.

77
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,280
I'll wash your hair first then.

78
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,840
I'll take care of you.
Move aside please?

79
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,360
Okay, I'm finished.

80
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,480
-Could you style my hair, please?
-Yes, sure.

81
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,120
Hey, you handle the wash. I'll do the styling.

82
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
How it is?

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,480
-All good?
-Yeah, perfect.

84
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,320
Off somewhere special?

85
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,880
Grabbing lunch nearby,

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,880
Cool, I'll give you a chic look.

87
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,400
Awesome.

88
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,920
First time here?

89
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,360
-Yes, bro!
-Excuse me...

90
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,000
-Like it?
-Love it!

91
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,600
Okay, all done now.

92
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,320
-Thanks a lot!
-You're welcome.

93
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,440
-Thank you!
-Thank you, sir!

94
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,120
Hey Pond!

95
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,360
Why not try working here?

96
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,520
As an employee at your shop?

97
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,000
Really?

98
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,960
Yeah, you're already good at helping out.

99
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,520
I'll even teach you hair-cutting skills.

100
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,840
Will I get paid?

101
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,640
Of course. Come on!

102
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,000
-Let's start tomorrow.
-Alright!

103
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,000
Shit!

104
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,200
Damn it!

105
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,120
Perfect, all done here.

106
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,640
Alrighty!

107
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,680
-Thanks a bunch.
-My pleasure.

108
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,680
Why the glum face?

109
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,840
You look like a sad puppy.

110
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,600
All my customers got scared off.

111
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,320
I broke a mirror this morning.

112
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,040
Ah, it's just a mirror.

113
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,840
You've got like a gazillion mirrors back home.

114
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,880
-Just use another one.
-It's not the same, dude.

115
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,080
You ever try hairdressing with a bathroom mirror?

116
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,920
Need a proper full-size one for my getups.

117
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,600
Worried? I can take you to the second-hand store down the road after work.

118
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,080
What's there?

119
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,200
-Saw some mirrors on sale there.
-For real?

120
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,720
-Yeah!
-Let's go now.

121
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,080
Hang on!

122
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,680
Calm down, dude. My shop closes at nine.

123
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,800
They'll be closed by then too, right?

124
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,520
Nah, they won't be.

125
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,320
Trust me, let's just focus on work for now.

126
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,080
Quickly!

127
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,040
-Welcome!
-Hello, sir!

128
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,400
-Good morning!
-Take a seat, please!

129
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,240
Get a move on!

130
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,960
Hurry, man! What if they're closed?

131
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,000
Slacking on day one? If they're closed, you can punch me.

132
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,040
Clench your teeth, dude.

133
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,720
-Don't bite your tongue, okay?
-Hey, wait up, Pond!

134
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,720
You'd really punch me over a mirror?

135
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,960
And how am I supposed to dress without it

136
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,880
I can't step out if my outfit isn't on point.

137
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,200
You're off the rails, you know that?

138
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,120
Hello! Is anyone there? I'd like to buy something.

139
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,680
I'd like to buy something. Could you open up?

140
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,040
There's no one here, man. The shop is closed now.

141
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,200
Pond...

142
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,200
What's wrong?

143
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,040
It's nothing.

144
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,360
Pond...

145
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
-Wait here for me!
-Hold on!

146
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:16,600
[Pond Yelling]
-Pond...!

147
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,960
Darn it!

148
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,880
What have you brought now?

149
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,080
A mirror!

150
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,960
The size is really good. It's a little old but it looks fuckin' good.

151
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,600
You screamed as if someone was killing you.

152
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,840
What's the deal?

153
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,760
I'm an influencer, gotta react big.

154
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,800
Gosh!

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,440
-And what now? Are you taking it home?
-Yeah, why not?

156
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,360
It would be a waste to leave it.

157
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,120
But are you sure it was dumped?

158
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,600
It was there, how could it not be thrown away?

159
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,560
If we don't take it, it will just get ruined.

160
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,000
I wouldn't if I were you.

161
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,800
Old mirrors like this could have a past.

162
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,680
Don't take it, gives me the creeps.

163
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,200
-Hold this.
-What now?

164
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,600
Dear mirror,

165
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,000
if anyone owns this, come break my neck.

166
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,520
Otherwise, it's mine.

167
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,040
No take-backs, got it?

168
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,720
I'm bringing this home.

169
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,360
Let's take it home.

170
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,760
Fine, do whatever you want. Let's carry it.

171
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,040
-Oh, this thing's heavy.
-Not too bad

172
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,720
-Yes, it is. Quite a load.
-Yippee!

173
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,200
Oh fuck!

174
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,800
Pond...

175
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,440

176
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,040
I really want to see you.

177
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,680
Darn it!

178
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,760
All done here.

179
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,480
Pardon me...

180
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,640
May I...

181
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,480
Alright, sir! Thank you.

182
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,320
Thank you.

183
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,880
Hold on!

184
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,960
How's this?

185
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,200
-Um...looks good.
-Is it alright?

186
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,680
That's good.

187
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,480
Thank yo so much.

188
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,640
Thank you, sir!

189
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,840
-Pond, what's up today?
-What do you mean?

190
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,880
What do you mean?

191
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,120
Do I seem off? I'm totally fine.

192
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,160
You seem freaked by mirrors...

193
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,320
-Is it about that mirror?
-Hey, listen...

194
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,240
I'm just... trying not to look in mirrors today,

195
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,000
Feels like I'm losing my personality.

196
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,200
-Really?
-Yeah.

197
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,520
Sure?

198
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,560
I told you not to mess with that stuff.

199
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,040
What now?

200
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,480
It's done, no use complaining.

201
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,800
What? Closed again?

202
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,560
This is odd. Does this guy ever open his shop?

203
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,640
-He's open sometimes,
-Shit!

204
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,680
but my granpa's been sick lately.

205
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,400
You guys looking to buy something?

206
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,080
Damn, Pai, you scared us!

207
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,360
How's it going? Finished your work in Europe?

208
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,960
Look, my granpa's suddenly sick,

209
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,920
so I had to to rush back.

210
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,920
He's worried about the shop.

211
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,160
What's with the faces? You look like you've seen a ghost.

212
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,320
You know this guy?

213
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,760
Yeah, he's an old junior.

214
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,480
-Good to meet you!
-Good to meet you too!

215
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,920
He's a travel companion, really nailed it.

216
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,080
Pai, about the mirror you had left there...

217
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
is it yours?

218
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh, you guys took it?

219
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,840
Come, sit down, I'll explain.

220
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,360
Here...

221
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,960
Was wondering why my uncle kept going on about a mirror.

222
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,360
I came to the shop and it was missing.

223
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,280
And what did he say?

224
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,240
-The ancient and big one, right?
-Yes.

225
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,960
If I'm not mistaken, it's been with my grandpa since I was a child.

226
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,680
But lately, he's been saying it's haunted or something,

227
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,760
like seeing shadows in it or hearing voices.

228
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,760
We even had monks, mediums check it out,

229
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,080
nobody could do anything.

230
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,280
So, we decided to keep it outside the shop.

231
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,240
Just like what I experienced.

232
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,880
Did the mirror ghost call out to you and your grandpa too?

233
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,800
No, not exactly

234
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,960
He said it was calling out some other names,

235
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,680
like Pong or something similar.
-Oh man!

236
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,240
Shit!

237
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,960
-Pong... what?
-That´s my fucking name.

238
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,920
So you've already taken it, right?

239
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,920
Honestly, it's fine. I feel more at ease now it's gone.

240
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,840
But if you're unsure what to do,

241
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,760
try communicating with it.

242
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,360
My shop has a spirit board and glass for sale.

243
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,800
Whoa, you're really freaked out, aren't you?

244
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,120
You wouldn't understand unless it happens to you.

245
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,000
We should've grabbed that spirit glass, figure out what it wants.

246
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,960
So, we could resolve  it at once.

247
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,360
Just moving it out of the room is enough for me.

248
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,480
-Sure, which one?
-Here, can you help me?

249
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,280
This one?

250
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Shouldn't we take off the cover first?

251
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,560
Hey, you can't do that.

252
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,200
Don’t you dare remove it!

253
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,680
Don't!!!

254
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,560
Hey, Pond, you okay?

255
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,400
I'm fine.

256
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,440
What happened? You just fell over.

257
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,720
I know now.

258
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,200
Here...

259
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,920
This is Marvin, an old buddy of mine.

260
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,880
We were very close when he was in high school and I was in university.

261
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,680
I forgot about him.

262
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,200
You and Marvin were close?

263
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,880
[News report of a car crash. One survivor, two fatalities. The family supposedly dozed off while driving.]

264
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,280
Yes, we were close like you and me.

265
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,080
I tutored him for university.

266
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,120
Suddenly he disappeared.

267
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Later, I found out that...

268
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,960
Members of his family were killed in an accident.

269
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,440
Marvin?

270
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,280
Pond?

271
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,280
You're not dead?

272
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,920
Huh?

273
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,720
-Let's talk inside, okay?
-Sure thing.

274
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,760
Starting off with curses, huh?

275
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,880
So, how could you come here?

276
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,640
It's a long story.

277
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,280
You might not believe it.

278
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,760
How've you been, disappeared for so long?

279
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,440
Everything good with you?

280
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,480
Yup,

281
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,120
I've been okay.

282
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,760
I heard about your family.

283
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,520
I'm sorry.

284
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Yeah, it's been a while.

285
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,400
Thank you.

286
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,840
I knew from the news.

287
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,320
They said the whole family was gone.

288
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,200
If I knew you were alive,

289
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,720
I would've reached out sooner.

290
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,840
I'm sorry.

291
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,640
No problem, bro.

292
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Actually, I woke up in a hospital after that crash.

293
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,560
I've been keeping to myself since then.

294
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,320
You have a lot of photo frames.

295
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,640
Why so many?

296
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,360
So,

297
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,240
I keep them for the future pictures.

298
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
But Pond,

299
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,240
you have a lot of mirrors at your place, right?

300
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,400
That's right.

301
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,840
Hold on,

302
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,240
how did you know about that?

303
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,240
Huh?

304
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,520
I've dreamt about it.

305
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,320
Me too, actually.

306
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,160
Same here. That's how I found my way here.

307
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,160
It's like fate.

308
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
I've always wanted to meet you.

309
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,080
Thought I'd never see you again.

310
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,880
Vin!

311
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,960
Are you okay?

312
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,080
Oh, Vin!

313
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,520
[Pond is calling Marvin]

314
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,080
Are you still alright?

315
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,160
what's wrong? Marvin?

316
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,520
Huh?

317
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,840
-Asthma...
-Asthma?

318
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,280
Inhaler... where is it?

319
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,160
Upstairs.

320
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,280
How do you feel?

321
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,680
Feeling better now?

322
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,960
Much better, thanks.

323
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,720
So you have asthma?

324
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,000
Yeah.

325
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,000
Yes, I have.

326
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,800
It's severe, isn't it?

327
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,720
I dreamt you were almost dying from coughing.

328
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,080
Actually, besides asthma,

329
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,600
I have an autoimmune disease too.

330
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,200
The doctor said

331
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,240
my time is limited.

332
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,360
But what I feared the most

333
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,160
was not being able to see my friends again,

334
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,400
especially you.

335
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,080
I didn’t know how to reach out to you,

336
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,680
just always prayed to see you again.

337
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,920
And today,

338
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,240
it's like a miracle happened.

339
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,280
Because of the mirror?

340
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,880
The mirror?

341
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,880
Yeah!

342
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,040
That old mirror in your room. I have a similar one.

343
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,679
Ever since I got it, it's like I've been seeing you all the time.

344
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,360
I think they're connected somehow.

345
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,920
-Grandma wasn't kidding.
-Huh?

346
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,719
This mirror has been in our family for a long time.

347
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,679
She said it's a magical mirror

348
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,639
that can make wishes come true.

349
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,040
And every night when I'm alone,

350
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,159
I've been thinking about seeing you again.

351
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,160
Marvin!

352
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
I'm sorry, man.

353
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,960
I had no clue you wanted to see me this badly.

354
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,400
You need anything else?

355
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,680
I don't really need anything.

356
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,800
Just...

357
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,520
I just need good memories with you

358
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,960
to fill up these photo frames.

359
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,040
Then,

360
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,040
who else?

361
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,520
Who else do you want to meet?

362
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,560
How about this? Let's get together with everyone.

363
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,480
Our old tutoring group.

364
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,600
Um...

365
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,600
But don't tell others I'm sick.

366
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
I don't want them to worry.

367
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,200
Okay, no worries.

368
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,360
Let's take a pic.

369
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,280
Just smile...okay.

370
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,480
I finally met Marvin, folks!

371
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,200
How about a reunion? Been ages.

372
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,720
[JamJam: Let's go, haven't met in years. Miss you guys.]

373
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,720
[Name: Sounds good. Shall we have tutoring session, teenagers?]

374
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,400
[JK: Where should we meet? I'm hungry.]

375
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,120
[Mymild: here's this place near Siam. I really like it.]

376
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,200
You see everyone's comments.

377
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,400
Everyone wants to see you.

378
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Thank you, Pond.

379
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,080
Let's meet up, come on.

380
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,240
[Name:  Sorry guys, can't make it today, my kid is sick.]

381
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,680
[JamJam: Same here, have to dine with a client.]

382
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,480
[Mymild: If Jam isn't going, I'm out too.]

383
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,440
[Boy:  Wow, many are busy. Should we reschedule?]

384
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,760
[JK: Yeah, let's plan for a day when everyone's free.]

385
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,840
[Name: Agreed, we'll set another date.]

386
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,840
Hey!

387
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,640
Oh!

388
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,200
Why did you bring food?

389
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,240
Weren't we meeting the tutoring gang?

390
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,560
The plan fell through,

391
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,000
So, I brought food to eat with you instead.

392
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,680
Disappointed?

393
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,440
Yeah,

394
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,800
A bit disappointed.

395
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,240
But it's fine, at least you're here.

396
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,320
Shall we go in?

397
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,040
Okay!

398
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,880
I'll eat it up just to make them jealous.

399
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,680
What have you bought?

400
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,880
Oh...

401
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,800
-there is a lot of it
-Think you can handle it?

402
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,280
I'll try, but it's a lot.

403
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,400
No worries, we can always save some for later.

404
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:24,960
Alright.

405
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,040
Finally, we're together again.

406
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,840
These are our first memories.

407
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,880
But I promise, this won't be the last time.

408
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,040
We've got a whole lot of memories ahead.

409
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,200
Even if there's no one else, remember this

410
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,280
You'll always have me.

411
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,920
Why do you go to such lengths for me, Pond?

412
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,680
Because we're buddies, right?

413
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,360
I'm sorry.

414
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,880
I bet it's been lonely for you lately

415
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,880
It's okay.

416
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,520
I'm not lonely anymore.

417
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,560
Then let's make life fun together.

418
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,360
Let's live it up together.

419
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,840
[Next episode]
Why are you so good to me?

420
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,360
Hey, Marvin! What brings you here?

421
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,240
I just want to see your workplace.

422
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,680
Thanks for making me feel so happy, after all these years.

423
