[Previous episode]
 Coach, do you like me?

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,479
Well...

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,720
Yes, I do.

24
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,920
You and I can be together?

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,039
Sure!

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Jay!

27
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,840
What are you doing, little Pun?

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,800
Pun: Jay!
Team: Oh, wait!

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,800
Guys, let me go.

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,120
Tonight,

31
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,280
I'll take one of our reserved rooms, okay?

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,600
I’d love to clear things up with him.

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,480
Alright.

34
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,560
Where are you dragging me to?

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,480
Just for a chat.

36
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Anything else to talk, huh?

37
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
We might get caught again.

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,560
I have a room where no one will see us.

39
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,800
Jay!

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,240
I didn’t tell my friends about meeting you.

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,600
If you didn't tell, how'd they know you were meeting me?

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,040
I don't know, they could track me.

43
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,800
Soon, even the coach will find out.

44
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,200
My friend promised to keep it a secret.

45
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,920
The head coach won't know.

46
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,440
Secret, huh?

47
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,640
How's this a secret?

48
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,480
You yanked me out in front of everyone.

49
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,440
Everyone at the event saw it.

50
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,720
Teachers and staff might suspect something.

51
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,560
Can I ask you frankly?

52
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,960
And you must answer me frankly.

53
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,160
Why keep this so secret?

54
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,839
I don’t understand.

55
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,480
It could wreck my coaching career.

56
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,320
Aren't you aware?

57
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Coaches are forbidden to have relationships with athletes.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,240
That’s selfish of you.

59
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,040
You knew the risks,

60
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,080
and the potential fallout,

61
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
you shouldn’t have gotten involved with me.

62
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,000
You think I'm selfish?

63
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,960
My good intentions seem selfish to you?

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,240
You know what...

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,080
Remember when you were criticized for poor performance?
It was actually poorer than that.

66
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,760
I fudged your stats to look better.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Or you'd be fucking dismissed.

68
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,800
Why the hell did you do that?

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,120
If my performance was lacking, just report it.

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,720
And another thing...

71
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,600
Remember your standout performance?

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,640
Pun, you really shone today.

73
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,360
Keep this up, and you'll be off the bench next time.

74
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,760
Just stick with it, okay?

75
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Sure thing, Coach! Thanks!

76
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,760
Team: Thanks, Coach!

77
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,720
That was all me.

78
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,280
How's that possible?

79
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,440
It was my solid play, that's why he praised me.

80
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,360
You really don't get it?

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,440
I spiked your water with stimulants.

82
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,560
Without that, you wouldn't have played so well.

83
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,000
Come on, you're a coach!

84
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,400
You're a damn coach!

85
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,280
Why would you do that?

86
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,640
This is insane!

87
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,320
I'm gonna spill it to the head coach.

88
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,880
No, you can't do that!

89
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,680
Pun: I’m going to tell him!
Coach Jay: I said no!

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,520
You can’t do like that, Pun!

91
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,560
You can’t report my good intentions to the coach.

92
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,880
I have been doing this for you, Pun!

93
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,200
Good intentions?
Don't pretend they’re for me.

94
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,120
You did it for yourself.

95
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,800
Without my help,

96
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,840
you’d always be a reserve player for life.

97
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,680
If I hadn't intervened,

98
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,200
you wouldn't be a main player.

99
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,080
I'd rather be a reserve forever...

100
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,840
than a main player through shady means.

101
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,760
Let go of me!

102
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,080
The head coach needs to know your dirty tricks.

103
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,920
Back off!

104
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,920
Release me!

105
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,120
Let me go!

106
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,920
I can't let you go.

107
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,440
I won’t let you go.

108
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,880
I fucking love you so much!

109
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,880
I fucking love you!

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,400
Mhok, Camp!

111
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,600
Hey, Mhok, Camp!

112
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,200
Wake up!

113
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,840
Wake up, Mhok, Camp!

114
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,960
Oh, what's all the noise for?

115
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Wake up, it's time to check out.

116
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,280
Phol!

117
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,160
Wake up!

118
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,440
Phol!

119
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,120
Hey Phol, wake up.

120
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,800
Or I'm going to jump on you.

121
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,240
Phol!

122
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,480
You're like a ton of bricks!
Why jump on me?

123
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,560
You wouldn't wake up any other way.

124
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,080
Meen: Everyone, up now!

125
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,840
Alright, I'm awake.

126
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,440
Come up!

127
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,040
Hey, what's up with Pun?

128
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,000
They're probably done talking by now.

129
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,480
Shall we go check on him?

130
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,120
Shall we?

131
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,560
Meen: Phol, wanna go?
Phol: Let's do it!

132
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,480
Meen: Camp, you in?
Camp: Count me in.

133
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,400
And you, Mhok?

134
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,640
Alright, I’m coming too.

135
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,240
Let's have a little fun with him.

136
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,240
What are we waiting for?

137
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Let's go!
Go, go, go.

138
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,600
Time to see our friend!

139
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,440
Meen: Go, go, go.
Hurry up, Phol, you were the last to wake up!

140
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,680
Let’s go!

141
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,240
Phol: Hey, let me get a shirt.
Meen: Hurry up then!

142
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,800
Let's go see our pal.

143
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,960
It's Friday night, hope he had fun.

144
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,880
Yeah, hopefully.

145
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,360
Hey, why are the police and rescue team here?

146
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,040
Move!

147
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,600
What´s going on?

148
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,920
Go!

149
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,920
Oh, coach...

150
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,960
Go!

151
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,880
Camp: Is that Coach Jay?
Meen: Yeah.

152
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,040
Why's Coach Jay handcuffed?

153
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,160
What's going on here?

154
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,120
Phol: Where's Pun?
Team: Yeah, where is he?

155
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
What's happened here?

156
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,120
There was a murder last night.

157
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,760
Mhok: Let me through!

158
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,760
Mhok: I need to see my friend.
Police: You can't go in.

159
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,080
Pun, wake up, man!

160
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,080
Team: C'mon, Pun, wake up!

161
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,680
Camp: Pun, please, talk to me!

162
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,320
Pun, wake up now!

163
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,680
Pun, wake up!

164
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,960
Wake up, Pun, right now!

165
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,120
Is that a message from the one leaving the water?

166
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,280
You're all grins there, huh?

167
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,880
Get up, gently!

168
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,080
Grab my neck!

169
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,400
Oh, little Pun!

170
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,480
You're so annoying, huh?
Come on, let's roll.

171
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
Got it!

172
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,440
Team: Let’s go!

173
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,000
Mhok: No sweat, bro.
We'll give it another shot.

174
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,400
I’m alright.

175
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,080
MC: Please welcome the president and Captain Mhok to the stage.

176
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,680
I’m going to see my friend.

177
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:15,680
[3 years later]

178
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,640
I’m sorry, Pun.

179
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,720
I should've been there with you.

180
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,160
Hey, Mhok.

181
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,440
Hello, Coach!

182
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,680
How have you been?

183
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,360
I’m good, coach.

184
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,160
And you, Coach?

185
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,560
I’m all good too.

186
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,080
Today's the anniversary of Pun's passing, isn't it?

187
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,120
Is that why you’re here?

188
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Yes, Coach.

189
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,600
Three years since Pun left us.

190
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,360
Time sure flies, doesn't it?

191
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,400
Hey guys!

192
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,400
What’s up!

193
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,200
Still have a lot of energy, huh?

194
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,440
If you've got that much left,

195
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,000
go for five laps around the field!

196
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,480
Really, Coach?

197
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,200
Do I look like I'm joking?

198
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,640
Or is five too easy for you?

199
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,320
How about ten laps then?

200
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,200
No, no, coach!

201
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,440
Let's go, guys!

202
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,000
Hurry up!

203
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,240
Mhok: Pun, hurry up!
Pun: I'm running.

204
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,000
Keep going!

205
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,320
Hang in there!

206
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,640
Man, I'm beat.
I just can't go on.

207
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,480
I can’t go on anymore!

208
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,560
Pun, get up already!

209
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,120
If coach catches us, it's game over.

210
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,640
I'm done for.

211
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,080
Just one last round.

212
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,040
Up you go!

213
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,640
Pun!

214
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,960
Are you going to get up or not?

215
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,440
No way!

216
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,840
You're not getting up, right?

217
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,440
No!

218
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,880
You’re not getting up?

219
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Pun: No way!
Mhok: Okay then.

220
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,680
Oi Mhok! Get off,
you weigh a ton!

221
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,600
Yes, Coach.

222
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,520
Time flies so fast, it's hard to keep up.

223
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,680
By the way,

224
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,080
I've got news for you.

225
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,760
This Friday, there's a celebration for a football win.

226
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,280
As your junior team has won.
Just like you did three years ago.

227
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,840
I want you and your old teammates to come.

228
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,280
You can't miss it.

229
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,720
Okay, Coach.

230
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,080
I'll let them know.

231
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,840
Where's it happening?

232
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,040
At the same hotel, in the same hall as before.

233
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,880
Don't forget to tell them.

234
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
You can't miss it.

235
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,560
Got it, Coach!

236
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,200
I need to head out now.

237
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,920
Goodbye!

238
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,520
What’s up?

239
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,760
Visiting Pun too, huh?

240
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,079
You as well?

241
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,480
Yeah.

242
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,920
I miss you, Pun.

243
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,360
Been here long?

244
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Just a bit.

245
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,560
Well,

246
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,040
can't believe it's already been three years since Pun's gone.

247
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,880
Guys, here comes the star!

248
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,960
Finally, you've arrived.

249
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,000
Mhok: What's good!
You all came so early.

250
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,280
It's not early.
You're just late, Pun!

251
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,640
Late?

252
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,600
It's not even practice time yet.

253
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,480
You've annoyed me again.

254
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,720
Let’s roll!

255
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes, sir!

256
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,400
Team: Let’s go!

257
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,480
Oh, come on, little Pun.

258
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,480
No worries, mate.
We'll try again.

259
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,480
I'm fine, really.

260
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,040
MC: Please welcome Captain Mhok to the stage.

261
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,440
Time passes as quickly as a lie.

262
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,760
Still hard to grasp that
he's been gone for three years.

263
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,480
You guys always get here before us.

264
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,440
Miss you, man.

265
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,720
I miss you too,

266
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,160
my little Pun.

267
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,920
Damn, I’m not kid anymore.

268
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,320
Oh, come on, little Pun.

269
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,000
Meen: Just kidding.

270
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,760
If he were here, he'd have told you off.

271
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,000
for calling him 'little'.

272
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,440
How's everyone doing?

273
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,600
Doing well.

274
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,520
Yeah, same here.

275
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,160
How about you guys?

276
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,920
Doing well,

277
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
nothing new really.

278
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,320
Same here,

279
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,600
Doing well, right?

280
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,960
Guys,

281
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,840
I just spoke with the head coach.

282
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,360
He's invited us to celebrate the junior team's win

283
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,080
like we did three years ago.

284
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,880
So, where's it at?

285
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,800
It's not at the same hotel, is it?

286
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,440
It is.

287
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,400
The same hotel, same banquet hall.

288
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,280
Let's toast!

289
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,600
You’re so cool, Mhok!

290
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,280
Camp: You look so cool!

291
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,120
Mhok: Let me kiss it first.

292
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,800
One, two... Hooray!

293
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,600
C'mon!
Let's toast one more time.

294
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,560
Where should we put this?

295
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,920
Put it here.
Let other people see it.

296
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,760
Just show it!

297
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,800
Mhok: I run every day for this win.
Camp: Come on, let's toast!

298
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,640
At the end we are champions.

299
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,440
Shit!

300
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Are we really going back there?

301
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,960
That’s where we lost Pun.

302
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,800
We should go.

303
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,080
The coach himself invited us.
It would be wrong not to.

304
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,320
Let’s do it!
It'll be okay.

305
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,240
Alright, guess we have to go.

306
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,080
Alright, let’s go.

307
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,800
Let's meet outside the hotel this Friday, okay?

308
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,120
Team: See you there!

309
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,440
I have to get going,
got work waiting.

310
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,800
I have some too.

311
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,360
Should we head back together?

312
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,760
Phol, you leaving now?

313
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,360
Yeah!
Shall we go?

314
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,440
Sure, let's go!

315
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,440
I'm leaving now, man!

316
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,680
We'll be back next year.

317
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,640
See you again!

318
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,680
Evening, Coach!

319
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,640
Camp: Good evening, Coach!
Coach Long time no see!

320
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,480
Happy you could make it.

321
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,480
Our pleasure.

322
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,040
Let's head in!

323
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,640
Team: Thanks, Coach!

324
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,040
I miss that time a lot.

325
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,520
I really miss Pun.

326
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,080
Feels like nothing's changed.

327
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,040
But you look older.

328
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,680
You too, with that mustache.

329
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,480
We are all old!

330
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,600
Your mustache is greener than ever.

331
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,640
It suits my age.

332
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,440
Your mustache go gray too?

333
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,240
Going gray? Really?

334
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,920
That's overkill!

335
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,400
I'll grab some drinks.

336
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,640
What's everyone want?

337
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,080
A soft drink for me

338
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,360
Soft drink here too.

339
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
Phol, what about you?

340
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,000
I’ll go with you.

341
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,800
Mhok: Back in a bit.
Camp: Sure thing.

342
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,360
Why did it take so long?

343
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,240
Here they are

344
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,360
Oh, speak of the devil.

345
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,520
Thank you!

346
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,560
You nailed it, man!

347
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,720
Looks like Captain Mhok!

348
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,200
Reminds me of our win three years ago.

349
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,960
We too received an award like this.

350
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,200
If Pun were here, it'd be a blast.

351
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,720
We shouldn't have let him go alone with Coach Jay.

352
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,960
Maybe he wouldn’t have died.

353
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,680
It was an unexpected tragedy.

354
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,040
No one could've predicted it.

355
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,240
Don't overthink it!

356
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,240
Do you think Pun might come tonight?

357
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,720
How could he?

358
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,000
He's gone.

359
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,360
Maybe as a ghost.

360
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,320
Remember, he did pass away here.

361
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,040
His spirit might still be lingering around.

362
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,120
Who knows?

363
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,240
Good. If he’s still lingering here,

364
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,680
let him show up.

365
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,400
I'd love that.

366
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,240
I miss him.

367
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,560
Let's try calling him.

368
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,720
Hey, is that a good idea?

369
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,880
Yes.

370
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,840
I also want to see him.

371
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,640
So, how do we summon him?

372
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,960
Ever tried a glass séance?

373
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,440
Phol: A glass séance?
Meen: Exactly!

374
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,720
But we need a board.

375
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,040
Where can we get one?

376
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,680
Where can we find one?

377
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,760
Good question.

378
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,720
Let's try something simpler.

379
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,320
Like what?

380
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,560
Light some incense and call him.

381
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,440
Where do we get incense?

382
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,160
Come on, any convenience store has them.

383
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,200
Alright!

384
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,920
So, let's go for it.

385
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,840
Mhok, go to convenience store

386
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,560
go buy incense, candles

387
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,000
rice, and a glass.

388
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,240
We’ll use the rice to hold the incense.

389
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,360
No need for a lighter, I've got one.

390
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,400
Where do we set this up?

391
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,160
Meen: Good point.

392
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,520
How about the rooftop?

393
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,600
Phol: The hotel rooftop?
Meen: Sounds good.

394
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,000
Mhok!

395
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,240
You go buy the stuff at the convenience store.

396
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,560
I'll go check out the rooftop.

397
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,760
Alright.

398
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,360
Meen: I’ll join you.
Phol: Sure!

399
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,520
So, I’ll go with Mhok.

400
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,520
Well, see you!

401
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,080
Let’s go!

402
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,080
Hey Mhok, don't leave me.

403
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,520
Phol: The rooftop's got plenty of space.
Meen: Yeah.

404
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,800
And the sky's so clear.

405
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,920
Do you think Pun might show up?

406
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,040
I really hope so.

407
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,080
Hey, Meen!

408
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,640
Are you scared of ghosts?

409
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,360
Gosh, they freak me out.

410
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,880
If Pun appears, I'd ask for lotto numbers.

411
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,520
Let's see how brave you are.

412
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,520
No need to fear,
it's just our friend's ghost.

413
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,800
I'm not scared, just a bit worn out.

414
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,880
I'm more tired from dragging you up here.

415
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,640
Phol: Come here!

416
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,280
Meen: Got everything?
Mhok: There you go.

417
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,120
Completed!

418
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,600
Completed, right?

419
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,480
Hold on, Mhok!

420
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,400
Pour the rice into the glass.

421
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
I’ll hold the glass for you.

422
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,520
Should be okay?

423
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,200
Camp!

424
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,240
Are you alright?

425
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,440
Yeah, I’m alright.

426
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,800
Think he'll show up?

427
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,640
Definitely, he's our friend.

428
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,040
Here, Mhok!

429
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,840
Thank you!

430
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,760
Shall we start?

431
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,280
Should we chant anything special?

432
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,640
No chants needed.

433
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,360
Just focus on Pun and invite him over.

434
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,880
Alright, let’s try.

435
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,520
Nothing's happening.

436
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,120
Where’s Pun?

437
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,680
Maybe this doesn't work.

438
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,160
Perhaps he doesn't want to come.

439
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,800
Camp: Let’s go back!
Team: Oh!

440
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,400
Shoot!

441
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,240
Must be the wind, huh?

442
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,720
Yeah, it's blowing like crazy!

443
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,160
Exactly.

444
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,560
[Shout]

445
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,520
Meen: Shoot!

446
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,600
This doesn't feel like just wind.
What on earth!

447
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,520
Meen: Way too quick.

448
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,400
Camp, you freaked out?

449
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,840
Totally!

450
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,120
Just hold me tight.

451
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,760
Meen, why'd you smack me?

452
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,400
Mhok, why are you hitting me?
Damn it!

453
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,400
I got smacked too.

454
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,440
Phol, was it you?

455
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,920
Not me.

456
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,280
Camp, did you hit me?

457
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,600
Who smacked you?
[Shout]

458
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,560
It was me.

459
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,680
Hey, Pun!

460
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,480
Camp: Me too!

461
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,560
We've missed you.

462
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,560
We've been missing you so much.

463
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,120
Pun: Missed you guys too.

464
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,760
Miss you.

465
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,720
You were joking with us, right?

466
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,760
From slamming doors,
toppling the incense holder,

467
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,800
and hitting our heads.

468
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,440
Yep, that was me.

469
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,680
Fuck you!

470
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,520
I almost peed myself with shock.

471
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,200
My heart nearly stopped.

472
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,720
Hey, Camp!
That's our friend.

473
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,640
Aren't you scared, Meen?
 I'm in shock.

474
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,440
Yes, I can see.

475
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,680
Mhok, why so quiet?

476
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,400
What's up?

477
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,360
Sorry, Pun.

478
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,560
That day, I didn’t go with you.

479
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,000
I should've been there that day.

480
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,360
Maybe you wouldn't have died.

481
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,840
It's not on you.

482
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,240
I never thought Coach Jay would go so far.

483
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,160
If we hadn't been nosy

484
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,199
and hadn't discovered your secret with him,

485
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,639
you might not have died.

486
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,840
Don't blame yourselves.

487
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,679
He didn’t kill me just because
you guys knew about our secret.

488
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,239
He was more worried about losing his career
for breaking the rules.

489
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,040
The head coach banned relationships
with team athletes.

490
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,920
More importantly,

491
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:39,440
he was terrified I'd reveal he'd been spiking
my water with stimulants

492
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,360
during my practice.

493
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,440
He put stimulants in your water?

494
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,719
When?

495
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
That day Coach praised me for playing well.

496
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,880
The day with the water bottle in your locker?

497
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,800
Yes, that day.

498
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,040
So evil!

499
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,560
He was a coach

500
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,040
but couldn’t follow the rules.

501
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,240
Lucky he's not coaching anymore.

502
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,880
He belongs behind bars.

503
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,440
He ruined his future himself.

504
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,000
What a coach he was,

505
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,360
giving banned substances to athletes?

506
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,080
He said he was doing it for my good,

507
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,320
wanting me to play as a main player.

508
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,800
Good goals, bad methods, right?

509
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,320
Something on your mind, Mhok?

510
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,640
I really miss you, Pun!

511
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,400
Without you,

512
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,800
it's been so empty.

513
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,480
No one to invite me for meals.

514
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,000
The locker room feels too silent.

515
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,240
I miss all of you too.

516
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,480
I miss you so much.

517
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,640
I miss you too.

518
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,160
I miss you more than these guys.

519
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,520
I miss you all!

520
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,880
We miss you too, Pun!

521
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,840
I need to leave now, guys.

522
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,720
Where to?

523
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
To the place where I must go.

524
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,320
Your rightful place, huh?

525
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,360
Thanks for everything.

526
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,600
I'm so grateful

527
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,400
to have been friend with you all.

528
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,400
We're thankful for your friendship too.

529
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,040
You are the best friends anyone could ever want.

530
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,760
From now on,

531
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,440
I hope everyone of you find happiness every day,

532
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,000
and succeed in whatever paths you choose.

533
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,440
If we are reborn in the next life,

534
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,400
let’s be friends again.

535
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,560
Absolutely!

536
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,360
I'll always remember you, Pun!

537
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,480
We'll reunite someday.

538
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,400
Next life, let’s be friends again.

539
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,120
Mhok: Pun, hurry up!
Pun: I'm running.

540
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,800
Just a little more!

541
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,960
Oh, I'm exhausted.
I can't go on.

542
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,560
I can’t go on anymore!

543
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,040
Are you going to get up or not?

544
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,720
No way!

545
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,080
You're not getting up, right?

546
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,640
No!

547
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,640
Mhok: You’re not getting up?
Pun: No way!

548
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,720
Okay then.

549
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,000
Hey Mhok! You're heavy.
Get off me!

550
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,440
Oh, come on, little Pun.

551
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,280
You're so annoying, huh?
Hurry and follow me.

552
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,600
Let’s go!

553
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,640
Take it, Meen!

554
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,920
That’s it!
Good!

555
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,920
Meen: Did you just hit my friend?

556
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,880
Meen: Shit!

557
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,360
Hey Hey Hey...
What's going on?

558
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,000
Mhok: Are you okay?
Meen: You alright?

559
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,880
It hurts. I can't get up.

560
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,720
I think we should take Pun to the sideline.

561
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,440
Mhok, Camp, please take him aside.

562
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,440
I think it's better for him to rest in the locker room

563
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,200
Fine.

564
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,480
Please take care of him.

565
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,000
Yes, coach.

566
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,320
Come on,
get up slowly.

567
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,520
Hold my neck!

568
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,680
Walk slowly!

569
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,640
The rest, continue practicing.

570
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,320
Yes, Coach!

571
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,560
Please welcome Captain Mhok to the stage.

572
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,640
Hey, I’ll be right back.

573
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,920
You’re the coolest, mate!

574
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,560
Let’s give my friend a round of applause.

575
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,160
You’re so cool, Mhok!

576
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,040
I’m okay.

577
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,320
I’m used to being scolded.

578
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,240
Hey, it's okay.
Let's do it again.

579
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,360
I’m okay, no worries.

580
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,200
Let’s get inside.

581
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,640
Oh, yeah, go, go, go!

582
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,040
Go, go, go!

583
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,880
Hey, run, run!

584
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,800
Let’s go, guys!

585
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,840
Camp, why the rush?

586
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,680
Gotta see my boyfriend.

587
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,800
Oh, so bored of the boyfriend junkie.

588
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,520
Phol, you are addicted to your boyfriend too.

589
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,000
Camp: Really, Phol?
Mhok: Look who's talking!

590
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,280
Phol: Okay, okay, let's head back.
Meen: Off we go.

591
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,840
Let’s go, guys!

592
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,080
Phol: How about noodles at our favorite spot?
Meen: Sounds good.

593
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,960
[Next Episode]
There he is.

594
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,560
Go for it!

595
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,360
Phol!

596
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,440
My name’s Peem.

597
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,720
Can I get your number?

598
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,520
Done talking?

599
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,960
Damn!

600
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,800
What a lack of manners.
Thinks he’s so handsome or what?

601
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,880
