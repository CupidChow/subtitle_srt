Bangkok?

23
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,400
They’ll close the application next week.
Made up your mind yet?

24
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,520
Mind? About what exactly?

25
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,440
About the exam...

26
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,520
Ah, right.

27
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,800
You seem lost in thought about it, am I right?

28
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,760
You're all quiet, like you're hesitant to go.

29
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,079
And I don't want to pressure you.

30
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,640
It's not about going.

31
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,760
It's the English test, it's tough.

32
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,560
-Can I ask something?
-Yeah?

33
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,040
When people ask what your strengths are,

34
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,480
what's your answer?

35
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,560
Probably my academics.

36
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,840
The only weapon I can think of right now is my school report.

37
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,720
And if someone asks you what I'm good at,

38
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
what would you say?

39
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,720
I'd say... um,

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,920
Is it that tough to answer?

41
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,920
Maybe... having fun?

42
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,519
What's that mean?

43
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,520
Like this exam you're pushing. You just taking it for fun.

44
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,200
No, I'm dead serious about it.

45
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,880
For real?

46
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,720
I'm serious.

47
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
Totally. Come take it with me.

48
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
You told your mom?

49
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,880
You know that. She's cool with whatever.

50
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
Well, we should tell her first.

51
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,680
So, if she says yes, you're in?

52
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,840
Not sure...

53
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,920
Still thinking it over.

54
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,600
Doesn't it scare you?

55
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,080
Scared of what?

56
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,080
We've never been to Bangkok.

57
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:44,480
What if we move and don't like it?

58
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,680
Then what?

59
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,280
Don't worry about that.

60
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,840
If you're cool with it, let's just try the exam.

61
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,240
We'll figure out the rest later.

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,560
I mean it.

63
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,000
I promise to study hard.

64
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,520
You have to help me, okay?

65
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,240
But back to what we were saying.

66
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,240
If your weapon is your school report,

67
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,760
what's my secret weapon, you think?

68
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,720
You don’t have.

69
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,800
Still not ready? Why are you chilling?

70
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,280
You complain so much.

71
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,680
You take forever.

72
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,160
Think Left and Right are bored?

73
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,720
Fish probably don't get bored.

74
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,680
But who is bored is... me.

75
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,200
Next time, don't forget to charge your phone.

76
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,200
If we do head to Bangkok,

77
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,000
I want to take them with us.

78
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,600
Can you even tell which is Left and which is Right?

79
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,680
I know them apart. Nothing's completely identical.

80
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,360
So, you getting ready now?

81
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,480
Morning! Salute courteously!

82
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,840
-What's this?
-Take a look, please.

83
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,240
One moment!

84
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
-New here?
-Yes.

85
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,240
Come with me.

86
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,160
Okay...

87
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,800
Let's start with question one.

88
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,560
Today's topic is...?

89
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,040
The reproductive system of...?

90
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,880
-Female.
-Right on!

91
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,720
Ladies here, hands up!

92
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,240
Wow... phenomenal.

93
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,680
Tell me about this part.

94
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,320
What's this called?

95
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,640
Cer...

96
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,560
Called? Cer...

97
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,400
-Cervix.
-Right, 10 points.

98
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,400
And this part, name it?

99
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,320
Oh no, don’t run!

100
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,760
[Teacher shouting]
Careful, everyone.

101
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,640
Oh my gosh.

102
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,480
Why did you run like that?

103
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,320
I feel like a wallflower in a lively crowd.

104
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,280
-Oh, Kun...
-Yes, sir.

105
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,840
-Look after our newbie, alright?
-Of course, no problem.

106
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,240
Awesome!

107
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,320
I'll leave you guys.

108
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,480
Sure thing.

109
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,440
Good afternoon!

110
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,840
Hey, too polite.

111
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,000
We're the same age.

112
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,200
Yeah, right. Sorry, I forgot that.

113
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,600
Done.

114
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,960
You guys do this every time, huh?

115
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,240
Why?

116
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,000
Why what?

117
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,560
Why be nosy?

118
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,480
Oh, right. I'm not into meatballs,

119
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,320
and he doesn't like veggies.

120
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Wouldn't it be simpler to order straight up?

121
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,240
Uh, shall we go get something to eat?

122
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,640
I'll show you around.

123
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,880
Sounds good, let's go.

124
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,880
Actually, the cafeteria back at my old school had a similar feel.

125
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,520
And were the noodles there as tasty as these?

126
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
They were nice,

127
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,480
but there were more choices there.

128
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,440
Let's try something else tomorrow, yeah?

129
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,160
-Sounds good.
-Yeah.

130
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,320
I'm Tod, by the way.

131
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,640
Can I call you by your nickname too?

132
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,160
-You moved from Bangkok?
-Yep.

133
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,400
What made you move?

134
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,840
My parents change jobs frequently.

135
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,640
But this time...

136
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,360
Never mind, it's nothing.

137
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,800
You cool with all this?

138
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,360
I’m okay.

139
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,400
Actually, my parents change my school as one of their hobbies.

140
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
You should've stayed there another year.

141
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
We're almost done with middle school, after all.

142
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,760
I thought I'd study here for a year,

143
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
then head back to Bangkok next year.

144
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,960
Wanted a bit of a change, I guess.

145
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,200
So, lots to do in Bangkok, right?

146
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,560
Definitely, it's easier to get around there.

147
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,960
You can pretty much do whatever.

148
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,120
Kun and I are also aiming for a scholarship exam to study in Bangkok.

149
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,920
Sounds like you're prepping for uni.

150
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,480
Actually, moving to Bangkok isn't that hard.

151
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,920
It's easy for people to move in and out there.

152
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,840
Back in the day, my mom lived in Bangkok.

153
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,000
She always talked about not wanting to return to that hustle.

154
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,440
Is Bangkok really that bad?

155
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,280
It's chaotic...

156
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
but I kind of like it.

157
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,040
Actually, it's not that terrible.

158
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,200
You've got freedom to roam.

159
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,760
Sure, it's wild,

160
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,520
but it's... handy, you know?

161
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,600
But if you're into chaos,

162
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,440
you won't find it here.

163
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,120
It's all good.

164
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,120
Got a ticket back to Bangkok ready.

165
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,760
Just need to ensure I can actually use it.

166
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,080
What if you grow to like it here?

167
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,920
Then what?

168
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,240
He doesn't seem to like things easily.

169
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,040
A bit self-centered.

170
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,480
Oh, I'm just talking to myself.

171
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,240
Oh, I forgot to introduce.

172
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,720
This is Korn,

173
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,800
and this... is Tod.

174
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,000
Kun!

175
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,360
Korn!

176
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,200
Your names are pretty similar.

177
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,840
Are you soulmates or something?

178
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
Must be soul mates, right?

179
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,840
[Kullawat Sirisayan G.8/1]
[Cholakorn Sirisayan G.8/1]
-They’re all mushy.

180
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,840
Noodles?

181
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,080
After listening to Tod talk about it,

182
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,640
doesn't seem as daunting anymore, huh?

183
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,160
Yeah.

184
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,080
So, shall we talk to Mom about it?

185
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,880
You really want to go there now, right?

186
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,240
Wasn't too fussed either way before.

187
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,040
When do we have to apply for the exam?

188
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,560
Kun, Korn... get down here now.

189
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,800
You tell her.

190
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,640
No, you do it.

191
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,600
-You're the older one.
-Who said I'm the older one?

192
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,160
You were born first, you're the older brother.

193
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,120
You let me be born first.

194
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,640
-You're the elder.
-What?

195
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,920
-Elder brother, that's you, born first.
-No, you’re.

196
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,400
What are you two playing at with?

197
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,040
Why didn't you dry your hair?

198
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,760
You'll slip and hurt yourselves.

199
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,240
Gimme your towel.

200
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,360
No.

201
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,240
Stop playing around. Time to eat.

202
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,200
Let me use it to dry off.

203
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,560
Let’s eat.

204
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,720
You spill it. Don’t hold back.

205
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,800
What's going on?

206
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,200
Spit it out.

207
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,120
Uh...

208
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,320
Mom...

209
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:59,120
Thawiwat School’s opening up scholarship tests.

210
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,520
We were thinking... maybe we could to try it out.

211
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,960
Try it out?

212
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,640
Korn’s idea, right?

213
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,520
No, Mom, I want to take the exam too.

214
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,600
Where’s it?

215
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,040
In Bangkok.

216
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,360
Bangkok, for real?

217
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,480
Yes...

218
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,080
But if Mom doesn't want us to go, just say it.

219
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,800
We're still on the fence about it.

220
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,560
Then go for it.

221
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,360
But if it costs to just try, I'm not for it.

222
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,680
Take it seriously if you're doing it.

223
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,520
Why waste time trying it out?

224
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,040
You okay with us heading to Bangkok?

225
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,839
If that's what you want, go.

226
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,599
I won't hold you back.

227
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,000
-Not worried about Kun, but...
-Right, not worried?

228
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,119
Worried my grades aren't up to Kun’s?

229
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,680
Getting smart now, huh, little puppy.

230
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,359
So you’re the mother dog, right?

231
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,600
You cheeky kid.

232
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,040
Just make sure you pass the exam, you little puppy.

233
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,480
I'll back Korn up, Mom.

234
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,360
This time, he's already said he'll take it seriously.

235
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,960
That’s good to hear...

236
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,280
What if, Kun...

237
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,240
No, not that.

238
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,840
Say Korn passes,

239
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,400
but Kun doesn’t.

240
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,840
Would you still want to go?

241
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,240
Hmm...

242
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,720
If Kun doesn’t make it, would I?

243
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,120
Just a what-if.

244
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,200
This is a big investment for me.

245
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,680
It will affect my decision.

246
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,400
If I'm in but Korn isn’t,

247
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,000
I probably wouldn't go.

248
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,040
Me neither.

249
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,280
We stick together.

250
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,440
Not leaving each other, but leaving Mom behind, you two puppies.

251
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,520
Aw!

252
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,280
Who would dare leave behind mother dog?

253
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,480
We'll visit often during the holidays.

254
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,240
Or if you miss us too much,

255
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,360
you can just drive to see us.

256
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,520
It's only a few hours.

257
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,760
Don't sweet-talk me.

258
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,640
You haven't even passed yet.

259
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,560
Maybe I'll find a tutor for you.

260
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,840
Pond, Uncle Sam's son, is back from China.

261
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,960
I should hire him to prep you for the test.

262
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,600
No need, it's a waste of money.

263
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,320
No problem,

264
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,240
I'll help Kun myself.

265
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,440
Just focus, okay?

266
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,960
But let's chow down first.

267
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,000
Want some chicken?

268
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,000
Let’s eat.

269
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,720
I don't really get along with Tod.

270
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,840
He seems boastful somehow.

271
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,040
You're overthinking.

272
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,440
I think he's fun to talk to.

273
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
What if all three of us pass the exam?

274
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,040
Then what?

275
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,880
If we all make it, great.

276
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,960
Tod could lend a hand.

277
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,440
But we can take care of each other anyway, right?

278
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,120
He's kind of pitiful, you know.

279
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,160
His family went bankrupt

280
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,000
and had to move here in the mid-year.

281
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,000
I heard he has to share a room with his parents.

282
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,920
It's suffocating just thinking about it.

283
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,440
And when did you find out all this?

284
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,520
He told me during agriculture class.

285
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,760
Take it off, take it off now.

286
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,720
-What's your problem?
-It might blow up!

287
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,080
Tons of people do it, never seen an issue.

288
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,760
Just 'cause you haven't seen it, doesn't mean it won't happen.

289
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,760
You're spending too much time on TikTok.

290
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,560
Your battery's still good.

291
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,720
If you doze off, I'll plug it in for you.

292
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
You always sleep before me anyway.

293
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,000
Don't forget, alright? You always do,

294
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,880
and I end up with a dead phone.

295
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,400
Who's the night owl playing games?

296
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,040
Fine, I'll charge it on my side then.

297
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,960
You can charge it, but don’t play with it.

298
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,360
You’d better take a break for a few days.

299
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,480
Didn't you say you'd study with me?

300
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,280
Come, let's read in bed,

301
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,400
I'll study too.

302
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,720
Sitting too long is killing my back.

303
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,800
You need to plan your study time better.

304
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,280
Every time I carry your bag,

305
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,440
I feel like my shoulder's breaking.

306
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Want a back rub?

307
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,000
Sure.

308
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,960
Did you hurt your back?

309
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,040
Yeah.

310
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,560
-I'll go to the restroom first.
-Yeah.

311
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,320
Who uses their phone while it's still charging?

312
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,720
Who says it's a problem?

313
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,120
I've seen clips of phones blowing up while charging and in use.

314
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,000
They explode right in the hand.

315
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,720
Really?

316
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,680
But this one's high-end, not some cheap knock-off.

317
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,160
It won't just blow up.

318
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,080
Showing off, huh?

319
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,280
-Then don't lend me if you're out of battery.
-No, I won’t.

320
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,760
-Just take it off.
-No, I won't.

321
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,400
-What if it explodes?
-No, it won’t. This one is expensive.

322
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,080
-Just take it off.
-No, I won't.

323
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,600
-Take it off.
-No, I won’t.

324
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,360
It will explode in your hand.

325
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,840
I’ll take it off then.

326
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,840
Hey there, bro.

327
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,480
Oh, Pond...
Good afternoon!

328
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,560
Oh wait, why too formal.

329
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,040
When did you get back from China?

330
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,960
So you're going to continue high school here?

331
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,240
Hang on a sec!

332
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,320
Give me a moment to reply, will ya?

333
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,760
I’d better stop asking then.

334
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,480
Oh, you're annoying.

335
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,080
I was kidding.
Mom said you were coming.

336
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,560
You haven't visited us at home since you got back.

337
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,960
I’ve been busy these days.

338
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,880
I was meaning to visit your mom too.

339
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,760
Got some gifts for her.

340
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,440
How about we ride back together later?

341
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,800
No, thanks.

342
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,160
High schoolers always get out late.

343
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,360
I don't want to wait.

344
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,280
You know that, huh?

345
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,680
And where's Kun at?

346
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,600
You guys used to be thick as thieves, right?

347
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,120
You both look like Siamese twins.

348
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,640
Everything alright?

349
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,000
Want to talk about it?

350
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,000
Here's the study plan.

351
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,040
Roughly planned like this.

352
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,560
Wow, you're taking this seriously.

353
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,360
Thought about where you'll stay in Bangkok?

354
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,320
Maybe a dorm,

355
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,640
what about you, Tod?

356
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,920
Maybe move in with my brother.

357
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,280
Your real brother?

358
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,760
Nah, just a close family friend.

359
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,320
Still not sure if he's up for it.

360
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,480
Probably realizes how difficult you are to live with.

361
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,960
Maybe I should look into a shared dorm with you.

362
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,240
Could be fun. If we three get a big room, it might be cool.

363
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,600
I'll keep it as Plan B then,

364
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,480
But have a Plan C ready too.

365
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,600
You and I, we just met;

366
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,520
better not to have problems later.

367
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,680
Don't worry.

368
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,520
We have a year to get to know each other.

369
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,960
I promise...

370
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,040
If you guys end up going to Bangkok...

371
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,440
I'll show you around the city.

372
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,040
Are we going to study or tour?

373
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,760
Just missing the city life,

374
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,040
eager to show you around.

375
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,160
Let's nail the exams first.

376
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,680
Hey, what's up!

377
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,080
Whatcha doing?

378
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,840
If you let it go like that, it'll just die.

379
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,720
Who said I was releasing it?

380
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,080
Fed up with taking care of it?

381
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,600
Nope, just don't want to cage it anymore.

382
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,400
Fish are simple creatures;

383
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,240
they don't get bored easily like humans.

384
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,120
They're happy anywhere they feel safe.

385
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,520
What's next?

386
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,600
Need a lift?

387
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,560
Let’s go.

388
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,800
-Think you can handle it?
-Sure, it's a piece of cake.

389
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,040
You’re smart.

390
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,320
Where have you been? Shouldn't you be studying?

391
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,280
I took Left out for a stroll.

392
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,400
I will soon release it upstairs.

393
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,280
Left?

394
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,320
Names of the two fish in our room.

395
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,120
Korn named them,

396
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,000
but we can't tell them apart anymore.

397
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,320
-For real?
-Yup.

398
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,760
Here, soybean pudding.

399
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,160
-You can eat it, right?
-Of course.

400
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,200
And Korn? Isn't he studying with

401
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,680
I don’t know. He's upstairs.

402
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,120
Why aren't you studying downstairs?

403
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,520
Kun’s schedule is too intense. I need a break.

404
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,720
You two haven't been arguing, right?

405
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,000
Mom, can I ask you something?

406
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,400
What’s that?

407
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,720
You know me pretty well.
So, what do you think I'm really good at?

408
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,480
Can't you figure that out yourself?

409
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,640
I'm not sure, so I'm asking around.

410
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,000
Did you ask Kun?

411
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,520
Yeah, I did.

412
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,840
He says I'm good at hiding how I feel,

413
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,320
getting irritated easily, goofing off, and not taking things seriously.

414
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,600
It's sad to hear;

415
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,360
there's nothing good.

416
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,440
Were you upset when Kun said that?

417
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,800
Let's change the question.

418
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,159
Have you ever felt jealous or annoyed because of Kun?

419
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,120
Or frustrated with yourself over him?

420
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,600
Can't recall any. Probably never happened.

421
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,160
You know, it's odd that...

422
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,480
I’ve never seen you and Kun argue over anything, big or small.

423
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,600
It's like you're two people in one body,

424
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,040
despite being non-identical twins.

425
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,200
Mom, besides Bangkok, what else scares you?

426
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,200
I'm not afraid of Bangkok.

427
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,960
I just prefer not to live there again.

428
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,360
So why did you let us go so easily?

429
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,400
Aren't you afraid we won't like it like you

430
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,920
What if we change our minds?

431
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,280
No, whether you like it or not,

432
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,400
that's for you to decide.

433
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,320
Regarding the exams, I'm not setting high expectations.

434
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,880
Seeing how you're doing, my hopes are even lower.

435
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,320
The only thing that scares me is the thought of you and Kun fighting.

436
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,160
No worries, Mom. We still bathe together every day.

437
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,520
What could we possibly fight about?

438
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,360
Alright, you little dog.

439
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,880
I’ll keep an eye on you both.

440
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,440
Can I have a hug, Mom dog?

441
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,880
Hello?

442
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,640
You awake?

443
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,160
Been up for a while. Waiting.

444
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,800
You sound sick, like you have a cold.

445
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,760
Yeah, maybe not enough sleep lately.

446
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,360
I haven't been sleeping well,

447
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,520
still trying to adjust.

448
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,880
Feeling boxed in?

449
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,560
No,

450
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,880
I only feel bad about other things.

451
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,680
Really wish I could go back to Bangkok now.

452
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,920
Aww...

453
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,440
Just got here a month ago and you're already homesick?

454
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,600
How about a mini-trip this weekend? I'll take you.

455
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,720
No, I'm saving money.

456
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,040
Okay, I'll treat you to shabu-shabu.

457
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,440
No need, I'm fine.

458
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,440
Studying together is plenty for me.

459
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,960
Now I'm losing focus too.

460
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,320
I want you to go back to sleep.

461
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,040
Why?

462
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,480
Just not feeling it today.

463
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,400
You feel it too, right?

464
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,600
Let's close our books for now.

465
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:40,880
Okay.

466
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,640
One... two...three.

467
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,520
You're up late.

468
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,560
Also didn't get up to study.

469
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,640
You didn't hear me call earlier?

470
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,360
Already showered?

471
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,480
Yeah, heading down for breakfast.

472
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Wait for you?

473
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,920
Where's my phone?

474
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:07,720
[What's wrong?]

475
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,400
Alright, get up,

476
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
and let's start picking up trash.

477
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,680
You know why? Because you’re late.

478
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,440
Don't forget to press it.

479
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
Okay, let's clean up.

480
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,600
If the school is not clean, you can't stop.

481
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,640
Are you upset I nagged about your late start?

482
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,480
-No.
[Teacher] Head over there!

483
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,720
Then what's wrong?

484
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,640
Did you really try to wake me up this morning?

485
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,880
Yeah!

486
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,880
Then why didn't you plug in my phone?

487
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,760
Oh, I forgot. Sorry.

488
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,400
I overslept because my phone died.

489
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,800
No alarm, and you didn't wake me.

490
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,240
Sorry, can we let it go?

491
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,240
I'll make sure it won't happen again.

492
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,640
This morning I left my phone charging,
but dang, forgot to plug in.

493
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,040
So I had no phone today,

494
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,120
and the school doesn't allow charging.

495
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,160
Here, use mine...

496
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,440
Really?

497
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,240
-I'm really sorry.
-Here!

498
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,880
Take my power bank, I have an extra.

499
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,280
Use it!

500
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,480
Why don't you guys carry one?

501
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,600
Manufacturers would be heartbroken.

502
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,880
-Give it to me.
-No.

503
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,720
Charge first, then use?

504
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,160
Is it really a big deal?

505
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,880
Worried it might blow up.

506
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,160
Hand me your phone.

507
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,520
What for?

508
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,680
Going to delete TikTok. Maybe less obsession.

509
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,080
Damn.

510
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,520
Give it to me.

511
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,240
No, unplug it first.

512
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,400
It might explode.

513
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,840
No need to charge anymore.

514
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,560
If you wanna charge, don't use it.

515
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,920
Charge it fist.

516
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,160
-Hey, bro!
-Hey, Pond!

517
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,320
Pond!

518
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,760
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Kaew.
-Come in.

519
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,800
We're just starting to eat.

520
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,000
What'd you bring this time?

521
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,240
Brought some chicken, just in case.

522
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,600
Oh, that's kind of you.

523
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,280
Let’s eat!

524
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,840
Here’s your seat.

525
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,360
Wow, looks like he really wants the money.

526
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,800
I'll ask Pond to tutor you guys too.

527
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,640
Come study with them, Tod.

528
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,080
Yes, sure.

529
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,080
So,

530
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,400
should we call him Pond or Teacher Pond?

531
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,920
Of course, Teacher!

532
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,560
Mrs. Kaew...

533
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,120
Just Pond is fine.

534
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,160
I'm used to it.

535
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,080
No, they need to respect you. You're helping for free.

536
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,720
So Pond's tutoring for free?

537
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,000
Exactly!

538
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,680
Say thank you to him.

539
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,600
-Thank you, Pond.
-No problem. Let’s eat.

540
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,360
That’s great.

541
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,160
We're struggling on our own.

542
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,320
Thank you for your time, Pond.

543
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,160
It does not waste my time at all.

544
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,360
On the other hand,

545
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,360
It's like a review for me too.

546
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:08,000
Tutoring Kun and Korn is like helping my own brother.
I've known them since they were this small.

547
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,240
Tod, just relax, okay?

548
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,000
Thanks, Teacher Nick. Oh...

549
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,120
Teacher Pond.

550
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,440
Alright.

551
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,160
Let me know if you need anything.

552
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,040
If they pass, you'll get a bonus, Pond.

553
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,640
No need, Mrs. Kaew.

554
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,080
Happy to help. We're like family.

555
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,440
Is it okay to have Pond as a tutor?

556
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,160
Better than now. I can't manage your laziness alone.

557
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,720
Worried it might be too strict.

558
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,000
Just give it a shot. Pond's smart.

559
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,360
What are you two whispering about?

560
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,200
Nothing.

561
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,200
Just eat.

562
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,600
Ouch, I hurt my stomach.

563
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,480
I'll go to the bathroom first.

564
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,920
Bet he's off to play games.

565
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,000
See you later, Pond.

566
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,840
Take care!

567
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,120
That's just how he is,

568
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,480
don't mind him.

569
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,400
Can't believe how fast they've grown.

570
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,520
I really wanted you to tutor because of Korn.

571
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,560
Kun keeps complaining about dragging him to study.

572
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,400
All he does is complain about laziness.

573
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,800
He's always like that.

574
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,640
When's the next exam, Kun?

575
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,320
In two months.

576
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,200
In two months...

577
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,560
Should be enough time then.

578
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,080
Tod and I are stressed out.

579
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,920
We're not keeping up.

580
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,320
It's scary when it doesn't match our studies.

581
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,040
Just relax, no need to overthink.

582
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,200
-Kun is not a concern.
-Yes, ma'am.

583
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,880
But Korn, I don't know what to do with him.

584
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,640
Tomorrow... oh, Saturday right?

585
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,320
How about this? I'll start tutoring here from tomorrow afternoon.

586
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,040
Kun, Tod!

587
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,400
You guys okay with that? Any plans this weekend?

588
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,240
Was planning to study at home anyway.

589
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,360
Let's start tomorrow then.

590
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,280
Sounds good, it's a deal.

591
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,040
Feel free to be firm with Korn.

592
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,640
I'll check on him upstairs.

593
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,920
-Kun, please take care of him.
-Yes, sure.

594
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,040
Mrs. Kaew, I should head out now.

595
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,600
Don't want to get home too late.

596
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,440
Thanks, Pond. See you tomorrow.

597
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,280
Until tomorrow.

598
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,040
See you tomorrow.

599
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,520
Goodbye, Mrs. Kaew.

600
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,920
-Goodbye!
-Bye, take care!

601
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,320
Thank you, see you later.

602
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,360
We can mix this.

603
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,920
I'll keep these dishes.

604
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,640
All washed.

605
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,600
Why does Korn seem to dislike me?

606
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,480
What makes you say that?

607
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,760
Isn't it obvious?

608
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,960
That's just how he is.

609
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,640
It's his personality.

610
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,160
He finds it hard to get close to people.

611
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:03,240
Mother said that you and Kun never fight. Is that true?

612
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,440
I usually make up first.

613
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,960
which coincides with Kun's sulking.

614
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,720
Are you normally sulky?

615
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,560
Someone once told me I'm sulky.

616
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,120
and hard to get close to.

617
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,080
And I don't really care about others' feelings.

618
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,520
Do I remind you of Korn?

619
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,840
Korn's just like that. No worries.

620
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,840
Mom recently shared some childhood stories.

621
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,960
What did she say?

622
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,360
She said...

623
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,720
Korn and I, we used to play together.

624
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,200
I once played a prank on Kun by sticking his hand in a socket.

625
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:02,960
Pretty mean, huh?

626
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,600
I see.

627
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:07,680
Why?

628
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,280
Is that why you guys developed a fear of electric shocks?

629
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,560
Maybe... I don't know.

630
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,280
But that's harsh.

631
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,800
Actually, there's more.

632
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,360
Once, many years ago,  Kun pranked me back

633
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,280
by stuffing meatballs in my mouth.

634
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,480
I almost choked.

635
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,240
It was a close call to the hospital.

636
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,040
That's also harsh.

637
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,360
How did you guys survive childhood?

638
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,120
Just kids being silly. Luckily, no harm done.

639
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:50,480
Those two incidents brought us closer.

640
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,680
Nothing ever big enough to make us really fight.

641
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,040
[Next Episode]
Where are you stuck now?

642
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,920
Pond seems focused on you, right?

643
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,280
Got something to confess to me?

644
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,080
I know you two are secretly studying...

645
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,640
Can we really move away from a place we thought was good?

646
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,920
Does being here feel bad?

647
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,600
Honestly, I can't imagine life without Kun.

648
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,160
Good to see you happy, Korn.

649
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,040
Mom, if I don't want to study in Bangkok,

650
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,400
will you be upset?

651
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,520
Would you really let go of all our hard work?
