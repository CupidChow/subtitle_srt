00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,520
♫Just a single glance, from your eyes straight to mine,♫

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,239
♫and my heart starts to melt.♫

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,400
♫As I come closer, I talk to you,♫

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,760
♫ I tremble, till I'm almost breathless.♫

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,840
♫ A restlessness overwhelms me, losing myself in the tide.♫

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,040
♫Is this what they call symptoms of love,♫

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,320
♫It happens every moment,♫

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,760
♫when I get a glimpse of you,

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,840
♫Are you feeling like me, perhaps,♫

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,320
♫A burning, restless whirl within the heart, do you feel so?♫

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,280
♫Every symptom shows, do you tremble too, just how much,♫

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,640
♫Feeling good, alike maybe?♫

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,560
♫then we can weight the chances in our hearts,♫

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,520
♫Are you feeling like me, perhaps,♫

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,600
♫As if I can't control myself,♫

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,920
♫in my dreams or wherever, it is you I meet ♫.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,600
♫Tell me, when I meet you,♫

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,200
♫Are your thoughts the same as mine,♫

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,680
♫that we are in love?♫

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,920
Ah, it's just a mirror.

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,080
You've got like a gazillion mirrors back home.

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,759
-Just use another one.
-It's not the same, dude.

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,880
Old mirrors like this could have a past.

25
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,960
Don’t you dare remove it!

26
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,479
You can't do that.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,759
Don't!!!

28
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,880
I know now.

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,440
This is Marvin, an old buddy of mine.

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,680
I forgot about him.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,440
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,840
I bet it's been lonely for you lately

33
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,080
It's okay.

34
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,320
I'm not lonely anymore.

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,640
Then let's make life fun together.

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,400
Let's live it up together.

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,920
Want some ice cream?

38
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,400
Let's get the same kind, alright?

39
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,760
Yes, sure.

40
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Chocolate, cookies and cream, please.

41
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,520
-Two cups, right?
-Yes, please.

42
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,800
Alright.

43
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,720
Everything good?

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,240
All good.

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,040
Here, two cups of ice cream.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,920
Thank you so much.

47
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,280
Vin!

48
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Smile!

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
-Hmm, delicious.
-You think?

50
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,200
I haven't been out like this in a long time.

51
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,440
Haven't been out at all?

52
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,000
How do you live, with food and stuff?"

53
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,640
I do go out sometimes,

54
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,720
but just around the block.

55
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,440
I don't really know how to go elsewhere.

56
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,280
I'm not used to it.

57
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,400
For food and necessities, my uncle takes care of them.

58
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,120
Good that you have your uncle to look after you.

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,920
In my parents' will,

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,480
he gets everything - insurance money, house - when I'm gone,

61
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,360
in exchange for taking care of my needs.

62
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,800
They planned it all, knowing what was coming.

63
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,080
But my uncle only does what's necessary.

64
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,360
He doesn't really care much about me.

65
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,360
Forget him.

66
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,640
If he doesn´t care, just let it be.

67
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,240
I'll be the one to look after you now.

68
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,760
Why are you so nice to me?

69
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,120
Well,

70
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,440
we are...

71
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,120
I feel so happy today.

72
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,240
How's it going?

73
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,640
What's that?

74
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,360
Just asking how you're feeling.

75
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,120
What's up, bro?

76
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
Enjoying yourself?

77
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,680
Yeah, having a blast.

78
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,160
It's my first time here.

79
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,360
You like it?

80
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,240
Absolutely, bro.

81
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,360
What's up!

82
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,760
We've done a lot of things today.

83
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,800
What do you like the most?

84
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,280
Um, just about everything.

85
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
-I feel very happy.
-Impossible...

86
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,360
Like what is the happiest thing in your life?

87
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,120
Well,

88
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,360
maybe...

89
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,320
spending time together with you.

90
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,120
That's touching, huh?

91
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,560
So, when I went to the toilet,

92
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,280
did anyone ask your number?

93
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,920
Nope,

94
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,840
-No one.
-Really?

95
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,320
I don't even have a phone.

96
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,960
Right.

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,640
You don't have a phone.

98
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,200
You've been without a phone for years,

99
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,520
not even on social media.

100
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,040
Don't you feel alone?

101
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,320
I'm scared to use it.

102
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,360
I'm afraid.

103
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,320
Since I got sick,

104
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,400
my world's shrunk a lot.

105
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,000
I didn't get to play outside like other kids.

106
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,760
Didn't go to school.

107
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,080
My life was just home and hospital.

108
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,360
When I go out,

109
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,120
it's always with family.

110
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,760
But it's not too bad, you know.

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,640
I'm happy in my little world.

112
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,320
But without them,

113
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,559
it feels even smaller.

114
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,159
I don't know how to live outside.

115
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,880
Seeing the world through social media?

116
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,560
I don't know how I'd feel about that.

117
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,280
Hey, it's alright.

118
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,640
I'll show you the world myself.

119
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,120
Alright?

120
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,240
But for tonight,

121
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,120
let's head back home.

122
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,880
It's getting late now.

123
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,880
So, want me to drop you?

124
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,960
No worries,

125
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
-I'll take a taxi.
-Sure?

126
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,680
-You've got work tomorrow, right?
-Yep.

127
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,000
Then...

128
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,360
-Shall we ask for the bill?
-Okay.

129
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,800
Excuse me, can we get the bill?

130
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,920
-I'll pay for it.
-Oh, no need.

131
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,240
I've got this one.

132
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,200
You paid me for the whole day, let me pay it.

133
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,080
I'll treat you.

134
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
Save your money for the cab. I've got it.

135
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,320
Pond, stop it! I'm not playing.

136
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,160
I mean it, I'll actually do it.

137
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,880
You're not ready for this, trust me.

138
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,200
How will I know if I don't really try?

139
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,120
Let's do it!

140
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,640
-Come here!
-Stoy playing.

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,520
Come!

142
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,160
If you wanna try, test it on your hair.

143
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,960
Nope!

144
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,920
Just bet your head on it.

145
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,480
-Hurry up.
-You're too into cartoons, Pond!

146
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,640
Oops!

147
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,040
Sorry!

148
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,560
Hello, here for a haircut?

149
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,440
Yes.

150
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,800
-Welcome.
-Right this way.

151
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,040
-Please follow me.
-Don't be scared.

152
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,600
-Take a seat here.
-Please, sit down.

153
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,000
Just keep your hair clipper.

154
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,800
Man, you're always eager to cut hair!

155
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,760
Sorry for the mess.

156
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,800
I'm practicing haircutting.

157
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,960
No worries.

158
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,560
Well, it looks fun.

159
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,120
No, it's not fun.

160
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,960
We're just kids at heart.

161
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,280
What haircut do you want?

162
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,480
Skinhead?

163
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,200
Skinhead?

164
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,960
I have cancer.

165
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,040
My hair's falling out from chemo.

166
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,000
Thought I'd just shave it all off.

167
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,400
Less distracting.

168
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,400
Sorry to hear that.

169
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,480
Hope you get better soon.

170
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,320
My dad died of cancer too.

171
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Still don't get why I keep treating it.

172
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Maybe, I do it for those behind me.

173
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,440
Treatment just adds a little time.

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,760
But I think that little time is meaningful.

175
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,720
Even a little time can create a lot.

176
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,360
Create some good memories.

177
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,040
But eventually we will forget about them,

178
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,320
no matter how many good memories,

179
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,880
It´s true.

180
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,280
But those who remain still remember.

181
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,480
Sorry,

182
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,280
I talked too much.

183
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,280
No worries.

184
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
Thank you.

185
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,520
Sorry about that.

186
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,800
Got a bit hectic earlier.

187
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,200
What haircut would you like, sir?

188
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,520
Skinhead, please.

189
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,560
Uh...

190
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,360
Can he shave my head?

191
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,640
-Are you sure?
-You sure?

192
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,680
It's just shaving.

193
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,200
He won't cut off my head, I guess.

194
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,160
Let him do it, please.

195
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Alright then.

196
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Take care of it, okay?

197
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,960
I'll do my best.

198
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,960
Ready?

199
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,120
All finished, sir. How's it feel?

200
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,520
Great, you've got a gentle touch, bro.

201
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,800
Thank you so much.

202
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,680
How much's this?

203
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,720
No charge for this one.

204
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,360
Consider it a lesson for Pond to practice.

205
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,000
Thanks again.

206
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,760
Pond&Mac: Thank you.

207
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,440
Thank you.

208
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,840
You're lucky today.

209
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,440
Tomorrow, your head's my practice canvas.

210
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,760
You just zip it!

211
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,840
-You'd better do here.
-What?

212
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,600
Here it is.

213
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,720
This is your job.

214
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,320
Here's the broom.

215
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,360
Get sweeping!

216
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,360
-Here, here...
-Back up!

217
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,200
Over there, more to clean.

218
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,920
Pond!

219
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,080
Vin!

220
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,120
Watch out, Vin!

221
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Vin...!

222
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,320
Lift your head and breathe...

223
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,320
Feeling better now?

224
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,720
Vin!

225
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,400
Come here!

226
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,640
Let's eat, so you can take your pill.

227
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,599
Careful, it's hot.

228
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,920
Blow it first.

229
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,240
-Let me help.
-No, I'm good.

230
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,080
I can handle it myself.

231
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,080
Not gonna blow?

232
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,880
Here...

233
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
I have an old phone for you.

234
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,920
Why give this to me?

235
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,480
It's weird not having a phone.

236
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,160
I wouldn't call anyone, though.

237
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,080
Then call me,

238
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,800
or I can call you too.

239
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,840
What, gonna wish me good morning and good night?

240
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,320
Sure, I can do that. No sweat.

241
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,160
But mainly, it's for when you're sick,

242
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,200
Like today. Imagine if I hadn't arrived on time.

243
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,040
Shouldn't you have gone to the afterlife?

244
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,760
I did want to go soon.

245
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,280
Life's exhausting.

246
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,280
Hit your mouth three thousand times.

247
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,080
Just joking!

248
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,680
Why the hurry? You've got more photos to take.

249
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,680
-I said I was kidding.
-Gosh!

250
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Here, do this.

251
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,440
I'll set up Instagram for you.

252
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,360
On Instagram

253
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,160
you can take and store lots of photos.

254
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,920
Mostly, if I'm not with you, I stay at home.

255
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,920
What's there to photograph?

256
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,160
Just take them even random shots.

257
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,480
In fact, I will also know that you are doing well.

258
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,240
You can also save the best ones for framing.

259
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,280
Okay.

260
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,840
You know how it works?

261
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,000
Hey Vin.

262
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,080
What are you taking?

263
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,800
Handsome, huh?

264
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,800
-Not bad.
-Wait!

265
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,560
You flatter yourself?

266
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,520
Really? Is it really good?

267
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,760
What are you taking?

268
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,640
You look handsome too.

269
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,240
That looks ugly. Delete it.

270
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,960
-Delete it.
-No, it's my phone.

271
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,280
-My choice.
-These photos are too dark.

272
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,040
Delete that!

273
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,680
My decision, dude.

274
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,680
-Just delete it.
-Hey...

275
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,320
So, don't post it okay?

276
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,160
-Please!
-Okay.

277
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,640
-Promise me?
-I'll only save it.

278
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,520
It's awful. You're not great at this, huh?

279
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,160
Alright, all set, sir.

280
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,640
Excuse me...

281
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,200
-How much?
-120 baht, sir.

282
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,880
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

283
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Hello!

284
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,800
Vin!

285
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,600
What brings you here?

286
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,200
Just wanted to see your workplace.

287
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Pond, you know this guy?

288
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,680
That's Marvin, my ghost buddy.

289
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,560
Oh, this guy. Nice to meet you.

290
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,160
I'm Mac.

291
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,360
Need a haircut?

292
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,920
Trying to make a quick buck, eh?

293
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,920
-Absolutely!
- I'd love to.

294
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,360
But I just got trimmed.

295
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,640
How about a hair wash?

296
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,920
Just washed it before coming.

297
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,160
Oh!

298
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
Where to next?

299
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,640
Pond can take care of you.

300
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,800
Um...

301
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,000
sounds good.

302
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,400
-Alright!
-Pond, your turn.

303
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,200
-Take care of him.
-Got it.

304
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,720
How do you want it styled?

305
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,000
I don't know, bro.

306
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,080
Never really styled it before.

307
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,680
Set it how you think is handsome.

308
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,400
Okay, but my idea of 'handsome' might be different.

309
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,160
Just go for it.

310
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,080
-I'm the customer here.
-Okay, dude.

311
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,680
How's it?

312
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,880
Like it?

313
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,120
Hmm,

314
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,760
super handsome.

315
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,120
- Bro, you've made so many dreams come true,
- It's nothing.

316
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,440
You know, you could style it yourself at home.

317
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,680
No,

318
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,640
I dreamed that if you had a shop, I'd like to be your customer.

319
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,960
Then, if you like, shall we take a picture together?

320
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,240
-Mac!
-Sup!

321
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,320
-Snap a picture for us?
-Sure thing, one sec.

322
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,600
Just use your phone.

323
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,400
Alright, come on.

324
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,280
Okay, come on.

325
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,800
Ready?

326
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,160
1...2...3

327
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
One more.

328
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,560
-Just smile, man.
-Okay, smiling.

329
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,480
Cheese!

330
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,120
1, 2,  cheese!

331
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,840
Awesome, that's a great shot!

332
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,400
-Let's see.
-Check it out.

333
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,640
Here...

334
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,200
Where you would like to go next?

335
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,560
We're pretty lucky today.

336
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,000
Usually there are a lot of people in this place.

337
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,520
Pond, you come here often?

338
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,880
Yeah, but I usually skip it because of the queue.

339
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,160
Hey!

340
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,480
-What a coincidence!
-Oh, Mr. Barber.

341
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,520
Here for a meal?

342
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,080
Yeah,

343
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,920
-I'm here with my girlfriend.
-Got a table yet?

344
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,200
Still waiting in line.

345
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,960
Join us, won't you?

346
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,120
More people, more fun. And you don't have to wait.

347
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,040
Come on!

348
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,760
Yes, sure.

349
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
How often do you come here?

350
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,880
Sometimes...

351
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,880
-Long wait normally, right?
-Yeah, it's pretty long.

352
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,480
By the way, I still don't know your name.

353
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,840
I'm Pond, and this is Marvin.

354
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,160
Shin here and...

355
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,520
Meaw, my girlfriend.

356
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,480
Nice to meet you all.

357
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,360
Meaw and I met back in university.

358
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,760
Started like a sister,

359
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,200
now she's my world.

360
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,280
Whoa!

361
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
How envious!

362
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,960
It's obvious,

363
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,640
I envy myself too.

364
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,560
If not her, then who else?

365
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,120
You're being cheesy, huh?

366
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,840
Not at all.

367
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,880
Well, I'm off to the toilet now.

368
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,200
Keep the praise down a bit, okay?

369
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,720
Okay.

370
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,880
She's so cute, really.

371
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,000
Hey, bro!

372
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,400
Remember that chat we had earlier?

373
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,880
Yes.

374
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,080
At first,

375
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:36,200
I didn't quite get why you said those things so sincerely

376
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,000
until I heard about Marvin.

377
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,320
What were you guys talking about before?

378
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,440
Marvin,

379
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,000
our lives might not be long,

380
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,880
but having someone special

381
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,280
can truly make you the happiest.

382
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,400
So,

383
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,360
you guys, be my witnesses.

384
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,760
Witnesses?

385
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,360
Meaw,

386
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
I'm sorry

387
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,000
for the tough times ahead.

388
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,400
And thank you

389
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,840
for filling my life with meaning.

390
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,280
Thank you for being the joy in my life.

391
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,280
I don't know...

392
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,160
what the future holds,

393
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,560
but from now on,

394
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,720
I want to be by your side forever.

395
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,040
Will you marry me?

396
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,160
Yes, I will.

397
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,240
Congratulations!

398
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,080
Thank you.

399
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,280
Want it?

400
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,280
Already?

401
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,120
-It's done already.
-Yeah... it's done.

402
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,240
-It's great, isn't it?
-Huh?

403
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,440
Shin must be so happy to be with someone he loves.

404
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,600
Hmm,

405
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,560
the best life is probably one filled with happiness.

406
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,960
Thank you so much, bro,

407
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,360
for making me the happiest I've been in years.

408
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,960
Ever since my family left,

409
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,120
it's been lonely and tough.

410
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,200
I'm scared of feeling that way again.

411
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,800
If I have to be alone again someday,

412
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,720
I'd rather die while I'm happy like this.

413
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,520
Have you gone mad?

414
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,320
I'm here with you, aren't I?

415
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,320
Crazy, Pond!

416
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,160
You have your own life.

417
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,000
One day...

418
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,440
you'll find someone you love,

419
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,120
get married,

420
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,600
and I won't be there.

421
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,880
Don't think like that.

422
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,720
I love you, man.

423
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
I'll be with you,

424
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,040
stay with you forever.

425
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,520
Really?

426
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,400
-You won't leave me, really?
-Really.

427
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,200
I won't leave.

428
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,320
I'll make you happy.

429
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,720
Wherever you want to go, eat or do,

430
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,000
I'll be there with you.

431
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,520
We'll create memories together.

432
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
you and me.

433
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,720
Let's make life happy together.

434
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,320
Um.

435
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,360
Then...

436
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,840
Can you help me set up the tent, bro?

437
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,240
Over there?

438
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,240
Yes.

439
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,640
-Felt like camping today.
-Really?

440
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,000
Thought a sudden trip elsewhere might be too much.

441
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,920
Hey, no need to be so considerate. Just tell me
where you want to go.

442
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,240
Okay,

443
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,160
you just said it.

444
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,600
But let's camp with me right here for now.

445
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,920
Cool, you handle the BBQ, I'll get the tent.

446
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,760
-Deal!
-Let's go.

447
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,760
I'm really happy, you know.

448
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,240
Even this backyard camping is so fun.

449
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,680
Imagine how fun it would be a mountain trip together.

450
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,200
Next time, let's go to Khao Yai.

451
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,520
Drive around,

452
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,960
camp out, splash in waterfalls.

453
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,800
Inviting others could be even more fun.

454
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,080
Yeah, just the thought of it is exciting.

455
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,600
But...

456
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,960
will others be keen to come?

457
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,240
Of course,

458
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,960
Last time was just a plan change, no worries.

459
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,160
This time, we don't have to invite everyone.

460
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,360
Only the well-known ones.

461
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,360
I'll drag Mac along too.

462
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,040
Yeah, that could work, bro.

463
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,360
Hey, bro...

464
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,679
thanks...

465
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,960
for living the dream with me.

466
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
It's okay.

467
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,480
I already told you, right?

468
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,800
I'll do my best.

469
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,440
Just one regret though

470
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,080
There's one thing you can't do for me for sure.

471
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,120
What's that?

472
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,480
Graduation photos...

473
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,639
I wanted to take them with everyone.

474
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,960
Got this huge frame at home for it.

475
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,360
Actually, I wanted it to hold my graduation photo.

476
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,880
But I know...

477
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,120
can't rewind time to take it.

478
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,680
My parents are gone too.

479
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,880
Some moments...

480
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,520
if we missed once,

481
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,480
we are lost them forever.

482
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
That's why we have to make every day count.

483
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,680
What's past may need to be let go.

484
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,000
But from now on,

485
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,840
and in days ahead...

486
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,800
let's fill them with happiness together.

487
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,760
Um...

488
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,240
really, thanks, bro.

489
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,720
I'm glad

490
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,560
you're here with me today.

491
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,680
Vin!

492
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,320
Oh, Vin!

493
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,960
Vin!

494
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,160
Vin!

495
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,240
Vin...!

496
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,640
Vin, wake up!

497
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,360
Somebody help...

498
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,280
Vin...!

499
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,360
Damn it!

500
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,960
Vin...!

501
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,160
Somebody, help!

502
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,000
Vin, the doctor's coming.

503
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,280
What's gonna happen to him?

504
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,520
His condition is still critical.

505
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,960
We need to keep a close watch.

506
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,720
Can't say for sure yet.

507
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,760
You might have to prepare for the worst.

508
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,560
We'll go on a trip together, remember?

509
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,840
Vin!

510
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,920
Do something, doctor!

511
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,880
Vin, wake up, man.

512
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,360
Hey!

513
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,520
Damn mirror!

514
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,040
If you're really magic,

515
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,240
can't you make Marvin's wish come true?

516
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,800
Or If you can't rewind time,

517
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,160
at least wake Marvin up.

518
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,960
Didn't you bring me here just to make Marvin happy?

519
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,560
If you're really powerful,

520
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,080
show me a miracle, please!

521
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,640
Don't you want Marvin to be happy?

522
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,800
If you really want me to help Marvin, then help me too.

523
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,240
Let me fulfill Marvin's dream at once.

524
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,640
I'm begging you, for fuck's sake.

525
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
Hey Pond,

526
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,440
you lost in thought?

527
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,280
Pond, photo time!

528
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,560
Come on over.

529
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,920
Let's take photos with us.

530
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,160
Come on, stand in the middle.

531
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,240
Look at the camera.

532
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,840
Look over there!

533
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,560
Smile big, bro!

534
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,320
Smile!

535
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,360
Where's Marvin...?

536
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,160
Vin's not here today.

537
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,280
Why?

538
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,840
His uncle said he's sick.

539
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,840
Right?

540
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,360
Let´s do this.

541
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,360
Wait up, don't go anywhere. Hold off starting without me, alright? I'll be right back.

542
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,600
Oh, wait!

543
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,400
Where are you going?

544
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,200
Gonna get Marvin for the picture. Don't start yet!

545
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,400
Oh...

546
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,080
Hold up, man!

547
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,200
Why's he stalling us?

548
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,520
Marvin!

549
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,120
Marvin!

550
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,600
Marvin...!

551
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,280
Pond!

552
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,640
Hold on, young man.

553
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,000
What are you doing here?

554
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,560
Gonna take Marvin to graduation pics.

555
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,440
With our tutor gang.

556
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,880
Um, Marvin is still sick, he can't go.

557
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,000
But if not now,

558
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,160
they'll never happen again.

559
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,680
It happens only once, Marvin.

560
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,960
I said no, he's unwell.

561
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,160
We can take photos later.

562
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,440
I want to go, uncle.

563
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,280
It's just a doctor's appointment.

564
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,720
Postponing it a day or two won't matter,

565
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,560
I understand you're worried,

566
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,000
but...

567
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,920
I feel like...

568
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,600
if I don't go,

569
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,400
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

570
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,200
I...

571
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,800
don't wanna miss any more joy.

572
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,240
Alright,

573
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,200
I'll drive you.

574
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,720
Come on, let's come together.

575
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,840
-Thank you.
-Get in the car.

576
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,320
Hurry up, Vin...

577
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,840
They've all left.

578
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,520
Peek-a-boo!

579
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,760
Friends: Just kidding. We're still here!

580
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,400
You look disappointed, huh?

581
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,680
How're you doing?

582
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,880
Friends: We're doing well, Let's take a selfie.

583
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,800
Friends: Let's take pictures.

584
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,200
Friends: Put on the cap.

585
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,880
-No, use mine.
-No, mine's cooler.

586
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,600
Friends: Stop squabbling.
Pond: Selfie time

587
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,440
Friends: Come on, guys.

588
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,520
3...2...1...

589
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,680
Another one.

590
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,120
Change pose.

591
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,160
3...2...1...

592
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,440
Here comes the photographer.

593
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,160
Friends: Here he comes.
Pond: How to pose?

594
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,120
Come closer.

595
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,800
Smile. 1...2...3

596
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,720
Cheese.

597
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,320
One more 1...2..3

598
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,720
Looks good?

599
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,680
You smile too, bro.

600
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,440
Awesome!

601
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,920
Name: Hey, last night Boy and I dreamed of taking photos with Marvin.

602
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,880
Mymild: I had the same dream.

603
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
JK: Me too, everyone had the same dream?

604
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,880
JamJam: Seriously? I had the exact same dream about the graduation photos.

605
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,960
Boy: What's happening? Pond, are you there? Let's call.

606
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,880
Friends: Hey, guys...

607
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,800
Friends: everyone had the same dream. What's going on?

608
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,880
Friends: I'm really uneasy about this.

609
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,320
Everyone,

610
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,680
Friends: Did something happen?

611
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,440
Friends: Yeah, what's happening?

612
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,440
-Marvin is dying.
-Huh?

613
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,400
Hey there!

614
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,440
Hey!

615
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,400
Marvin's awake!

616
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,880
What's going on?

617
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,240
Friends: Easy, don't stress too much.

618
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,840
Friends: Look, we're all here.

619
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,240
Friends from other cities and abroad are also here.

620
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,080
One moment.

621
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,080
There you go...

622
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,040
Friends: Hey there!

623
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,000
Look at our friends, smile.

624
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,680
Hey!

625
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,600
We got this too.

626
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,160
Look what we've got.

627
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,120
Vin!

628
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,080
Time for grad photos.

629
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,960
Friends:  Come on, let's help him.

630
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,720
Oh, you're quite heavy, huh?

631
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,760
Friends: Put on the cap.

632
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,480
Friends: C'mon.

633
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,280
You wear the cap too.

634
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,800
Friends: Let me see, freaking awesome.

635
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,200
Friends: Super handsome.

636
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,200
Pond: Ready? Nurse, please come in...

637
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,240
-Can you take pictures of us?
-Of course.

638
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,600
You look so good.

639
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,960
Here, please.

640
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,600
Friends: Finally you wear it.

641
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,840
Smile. 1...2...3

642
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,000
One more time.

643
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,120
1..2...3

644
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,360
Everything okay, Pond?

645
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,720
Oh, yes. Almost done.

646
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,800
Just need to arrange things a little bit and that's all.

647
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,040
Good, good.

648
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,160
If you need help with anything, just tell me.

649
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,480
Your offer on the house alone means a lot,

650
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,520
Hey, it's not a big deal.

651
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,880
I should be thanking you.

652
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,680
This house isn’t just important to us.

653
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,800
For me,

654
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,240
it's my brother's legacy.

655
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,360
I should thank you, Pond,

656
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,680
for taking care of something I love,

657
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,520
as I couldn't do it myself.

658
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:27,960
No worries.

659
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,920
I'm happy to.

660
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,840
I gotta run now. Call if you need anything.

661
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,280
Thank you, sir.

662
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,360
Whoa!

663
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,880
What's with this quirky house? Mirrors and frames all over.

664
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,280
You're missing the vibe, man.

665
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,520
These are all memories.

666
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:01,760
And you funded all this from working at my shop?

667
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,760
Who are you, really?

668
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,360
Thought I was just loafing around?

669
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,120
Who am I really?  Well, my mom's money did help.

670
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,840
You'd better keep talking.

671
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,680
Just be careful not to get kicked out of the inheritance.

672
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,720
What’s your next move?

673
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,200
Wanna work with me again?

674
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,360
Can you give me a brake...

675
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,960
juts like a gap year...

676
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,760
-Gap year? Planning to wander again?
-Not like that.

677
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,720
I'll find work, but still figuring out what I really want to do

678
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,120
Right now, I just want to support people like Marvin.

679
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,360
Not letting them face things alone.

680
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,440
not sure what job that is.

681
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,360
-You're so philosophical, bro.
-Who's your brother?

682
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:57,960
Oh, come on!

683
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,480
Anyway, where do you need me first?

684
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,600
Moving, cleaning, where to start?

685
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,840
Toilet, start over there first.

686
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,360
- With all these things, why the toilet?
- Just clean it.

687
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,080
Should I go lift stuff?

688
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,240
Up to you. Go on.

689
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:04,880
