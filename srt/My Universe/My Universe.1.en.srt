166

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,500
because he made you cry.

184
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,220
The conclusion is...

185
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,260
Because of God?

186
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,780
It's not because of you?

187
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,060
Luckily Kim didn't get hurt.

188
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,250
Otherwise, you're doomed.

189
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,300
Or do you want me to change a place?

190
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:09,940
I'm fine with it.

191
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,380
How can you change a place?

192
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,340
I had a hard time applying to this place.

193
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,100
And the rent

194
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,140
and food are free.

195
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,580
And I promised

196
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,940
to help promote this place.

197
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,380
I'm more worried about you.

198
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,820
Kim doesn't seem angry.

199
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,260
I wonder if he's up to something.

200
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,140
Don't worry about me.

201
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,980
I'm more worried about you.

202
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,300
Are you okay?

203
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,420
Just let it be.

204
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,100
I do like Kim,

205
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,900
but we haven't talked for long.

206
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,700
I'm fine with it.

207
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,900
I'm glad you think that way.

208
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,100
You're not a crybaby. I don't want you to cry because of him.

209
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,210
Why is it so hard

210
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,890
to find a boyfriend?

211
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,500
Handsome,

212
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,580
with a good personality

213
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,820
and perfect.

214
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,300
Someone like Pleum.

215
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,460
Can't one be given to me?

216
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,060
Handsome,

217
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,020
with a good personality

218
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,780
but that jealous. That won't do, right?

219
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,540
Hey.

220
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,860
A man being jealous because of you

221
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,260
means he loves you

222
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,900
and cares about you.

223
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,300
It's good.

224
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,940
It's okay to be jealous.

225
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,940
But he just left.

226
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,180
He can't keep his promise.

227
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,580
Do you still want

228
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,180
someone like that to be your boyfriend?

229
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,300
Hey.

230
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,860
If Pleum hears you say that,

231
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,300
he will be sad.

232
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,540
It's good that he hears it.

233
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,380
That way, he will know

234
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,020
how hard life was for me in the past two years.

235
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,180
Pleum.

236
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,260
He has left.

237
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,540
You should move on.

238
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,420
You don't need to think about

239
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,060
or recall

240
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,940
the promises between you two.

241
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,820
Just remember the good things he did to you.

242
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,740
But I really like Kim.

243
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,380
I don't know why.

244
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,420
You said you wanted a good boyfriend.

245
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,340
Is he good enough?

246
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,780
Hey.

247
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,820
Haven't you heard of this?

248
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,260
People say

249
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,780
a playboy

250
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,940
won't be a playboy forever.

251
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,140
There must be someone

252
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,340
who can win his heart.

253
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,580
And can't I

254
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,260
be that someone?

255
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,260
You should know who I am.

256
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,660
Yes.

257
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,260
I'm Pleum,

258
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,860
Khun Khao's boyfriend who passed away two years ago.

259
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,010
Today,

260
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,380
I came back to this world

261
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,380
in the body of Kim,

262
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,940
a playboy

263
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,700
and the owner of this hotel.

264
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,620
I don't know how this miracle happened,

265
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,250
maybe it's a work of a deity,

266
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,980
but I have to abide by one condition:

267
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,660
I can't let anyone know who I really am.

268
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,660
So...

269
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,620
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,020
Bye, Kim.

271
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,540
I will take your body

272
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,380
as a punishment

273
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,940
for deceiving the girls.

274
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,460
I will live on your behalf.

275
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,980
But...

276
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,500
how did I die?

277
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,700
A senior student drove recklessly,

278
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,100
hit a wire pole

279
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,180
and died on the spot.

280
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,780
His partner was heartbroken

281
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,140
and took the flowers to the place where the accident happened.

282
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,820
The netizens cheered for him.

283
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,420
By the way,

284
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,260
why did you ask me to find the news about Khun Khao's boyfriend?

285
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,060
The last memory in my mind

286
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,180
was of that time.

287
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,460
Yes.

288
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,100
I did find that you were very sad then.

289
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,140
And you asked me to bring flowers and cards

290
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,700
to give them to Khun Khao.

291
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:08,940
He...

292
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,340
Oh.

293
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,340
Did I do that?

294
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,420
Yes.

295
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,300
You may not remember.

296
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,700
I was surprised

297
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,780
why you paid so much attention to Khun Khao.

298
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,460
Maybe I just

299
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,940
pitied him.

300
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:30,980
By the way,

301
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,900
you want me to blacklist all the girls' numbers?

302
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,970
After you blacklist them,

303
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:36,500
delete it.

304
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,660
You won't come after me, right?

305
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,140
I don't know.

306
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,700
All of a sudden, I don't want to play.

307
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,780
What did you just say?

308
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,260
By the way, Khet.

309
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,100
I changed my mind.

310
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,460
You can take that phone with you.

311
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,580
I'll give it to you.

312
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,700
But

313
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,180
I want a new number.

314
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,980
Okay, I'll get you

315
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,940
new number and a new phone.

316
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,260
Yes.

317
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,140
You can work for me.

318
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,020
Oh.

319
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,380
That's how people lose their memories for two years.

320
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,620
Okay.

321
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,780
Well...

322
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:13,540
Do I

323
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,220
yell at you?

324
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,460
Sometimes.

325
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,140
In the past, if I have scolded you

326
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,180
or got mad at you,

327
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,260
I apologize.

328
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,700
The death experience last night makes me want

329
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,700
to become a better person.

330
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,460
Mr Kim.

331
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,500
I need you

332
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,740
as soon as possible.

333
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,420
I want this number.

334
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,620
This

335
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,060
is the owner's address.

336
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,780
Go there.

337
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,700
Pay as much as he want.

338
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,180
If possible,

339
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,260
you can buy his phone

340
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,060
and...

341
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,940
500,000 baht.

342
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,140
500,000 baht?

343
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,660
But...

344
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,700
why did you buy the phone?

345
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,060
Take care of this for me.

346
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,099
It's not hard to get a phone number,

347
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,619
but how do we buy the phone?

348
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,060
Oh my.

349
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,540
My friend has become a VIP client.

350
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,380
That's awesome.

351
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,740
I don't understand.

352
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,580
You shocked him.

353
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,780
Why is he still so nice to you?

354
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,980
Did you apologize to him?

355
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,020
Not yet.

356
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,620
I think...

357
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,700
you should apologize to Kim.

358
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,020
Okay.

359
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,610
I will when I get the chance.

360
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,260
But

361
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,260
I'm starting to feel hungry.

362
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,700
Let's eat first.

363
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,420
Hey.

364
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,860
Or...

365
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,700
Khun, Kim may have drugged the food

366
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,580
to revenge on you.

367
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,500
What's wrong with you?

368
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,940
You've watched too many movies.

369
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,380
Oh my god!

370
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,620
He even sent you flowers.

371
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,220
Take them.

372
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,580
Oh my!

373
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,980
My goodness.

374
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,300
He even wrote a card.

375
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,060
Here.

376
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,540
Aoon.

377
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,260
I apologize for not greeting you this morning.

378
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,300
You know I lost my memories, right?

379
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,300
I just read our chat history.

380
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,180
Well...

381
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,980
I don't know if we have a chance to start over.

382
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,060
I promise

383
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,740
I won't be a playboy anymore.

384
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,020
And please apologize to your brother for me.

385
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,820
I made you cry last night.

386
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,380
Being electrocuted

387
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,300
may have made me think a lot.

388
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,180
I believe

389
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,180
you may really be the one who can make me better.

390
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,940
I apologize for the hurt and disappointment I caused to you in the past.

391
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,860
Kim.

392
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,700
Did Kim buy you those flowers?

393
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,340
Yes.

394
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,700
He bought them for me.

395
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,260
Maybe he invited you to dinner to apologize to you,

396
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,620
because he disappointed you.

397
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,700
But it looks like

398
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,620
he might have fallen in love with someone else.

399
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,220
That's why he wrote this card to reject you.

400
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,220
Or do you want to see what he wrote?

401
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,300
No.

402
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,450
That's it.

403
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,260
I don't want to see it anymore.

404
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,450
I trust you.

405
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,700
Okay.

406
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,300
Let's eat.

407
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,490
Let's eat.

408
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,660
Cheers.

409
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,260
Your sister didn't even raise her glass.

410
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,340
Hello?

411
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,620
I need to talk to you.

412
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,020
Oh.

413
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,420
Aoon's brother.

414
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,980
Good evening.

415
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,620
Can you stop pestering my sister?

416
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,580
Did you read the card I wrote?

417
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,500
You have so many women to choose from.

418
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,300
Why did you choose my sister?

419
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,620
I don't know.

420
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,540
Is it because of the glass of wine poured on your face

421
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,260
or the electric shock?

422
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,380
But I'm sure

423
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:53,900
you're the reason

424
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,340
I'm like this

425
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,900
after I woke up.

426
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,820
Are you provoking me?

427
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,460
Why did you avoid me this morning?

428
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,580
I wanted to hear your apology.

429
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,260
You are the one who should apologize to me.

430
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,260
You broke my sister's heart.

431
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,820
How dare you ask me to apologize to you?

432
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:13,860
Then...

433
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,020
let's call it even.

434
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,420
I almost died.

435
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,060
As for that card,

436
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,660
you don't have to give it to Aoon.

437
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,860
I used it to trick you.

438
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,580
How dare you say that?

439
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,740
Do you take Aoon as a toy?

440
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,980
You misunderstood me.

441
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,580
Fine.

442
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,540
I just want to make things clear with you.

443
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,620
Talk to me if you want to make things clear.

444
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,220
Why did you use my sister?

445
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,100
Fine.

446
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,660
I've been wanting to talk to you for a while.

447
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,900
But...

448
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,620
I shouldn't have done that to your sister.

449
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,730
I just want to talk to you and want to know you.

450
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,680
I thought about it for a long time.

451
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,220
Did I make you hate me again?

452
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,460
I'm sorry.

453
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,060
You talk like I've hated you for a long time.

454
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,620
If you don't hate me,

455
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,940
we should be very close now.

456
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,380
Do you come here often?

457
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,780
How do you know I come here often?

458
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,620
That's not all I know.

459
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,060
I also know

460
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,020
you're shooting the MV here.

461
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,820
I'm very happy.

462
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,860
You talk like we're close.

463
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,100
I thought you only remember those pretty female customers.

464
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,300
I remember regular customers more than them.

465
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,020
I'm very sorry

466
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,140
about your boyfriend.

467
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,820
You already gave me flowers and a card.

468
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,860
I don't know why you're doing this.

469
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,180
We're not that close.

470
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,580
Maybe it's time...

471
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,860
What time?

472
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,220
The time we met.

473
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,700
You talk like

474
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,660
we know each other well.

475
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,730
Hey.

476
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,780
What era are you living with your boyfriend?

477
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,420
You came here for your anniversary.

478
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:12,820
Yes.

479
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,820
What era?

480
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,460
Have you been wearing this necklace?

481
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,340
He gave you a ring when he became your boyfriend.

482
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:24,780
When you graduate,

483
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,690
will he buy you a house

484
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,060
or propose to you?

485
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,860
It would be great if he bought me a house.

486
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,450
If you want it, buy it yourself.

487
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,420
I don't want anything.

488
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,580
This ring even

489
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,220
makes me miss him.

490
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,820
If I have a house...

491
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,860
If I live alone,

492
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,620
I'm sure I'll die alone.

493
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,660
Hey.

494
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,300
You made my bar feel so sad.

495
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,460
You sitting here

496
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,580
makes the bar of your hotel very indecent.

497
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,540
Nonsense!

498
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,340
You talk like you know me well.

499
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,930
I'm serious.

500
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,300
The electric shock

501
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,980
made me

502
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,260
cherish life more.

503
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,260
It's like being reborn.

504
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,460
You're exaggerating.

505
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,740
I want to start over.

506
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,900
I dreamed of my past. I feel...

507
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,860
I hate myself very much.

508
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,380
You can start over with anyone,

509
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,410
but stop pestering my sister.

510
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,260
Can I start over with you?

511
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,900
What are you talking about?

512
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,740
Just kidding.

513
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,100
It's just strange...

514
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,340
You come to our hotel often,

515
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,780
but we don't have any common memories here.

516
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,780
What do you remember?

517
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,780
You talk like you don't remember what happened that day.

518
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:18,940
But...

519
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,820
I'm not usually like this.

520
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,740
Then what kind of person are you?

521
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
I'm sleepy.

522
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,420
I'm going to rest.

523
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,780
You're still a good drinker.

524
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,500
Same as before?

525
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,660
You make me feel you know me well.

526
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,420
Aoon.

527
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,100
How is it?

528
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,260
Did Nont answer the phone?

529
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,780
Hey.

530
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,660
Don't wipe it like that.

531
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,540
You'll ruin your makeup.

532
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,690
What should we do?

533
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,620
Nont's not picking up.

534
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,900
I wonder if he's awake.

535
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,100
What is he doing?

536
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,060
Then...

537
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,380
Who will be the male lead of the MV?

538
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:33,700
Hey.

539
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,940
What's up?

540
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,660
Hey, Muey.

541
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,090
Fix Aoon's makeup first.

542
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,740
I'll think of a way.

543
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,180
Hey.

544
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,420
Don't tell me

545
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,140
Nont can't come?

546
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:45,980
You're right.

547
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,420
He's not answering his phone.

548
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,900
What should we do now?

549
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,060
Pun, you do it.

550
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,460
Hey, I won't do it.

551
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,380
I'm not prepared.

552
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,180
Besides,

553
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,140
I have a pimple.

554
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,100
No, no, no.

555
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:56,700
Hey.

556
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,420
I can cover it with a concealer.

557
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,300
No.

558
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,900
I only have you now, Pun.

559
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,900
No one else can take the place.

560
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,500
Hey!

561
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,860
No.

562
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,580
I think I've found the male lead of the MV.

563
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,420
Who?

564
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,340
Kim.

565
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,380
Can you help us with the MV?

566
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,660
Well...

567
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,300
What should I do?

568
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,980
-Yes!
-Thank you so much.

569
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,380
Yes.

570
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,700
This scene is a Montage.

571
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,500
Well,

572
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,780
you and Aoon play a couple.

573
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,540
I want you to recall some happy memories.

574
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:51,980
Muey!

575
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,140
What are you looking at?

576
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,820
I think...

577
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,060
I don't need to do make up for Kim.

578
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,260
His face is so smooth that

579
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,380
it's like he doesn't even have pores.

580
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,860
Take a deep breath in.

581
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,860
Take a deep breath out.

582
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,250
Okay, keep it like this.

583
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,900
Imagine it now.

584
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,700
It's weird.

585
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,740
What do you mean?

586
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,340
Is it because I asked Kim to be in the MV?

587
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,900
No.

588
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:29,020
It's even weirder that Kim's willing to join your MV.

589
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,820
I asked him several times.

590
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,260
He has such a handsome face.

591
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,180
Why didn't he become a star?

592
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,220
But he refused very firmly.

593
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,420
He said he would never come.

594
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,020
And?

595
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,580
That's why I said it's strange.

596
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,020
He suddenly came to shoot for you.

597
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,300
I have my own way.

598
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,820
What about you?

599
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,700
Can you

600
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,860
shoot the MV with him?

601
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,460
I know.

602
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,500
Yesterday...

603
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,900
you didn't have dinner...

604
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,300
You went to talk to Kim.

605
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,300
I just want to take care of things about you.

606
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,900
Well...

607
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,980
But seriously,

608
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,930
when I chatted with him last night,

609
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,340
I felt...

610
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,300
very strange.

611
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,580
He looked more energetic than before.

612
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,140
He even said

613
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,220
he wanted to change himself

614
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,620
and start over.

615
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,060
It's weird, isn't it?

616
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,260
Really?

617
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,660
But I already told him.

618
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,300
We'll be brother and sister.

619
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,420
Then...

620
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,020
What did he say?

621
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:35,940
What did he say?

622
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,540
Did he agree?

623
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,290
He said he understands

624
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,940
and respects my decision.

625
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,780
And...

626
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,180
I saw it coming

627
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,380
Since he rejected me with a card,

628
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,700
that should be

629
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,020
the end of us.

630
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,540
If that's the case,

631
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,140
it's a good sign.

632
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,180
Let's go.

633
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,820
Let's go shoot the MV.

634
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,820
Take a deep breath in.

635
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,860
Take a long breath out.

636
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,450
Okay?

637
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,260
Don't

638
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,060
have any feelings for Kim.

639
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,860
We're just brother and sister.

640
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,180
We're just brother and sister.

641
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,420
-Just brother and sister.
-Just brother and sister.

642
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,180
-Just brother and sister.
-Just brother and sister.

643
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:19,780
Let's go.

644
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,540
Go!

645
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,220
-Just brother and sister.
-You can do it.

646
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:22,940
You can do it.

647
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,860
♫Do you know how hard it is?♫

648
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:48,580
♫It's been thousands of years, when we will meet similar stars?♫

649
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,980
♫Do you know? Within one blink of eyes♫

650
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:01,860
♫How many changes will the universe and my life have?♫

651
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:10,900
♫You turn the thin air into sweet fragrance of flowers♫

652
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:18,860
♫You make the dim stars the way I dreamed of♫

653
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,580
♫You make the moment become eternity♫

654
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:29,380
♫Now my love is valuable♫

655
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,460
♫Because it's you♫

656
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,980
♫We move along the orbit and meet like a dream♫

657
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,820
♫Light up each other♫

658
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:49,900
♫In a universe full of love♫

659
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,700
Cut!

660
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,460
Khun, I really envy your sister.

661
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,620
Why?

662
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,820
I want to be looked at by Kim like that too.

663
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,740
Look at Aoon.

664
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,260
How can she be so good when shooting with the person she likes?

665
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,060
If I were her,

666
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,580
I would be so embarrassed.

667
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,500
Ah.

668
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,500
You want to shoot with Kim?

669
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,740
Did you ask him

670
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,100
if he wants to shoot with you?

671
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,420
Aoon. Kim!

672
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,940
Great!

673
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,460
Pun.

674
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:39,740
You did a great job!

675
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,740
There are so many wonderful clips.

676
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,060
I'm a master of my trade.

677
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,180
Keep it up.

678
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,300
My little brother.

679
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:52,820
Well...

680
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,860
What should I do next?

681
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,460
Well...

682
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,060
Let's talk inside.

683
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:57,980
It's too hot outside.

684
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,500
Come with me.

685
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,260
Let me fix your makeup.

686
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:09,739
How do you feel?

687
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,820
Is it okay?

688
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,780
How do you feel after watching it?

689
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,380
Well...

690
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,420
Not bad.

691
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,219
It's just a little strange.

692
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,100
I didn't guide you.

693
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,659
But you suddenly know how to act.

694
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,699
It's all because of Kim.

695
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,699
He talked to me

696
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,659
and guided me.

697
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,860
Just like you.

698
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,060
How did he do it?

699
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,540
Well,

700
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,300
when we were walking,

701
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,739
he told me

702
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,100
to climb onto his back.

703
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:37,820
Yes.

704
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,820
When we were sitting,

705
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,780
I was going to give him a massage,

706
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,139
but he said no.

707
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,580
He said he should give me a massage.

708
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,940
Then he gave me a massage.

709
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,420
Good.

710
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:48,370
It's so comfortable.

711
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,699
Tired?

712
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,980
This strength is the same as before.

713
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,460
Give me a Martini.

714
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,420
As for Khun Khao's drink,

715
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,900
keep it on my tab.

716
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,170
Okay.

717
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,100
I still can't memorize them,

718
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,140
even if there are only two pages of script.

719
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,580
Actually, after you get to know the character's setting,

720
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,460
you can say anything.

721
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,180
Well...

722
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,700
Just improvise, Brother.

723
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,100
Oh.

724
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,780
I'm not used to

725
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,420
you calling me "brother".

726
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,260
Sorry.

727
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,780
Mr. Kim.

728
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,620
You can call me whatever you want.

729
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,180
Here.

730
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,940
Please read the script with me.

731
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:06,620
Well...

732
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,060
Mr. Kim.

733
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,500
I want to apologize for what happened that day.

734
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,140
I got mad at you for what happened to Aoon.

735
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,580
I almost got you killed.

736
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,820
Why are you apologizing?

737
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,770
People like me...

738
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,900
I deserved it.

739
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:23,860
Then...

740
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,260
Why are you helping us?

741
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,540
Well...

742
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,460
I heard from Aoon that

743
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,220
you and your friends will help promote the hotel.

744
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,980
I can understand the location.

745
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,140
But

746
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,700
you suddenly agreed to help shoot the MV.

747
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,020
I was a little confused.

748
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,460
Maybe I feel sorry for Aoon and... Well...

749
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,420
I feel sorry to you too.

750
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,460
But don't misunderstand.

751
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,220
I mean

752
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,260
I've made a deal with Aoon.

753
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,460
We'll be brother and sister.

754
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,460
I won't go after her anymore.

755
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,580
Because

756
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,260
I already have someone I like.

757
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,420
Doesn't that mean

758
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,500
the old Kim is back?

759
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:12,980
Oh.

760
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,700
You don't allow me to pursue your sister,

761
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,860
but I can still like someone else, right?

762
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,650
Then...

763
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,820
What about your ex-girlfriends?

764
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,900
Have you taken care of them?

765
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,740
Yes.

766
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,300
They were all taken care of by Khet.

767
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,500
Wow.

768
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,860
A playboy like you suddenly changed

769
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,580
after being electrocuted.

770
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,900
You have things to say when I turned good.

771
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,420
You have things to say when I was a bad guy.

772
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,740
What do you want me to do?

773
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,580
I'm not blaming you.

774
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,380
I just think it's quite cool to be a playboy.

775
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,220
You don't have to care about what others think,

776
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,340
or worry about anyone.

777
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,740
Do whatever you want.

778
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,420
Change however you want.

779
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,660
It sounds like

780
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,100
you want a playboy boyfriend.

781
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,060
Did you get electrocuted too?

782
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,460
To be honest, I thought about it in secret.

783
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,420
When I was with Pleum,

784
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,620
I felt quite depressed.

785
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:12,700
Well...

786
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,700
Wherever I go,

787
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,380
or what I do,

788
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,060
I have to send him a photo to report.

789
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,300
Sometimes I thought

790
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,300
I want him to try to be with someone else.

791
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:21,820
Let him see

792
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,820
if anyone can stand him like me.

793
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,100
You shouldn't think like that.

794
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,740
I was just

795
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,980
talking about it.

796
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,580
If it really happened,

797
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,020
I wouldn't be able to accept it.

798
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,700
Maybe I thought so

799
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,940
because I was sure he wouldn't do such a thing.

800
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,100
Disloyalty

801
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,460
is wrong.

802
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,300
Goodness.

803
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,220
You know

804
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,180
you're talking about yourself?

805
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,580
Actually,

806
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,980
when I was a playboy,

807
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,740
it taught me a lot.

808
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,540
No matter how bad a playboy I am,

809
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,700
I've never provoked anyone

810
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,540
or got involved in any relationship.

811
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,500
Then...

812
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,140
Have you ever thought about getting close to someone

813
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:13,340
or

814
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,410
date someone seriously?

815
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:17,820
Well...

816
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,540
I'm going to graduate.

817
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,060
No.

818
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,740
I graduated two years ago.

819
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,180
It should be time.

820
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,020

you're like a different person.

You said you didn't want to be a star.

823
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,860
But you suddenly came to film the MV for me.

824
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,860
I thought it was strange.

825
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,860
Hey, Khet.

826
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,420
Okay, I'll be right there.

830
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,020
Yes.

831
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,980
I'll be there as soon as possible.

No.

No.

-Why do you want Pleum's number and phone?

856
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,020
I want to pursue Khun Khao.

857
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,500
Kim, have you been here before?

858
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,180
Of course.

859
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,580
How many people have you brought here?

860
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,420
One.

861
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,860
Who is so unlucky?

862
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,620
So, the person who bought Pleum's number

863
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,620
is Kim?

864
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,140
Why did you do that?

865
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,340
Khao, listen to me.

866
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,020
I can explain.

867
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,460
Khao, can you like me?

868
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,860
Like me like you like Pleum.

What's wrong with you?

870
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,660
I'm Pleum.

00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,340
A scumbag like you

872
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,100
can't be compared to Pleum.

00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,420
you would be a playboy like me.

878
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,060
I can't become Khun Khao's boyfriend.

00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,540
You know that, right?
