[Building 17]

22
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,960
Jeez, the previous class had a lot of lecture notes.

23
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,440
Yes, also a lot of tasks.

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,800
I didn't even finish any tasks yesterday, and now there’s more.

25
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,639
I've got a presentation tomorrow too.

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,600
I haven't slept yet.

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,920
Ugh, I'm beat.

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,280
I'm so stressed out.

29
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,840
I definitely need to go for a spa,

30
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,360
get a body massage, facial massage, foot massage,
and a skin treatment at my mom's hotel to prevent wrinkles.

31
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,600
Hey, are you going somewhere?
Join me at the spa?

32
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,280
Nah, gotta swap cars at home.

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,360
My dad called, said he needs this one,

34
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,040
and is buying me a new one,

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,520
so I'm going to check it out.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,240
Your father is so amazing,

37
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,320
buying you a new car every month.

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,560
Sure thing.

39
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,960
Excuse me, might be Dad. Back in a sec.

40
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Alright.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,040

00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,680
Ouch!

44
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,480
I’m sorry.

45
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,720
Is your cell phone okay?

46
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,200
Here it is.

Who was that guy?

53
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,680
You're always a step behind. He's already left.

54
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,640
Who left?

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,320
Don't know, but he was... impressive.

56
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,040
Really?

57
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,720
Is there any hot guy at this university you don't know?

58
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,880
Come on, you're a bit over the top.

59
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,720
But who was he? Never seen him around before.

60
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,240
Hey, gotta run.

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,200
I'm meeting up with Tai.
It's already late.

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,200
You're not joining, right?

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,280
Nope, got a professor's meeting.

64
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,120
-Alright, heading out.
-Bye.

65

-Hey, what are you doing?
-Just wanna chat.

66
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,240
What’s up?

67
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
Make it quick, I'm in a rush.

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,520
I miss you and...

00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,960
[Whisper] Horny.

70
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,440
Hey, that's not cool,

71
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,360
Why not? We used to talk like this.

72
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,560
That was in the past.

73
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,760
We're not together anymore.

74
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,000
Because of you, remember?

75
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,960
We broke up, but we can still be friends,

76
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,159
or maybe more, if you're open to it.

77
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,600
Only I really get your likes and dislikes.

78
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,000
And you always knew what I wanted.

79
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,080
It's quiet here;

80
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,880
I suppose...

81
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,160
should we relive our past?

82
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,320
Damn it!

83
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,080
Don't try this again.

84
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,640
It's because of this behavior of yours

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,640
fuck anyone at random, that made me leave.

86
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,280
Just so you know, I'm with someone else now,

87
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,920
and I love him a lot.

88
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,840
I mean,

89
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,240
so much more than you.
Remember that!

90
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440

Yes!

93
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Oh, sorry about that, I was busy with my studies.

94
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,840
Thank you so much, I'll send it asap.

[The bag doesn't have any defects, right? Why sell it so cheap?]

96
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,560
Absolutely no defects. I wore it once and felt it didn't suit me,
so I wanted to sell it.

97
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,120
[Cool, thanks.]

98
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, dear Som... my sugar mama FC,

99
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,600
thanks for buying me the bag!

100

I’m really sorry.

101
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,200
I really need to sell this off.

102
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,560
Bye, bye, goodbye little luxury.

103
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Just borrowing it, Dad. Promise I'll return it soon.

104

Stop, Peem!

105
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,760
Can't believe you, you troublemaker.

What do you want?

109
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,800
New car, huh?

110
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,440
Looks sharp.

111

113
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,000
Or... you don't have one, do you?

114
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,400
Hey, are you okay?
You've been looking glum since morning.

115
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Yeah, what’s wrong?

116
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,720
I ran into Ta yesterday.

117
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,760
Seemed like he wanted me to make love with me.

118
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,880
I cut it off and told him...

119
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,160
Tell what?

120
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,280
-I already got a partner.
-Huh...you got a partner?

121
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,920
Yep, and it's stressing me out.

122
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,040
Don't stress about it.

123
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,240
We just avoid places where he is,

124
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
so we don’t have to meet him.

125
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,800
We'll help scan the area for you.

126
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Hmm, thanks.

127
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,000
Look out, Ta's heading this way.

128
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,600
Hey there, Ta!

129
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,920
You've come a long way.

130
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,160
Actually, I have some business with Peem.

131
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,200
What is it?

132
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
My faculty is having a party.

133
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,680
As student president, I'm here to invite you.
You can’t miss it.

134
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,880
Anyway...

135
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,280
bring your partner along.

136
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,920
I’m dying to meet him.

137
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,280
Ink and Tide, make sure you come.

138
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,720
Alright.

139
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,120
Thanks.

140
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,160
See you there.

141
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,080
Gosh, what do I do now?

142
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,760
Hey, what's stressing you out?

143
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,520
Just show up, it's just an invite.

144
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,520
But it's not that simple.

145
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,720
-Stressed about the partner thing?
-Yeah.

146
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,400
I can get a model from my friend's parlor.

147
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,240
They all look like models, really.

148
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,920
That won't work.
Ta is a party animal,

149
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,600
He may know everyone, right?

150
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,440
True that.

151
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,400
What should I do then?

152
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,320
Can't be just any random person.

153
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,160
They have to match your stature.

154
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,400
Yeah,

155
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,400
if it's someone even better than Ta's current partner,
that would be awesome.

156
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,080
And who's Ta dating now?

157
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
Can't recall the name.

158
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,240
What I do know is that his profile is top-notch.

159
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,000
Rich family, handsome, good physique...
could be a celebrity easily.

160
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,840
Where am I gonna find someone like that?

161
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,840
And with the party just 15 days away...

162
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,800
No worries, we've got 15 days.

163
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,600
Trust us, we'll help you out. There's gotta be someone.

164
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,840
Yeah,

165
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,120
I'm on it too.

166
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,320
Trust me.

167
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,720
There's gotta be a hidden gem here somewhere.

168
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,520
Let's grab a bite.

169
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,920
Is it good?

170
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,160
-Spicy.
-Aha.

171
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,560
-Drink some water.
-It's burning up.

172
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,800
Check out this guy.

173
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,240
Tall, Chinese-like and muscular.

174
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,440
Not my type.

175
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,840
Pass.

176
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,520
What about this one?

177
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,160
I think he's as handsome as Ta.

178
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,040
Just handsome, huh?

179
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,600
I heard his family is going bankrupt.
Just skip!

180
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,920
This guy?
He's dark, handsome, bad boy-looking. It's trendy right now.

181
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,840
Man, he's studying by day and
works as a bar host in Thonglor by night.

182
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,280
Just pass.

183
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,640
Man, why is it so hard to find a hidden gem?

184
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,560
That is why it is called a hidden gem.

185
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,120
Should I just tell Ta the truth?

186
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,560
No, don't give up yet.

187
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,080
We haven't scoured the whole university.

188
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,280
There's one guy,

189
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,960
but he might be hard to find.

190
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,000
Keeps to himself mostly.

191
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,400
Even though he hardly meets anyone, he has a lot of fans.

192
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,120
Oh? You mean Phol?

193
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,360
Yeah, Chaiphol.

194
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,480
Chaiphol? Who's that?

195
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,600
Chaiphol, real name Song-Itthiphol.

196
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,560
He's the star of the Faculty of Science,

197
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,760
Arguably the hottest guy around.

198
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,040
He also has a soccer team.

199
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,800
Extremely rich, lives in a luxurious university apartment.

200
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,400
Top student, ranked first in his faculty

201
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,680
But he's a bit strange, doesn’t like mingling with others.

202
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,360
I think Chaiphol is perfect for you, Peem.

203
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,200
I heard Ta tried to woo him but failed.

204
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,880
Right, if you get him, Ta will definitely stop bothering you.

205
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,400
Okay, I choose him.

206
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,840
Is he really from this faculty?

207
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,240
Yeah,

208
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,320
why hasn't he shown up to any classes yet?

209
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,720
Maybe we need to be here as early as 5 AM to meet him.

210
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,960
Hmm, if it's earlier than this, count me out.
I can't wake up that early.

211
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,360
Gosh!

212
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,240
Hey, we’ve been waiting since 6 AM,

213
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,560
now it's 10:45.

214
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,920
Still no sign of that guy.

215
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,480
If he doesn't turn up by 11, I'm out.

216
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,360
Wait, there he is! Chaiphol!

217
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,040
[Scream]

218
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,080
Such a handsome guy, radiating a strong aura.

219
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,840
Guys, it’s him.

220
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Don’t just stand there stunned.
Let's follow him!

221
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,520
Hurry up!

222
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,120
Quickly!

223
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,800
I saw him.

224
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,200
Let’s go.

225
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,200
He’s rich, why eat in the cafeteria?

226
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,240
Maybe he’s just humble, not weird at all.

227
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,360
Wow... doesn't he care about anything else?

228
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,960
What a guy, why is he so perfect?

229
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,800
Doesn't he ever just chill out and have fun?

230
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,200
All he does is study. Must be pretty dull.

231
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,400
Would someone like him even be interested in me?

232
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,880
Come on, have some confidence!

233
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,360
You’re the star of the communications faculty, with lots of fans.

234
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,920
A lot of people like you.

235
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,720
Trust me. If he meets you, he's bound to like you too.

236
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,440
Fight on, dude.

237
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,480
Shush!

238
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,640
Quiet, please. This is a library.

239
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,320
Sorry, ma'am.

240
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,120
How does he manage that? No social life. Boring!

241
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,360
He's just focused on his books.

242
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,520
Peem, you're running out of time.

243
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,200
Just give him a shot.

244
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,000
Today's the day—I'll tell him I like him.

245
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,360
Here he comes,

246
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,760
go for it!

247
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,360
Give him a shot.

248
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,800
Phol!

249
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,680
I'm Peem.

250
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,360
Can I get your number?

251
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,440
Done talking?

252
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,080
What the heck was that?

253
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,720
What's with him? No social skills at all?

254
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Peem, it’s okay.

255
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,440
Hey, you're late too.

256
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,080
Yeah, I couldn't sleep well last night.

257
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,560
Worried about Phol, huh?

258
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,040
Don't worry about it.

259
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,320
I got something for you.

260
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,840
How did you manage to get this?

261
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,240
Traded my charm for it, obviously.

262
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,720
Thanks, my beautiful friend.

263
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Relax, or you won't be able to focus in class.

264
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,120
Let's head in, we're already late.

265
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,880
Hello, Phol!

266
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,840
He's not answering.

267
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,640
Call him again.

268
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,880
[Hi Phol! It's Peem here.]

269
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,640
[Message seen]

270
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,600
Any response?

271
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,360
Nothing yet.

272
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,360
-He may be having lunch now.
[Are you in class today? Need to talk.]

273
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,600
[I have something to talk to you about.]

274
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,000
[Hello!]
[All messages were read by Phol]

275
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,040
Are you going to keep texting him?

276
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,440
That´s enough.

277
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,000
Calm down, folk.

278
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,200
[Phol, won't you answer me?]
Hungry? I'll treat you.

279
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,200
When will he arrive?

280
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,560
Damn, where could he be?

281
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,680
Still didn’t show, right?

282
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,160
Excuse me, I didn’t order this.

283
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,440
Excuse me, I think you’ve got the wrong...

284
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Damn, so rude.
Thinks he's so handsome or what?

285
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,080
Ouch!
Watch where you're going...

286
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,320
I’m sorry.

287
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,800
Is your cell phone okay?

288
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,800
Here it is.

289
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,880
Hey, Peem!

290
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,320
Where are you going?

291
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,840
Come!

292
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,280
He...

293
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,680
Who is he?

294
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,640
Well, but he’s handsome, very much so.

295
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,680
Why's he hiding like that?

296
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,720
Your mom sent some food over.

297
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,080
Thanks, Dad.
Tell Mom she doesn't have to, though.

298
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,560
Just in case, so you don’t go hungry.
It's your favorite menu, so you'll get chubbier.

299
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,800
Dad, you can head back.
I'm planning to stay and read more.

300
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,640
His dad?

301
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,760
When do you want me to pick you up next time?

302
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,160
Next week's good, Dad.

303
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,160
Or if I'm not coming home, I'll call.
So you don’t have to drive here.

304
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,520
No problem, take your time.

305
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,000
And hey, if you need more rice or anything, just call me.

306
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,200
-I’ll bring it for you.
-Sure, dad.

307
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,080
-You should get home, it's late.
-Alright then.

308
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,800
Take care, eat well.

309
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,720
-Call me when you get home, okay?
-Will do, don't worry.

310
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,800
Let's talk in my room.

311
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,159
It's more private.

312
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,480
Send me your location.

313
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,920
There he is, Chaiphol!

314
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,280
He’s rich, why eat in the cafeteria?

315
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,360
Maybe he’s just humble, doesn’t seem weird to me.

316
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,080
What a guy, why is he so perfect?

317
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,240
Doesn't he ever look for some fun?

318
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,080
Just studies all the time, must be so boring.

319
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,240
Would someone like him even be interested in me?

320
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,600
Today's the day—I'll tell him I like him.

321
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,320
Here he comes, go for it!

322
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,840
Give him a shot.

323
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,080
Phol!
 I'm Peem.

324
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,360
Can I get your number?

325
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,800
Done talking?

326
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,800
What the heck was that?

327
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,280
When will he arrive?

328
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,440
Damn, where will he be.

329
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,480
You didn't come, right?

330
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,280
Excuse me, I didn’t order this.

331
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,400
Excuse me, I think you’ve got the wrong...

332
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,760
Damn, so rude.
Thinks he's so handsome or what?

333
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,040
Wow, your room is super tidy!

334
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,880
Dude, you've got more fans than me!

335
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,640
Let's talk quickly so you can leave soon.

336
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,320
Come this way...

337
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,520
Have a seat here.

338
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,640
Okay,

339
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,120
in exchange for keeping your secret,

340
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,160
I want you to pretend to be my boyfriend.

341
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,640
No way…

342
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,520
-Maybe I'll just post this on my story...
-For how long?

343
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,400
Until the end of this month.

344
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
What do I have to do?

345
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,360
Simple. Ever had a boyfriend?

346
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,600
Just act like you're my boyfriend.

347
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,000
-How sweet do I have to be?
-A lot.

348
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,080
I don’t get it.

349
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,240
There are other good-looking guys around.

350
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,200
Why does it have to be me?

351
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,120
Listen, I’ll explain to you.

352
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,360
Ta used to be my boyfriend.

353
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,760
And he's been trying to get under my skin.

354
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,080
I just want him to leave me alone.

355
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,160
So I want someone better to be my partner.

356
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,440
I still don't see why it has to be me.

357
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,080
Because you're the perfect choice.

358
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,200
And importantly,

359
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,640
Ta tried to woo you too, right?

360
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,640
And you turned him down, didn't you?

361
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:15,520
Look, it's just for a couple of days, till the party is over.

362
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,680
Then we can break up.

363
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,520
Time will fly, you'll see.

364
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:28,920
Please, think of it as helping someone out.

365
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,000
-When do we start?
-Tomorrow.

366
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,280
Huh?

367
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,440
Nothing to be shocked about.
We start tomorrow.

368
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,520
Isn't it too soon?

369
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,520
-No, tomorrow's perfect.
-Give me a little time to prepare.

370
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,440
Just a favor for a fellow human.

371
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,080
Please!

372
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,960
Come on, please!

373
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,480
[Next Episode]
You really want to go serious with this guy?

374
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,800
Why not?

375
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,840
Phol's got it all – looks, brains, wealthy background.

376
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,240
Who wouldn't be into him?

377
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,160
I heard... once you tried to woo him too, right?

378
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,800
Too bad it didn't work out for you.

379
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,040
True,

380
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,640
I didn't end up being his boyfriend

381
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,280
but I got something else.

382
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,760
If you doubt it, just ask Phol yourself.

383
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,240
It's none of your business.

384
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,080
We'll break up soon.

385
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,080
What the hell do you want to know?

386
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:07,800
