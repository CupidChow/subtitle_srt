00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,370
You can go by yourself.

189
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,290
A wonderful world

190
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,490
is not only about praying and doing good deeds in the temple.

191
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,460
In this world,

192
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,740
we have to accept the fact that

193
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,700
the world is not about us.

194
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,420
Every inch of land in this world

195
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,010
and every place

196
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,860
has something worth learning and exploring for us.

197
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,650
A world

198
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,530
with many people who have different ideas from ours.

199
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,420
And that doesn't mean

200
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,370
their ideas are wrong.

201
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,450
Do you understand?

202
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,500
Huh?

203
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,460
Don't follow me.

204
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,610
I'm going to seek relief.

205
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,530
Emmy.

206
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,700
You call this "seeking relief"?

207
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,410
Now you believe there's really right and wrong in the world.

208
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,620
Are you hurt?

209
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,890
Emmy.

210
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,060
I'm exhausted.

211
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,770
Is there anything else to pack?

212
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,250
The clothes I didn't wear...

213
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,420
Do you know

214
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,650
how hard it took me to find them?

215
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,700
Why is it so hard for us to get married?

216
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,220
It wouldn't have been hard

217
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,810
if you hadn't lied in the beginning.

218
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,260
Darn it.

219
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,220
Darn it.

220
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,980
Is this some kind of a bad omen?

221
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,180
I don't feel good.

222
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,210
I think we should pack up and go home.

223
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,380
Yes.

224
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,010
I think so.

225
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,380
Hurry up.

226
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,850
Isn't that my brother?

227
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,220
What is he doing with Emmy?

228
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,460
-You scumbag!
-Sister! Sister!

229
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,210
-Sister!
-Mei!

230
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,100
Oh no, what did I throw out just now?

231
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,210
My ring box.

232
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,490
Where did you throw it?

233
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,500
I don't know.

234
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,890
I just threw it.

235
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,260
Mei.

236
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,980
We've searched many places.

237
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,100
Why can't we find it?

238
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,380
Yeah.

239
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,770
Mei, did you throw it to Mars?

240
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,940
Oh.

241
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,860
Maybe Pluto.

242
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,740
I just can't find it.

243
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,090
Your names are on the ring, right?

244
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:42,780
Yes.

245
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,170
Oh, I ruined everything.

246
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,340
Hello, Mom.

247
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,020
I'm not coming back.

248
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,820
Because I don't want to.

249
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,170
I'm hanging up. I have something to do.

250
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,860
Tob and Boss

251
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,610
are a couple, right?

252
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,260
When people want to hide the truth,

253
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,380
their eyes will be like yours right now.

254
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,380
Your eyes are spinning to avoid eye contact.

255
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,330
It's obvious that you're lying.

256
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,810
I'll find evidence

257
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,220
to prove my gaydar

258
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,050
is correct.

259
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,180
It's time for a beautiful Cupid like me

260
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,820
to reveal the truth.

261
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,500
Because love

262
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,730
cannot be hidden.

263
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,380
Understand?

264
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,460
Oh.

265
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,620
I woke up early to look for it.

266
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,700
Why can't I find it?

267
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,820
Did something bad happen to me?

268
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,140
It's our bad luck.

269
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,330
What if we can't find it?

270
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,180
Are you looking for something?

271
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,490
Why are you all so surprised?

272
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,890
It's me, Emmy.

273
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,170
Speaking of which,

274
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,650
are you looking for something?

275
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,660
Yeah...

276
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,810
Well...

277
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,940
It seems like it's something important.

278
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,330
Then...

279
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,970
I'll help you find it, okay?

280
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:39,980
Come on.

281
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,490
Let me help you.

282
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,730
A wedding ring?

283
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,530
No.

284
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,010
No one said they found something.

285
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,660
I'll check with other departments.

286
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,340
Please wait a moment.

287
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,819
Thank you.

288
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,450
Anyway,

289
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,369
I'll communicate the details with you over the phone, Bua.

290
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,819
I'm sure in this trip,

291
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,900
we will definitely gain more merits than before.

292
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,490
Trust me.

293
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,140
My mom.

294
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,500
Oh no.

295
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,010
Go!

296
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,420
Go!

297
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,090
Ouch.

298
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,100
Why did you stop? Just go.

299
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,180
Anyway,

300
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,500
I'll come see you again.

301
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,450
Sure.

302
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,260
Have a safe journey.

303
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,890
Thank you.

304
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,210
No.

305
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,540
Oh.

306
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,490
Where did they go?

307
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,500
Is there something wrong?

308
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,050
Oh, nothing.

309
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,850
A few guests came to ask about the wedding ring.

310
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,980
Wedding ring?

311
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,820
Wedding ring?

312
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,500
Has anyone seen the ring?

313
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:42,730
No.

314
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,050
I know.

315
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,330
Should we keep looking or go back?

316
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:05,850
[Bass: Let's make up... Why are you mad? There must be a misunderstanding. Mei.]

317
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,180
[Bass: Be careful!]

318
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,300
My mom!

319
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,660
Aunt Bua.

320
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,330
Emmy, what are you doing here?

321
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,300
Uncle Prem, Aunt Bua.

322
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,060
What do you think about gay?

323
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,580
I think it's their own business.

324
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,530
Yeah.

325
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,210
What's wrong? Is there something, Emmy?

326
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,180
Are they hiding...

327
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,100
because they're afraid that their parents woon't accept it?

328
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:35,970
No.

329
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,250
Nothing.

330
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,180
I'm fine.

331
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,340
I just

332
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,410
want to ask what you think about them.

333
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:50,980
I want to know what other elders
beside my mom think about this.

334
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,530
Nowadays, the BL dramas

335
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,450
are very popular.

336
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,780
I'd like to recommend them to you.

337
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,410
I want to invite you to watch those dramas with me.

338
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,810
In this way,

339
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,180
we can see

340
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,620
different types of love besides heterosexual love.

341
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,490
Love is very beautiful.

342
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,860
Do you want to see it with me?

343
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:24,930
Do you?

344
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,850
Do you?

345
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,180
BL drama?

346
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,420
Why is my mom following us?

347
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,210
Could it be...

348
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,170
we're exposed?

349
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,420
No, that's impossible.

350
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,170
We've been hiding it well.

351
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,460
I think we should go back to Chiang Mai.

352
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,380
I came all the way to Bangkok.

353
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,930
My mom can still catch up.

354
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:03,740
Yes.

355
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,940
I agree.

356
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:09,050
Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps.

357
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,310
I want the most beautiful and expensive dress.

358
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,050
Don't worry about the budget.

359
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:31,530
Okay.

360
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,580
Are you serious, Mom?

361
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:39,690
Of course.

362
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,330
Em-orn has prepared everything.

363
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,220
She wants to apologize for her ruined wedding.

364
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,250
Besides,

365
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,700
tomorrow is a very auspicious day.

366
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,380
And

367
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,900
don't worry about the wedding guests.

368
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,460
I invited your friends in Chiang Mai.

369
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,580
Very generous.

370
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,540
I took care of everything, including round-trip tickets.

371
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,220
Generous?

372
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,820
Hello, Mom.

373
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,740
What's wrong, sweetie?

374
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,170
Are you planning a wedding for Boss and Mei?

375
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,490
No.

376
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,930
What's going on now?

377
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,820
What should I do?

378
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,180
Can I pretend to be sick?

379
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,530
Hello?

380
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,330
I know.

381
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,340
I'm going to pretend my leg is broken.

382
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,490
When Aunt Bua approaches,

383
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,940
you push me down the stairs.

384
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,250
Mei.

385
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,380
You're messing around.

386
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,780
Sit down first.

387
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:11,970
No.

388
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:25,690
Hey.

389
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,690
I've made up my mind.

390
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,090
I'm going to be honest with my parents.

391
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:31,730
What?

392
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,370
Are you serious?

393
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,250
Yes.

394
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,490
Are you ready?

395
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,660
I have to be ready.

396
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,300
What will come will come eventually.

397
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,580
Just hold my hand tightly.

398
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,260
Wait.

399
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,180
Are you really going now?

400
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,260
Think about it.

401
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,930
There's no time.

402
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,700
The longer we wait, the worse things will get.

403
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,290
If we say it now, maybe we can still cancel the wedding.

404
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,060
You're right.

405
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,580
Go ahead.

406
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,930
I believe everything will be fine.

407
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,060
Let's go.

408
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,450
Do you want to talk?

409
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,660
No.

410
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,970
Mei.

411
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,260
If you don't want to talk, I'll go back to work.

412
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,460
You know that, right? I flew here just to see you.

413
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,260
Tomorrow is the last day of my leave.

414
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,570
Are you really going to waste the time?

415
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,140
Mei!

416
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,050
So what made you angry before

417
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:39,930
was a misunderstanding,

418
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,370
right?

419
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,330
So,

420
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,410
we need to calm down from now on

421
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,260
and ask each other first about anything.

422
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,370
I want us to rely on each other,

423
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,850
to trust each other,

424
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,730
and get along well with with each other.

425
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,690
Okay?

426
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,210
As I said before,

427
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,380
I broke up with my ex because of lack of trust.

428
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,770
I don't want us to repeat the same mistake.

429
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,370
I don't know if you believe me or not,

430
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,380
but...

431
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,450
but I really like you.

432
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,250
I've liked you since we started texting each other.

433
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,930
I like your honesty,

434
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,490
so that I don't have to think too much.

435
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,930
I want to continue our relationship.

436
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,100
Should we try to get to know each other better?

437
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,530
Can you be my girlfriend?

438
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:11,730
What's wrong?

439
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,210
Why aren't you saying anything?

440
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,410
I couldn't find the words.

441
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,050
But...

442
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,140
Fine.

443
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,730
From now on,

444
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,210
I'll try to stay calm.

445
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,410
And...

446
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,690
trust each other like you said.

447
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,650
Yes.

448
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,330
Then we're officially dating now.

449
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,050
Why are you crying?

450
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,970
I'm just so touched.

451
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,490
Don't cry.

452
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:34,330
[Mom: Your dad and I are going to pray all night. The signal here is bad.
It's inconvenient to contact you. We'll see you at the wedding tomorrow.
Em and I have arranged everything for the wedding. Don’t worry.

453
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,690
What?

454
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,620
Praying all night?

455
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:40,530
Yes.

456
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,970
Why are you suddenly praying all night?

457
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:47,850
Let's see...

458
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,340
Did you

459
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,620
call Aunt Bua?

460
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,850
I did,

461
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:58,970
but she didn't pick up.

462
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,090
I have an idea.

463
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,650
Let's go find the wedding staff.

464
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,610
The wedding is tomorrow night.

465
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,570
So they should be here tonight to set up.

466
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,370
We'll tell them that the wedding is cancelled

467
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,530
in case they do useless work.

468
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:20,890
Sure.

469
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:21,970
Good idea.

470
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,650
Let's go.

471
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,100
Wait.

472
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,050
I changed my mind.

473
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:38,970
I think

474
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,130
we should just get married and end all of this.

475
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,660
Then we don't have to worry anymore.

476
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,330
-What?
-What?

477
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:44,850
That's right.

478
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:46,450
That's it.

479
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,570
I'm going to sleep now.

480
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,890
Bye. Good night. Good night.

481
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:50,930
Sis!

482
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:51,610
Sis!

483
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,490
-Mei!
-Mei!

484
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,140
Mei!

485
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,010
What the hell?

486
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:04,650
Mei.

487
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:05,570
Where are you?

488
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:06,820
The wedding is about to begin.

489
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,170
Tob.

490
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,370
My stomach hurts.

491
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,850
It's killing me.

492
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,210
What's wrong?

493
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:13,650
Stomachache?

494
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,490
Should I cancel the wedding?

495
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,100
No, no...

496
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,610
Did you wear the dress I picked for you?

497
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:22,650
Yes.

498
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,690
I'm wearing it.

499
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:24,690
Why?

500
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,650
Oh, nothing.

501
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,450
How about this?

502
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,610
You and Boss go greet the guests first.

503
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,890
I'll be right back.

504
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,090
Em, that will do.

505
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,770
Are you preparing another big show?

506
00:31:58,970 --> 00:31:59,540
What are you doing?

507
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,010
You'll find out soon.

508
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:37,850
Dad.

509
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,250
Mom.

510
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,410
Sure.

511
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:47,770
Good idea.

512
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,620
Let's go.

513
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:04,690
[Aunt Bua: If you don't want a fake wedding,
call me. I know everything.
But don't tell anyone else.
I want to give Tob a surprise at the wedding.]

514
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:05,970
Wait.

515
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:08,810
I changed my mind.

516
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,010
I think

517
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,930
we should just get married and end all of this.

518
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,690
Then we don't have to worry anymore.

519
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,210
-What?
-What?

520
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,330
You...

521
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,450
Mom.

522
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,250
You deserve it

523
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,820
for hiding from me.

524
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,900
Mom, I'm sorry.

525
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,090
I'm sorry, Aunt Bua.

526
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,770
Don't hide it from us anymore.

527
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,889
Love is love.

528
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,690
I'm happy that you two love each other.

529
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,330
As a mother,

530
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,090
I just want my child to be happy.

531
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,170
Don't worry about anything else, okay?

532
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,449
Mom.

533
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,179
You don't have to put on a show.

534
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,940
I wanted to get mad at you too.

535
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,050
Why didn't you discuss the marriage with mom and dad?

536
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,300
You know what?

537
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,370
I've always wanted to plan these things for you.

538
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:14,740
-The ring!
-The ring!

539
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:18,610
Yes.

540
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,090
The ring.

541
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,210
Surprised, huh?

542
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:32,610
-You scumbag!
-Sister!

543
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,130
-Mei!

544
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:35,810
Ah.

545
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:37,770
What's wrong?

546
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,170
I knew it.

547
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,170
Mom, can you really accept that

548
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,820
Boss and I love each other.

549
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,170
Is there anything I can't accept?

550
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:33,210
I'm so happy. I can totally accept it.

551
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:42,980
Bua.

552
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,410
Lower your voice.

553
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,250
You make them too nervous.

554
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,650
I can accept it too.

555
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:57,130
♫We move along the orbit and meet like a dream♫

556
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,770
♫Light up each other♫

557
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,780
♫In a universe full of love♫

558
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,340
Why did you pretend to be married?

559
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,890
Did you hire me to play along?

560
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,690
I was just kidding. I wanted to surprise them.

561
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,530
Thank you very much.

562
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:29,810
You're welcome.

563
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,930
Aunt Bua, you know what's going on, right?

564
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,610
Let's work together.

565
