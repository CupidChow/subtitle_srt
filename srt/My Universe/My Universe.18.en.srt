[Previous Episode]

22
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,640
Bangkok?

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
You guys do this every time, huh?

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,280
Why?

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Why what?

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,160
Why be nosy?

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,160
I don't really get along with Tod.

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,280
He's kind of pitiful, you know.
His family went bankrupt

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,120
and had to move here in the mid-year.

30
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,240
Korn, you can handle this?

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,640
Kun, maybe you should take a brake.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,680
Alright.

33
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,640
Okay, where are you stuck?

34
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,760
This question here, bro.
I feel like I can do it,

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,360
but I'm stuck on the method.

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,240
Why not skip it for now?

37
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,160
But if I do, I might not be able to come back to it.

38
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,040
Try this.

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,080
Calm down,

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,920
focus your mind,

41
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,000
channel your thoughts through your pulse points

42
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,520
to the crevices in your brain.

43
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,760
What?

44
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,800
Found the right point yet?

45
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,280
No, Bro. What kind of technique is this?

46
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,600
If you haven't found it, try here.

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,240
Did it work?

48
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,040
Not this approach,

49
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,560
rethink it.

50
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,800
But you're close.

51
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,360
I’ll test another pulse point.

52
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,360
Is the answer 27?

53
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,480
Yes.

54
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,920
You nailed it.

55
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,960
That was amazing.

56
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,760
Now, try the rest.

57
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:00,320
Solving math problems needs focus, don't let distractions sway you.

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,160
Got it?

59
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,480
You use this trick often?

60
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,520
Nope,

61
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,160
just an idea I picked up from a movie.

62
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,600
-But it's incredible, Bro.
-Really?

63
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,800
Let’s move on.

64
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,760
What are you doing?

65
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,080
Pond showed me how to use the pulse for exam questions.

66
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,120
That's weird.

67
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,240
Believe it or not, it works.
Like tapping into the brain using the pulse.

68
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,440
Sounds crazy.

69
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,480
Believe it or not.

70
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,240
But I think Pond has a special interest in you, right?

71
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,200
Maybe he thinks I'm slow.

72
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,440
Today my brain is on the fritz.

73
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,600
I'm not used to his style.
It's different from when you teach me.

74
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,800
You've been pretty quiet.

75
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,480
Something up?

76
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,120
Nope.

77
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,440
Then why didn't Tod show up for Pond's first session?

78
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,120
Not sure, I called early, but no response.

79
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,720
Is there something you want to confess to me?

80
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,600
I know about your secret sessions with just you two.

81
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,240
Well... you always seem lazy,

82
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,480
preferring to sleep early.

83
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,560
You never wake up when I call.

84
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,720
You're not up to something else with him, are you?

85
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,480
What do you mean by something else?

86
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,880
I don’t know. You seem bothered he didn't show today.

87
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,440
I'm just indifferent.

88
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,720
If he doesn't come to tutor because of Pond, just let it be.

89
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,800
He seems a bit over the top.

90
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
You don't like Tod, huh?

91
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,080
Yeah, I guess.

92
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,960
Why? What's wrong with Tod?

93
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,440
Do we need a reason to dislike someone?

94
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,560
Can't we just not vibe with them?

95
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,640
But aside from us,

96
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,080
Tod doesn't really have friends, you know.

97
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,960
What’s that?

98
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,919
Sereen Works!

99
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,640
For healthier skin and less acne.

100
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,000
-And mine?
-Go get your own.

101
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,160
Just kidding. Here you go.

102
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,600
Why's yours that color?

103
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,520
This one's for acne-prone skin.

104
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,280
If your skin is sensitive, use green.

105
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,160
Thanks!

106
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,440
Who said I bought you free.

107
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,120
You owe me noodles next time.

108
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,400
Want some noodles?

109
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,400
Yeah, same stall.

110
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,680
Got this for you guys,

111
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,880
as a sorry for missing the tutoring session.

112
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,720
Hey, thanks, man.

113
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
Did you split the veggies and meatballs for us?

114
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,480
That's cool.

115
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,920
Yeah, so Korn doesn't have to.

116
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,960
He's always sorting them out.

117
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,000
-Be right back.
-Alright.

118
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,160
Korn!

119
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,880
Korn!

120
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,600
Korn...

121
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,200
What's wrong with you now?

122
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,120
Something wrong?

123
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,880
I just can't stand Tod.

124
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,800
What did Tod do wrong?

125
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,520
You think what he's doing is okay?

126
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,560
He's trying to apologize by buying us lunch.

127
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,560
Don't be biased.

128
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,640
He even got our orders right, separated and all.

129
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,760
Shouldn't we count him as a friend?

130
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,200
But it's never been an issue for me.

131
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,400
This is just too much.

132
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,240
You're... being too much now.

133
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,040
Too much how?

134
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,000
Let’s not fight over something like this.

135
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,720
You don't see this as a big deal?

136
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,840
I understand.

137
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,840
It might not be a problem for you,

138
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,880
but you're stirring up trouble too.

139
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,880
Okay, I get it.

140
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,200
Okay what?

141
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,160
You see you're siding with someone else now?

142
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,200
Seems like Tod matters more to you than me.

143
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,040
-You get that, right?
-What?

144
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,280
But I still care about you the same.

145
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,320
How could I value others over my own brother?

146
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,240
What's eating you?

147
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,680
Korn!

148
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,760
Let's not clash over this.

149
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,920
What's up? You look so grumpy.

150
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,760
What´s going on?

151
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,480
Did you argue with Kun?

152
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,120
Right?

153
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,280
Nah!

154
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,040
Just typical brother stuff...

155
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,280
From the looks, I'm sure you're angry.

156
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,960
Are you angry?

157
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,200
Come on, why are you pissed off?

158
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,920
Hungry pissed!

159
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,240
Want to grab something to eat outside?

160
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,800
-Huh?
-Yeah.

161
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,240
I'm free this afternoon.

162
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,720
But I've got class, Bro.

163
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
Skip it.

164
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,760
What kind of teacher encourages skipping?

165
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,200
Oh, I'm just a tutor.

166
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,720
You're like a little brother to me.

167
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,800
If my sibling is stressed,

168
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,960
it's my job to help them chill, right?

169
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,520
Is that right?

170
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,000
What do you want to eat?

171
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,480
I'm your Sugar Daddy today,

172
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll treat you.

173
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,400
Interested huh?

174
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,880
Hurry up! Let’s go!

175
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,160
Ouch, my back!

176
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,080
Grab your stuff, let's move.

177
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,120
You good?

178
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,840
Ready?

179
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,200
[Kun]

180
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,400
It's just about a bowl of noodles.

181
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,080
Do I look that foolish?

182
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,320
Nope,

183
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,600
but this could be jealousy or possessiveness, you know?
Two different things.

184
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,880
How's jealousy different from possessiveness?

185
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,920
Jealousy's like not wanting him to drift away from you,

186
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,240
wanting him all to yourself.

187
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,760
That's jealousy.

188
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,680
And possessiveness...

189
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,560
is not letting anyone even get close to him,

190
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,600
like reserving him just for someone you like.

191
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,640
Hey, since I ditched class today,

192
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,160
how about you tutor me?

193
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,120
Sure!

194
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,600
Just us like this...

195
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,720
will Kun be bothered if he knows?

196
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,040
Forget about him!

197
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,040
Kun's smart enough. He doesn't need extra help to ace tests.

198
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,240
Okay.

199
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
Page 145.

200
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,480
Pond, can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

201
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,040
What made you come back to study here?

202
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,080
Was it tough over there?

203
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,320
With your overseas degree,

204
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,480
you could've landed a great job easily.

205
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,720
Plus, with your Mandarin skills...

206
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,160
That'd be a big advantage.

207
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,160
Actually, it wasn't that bad there.

208
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,680
It was pretty good, like you said.

209
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,840
But I made my choice...

210
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,760
I wanted to come back home.

211
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,960
Can we really leave a place we think is good?

212
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,280
Does being here feel that bad?

213
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,680
Not exactly.

214
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,040
I'm quite happy here.

215
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,240
Then why think of leaving if it's nice here?

216
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,960
Just felt like going there could be more thrilling.

217
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,640
It's the same.

218
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,440
Everyone has their reasons,

219
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,839
good or bad.

220
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,800
In the end, it is their choice, not ours.

221
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,360
Honestly, I can't imagine myself without Kun.

222
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,320
It's like now.

223
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,800
Just joking.

224
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,720
At first, couldn't imagine you two apart.

225
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
But now, I can a little bit.

226
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,360
I'm scared, Bro.

227
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,920
Scared of what?

228
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,360
Dunno. Just scared.

229
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,880
Afraid the others will pass the exam and you won't?

230
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,520
Or maybe I should switch up my tactics.

231
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,840
What tactics?

232
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,920
This tactic.

233
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,080
This is your tactic to acing the exam.

234
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,680
Hit the book!

235
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,480
Hello!

236
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,840
Where are you at, Mom?

237
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,520
At a party.

238
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,440
When you coming back?

239
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,840
I'm starving.

240
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,080
There's food in the fridge, heat it up.

241
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,080
And... Kun?

242
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,640
Kun said he's coming from the library.

243
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,280
He tried calling, but you didn't pick up.

244
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
Kun said you skipped class this afternoon.

245
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,960
Where'd you go?

246
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,680
Never mind, gonna keep studying.

247
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,320
You alright being home alone?

248
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,560
This one is tough.

249
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,880
Not really. Let me have a look.

250
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,480
This one?

251
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,520
You can do it.

252
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,680
You've done it before.

253
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,240
Think carefully.

254
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,440
Take your time.

255
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,400
Can we take a ten-minute break?

256
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,960
Sure,

257
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,200
need a drink or something from the fridge?

258
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,600
Nah, I'm good.

259
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,480
[Asked me to join a study, but why are you only sleeping?]

260
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Pond, let’s post a story.

261
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,080
What are you doing?

262
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,320
Nothing, bro.

263
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,600
Posting stuff like this will lead to misunderstandings.

264
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Just playing, don't be serious.

265
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,280
[Kun liked your post]

266
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,800
[Post was deleted]

267
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,280
Hey, why'd you delete it?

268
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,280
Don't want people getting the wrong idea,

269
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,320
thinking I've got a private tutor.

270
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,840
I think we should continue tutoring.

271
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,720
Korn!

272
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,840
I'm glad to see you happy today.

273
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,280
Pond!

274
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,000
What’s wrong with you?

275
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,680
Korn!

276
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,000
You like me too, right?

277
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,000
I think you should head out now.

278
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,360
Why?

279
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,520
You like me, I like you, right?

280
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,640
This isn't right.

281
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Let go...

282
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,960
Let me go.

283
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,720
If you don't, I'll tell Mom.

284
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,280
You psycho, huh?

285
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,080
Look!

286
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,880
Listen up,

287
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,160
If this gets out to your mom or others,

288
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,920
you won't be the only one seeing this clip.

289
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,120
Do you think fish can cry?

290
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,560
Why such a strange question?

291
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,000
Just wondering if fish can feel sad enough to cry like us.

292
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,400
Not sure,

293
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,440
but even if they could, it'd be invisible, right?

294
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,600
Being deeply sad without anyone noticing,
that's rough, isn't it?

295
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,960
What did your parents say...

296
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,680
Umm...

297
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,560
Stay calm, okay?

298
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,160
Let's discuss gently with them.

299
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,080
Don't overthink it.

300
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,280
You're having bad luck, man!

301
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,360
You need to release some fish.

302
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,520
9 temples, 9 fish at each one.

303
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,520
It'll turn your luck around.

304
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,960
-Darn it! For real?
-Yeah!

305
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,080
-Okay, I'll give it a go. Thanks!
-Remember to do it.

306
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,120
-Can you read mine too?
-Sure!

307
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Show me your palm.

308
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,600
When's your birthday?

309
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,480
March 17th, 2007.

310
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,880
Birth time?

311
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,800
6:07 AM. He came into the world just five minutes apart...

312
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,680
-Wow, that's something.
-What's something?

313
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,760
Korn, looks like fortune's smiling on you.
You seem to travel a lot.

314
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,560
Travel a lot? What’s that?

315
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,080
You're destined to be a traveler and you'll journey far.

316
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,280
Completely different from Kun.

317
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,720
What about Kun's destiny?

318
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,040
Seems like you two might take different paths.

319
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,560
You're meant to travel, Kun not so much.

320
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,280
Kun's more likely to stay put.

321
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,240
But that's not a bad thing.

322
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,120
If you roam, you'll find success,
score big opportunities,

323
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,920
So, separating might be better for us?

324
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,400
Is that it?

325
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,480
♫Do you know how hard it is?♫

326
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:35,960
♫Countless millennia, not knowing when we'll meet similar stars.♫

327
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,680
♫Do you know, with just a blink of an eye, just once,♫

328
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,600
♫how much the universe and my life can change.♫

329
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:57,400
♫You transform the misty air into the sweet scent of flowers.♫

330
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,040
♫You change the silent stars into those from my dreams,♫

331
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,480
What do you want?

332
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,400
Did the exam go well?

333
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,080
I got rid of that video, you know.

334
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,960
Best of luck!

335
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,720
Pond suddenly returned to China.

336
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,600
Don’t you find that weird?

337
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,280
I don’t know.

338
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,280
Did he tell you anything?

339
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,880
You were with him last time.

340
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,719
I don’t know either. He must have his reasons.
Don’t worry about it.

341
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,840
You also...

342
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,520
don’t overthink about the fortune-telling.

343
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,880
Palm readers are just guessing, right?

344
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,159
I didn’t like being told that either.

345
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,440
Kun,

346
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,000
can I ask you something? I've asked before.

347
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,840
I just want to see if your answer's changed.

348
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,920
You're anxious about the exam, right?

349
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,960
Yeah, because I'm sure you'll pass.

350
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,920
Suddenly, I saw you and Tod wandering around Bangkok.

351
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,040
I couldn’t see myself there.

352
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,880
Don't know why.

353
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,440
If I don't make it, will you still go?

354
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,120
If you don’t pass,

355
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,360
I won't go.

356
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,640
I know about you and Tod's kiss.

357
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,520
-You saw it?
-Yes.

358
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,360
But I don’t mind, you know.

359
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,680
I'm sorry for...

360
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,480
Stop saying sorry like it's just your issue.

361
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,840
The real issue is here, with me.

362
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,120
Then why didn't you say you saw it?

363
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,000
I was just afraid, scared that Tod was coming between us.

364
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,840
I'm sorry,

365
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,000
but I'm also confused.

366
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,480
I don't know what to feel.

367
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,880
You don't have to apologize.

368
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,880
I just...

369
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,680
I can't even explain what this crap feeling is.

370
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,240
Am I...

371
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,840
jealous of my own brother?

372
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,160
Or am I already a psycho?

373
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,800
You are not jealous of me,

374
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,960
but just worried.

375
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,720
Come on, hug me.

376
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,960
I'm sorry for being possessive like this,

377
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,920
but I really can't picture myself without you.

378
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,600
I'm sorry too for hiding things.

379
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,880
I've never been one to hide stuff from you.

380
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,760
You don't have to go that far.

381
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:08,680
♫You transform the misty air into the sweet scent of flowers.♫

382
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:16,480
♫You change the silent stars into those from my dreams,♫

383
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,440
Thank you so much.

384
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,280
Little puppies!

385
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,200
Kun! Korn! Over here!

386
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,360
Come here!

387
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,120
Today's a day off, you know.

388
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,960
Why the early hustle?

389
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,560
That school in Bangkok already called.

390
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,720
-They told you the results?
-Precisely!

391
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,560
You both aced the exams!

392
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,080
Shit, really, Mom?

393
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,280
Watch your language!

394
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,720
Shit, Mom! I made it!

395
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,600
Yay! We did it!

396
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,240
Tod, I passed the exam.

397
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,960
What about you?

398
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,720
Let's take this.

399
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,680
Really?

400
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,240
Won't it be too heavy?

401
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,720
No,

402
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,280
I need it for when I miss Mom.

403
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,360
Better keep it here for Mom to look at when she's missing us.

404
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,120
Rght, Mom?

405
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,000
Pictures won't be as good as driving to see your kids in Bangkok.

406
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,400
Well,

407
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,640
let's find out who gets homesick first, you guys or me.

408
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,680
Who’s this?

409
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,480
Look who wore glasses.

410
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:22,320
[Don't lose hope just yet. It's alright if it didn't work out there. There are other places to apply, and I'll retake the exam with you. I really want you to join me in Bangkok for studies.]

411
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,240
What are you doing, Mom?

412
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,680
Just sorting out a dorm for you guys.

413
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,040
Everything alright?

414
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,920
Mom!

415
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,240
What if I don't want to study in Bangkok?

416
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,240
Would that upset you?

417
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,320
Why would it?

418
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,920
I'm not sure.

419
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,880
Suddenly, I feel like...

420
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,840
I need to live life on my own terms.

421
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,080
And it makes me think...

422
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,600
maybe the best thing for Korn...

423
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,720
is if we go our separate ways.

424
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,840
Hey...

425
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,840
what's this all about?

426
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,680
You don't want to go with me that much?

427
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,280
I told you I'm serious, not playing.

428
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,640
Why do you think it's a joke?

429
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,840
I just wanted to try applying. Tod suggested it.

430
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,920
So, you're saying you want to study with him?

431
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,640
I was just applying for fun.

432
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,280
So now, what's it gonna be? Are you in or out?

433
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,280
[Tod]

434
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,880
Pick up.

435
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,520
Tell him you chose me.

436
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,400
Korn, can you not pressure me?

437
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,200
Didn't we promise to stick together?

438
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,960
I'm not leaving you,

439
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,760
but I...

440
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,320
[You can stop trying. My grades won't cut it for the other school either. I should just stay here for my studies].

441
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,840
I don't want to go to Bangkok anymore.

442
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,560
Seriously? Why?

443
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,880
What was the point of all this effort?

444
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,360
Deep down, I didn't want to go from the start.

445
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,600
Plus, I'm tired of always trying to please you.

446
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,520
Is this about Tod? Is he the reason?

447
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,080
I told you, nobody's making me do anything,

448
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,120
but I'm not going.

449
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,280
Fine, I get it. You don't want to go.

450
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,240
Korn, it's time you grow up.

451
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,360
You can't keep controlling me.

452
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,800
Grow up? How can you even say that?

453
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,000
When will I be grown enough to understand that future matters more than just one guy?

454
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,080
I wouldn't be mad if you said you're staying for Tod.

455
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,200
I can't believe you'd let me down like this.

456
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,120
Tod doesn't think of me that way.

457
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,320
But you applied to the other school...

458
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,880
because of him, right?

459
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,760
Didn't you?

460
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,640
Now he's staying, you want to stay too, huh?

461
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,160
Fine,

462
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,400
if you're not going,

463
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,280
neither am I.

464
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,080
What the hell are you doing?

465
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,440
Korn, what on earth are you doing?

466
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,760
Korn, stop this!

467
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,240
I personally sent Kun's scores in.

468
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,040
I've been aware of this issue for a while.

469
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,840
We need to stop pointing fingers; it's us who end up hurt.

470
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,320
Mom, I've made up my mind.

471
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,720
I'm not leaving.

472
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,360
I'm staying right here.

473
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,800
I'll keep studying here till high school's over.

474
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,080
Hey,

475
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,120
you can't just decide that.

476
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,080
Are you really throwing away everything we worked for?

477
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,040
Mom,

478
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,720
I'm sorry...

479
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,960
for letting you down,

480
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,720
for not keeping my promise,

481
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,680
and for causing you pain.

482
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,000
A wound like this can't hurt me.

483
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,920
But if you need someone to blame,

484
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,640
you just blame me.

485
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,240
I'm at fault...

486
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,880
for causing a rift between two siblings who never fought.

487
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,000
But you said we should stop blaming others.

488
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,360
We don't need to pin this on anyone.

489
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,200
Korn... if Kun's not going to Bangkok,

490
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,160
do you still want to go?

491
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,680
I think...

492
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,720
Well,

493
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,720
If you can't imagine life...

494
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,800
without him,

495
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,880
just create that image yourself.

496
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,880
Look at me and your dad.

497
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,440
I used to think like that.

498
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,240
Back when I was with your dad,

499
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,120
I thought I couldn't live without him,

500
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,920
But, you know, life moves on. Now, here I am.

501
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,800
Perhaps it's time for you guys to explore your own paths.

502
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,600
I don't want your efforts to go to waste.

503
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,800
And about Kun...

504
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,800
I don't want him to be burdened

505
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,320
or stress more than this.

506
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,320
We all have the right to choose.

507
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,400
Kun doesn't want to go because of Tod, Mom.

508
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,800
Are you okay with that?

509
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,080
Why did you say that?

510
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,760
Alright, I've made up my mind.

511
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,800
I won't give up my opportunity.

512
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,400
Whoever chooses to give up,

513
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,760
that's their decision.

514
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,760
I'm heading out.

[3 months later.]

549
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,240
Hey there, my little pup! What's going on?

550
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,280
Mom, I'm out of money again.

551
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,920
Can you transfer me another thousand or two?

552
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,520
Didn't I just send you money like two days back?

553
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,640
Friends keep inviting me to eat fancy food,

554
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,480
and it's all expensive here.

555
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,000
How can I not run out of money?

556
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,280
Eating good food is already good.

557
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:01,880
Better to spend on eats than throw money away on nonsense.

558
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,400
Alright, I'll send it over.

559
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,680
Thanks, Mom.

560
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,080
Oh, Pond dropped by recently.

561
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:13,640
Huh?

562
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,360
Thought he moved away.

563
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,160
He brought a card.

564
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,120
Huh?

565
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,000
Pond's getting married?

566
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,520
No, he's becoming a monk.

567
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,960
How come he is getting married?

568
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,040
Ever since I've known him,

569
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,120
I never saw him with a girlfriend,

570
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,000
seems unlikely...

571
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,040
Talking about someone becoming a monk could jinx it.

572
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,720
True, my bad.

573
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,080
Apologies to the sacred ones.

574
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,920
Mom... you're funny.

575
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,800
Was it funny?

576
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,880
I miss you, Mom. When are you visiting?

577
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,360
By the way, I finish exams next week,

578
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,720
but might not come home this summer.

579
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,160
Planning a trip with friends.

580
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,120
But you still have a week off, right?

581
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,400
Eager to travel, huh?

582
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,000
Nice, take it easy.

583
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,120
And don't be too bossy with friends.

584
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,800
Don't worry, Mom.

585
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,560
I've got it under control.

586
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,520
And...

587
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,560
have you called Kun lately?

588
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,400
Not yet.

589
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,000
Call him when you're free.

590
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,680
He's been quiet lately;

591
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,200
it seems he was upset about something.

592
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,160
maybe he fought with Tod?

593
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,640
He can handle his own drama.

594
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,560
But still, give him a call.

595
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,480
Nah, I'd rather not.

596
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,960
You're something else.

597
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,760
I'm going to dorm now.

598
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,320
Just don't forget that transfer, okay?

599
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,600
Alright.

600
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:03,480
I love you, Korn.

601
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,360
Love you too, Mom.

602
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,120
Battery died?

603
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,960
Finally decided to charge it, huh?

604
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,560
So you can finally call me.

605
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,080

Nick,

606
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,280
how are you today?

607
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,400
Super tired,

608
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,720
but crispy pork rice would make me better.

609
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,920
You’re eating alone, huh?

610
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,640
Let me know when you come to Khon Kaen, I'll treat you.

611
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,800
