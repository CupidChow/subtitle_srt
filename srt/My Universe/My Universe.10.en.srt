[Previous episode]
I broke up with Noll.

21
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,240
What’s this?

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,640
It´s called Kiam Boey Moo Sab.
(Minced pork with sour plum soup)

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,560
Damn it!

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,800
Jeng: Hey!
Meen: What’s it to you?

25
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,800
Bring it on!

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,000
Please, bro!

27
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,039
You're good at smoking.
Want something else to smoke?

28
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,720
Hey, the door isn't locked.
I'm coming in.

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,039
You've seen mine.

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,440
Would like to switch from frying french fries
to frying sausages today?

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,080
Noll!

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,240
Fuck!

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,960
Whoa, you scared me to death.

34
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,160
Did you finish your chat with him?

35
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,079
Yep.

36
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,000
Where’s Jeh-Mek?

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,160
Jeh-Mek said she was going to rest upstairs.

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,440
Maybe for a moment.

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,480
When we've been together for so long,

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,040
why's it so tough to just say 'sorry'?

41
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,000
And if he says sorry just like that,

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,160
You'd just forgive him easily?

43
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,560
He's never apologized to me.

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,960
Everytime he calls,
I'm always happy to receive his calls.

45
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,280
This time though,
I feel I've had enough.

46
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,320
If it were me,
I'd probably feel the same.

47
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,520
You speak like someone who's never been in love.

48
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,160
You should learn to love yourself.

49
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,040
You know, it's not just him that hurts you;

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,160
you're doing this to yourself too.

51
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,560
Do you realize that?

52
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,480
Do I look like one who doesn't love myself?

53
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,560
If you truly cared for yourself,
you wouldn't have let yourself get drunk like yesterday.

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,079
Remember?

55
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,840
Hey, I wanted some advice,
not a sermon.

56
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,440
With your attitude,
he probably sees you as a plaything.

57
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,120
You mad at me now?

58
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,200
I just told you the truth.

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,520
I wanted you to console me,
not to remind me of my foolishness.

60
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,560
I know I'm an easy target,

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,920
but you've never been in love, Jeng?

62
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,000
If you had,  you'd get it.

63
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,600
Noll and I have been through a lot.

64
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,840
Deep down, I still care about him.

65
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,440
But love shouldn't cause pain to the other.

66
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,640
Did you eat anything yet?

67
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,440
Not yet.

68
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,440
Start by loving yourself first.

69
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,680
Eat up.
I bought it just for you.

70
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,440
Jeng: Delicious, right?
Meen: Yeah, delicious.

71
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,680
Do the restaurants use this brand?

72
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,680
Yes. If it's already good,
there’s no need to change or add anything.

73
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,600
Kinda like love.

74
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,159
If it were good,
you wouldn't have suffered like this.

75
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,520
Jeng, thank you...
for caring about my feelings.

76
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,880
Hey bro,
what's that on your face?

77
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,080
Where?

78
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,800
Here it is.

79
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,640
Here?

80
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,680
Jeng: Yeah.
Meen: Where it is?

81
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,640
Ouch!

82
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,280
Ouch, that stings!

83
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,560
Ouch, it hurts!
Why’re you pranking me, Jeng?

84
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,240
I haven't pranked you yet.

85
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,560
You made me rub my eyes!

86
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,280
You did your own thing.
I didn’t do anything to you.

87
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,520
My eyes!
Can you help me rinse them, Jeng?

88
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,760
Jeng: Over there to the left.
Meen: Where?

89
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,800
Jeng: No, your other left!
Meen: Huh?

90
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,360
Meen: Seriously, where?
Jeng: Right here.

91
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880
Jeng, I'm losing my patience!
where is it?

92
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,880
Just keep going!

93
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,120
Jeng, it hurts.

94
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,120
Meen: Where’s it, Jeng?
Jeng: It’s right here.

95
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,680
Damn it, where is it?

96
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,240
Meen: Feeling better now?
Jeng: Still stings a bit.

97
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,000
Hey Meen, what's up?

98
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,080
Seems like love blinds people, ma'am!

99
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,520
Huh?
What happened to his eyes?

100
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,680
Please give him lessons, ma’am!

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,680
Your chef has bullied me.

102
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,520
Ouch, it's stinging!

103
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,840
How did you two get so close then?

104
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,320
We didn't.

105
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,360
I tricked him into rubbing his eyes, ma'am.

106
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,560
I hope you won't fire me.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,800
I wanted people here to have bright eyes
after seeing their ex.

108
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,400
Hold on, Meen.
Did Noll come to see you?

109
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,680
Yes.

110
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,040
Alright, I'll leave you be.
Hope your talk goes well.

111
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,960
Thank you.

112
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,800
Thanks for everything, ma'am,
over these past days.

113
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,480
Thank you too.

114
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
No need to.
I didn’t do anything.

115
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,560
Hey, leave the dishes there.
 I'll handle them.

116
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
Let me help you.

117
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,280
I don't want any broken plates.

118
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,880
So, neither you nor Jeh-Mek trust my skills?

119
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,840
Anyway,
you can go take a shower first.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,960
I got you a toothbrush,
it's inside.

121
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,000
Hey, you didn't have to buy that for me.

122
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,560
I was planning to head back soon.

123
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,280
Hey, what is this?

124
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,559
Hey, why that look?

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,760
Never seen one before?

126
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,600
Of course I have!

127
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,440
I'm just confused,
did you get this for me?

128
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
So, are you going to use it?

129
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,720
You go ahead.
This isn’t my size.

130
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,120
Woah, are you bigger than mine?

131
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,920
Jeez!

132
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,200
Whatcha cooking?

133
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,480
Can I see?

134
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,520
Jeng: Right here? Now?
Meen: Hey, hey!

135
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,840
Don't stir me up!
I'm asking you seriously.

136
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,640
Someone ordered Kiam Buey.

137
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,240
Another bowl for you?

138
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,320
I eat it every day until my face is already plump.

139
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,400
It's delicious tho.

140
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,040
One more bowl, then!

141
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,240
The dish that Jeh-Mek and you made tastes different

142
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,760
Mine's better, right?

143
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,760
Each one has its own exquisiteness.

144
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,120
Wanna try making?
I'll give you the recipe.

145
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,760
Trust me,
it won't be the same elsewhere.

146
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,800
No thanks.
I even botch frying fries.

147
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,680
Rather watch you cooking.

148
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,280
If the bar ever closes,
how can I cook for you?

149
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,960
Good point!

150
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,480
What if it does shut down?

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,320
By the way, I heard from Jeh-Mek that
you're studying and working.

152
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,640
Why? Money's tight?

153
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,760
Why?
Wanna cover my tuition?

154
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,440
Just wondering.
Isn't it okay to ask?

155
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,120
Hoping to get to know me better, huh?

156
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,000
Just curious.

157
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
That’s why I’m asking.

158
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,360
What's your story?

159
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,720
I wanted real-world experience.

160
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,160
I'm really grateful to Jeh-Mek for letting me work here,
even though I haven't finished my studies.

161
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,320
Since coming here,
seen any oddball customers?

162
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,920
Yeah, one stands out.

163
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,720
Do tell!

164
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,760
You're pulling my leg again, right?

165
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,920
Don't forget my request!

166
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,720
What's that grin for?

167
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,560
Watching you cook is entertaining.

168
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,280
You’re almost perfect,
until you open your mouth.

169
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,560
Now you're just being annoying.

170
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,640
Your Kiam Buey's ready!

171
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,040
Cheers!

172
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,600
This is really tasty.
I'm loving it.

173
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,280
If you like it,
eat as much as you want

174
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,960
Eat until you feel good.

175
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,440
Do I look like I'm not feeling well?

176
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,160
Seriously?

177
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,520
Let’s eat.

178
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,080
Why are you calling?

179
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,120
I said I don't want to talk yet.

180
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,160
I need to talk, Meen.

181
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,000
I can't bear the thought of losing you, Meen!

182
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,680
I'm afraid of losing you in a way that you misunderstood me.

183
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,320
It's just not right.

184
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,040
Enough, Noll!

185
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,200
Meen, I'm drunk.

186
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,280
Then sleep it off!

187
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,640
Meet me,
or I'll be waiting all night.

188
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm tied up.

189
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,480
Do whatever you want.

190
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,600
Wait till morning if you like.

191
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,840
I've had enough.

192
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,360
Aren't you going to take a shower?

193
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,520
Oh, feeling out of sorts.

194
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,520
What are you doing?

195
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,000
Defending against your feet.

196
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,600
You've got a kicking habit when upset.

197
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,920
What if it's me next?

198
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,320
Damn you!

199
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,560
What's so damn funny?

200
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,560
My head's still throbbing.

201
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
It hurts a lot.

202
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,320
Is it your matter after all?

203
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,280
Go outside and breathe in the air.

204
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,840
Staying cooped up won't help your headache.

205
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,200
Get up!

206
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,440
Damn it!
Seriously!

207
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,000
Wait a sec!

208
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,280
Jeh-Mek wants me to apply cream.

209
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,240
Why?

210
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,880
She just said to use it.

211
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,560
Make you look dashing?
You're always behind the stove!

212
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,280
Let me see.
On this side... the other one.

213
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,800
On this side... the other side.

214
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,480
Jeng: Stop it, bro!

215
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,720
Jeng: Enough!

216
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
Do you know how to apply it?

217
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,800
You seem clueless.

218
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,640
Watch closely.
I'll show you.

219
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,200
Do like this!

220
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,560
Apply it slowly.

221
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,760
Hey, you should do the same.
See my fingers?

222
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,839
Use these two - the middle and ring.

223
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,520
Here, let me help you out.

224
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:38,080
Stay still!
See? It's easy.

225
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,880
What are you doing?

226
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,360
[Noll]

227
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,480
You're not going home anymore?

228
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,640
Oh, I'm going back today.

229
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,920
Just... felt like lingering.
I thought I'd stay a little longer.

230
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,160
And thanks for the shirt, by the way.

231
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,400
It's no big deal.

232
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,840
You know,
you're rarely out this long before.

233
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,840
Tell me what happened last night.

234
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,440
What happened?

235
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,560
Cut the act!

236
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,720
Remember, don't try to fool with a pro actor like me.

237
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,680
Noll came to see me here today.

238
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,480
Really?
All the way here?

239
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,560
Right.

240
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,800
He wanted me to back home.

241
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,280
But I told him I'd stay here,
then he left in a huff.

242
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,440
But he did ring me up again.

243
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,400
I just don't feel like going back.

244
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,200
This place feels safe for me now.

245
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,760
What did he tell you when you met?

246
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,480
He said I got him wrong.

247
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,560
And he was creating some model,
not cheating.

248
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,760
He was lying.
Creating a model in a pub. Really?

249
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,560
Can't buy that story.

250
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,040
I don’t know.

251
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,960
I didn't see it with my own eyes.
I don't know what to say.

252
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,560
Meen, are you thinking of going back to him?

253
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,120
Drop it!

254
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,200
Everyone’s seen it.
It’s become the talk of the town.

255
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,760
Darn it!  Guess I'll have to dig up some proof,
so you see the light.

256
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,120
When did I tell you that I was going back?

257
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,840
You might not voice it,
but your eyes give you away.

258
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,840
A few sweet words from him,
and I bet you'll run right back.

259
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,000
No,
not now at least.

260
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,800
Seen Jeh-Mek around?

261
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,200
Jeh-Mek?

262
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,120
She's inside, maybe!

263
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,640
What's going on with you both?

264
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,160
Guess he caught a bit of our convo,
he seems off.

265
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,680
Off?

266
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,520
He was mad at you?

267
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,160
Hold on, Meen!

268
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,600
Don't tell me there's something with you and Jeng.

269
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,960
I don’t know.

270
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,480
Porshe: Really? This is happening?
Meen: I don't know.

271
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,040
[Building lease agreement]

272
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,680
What's up, Jeng?

273
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,680
Where ya at?
Got something to discuss.

274
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,560
Um, I'm in the kitchen.

275
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,920
Why do you think Jeng sulks with me?

276
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,960
Yeah, that’s right.

277
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,480
Should I sort things out with him?

278
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,680
Maybe...

279
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,480
Sorting things or not,
get to the kitchen right now.

280
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,720
Meen: What?
Porshe: Now, quick!

281
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,920
Meen: What?
Porshe: Go, go!

282
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,280
Stay in the kitchen with Jeh-Mek.

283
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,320
Go, go, go!

284
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,760
Wait up!
Where do you think you're going, Noll?

285
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,280
Out of my way!
I need a word with him.

286
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,600
He's not up for it right now.

287
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,080
If not now, then when?

288
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,800
Let's clear things up.
If we’re going to split, just do it.

289
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,840
Alright,
let's hope this is the last of it.

290
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,720
Where's everyone?

291
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,120
Let’s talk first.

292
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,680
Why are you here?

293
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,120
I told you I'm not ready.

294
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,600
Not ready?
And when will you be ready?

295
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,160
Everyone else gets your time.
What about me, Meen?

296
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,000
You and other people are not the same.

297
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,720
Did you say you were drunk?

298
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,440
I'm trying to get your attention, Meen.

299
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,040
I want you to care more about me.

300
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,800
I don't want you to care about others.

301
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,480
Why the jealousy?

302
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,040
I  wish you'd go back to not damn caring me.

303
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,760
We're over.
Let me go.

304
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,920
I'm not breaking up.
Hell no!

305
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,600
Remember when you always hit me up first?
Look at our texts.

306
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,080
I'm not clingy;
I just care about what's mine. That includes you.

307
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,920
You're spouting crap!

308
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,000
You jerk!
What's gotten into you?

309
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,800
Noll,
what the hell are you up to?

310
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,560
You asshole!
Stop it!

311
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,800
Noll, stop it!
Get the hell out!

312
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,560
Let me go!

313
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,680
What's happening?

314
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,360
Excuse me!
Could you step outside for a sec?

315
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,080
I need to finish up with my boyfriend.

316
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,880
You should go.

317
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,120
I don't care if you're done.
This is a kitchen, my workspace.

318
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,960
If you want to make out,
find another spot.

319
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,240
Why are you guys doing here?

320
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,840
Why are you turning around?

321
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,320
Tearing up?

322
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,760
Is everything okay?

323
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,520
We weren't making out here.

324
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,960
I knew it.

325
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,360
If so, you wouldn't look like this.

326
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,440
You’d better go outside first.

327
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,880
I promise I won't tell anyone about this.

328
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,920
Thought you'd be in the kitchen?

329
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,040
Taking a brake now.

330
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,880
Always know what I need, huh?

331
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,720
That’s right.
It's wild, always reading your mind.

332
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,280
So, you really break up with him?

333
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,960
If only it was that easy.

334
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,080
But he seems very persistent.

335
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,200
We've all got choices.

336
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,840
I've already made mine.

337
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,440
Chose me, didn't you?

338
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,400
What was that?

339
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,160
Just kidding!
You’d better choose someone better.

340
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,520
So you'll get lucky in love for good.

341
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,480
Aren’t you not good?

342
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,840
You're puffing on my cig.

343
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,440
What kind of good person comforts
others by giving them cigarettes to smoke?

344
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,640
Your lungs can be damaged.

345
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,520
But since I've been here,
I've only been eating good food.

346
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Thanks for everything, Jeng.

347
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,560
This bar has become a safe zone for me.

348
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,320
Safe zone? How so?

349
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,160
Go find another place.

350
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,720
We're closing up.

351
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,040
True that.

352
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,080
Oh, I haven't asked you yet.

353
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,000
If the Jeh-Mek’s bar is closed?
where will you go?

354
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,280
Why asking?
Gonna tail me for more cigs?

355
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,400
Hey, quit acting like I'm some stranger.

356
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,960
Someone just need a boost, you know?

357
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,760
I don't know.

358
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,480
A break maybe.

359
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,200
A brake?

360
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Who will you spend it with?

361
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,480
Bro, this is definitely flirting.

362
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,160
I told you to flirt with someone good.

363
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,320
Why would you go after a guy like me
who's always in the kitchen?

364
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,160
You don't think I'm flirting with you, do you?

365
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,720
People like you wouldn’t like me.

366
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,760
I'm not well-educated, no fame, and no money.

367
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,920
How can I possibly afford your needs?

368
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:51,640
Sometimes my 'lucky in love' might just be
sharing a sweet meal with someone.

369
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,960
That could be.

370
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,440
What could?

371
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,600
Oh I don’t know.
You should go and end things up.

372
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,520
If it can't be the end,
I’ll be step in as your new boyfriend.

373
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,200
Huh?

374
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,360
I'm serious.

375
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,240
Being your new boyfriend may not be that hard.

376
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,000
Jeng!
[Genius!]

377
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:19,800
Yes?

378
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,360
No, I mean...
your plan is genius!

379
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,360
Sis,  what do you think is brewing there?

380
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,640
That’s right.
Seeing them makes my heart flutter.

381
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,760
Something might be happening.

382
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,920
I'm also intrigued.
Their chemistry is palpable;

383
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,200
Hopefully Meen will open up.

384
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,360
Hmm, I hope the same too.

385
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,160
Oh, Porsche,
you're a graphic wizard, right?

386
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,600
Jeh-Mek: Mind doing me a favor?
Porshe: Any help?

387
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,880
Is that... plum soup I smell?

388
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,640
For sure!

389
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,160
Here you go, sir!
Hope you enjoy it.

390
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,600
I thought this was just a bar,
just selling alcohol.

391
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,480
Didn't expect actual meals.

392
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,840
Normally, we rarely sell alcohol.

393
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,640
Mostly we sell for drunks
to have something hot to sober up.

394
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,880
That's why I hired an extra chef.

395
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,840
If this place shuts,
where will these drunks will go?

396
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,080
Let me try some!

397
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,360
Jeh-Mek!

398
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,120
Oh, Pias!

399
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,320
Did you come alone?

400
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,920
Em and the others are on their way.
I just came ahead to grab a table.

401
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,360
By the way, can I make a reservation for the entire week?

402
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,200
I'd like to savor the atmosphere
before it closes.

403
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,640
Oh gosh!
You're exaggerating.

404
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,400
Alright, I’ll take care of it.
Have a seat first!

405
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,680
Make yourself comfortable, sir.
I need to attend to others.

406
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,040
Sure, go ahead!

407
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,920
♫Staring at the screen, liking every picture of you on IG,♫

422
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,960
Looks like he's loving the food.

423
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,280
Certainly seems so.

424
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,440
Porsche, I own you one for the farewell event graphics!

425
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,880
If there's a guardian spirit listening,
make him change his mind.

426
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,440
So be it!

433

You've got to get it.
It's just how business goes.

434
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,920
Where'd Porsche run off to?
I saw him rushing out.

435
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,600
Headed to Huay Kwang.

436
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,960
For?

437
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,720
To meet up with Chang's godfather.

438
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,760
Chang's godfather.

439
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,520
Umm, suddenly, Mr. Prem wanted to chat with Jeh-Mek
about the lease.

440
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,880
The lease is up today,
but she's trying for a week's grace period.

441
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,320
Not sure if he’ll allow.

442
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,040
So, Porsche just sped off on this?

443
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,639
He thought the local spirit here might not be enough.

444
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,480
But with all these post-it notes,
the local spirit might support us.

445
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,400
Fingers crossed.

446
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,239
Hello, sir!

447
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
The food tastes good.

448
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,520
I didn't expect such a small bar to have delicious food.

449
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,480
No wonder people love it.

450
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,199
Meen: Mr. Prem please...
Prem: Wish you all success.

451
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,159
Jeh-Mek!

452
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,520
Everything’ll be fine.

453
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,400
Let's find a good spot nearby, alright?

454
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,280
If money's tight, I can ask my family for a loan.
Sounds good?

455
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,080
I won't let it close easily.

456
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,000
He mentioned to me that to lease
this place to some Chinese entrepreneur.

457
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,520
Because they gave a higher rental price.

458
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,440
But the city's flooded with Mala hotpots already.

459
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,800
They'll open another one here?

460
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,080
So, he asked if I was willing to pay a bit more.

461
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,120
Huh?

462
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,120
After trying our dishes and seeing the crowd,
he had second thoughts.

463
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,680
So, he's thinking of hiking the rent?

464
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,960
By how much?
Is it manageable?

465
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,600
Yes, it is.
I've already settled with him.

466
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,000
Wait, are those tears of fear?

467
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,240
Yes.

468
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,320
Oh, come on!

469
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,520
So, my job's still secure?

470
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,760
Yeah!

471
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,360
But we need to work harder, Jeng.

472
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,240
With the rent going up,
we've got to hustle more.

473
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,840
I’m on it.
come heaven or low water.

474
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,760
Hold on...
Isn't it wrong?

475
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,520
It's "come hell or high water"...

476
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,480
Something like that.

477
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,760
The one before means lazy.
Did you even attend school?

478
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,760
I just meant, I'm committed,
whether it's tough or easy.

479
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,800
As long as I have you.

480
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,080
Thank you both so much.
I really appreciate it.

481
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,720
By the way, where's Porsche?

482
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,440
He's off to Huai Khwang.

483
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,080
I've already prayed for you, ma'am.
If it works, give him offerings yourself.

484
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,960
Oh, for real?
Why do I have to make it?

485
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,480
I don’t know.
Maybe 'cause it's your bar?

486
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,440
Hoping that Mr. Prem
will deal with you better next time.

487
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:24,680
[Meen, I'm sorry.
How about we meet tomorrow?
Can you  give me another chance?]

488
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,080
Meen,
I thought you weren't coming.

489
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,520
I promised, didn't I?

490
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,320
You genuinely care that much?

491
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,720
You really love me like you said, right?

492
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,280
Yes, every word I typed,
I really meant it.

493
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,040
In the past,
I probably didn't pay much attention to you.

494
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,080
I might act like crap.

495
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,080
After giving it some thought,
apart from you, I truly have no one.

496
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,760
Do you still love me?

497
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,920
Of course!
Else I wouldn't be here.

498
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,520
Lovers just want to be the only one for each other.

499
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,720
You've always been my one and only.
That's why I can say I love you.

500
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,520
So, will you give me another chance?

501
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,240
Please!

502
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:12,720
Don't rush.
I've got a lot to clear up with you.

503
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,280
Especially regarding this.

504
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,760
I've got a couple more clips.

505
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,400
One from yesterday.
The guy there isn't the same as this.

506
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,440
How dare you say I'm the only one?

507
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,240
How dare you say you love me, Noll?

508
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,480
That's enough.
I don't want to hear your apologies again.

509
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,160
Let me find someone real.

510
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,160
Could we try this one more time?
Just one last time.

511
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,400
Fuck off!

512
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Enough, Noll!
You're not winning me back.

513
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,520
In the past, I gave in because
I truly loved you.

514
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,200
But now I've had enough.

515
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,400
Can you just let it be?

516
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,800
I came here today to end things with you.

517
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,640
Just go your own way,
I beg you.

518
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,960
♫Do you know how challenging it is?♫

519
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:46,440

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,160
♫You transform the misty air into the sweet scent of flowers.♫

Wanna have plum soup?

525
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,960
Comfort food for the brokenhearted?

526
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,560
Did you feel better after eating it earlier?

527
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,000
Not sure.

528
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,280
I guess so.

529
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:53,880
Damn!

530
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,480
Why do you look okay this time?

531
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,760
He tried to get back with you, right?

532
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,920
He did.

533
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,000
So I told him...

534
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,400
Fuck off!

535
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,800
Whoa, and his reply?

536
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,400
He said as I wish.

537
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,880
Don't expect to find real love.

538
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,720
Shit!
How dare he curse you like that?

539
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,720
That’s right.

540
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,560
It's weird. I'm not upset,
just... lighter.

541
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,240
As if a mountain was lifted off my chest.

542
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,880
Let me see,
what's left after you removed it?

543
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,880
Jeez! Your mind's always in the gutter.
Classic you.

544
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,240
But I've already seen what you’ve left.

545
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,640
Really!

546
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,880
Whoa, seriously?

547
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,760
Let me see yours then.

548
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,600
Release my hand first.

549
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,720
Fine.

550
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,040
Oh, gosh!

551
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,960
Just as vacant as yours.

552
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,080
So sad.

553
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,200
I need some time.

554
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,400
Time for what?

555
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,840
Are you gonna woo me or not?
Otherwise, I'll take the lead.

556
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,640
Chill out!

557
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,160
With this heat, what do you expect?

558
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,360
At this point, plum soup might not work.

559
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,800
Got plum ice cream, though.
Want some?

560
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,560
And loads more plum stuff
I want you to taste.

561
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,600
What's with you and plums?

562

Jeng: Hold up, man!
Meen: What now?

563
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,280
When you said to wait,
how long did you mean?

564
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,520
Not sure, but I'm starving.
Fetch me something.

565
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,440
On it, boss!
I'll go make it for you.

566
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,040
Jeng, get a grip.

567
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,200
Go, go, go...
Hurry up!

568
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,960
What's this drink?
It tastes off.

569
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,720
It's a Kiam Boey Moo Sab smoothie.

570
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,120
Ugh, take it back.

571
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,160
Kidding!
It's just plum

572
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,680
Plus some other fruits.
Drink up!

573
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,240
You still can't move on from plums.

574
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,880
Can´t you do anything else?

575
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,800
I heard you're loving it.
Recently became a plum enthusiast, huh?

576
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,280
Jeng: Who exactly can't move on?
Meen: Alright.

577
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,760
You ever cook anything not related to plums?

578
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,040
Actually, I have.
A dish that no one ever tasted it.

579
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,560
Really?
Mind if I try?

580
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,400
Wanna taste it here?

581
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,240
Why here?
Maybe in the kitchen later?

582
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,280
Well, this dish is best served... in bed.

583
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,800
Back to the naughty talk, huh?

584
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,440
Should I spray you with this drink?

585
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,280
If you spray me, I'll spray you with something else.

586
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,360
So naughty!

587
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,600
You told me that you've never made anyone taste it.

588
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,120
It means...

589
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,360
Exactly.
I've never dated anyone.

590
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,960
Plus, I´m still virgin.

591
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,600

592
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,720

How do you know
if drinking pineapple juice is beneficial?

595
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,960
The internet said so.

596
