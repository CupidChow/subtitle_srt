00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,500
I still have a lot.

185
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,780
I'm just kidding.

186
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,860
Is he not okay?

187
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,700
I'll be glad to see you date anyone.

188
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,780
But not him.

189
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,540
It's not because Korn is not good.

190
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,020
But if there are 100 people who like him,

191
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,940
then there will be 100 broken hearts.

192
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,220
Don't pursue a cold guy like him

193
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,780
with your pure heart.

194
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,140
Pursue a cold guy?

195
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,020
Are you scolding me?

196
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,220
Table number five!

197
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,340
Five is a bad number.

198
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,540
It represents bad luck.

199
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,580
It's a number that brings bad luck.

200
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,540
Table number five!

201
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,530
It's a bad luck number.

202
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,900
-Table number five!
-It's a number that brings bad luck.

203
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,980
Table number five.

204
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,860
Oh, my God!

205
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,580
Bud!

206
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,700
What a coincidence!

207
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,660
Bud isn't here.

208
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,620
No one here is called Bud.

209
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,730
Really?

210
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,100
Trust me.

211
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,890
No.

212
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,340
He's not Bud.

213
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,540
I'm here.

214
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,940
Where are you?

215
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,020
But I didn't see Bud.

216
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,620
Then I'll go to the toilet first.

217
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,780
My friend.

218
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,580
Calm down.

219
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,820
You haven't met him three times,

220
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,500
as the prophecy said.

221
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,020
Fong is not your soulmate yet.

222
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,620
He's not your soulmate yet.

223
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,220
Oh, no.

224
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,380
Who else can surpass him?

225
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,420
There's only one chance left.

226
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,780
What should I do?

227
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,300
[Mhok: You're at the restaurant, right? I'll come to you later
and give you your birthday present.]

228
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,140
Hello?

229
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,540
Mhok's coming to see me.

230
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,260
How can I get out?

231
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,580
Fong is still here.

232
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,220
What should I do?

233
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,900
What should I do?

234
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,260
[Mhok: Phat is drunk. I have to take care of him. I'm sorry.
You should go home first. See you tomorrow. I'll inform Bud about this.]

235
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,190
Oh, you.

236
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,620
Oh.

237
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,500
Hello.

238
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,540
Hello.

239
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,380
Are you Bud?

240
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,340
I'm Korn.

241
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,500
I'm Mhok's junior.

242
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,300
Oh.

243
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,140
Mhok can't make it today.

244
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,620
[Mhok: Bud, I can't come today. I'm sorry.
Let's talk tomorrow.]

245
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,160
I just got a message from him.

246
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,900
Here.

247
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,700
Did he ask you to bring it to me?

248
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,020
Yes.

249
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,220
He asked me to bring it.

250
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,980
Happy birthday.

251
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,100
Thank you.

252
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,420
I'll get going.

253
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,540
Bud.

254
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,940
Are you there?

255
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,620
Hey, Bud!

256
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,260
What are you doing?

257
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,420
Is someone in the restroom?

258
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,530
I'm looking for my soulmate.

259
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,140
Can you open the door for me?

260
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,700
I think we should open the door for him.

261
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,780
Keep quiet!

262
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,980
He might hear us.

263
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,380
We need to open the door for him.

264
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,860
Ouch!

265
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:42,980
[Fong] Hey!

266
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,700
What happened?

267
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,540
Are you okay?

268
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,740
Tell him I accidentally slipped.

269
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,340
Tell him that I accidentally slipped.

270
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,170
Tell him that I accidentally slipped.

271
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,060
Oh, no.

272
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,050
Tell him I'm pooping.

273
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,540
I am pooping.

274
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,180
My stomach hurts.

275
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,540
I'm pooping.

276
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,940
Plop.

277
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,740
Plop.

278
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,500
-Thud. 
-Thud.

279
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,180
Plop.

280
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:15,940
Plop.

281
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,859
Alright.

282
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,940
Just go on.

283
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,339
I won't disturb you.

284
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,660
Maybe

285
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,380
my soulmate is behind the restaurant.

286
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,060
I'll take a look over there.

287
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,420
Go on with your business.

288
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,660
He should have left by now.

289
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,820
No.

290
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,060
He's still here.

291
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,460
I can still hear the thumping sound.

292
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,180
I think that's my heartbeat.

293
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,620
I'll get going.

294
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,180
Hey.

295
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,660
How's your foot?

296
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,300
I'm fine.

297
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,420
I'm sorry for that.

298
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,140
No worries.

299
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,700
See you next time.

300
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,700
Is he really okay?

301
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,300
An orange marker!

302
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,300
It is exactly what I want.

303
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,980
Try it.

304
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,020
Emmy.

305
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,980
Do you think what happened
between Korn and I was a coincidence?

306
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,980
Korn and you?

307
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,940
I don't think it was a coincidence.

308
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,420
He came with Mhok.

309
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,700
And Mhok came all the way to see you.

310
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,340
How was this a coincidence?

311
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,340
Oh, you...

312
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,380
You completely destroyed my hope.

313
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,540
How dare you have naughty thoughts about him

314
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,980
after stomping heavily 
on his foot, my friend?

315
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,660
Are you really interested in him?

316
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,740
Well...

317
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,740
He is much better than Fong, isn't he?

318
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,140
That means you believe in
Aunt Phikun's prophecy, right?

319
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,020
I didn't want to believe it.

320
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,860
But it seems like I don't have a choice.

321
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,460
It's so accurate.

322
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,020
Even that number five thingy is accurate.

323
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,300
If you've believed it now,

324
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,500
I suggest you go home.

325
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:07,980
No.

326
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,340
I'm not going back.

327
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,060
Even my mom herself
didn't stop me from moving out.

328
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,540
Don't move.

329
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,040
The senior students
have finished their lectures.

330
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,340
The seniors will be out
for field study today.

331
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,660
You won't see Fong today.

332
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,500
God bless me.

333
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,420
There's only one chance left.

334
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,220
What should I do?

335
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,540
Please help me.

336
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,260
Please, my good friend.

337
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,580
Will you help me?

338
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,940
Okay, I will!

339
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:02,840
[Mhok: Are you downstairs?
I'll give you your birthday present later.]

340
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,300
What present?

341
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,460
What's wrong?

342
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,700
Are you getting two presents?

343
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,220
Why do you get two presents?

344
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,860
Humph.

345
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,860
I only got one present on my birthday.

346
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,180
Am I not Mhok's good sister?

347
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,940
Is it because

348
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,260
you're helping him film the micro movie?

349
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,700
I don't know.

350
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,460
But...

351
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,050
Where's my present?

352
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,460
Oh, you're so annoying.

353
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,980
You've received two presents.

354
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,220
Buy me a cup of
watermelon smoothie right now.

355
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,820
My body needs sugar now.

356
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,090
I need sugar.
On the spot. Immediately. Right now.

357
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,420
Right now!

358
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,940
Fine, I can buy it.

359
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,220
Where's the money?

360
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,060
I'll take the whole bag. Bye.

361
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,940
A sweet one, right?

362
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,100
I want an extremely sweet one that will cut my legs off.
[Cut off legs: An amputation due to diabetes.]

363
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,660
Hello.

364
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,620
Hello.

365
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,580
How's your foot?

366
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,540
My foot?

367
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,060
Ouch!

368
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,980
Are you okay?

369
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,260
It still hurts.

370
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,260
I need someone to hold me.

371
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,180
Really?

372
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,500
Come on.

373
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,380
Do you want to sit down?

374
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,740
I'm just kidding.

375
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,140
Oh, you scared me.

376
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,780
It's nothing.

377
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,580
Anyway,

378
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,060
I want to say sorry again.

379
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,700
Oh.

380
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,660
It's from Mhok.

381
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,340
Oh.

382
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,810
He went to check out the shooting site.

383
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,420
So he couldn't come.

384
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,020
Oh.

385
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,780
Thank you.

386
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,180
I'll get going.

387
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,540
Don't you have anything else?

388
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:33,980
Bye.

389
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,420
What a coincidence.

390
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,140
No.

391
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,660
I don't think so.

392
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,540
It's a coincidence.

393
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,940
-It isn't a coincidence.
-It's a coincidence.

394
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,260
How is this a coincidence?

395
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,260
I say It's a coincidence.

396
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,140
How is this a coincidence?

397
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,340
Hey, stop arguing with me.
It's a coincidence.

398
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,580
If you think it's a coincidence,

399
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,500
then I'll leave it to you.

400
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,220
Are you abandoning me?

401
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,220
Yes.

402
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,260
Aren't you going to help me?

403
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,900
It's not a coincidence.

404
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,420
How is this not a coincidence?

405
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,860
He prepared a present for me.

406
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,900
It was Mhok who asked him to give it to you.

407
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,700
Then why was it Korn
who passed the present to me?

408
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,010
How is this a coincidence?

409
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,380
It was Mhok who asked him to give it to you.

410
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,100
I think it's a coincidence.

411
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,700
You think it's a coincidence, right?

412
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,340
Yes.

413
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,900
Okay, then let's take it as a coincidence.

414
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,420
That's great, my dear friend.

415
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:33,980
Yeah!

416
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,100
How many times has this happened?

417
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,300
Hey.

418
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,820
It's a coincidence.

419
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,780
Huh?

420
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,900
It's a coincidence.

421
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,980
No.

422
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,860
It's a coincidence.

423
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,300
It's normal to run into his friends

424
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,700
when you help work for Mhok.

425
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:07,940
No.

426
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,620
It's a coincidence.

427
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,540
It's not a coincidence.

428
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,100
It's not a coincidence.

429
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,060
Don't flatter yourself.

430
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,380
Stop.

431
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,460
Stop.

432
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,700
Stop.

433
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,660
Stop.

434
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,530
Stop.

435
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,460
What do you think of the style and color?

436
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,900
Should we go with warm colors?

437
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,820
Let's go.

438
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,900
Okay.

439
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,140
Let's continue.

440
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:53,900
Well...

441
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,820
We can also insert these images.

442
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,860
For example, we can add
some slow motion shots.

443
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,100
You guys can leave first.

444
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,780
See you tomorrow.

445
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,700
Is the script difficult?

446
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,260
I'm sorry.

447
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,900
Were you scared?

448
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,100
No, I wasn't.

449
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,180
It's just

450
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,700
that the script is a bit long.

451
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,020
I can't remember it.

452
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,340
Do you like orange?

453
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,020
I like new things.

454
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,940
This is from Mhok.

455
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,340
The one you gave me that day.

456
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,820
Who was the guy that day?

457
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,180
Oh.

458
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,660
You must have been confused that day.

459
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,860
You were dragged
into the restroom all of a sudden.

460
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,580
Yeah, I was a bit confused.

461
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,140
Did he hurt you?

462
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,260
No, no.

463
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,540
He didn't hurt me.

464
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,620
Well...

465
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,420
How should I put it?

466
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,420
Is he pursuing you?

467
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,460
Yes.

468
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,060
It's something like that.

469
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,620
But he didn't do anything to me.

470
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,540
Actually…

471
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,900
it's a kind of superstition.

472
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,500
Superstition?

473
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,340
Well… my mom…

474
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,420
I mean, a fortune teller

475
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,540
predicted that if I ran into
someone three times,

476
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,740
that person would be my soulmate.

477
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,610
Huh?

478
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,780
That's about it.

479
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,180
That's why I'm hiding from him here.

480
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,300
The more I talk,

481
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,420
the more I get shy.

482
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,060
Why are you shy?

483
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,420
Then why are you laughing at me?

484
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,380
It's just superstition.

485
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,220
I don't find it strange at all.

486
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,420
♫Do you know how hard it is?♫

487
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:28,330
♫It's been thousands of years,
when we will meet similar stars?♫

488
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,180
♫Do you know? Within one blink of eyes♫

489
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:42,140
♫How many changes
will the universe and my life have?♫

490
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:51,460
♫You turn the thin air
into sweet fragrance of flowers♫

491
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:58,340
♫You make the dim stars
the way I dreamed of♫

492
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,980
♫You make the moment become eternity♫

493
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:08,700
♫Now my love is invaluable♫

494
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,060
♫Because it's you♫

495
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,060
♫We move along the orbit

496
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,020
♫Light up each other♫

00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:28,210
♫In a universe full of love♫

498
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,820
What should we do?

499
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,220
Fong is coming back from the campsite.

500
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,300
You should just accept it.

501
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,940
Emmy.

502
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:51,820
Huh?

503
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,940
Didn't you say it was hard to meet Korn?

504
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,820
But it's not hard at all.

505
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,460
I run into him all the time.

506
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,780
And it wasn't a coincidence.

507
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,940
That's right.

508
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,300
You meet him too often. I'm confused.

509
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,180
He meets you so frequently.
It's like he wants to see you.

510
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,060
Or should you start pursuing him?

511
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,900
Maybe you can win his heart.

512
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,300
Then what about the prophecy?

513
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,860
That's right. It's too complicated.

514
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,580
Aunt Phikun is good at fortune-telling.

515
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,700
Hey!

516
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,340
Huh?

517
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,140
What if we disguise it as a coincidence?

518
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,380
Can we?

519
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,220
-How can you make it look like a coincidence?
-Oh!

520
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,020
You can create a scene like this.

521
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,970
You don't know about it,

522
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,620
and Korn has no idea either.

523
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,140
Then the two of you
suddenly meet by chance. Bang!

524
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,300
This is called coincidence, right?

525
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,140
That's a great idea.

526
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,220
Right?

527
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,500
Yes, yes.

528
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,540
Yes, my dear friend.

529
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,140
Oh, no!

530
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:08,820
Huh?

531
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,740
What's wrong?

532
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,740
Today is rent day.

533
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,620
Where can I get the money?

534
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,580
Help me.

535
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,780
Stop it.

536
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,500
Close your eyes.

537
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,580
Close my eyes?

538
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,740
Yup.

539
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,180
Uh.

540
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,700
It's your birthday present,

541
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,340
sponsored by Fong.

542
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,900
Your tireless running that day
has paid off.

543
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,340
I have saved it for you to pay the rent.

544
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,860
My dear friend.

545
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,220
Thank you so much.

546
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,180
Don't forget to apply for the dorm.
You should apply it now, or it'll be too late.

547
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,660
That way, you won't have to pay the rent.

548
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,420
I've already applied,

549
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,820
and I'm waiting for the interview.

550
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,580
Okay.

551
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,739
[Aunt Phikun]

552
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,820
Your mother called.

553
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,300
Should I answer it or you?

554
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,500
Mom, what's wrong?

555
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:40,940
-What?
-Huh?

556
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:44,780
What is it?

557
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,699
You're injured.

558
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,460
Are you still going to do business?

559
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,219
Get some rest, Mom.

560
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:53,900
Hey.

561
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,780
The client has made an appointment.

562
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,260
I just sprained my ankle.
It's not a fracture.

563
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,060
Why are you wearing this?

564
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,100
You're going to slip again.

565
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,140
Oh, I know that.

566
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,740
I'm already being careful now.

567
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,260
You should stay and help me.

568
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,780
I'm dressed like this.
Isn't that helping?

569
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,700
When will your client arrive?

570
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,140
Right now.

571
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,260
He'll be here soon.

572
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,300
Excuse me.

573
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,620
Bud?

574
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,620
Korn?

[First coincidence]

576
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,660
Your type of coincidence is so...

577
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,660
It's beyond my expectation.

578
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,140
I know, right?

579
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,660
I'm so embarrassed.

580
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,420
But now that I think about it,

581
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,140
you look cute in that outfit.

582
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,060
Cute my foot!

583
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,020
Haven't you seen Korean dramas?

584
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,540
The female lead is usually clumsy.

585
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,820
What are you talking about?
What should I do now?

586
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,500
Mhok and Korn are coming.

587
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,220
Don't turn around.

588
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,060
Don't turn around.

589
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,860
Oh, no!

590
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,980
He's going to the toilet.

591
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,780
He is just going to the toilet.

592
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,340
It's okay.

593
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,420
Why did I have to meet him today?

594
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,060
Why are you hiding here?

595
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:48,970
Are you avoiding me?

596
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,300
Can we sit together?

597
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:11,940
Well...

598
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,580
I'm shy.

599
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,380
Shy?

600
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,500
Why are you shy?

601
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,260
Oh, is it because
of what happened yesterday?

602
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,820
Just say it if there's anything.

603
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,460
Uh...

604
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,580
Where is your disciple?

605
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,020
I don't know.

606
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,540
Let him be.

607
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,660
That's how stubborn the kid is.

608
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,260
Kid?

609
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,580
Yes.

610
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,180
Is he your biological son?

611
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,460
By the way,

612
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,700
you came here because of a dream, right?

613
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,660
You dreamed of the same stranger, right?

614
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,420
Oh, my.

615
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,500
You're so accurate, just as they say.

616
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,860
If you're here to test me,

617
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:19,820
then you can go back now.

618
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,140
My son himself
has already given me such a headache.

619
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,980
No, no. That's not what I meant.

620
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,740
I did dream of someone.

621
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,090
It's someone that I don't know.

622
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,220
I've never seen him before.

623
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,860
But as time passed,

624
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,300
we started to meet often.

625
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,380
What does it mean?

626
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,100
Did you build a relationship with him?

627
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,860
Sort of.

628
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,380
You like him, right?

629
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,020
The person you dreamed of

630
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,450
is not your soulmate.

631
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,700
The person in your dream

632
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,490
has found his other half.

633
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,420
Do you know who the person in my dream is?

634
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,660
No.

635
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,780
But your eyes tell me…

636
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,690
Your eyes tell me…

637
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,140
the person you dreamed of

638
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,900
looks like my son.

639
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,620
If you happen to meet someone three times…

640
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,820
That person will be your soulmate.

[In the next episode]
Your mom didn't choke anyone
and threatened others to believe her.

643
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,060
There's no right or wrong with belief.

644
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,300
Wait.

645
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,140
You're also my mom's follower, aren't you?

646
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,740
Fong went to the back door.

647
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,580
-What?
-Run!

648
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,060
Where do you want me to hide?

649
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,100
Do you want to go to my room?

650
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,460
I'll get you some clothes to change into.

651
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,460
-Mhok has been clinging to his boyfriend lately.
-That's normal.

652
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,820
Is it normal?

653
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,060
You'll understand

654
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,940
when you're dating someone.

655
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,300
Let me ask you.

656
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,460
Did you chase him?

657
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,620
Take the drink away.

658
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,260
That's Korn's car.

659
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,540
Is he Korn's boyfriend?
