21
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,830
Tarot cards are not the tools to guide life,

22
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,470
but the signposts on our path of life.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Besides, tarot cards
not only tell us what we want to know,

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,740
but they will also reveal
what's deep in our hearts.

25
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,520
Draw three cards.

26
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,280
This card…

27
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,700
This card is about a bond.

28
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,420
It's destined to be entangled again.

29
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,030
It could be someone from the past
or someone who is about to come.

30
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,670
It may arouse deep feelings.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,790
But the thing is,

32
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,480
this relationship seems
complicated and confusing.

33
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,130
Are you dating someone without telling me?

34
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:44,880
Nonsense.

35
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,660
I'm just following the hint on the card.

36
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,760
This card even implies a love triangle.

37
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,250
So, have you been flirting
with someone secretly?

38
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,800
No!

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,260
Even if I do, I won't tell you.

40
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,670
When does this secret start?

41
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,140
I think it started in high school.

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,450
Forget it.

43
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,810
Hey, do you think
my tarot reading is a joke?

44
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,440
I'm very good at it. If it weren't for my mom,
I would have started my own studio.

45
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,680
Your friend can find
this place on his own, right?

46
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,220
I called him,
and he said he was on the way.

47
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,579
It's been quite some time.

48
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,490
Does he know the place?

49
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,540
Yes, I sent him the location last night.
He should be here soon.

50
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,050
Just wait for a while.

51
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,740
I'll go change the pot.

52
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,000
Hey! If you have a boyfriend, bring him to me.
I'll check him out for you.

53
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:20,000
Mhok.

54
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:36,890
How is it?

55
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,440
Hello, Phat.

56
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,390
Long time no see, kid.

57
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,100
Oh.

58
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,500
You've grown a lot.

59
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,980
Hey! Stop chatting.

60
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,050
Let's check the room first.

61
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,290
Okay. And I can pack up my stuff.

62
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,480
Why do you need so many things?

63
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,580
They're all necessities.
I'll leave it here first.

64
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,300
Why are you changing clothes?

65
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,140
Hey, Mhok! Help me pack up!

66
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,380
Just leave it there.

67
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,110
Where are you going in a hurry?
Don't you want to see me again?

68
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,850
Koi brought us food.

69
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,150
I'm hungry now.

70
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,909
Just sit here and wait.
I'll get the food.

71
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,380
You're here.

72
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,010
This is the Spicy Papaya Salad
with Fermented Fish.

73
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,490
Roast Beef Waterfall Salad.

74
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,090
The super spicy beef soup
that can make a tiger cry.

75
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,760
I even added raw beef for you.

76
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,350
I made it for you.

77
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,610
You know what? When I was abroad,
I missed Koi's Spicy Papaya Salad so bad.

78
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,530
I thought you were as sad as a lost puppy.

79
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,200
I'm relieved to see you eat so well.

80
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,620
A lost puppy?

81
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,720
I don't care about trivial things.

82
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,620
Really? You can lie, but the scar
on your eyebrows always tells the truth.

83
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,460
Oh, you're right.

84
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,710
Until now,

85
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,740
I can't believe

86
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,840
that I have been tolerating and staying

87
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,600
with someone like him for almost six years in the US.

88
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,330
That's why...

89
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,520
I feel like I was bound by someone
with bipolar disorder.

90
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,410
He was nice to me
when he was in a good mood.

91
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:16,290
But

92
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,600
he would hit me when he was drunk.

93
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,300
Look at my wound.

94
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,400
I was beaten until I was hospitalized.

95
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,070
The doctor let me run away on purpose.

96
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,350
If the doctor hadn't helped me leave,
I could only meet you in my dream now.

97
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,789
And I would tell you the lottery number.

98
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,470
But I should be condemned too.

99
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,840
No matter what he did to me,

100
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,290
I forgave him.

101
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,440
But it won't happen again.

102
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,310
Let's eat the Spicy Papaya Salad.
I've had enough.

103
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,500
Let's eat.

104
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,510
It's all in the past now.
Everything will be fine.

105
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,070
Have you talked it out with him?

106
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,910
No, I didn't have the chance.

107
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,690
But I have to talk to you. Well, I…

108
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,050
I bought a lot of things for him.

109
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,260
I'm dumb, right?

110
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,330
It's okay.

111
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,710
Tell me if you need anything.

112
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
I'll always be by your side and support you.

113
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,300
You're always my safe zone.

114
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,030
Hey, wait.

115
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,420
This is for you.

116
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,350
Tie it up.

117
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,230
No, you have to tie it yourself.

118
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,330
How can I tie it myself?

119
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,520
With my feet?

120
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,710
Are you crazy?

121
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,610
Try to tie it yourself.

122
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,530
If you do that,
you two will be tied together.

123
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,030
That's great. I'll have someone
to take care of me when I get old.

124
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,250
You...

125
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,350
Please take care of me when I get old, okay?

126
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,890
Do you want to spend the night with me?

127
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,540
Yes.

128
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,090
But I might come back and forth.

129
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,730
Because Bass will miss me.
I can't leave him alone for too long.

130
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,690
And feel free to stay
in this house as long as you want.

131
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,690
You clingy husband is so annoying.

132
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,050
Don't get me started on how you acted
when you had a boyfriend.

133
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,370
It was hard to ask you out for dinner.
I almost sent you a lawyer's letter for it.

134
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,220
Don't you think I'll be lonely?
I'm a heartbroken man.

135
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,610
I know you need company.
That's why I invited Mhok.

136
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,850
Then... What kind of heartbreaking event
will you invite me to?

137
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,650
I've prepared everything for you.

138
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,760
As long as you open your heart,

139
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,360
we can start it tonight.

140
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,210
Don't just invite me to drink like you did
when we were in school.

141
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,000
That sounds fun.

142
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,900
Hey, Phat.

143
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,220
What's wrong with you? I'm all soaked!

144
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,170
It's hot. So I want to play with water.

145
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,940
Both of you are like kids.
You've grown up now. Aren't you tired of it?

146
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,110
We all need some fun, don't we?

147
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,940
Unlike you, you're aging.

148
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,330
Come join us if you want to be young.

149
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,050
I don't want to.
You guys can play it yourself.

150
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,580
Hey. Why don't you play with him?

151
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,480
I don't want to play.

152
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,290
Sister.

153
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,390
What's wrong with Phat?

154
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,530
Despite what happened to him,
he's still smiling.

155
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,440
Doesn't he feel anything?

156
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:39,780
Of course he does.

157
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,490
But when you see his smile,

158
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,210
he might be trying to hide his pain.

159
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,120
He probably doesn't want to ruin
the atmosphere at his friend's place.

160
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,440
How did you know?

161
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,690
Of course I know.

162
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,110
Because he's my best friend.

163
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,550
How bad is it

164
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,890
to be hurt by the person you love?

165
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,190
It's…

166
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,830
It's hard to answer.

167
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,230
Now,

168
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,720
all I can do is to be with him.

169
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,170
I hope he won't hurt himself.

170
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,110
I don't want to let him feel like
no one loves him.

171
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,560
Sister, why did Phat...

172
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,780
Where are you going?

173
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,540
Did I scare you?

174
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,840
I thought you...

175
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,700
Are you okay?

176
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,140
Are you worried about me?

177
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,550
No.

178
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,450
The water is still on.

179
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,360
What a waste.

180
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,140
Is this how you play?

181
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:32,920
Oh.

182
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,350
What are you doing?

183
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,400
Hey.

184
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,360
Let's play!

185
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,590
Mhok, don't forget that I'm older.

186
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,720
You started it first.

187
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,270
-Come on.
-You'll pay for it.

188
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,380
Stop!

189
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,220
I'll show you what I've got!

190
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,220
Shuffle the cards with your left hand,

191
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,280
split them into half,

192
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,940
and draw three cards.

193
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,980
Your love card shows up.

194
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,300
What's that look on your face?

195
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,119
Because you haven't forgotten him.

196
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:19,990
Are you kidding me?

197
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,700
Look at my smile.

198
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,750
You see that? I'm happy without him.

199
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,070
Then tell me,

200
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,600
before you close your eyes,
who is the last person to appear in your mind?

201
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,670
Are you fooling him?

202
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,970
Trust me.

203
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,210
I'm a very accurate fortune teller.

204
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,640
Everything can be solved.

205
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,650
If you want to move forward,

206
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,130
draw a card with your left hand.

207
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,580
I'll find a solution for you.

208
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,210
It's your fate. You decide it yourself.

209
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,090
What do you mean?

210
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,880
It's about to change.

211
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,900
I think you have to cut ties with Khun.

212
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,030
What are you trying to say?

213
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,150
This is a tool to cut off contact.

214
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,320
Ridiculous.

215
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,980
To make it happen,

216
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,520
you must write your name on the candle

217
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,560
and boldly write your ex's name on another.

218
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,690
When you write,

219
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,750
put your desire into it
to end your relationship.

220
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,270
Stay focus.

221
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,780
Next,

222
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,660
I'm going to tie these two candles

223
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,360
together

224
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,720
and ignite them.

225
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,230
Then, I'll wait for the rope to break.

226
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,930
That's how it ends.

227
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,650
Hey, Mhok!

228
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,500
What are you doing? You ruined the ceremony.

229
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,840
Eh, you...

230
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,510
That's fine. If not, I would have dozed off
while we were waiting

231
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,400
for the candle to burn the rope.

232
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,580
Right.

233
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,470
Cut it off and let it end.

234
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,510
You two are so annoying.

235
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,030
Stop complaining.

236
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,780
Let's drink.

237
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,000
Mhok.

238
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,970
Cheers!

239
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,500
Stop complaining. Drink.

240
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,030
Drink as I do now.

241
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,130
Drink.

242
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,320
Hurry up.

243
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,250
Why are you spraying it so much?

244
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,700
There's a lot of mosquitoes.

245
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,510
Didn't you see it?

246
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,960
The only insect I saw was you.

247
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,640
I sprayed it like that
to prevent mosquitoes from biting you.

248
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,160
It's okay.

249
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,870
Mosquitoes are so small.

250
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,460
They can't suck much of my blood.

251
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,490
If Sis sees you sick,

252
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,340
she'll be worried about you.

253
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,070
Are you sure
she's the only one worried about me?

254
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,500
Let's go back inside the house.

255
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,180
Don't flirt with me, okay?

256
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:12,850
Mhok!

257
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,640
Follow me.

258
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,380
Sit down.

259
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,550
The quickest way to forget your ex

260
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,560
is to find a new husband.

261
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,960
That's it.

262
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,810
You're not going to wait until the wound
on my face is healed, are you?

263
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,160
You'll get better soon if your new husband
applies the medicine for you.

264
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,950
Well...

265
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,600
Oh, we're solving the fundamental problem.

266
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:01,740
Awesome!

267
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:02,980
Phak.

268
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,880
Let me see who's on your list.

269
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,500
Here.

270
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,570
With the information from our friends

271
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,100
and also Bass and Tob, I have done

272
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,090
background checks on them.

273
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,100
I have prepared some single men
with status for you. In total...

274
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,080
We have nine.

275
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:24,930
Let's start.

276
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,140
Phat, how about this one?

277
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,480
Bass's friend?

278
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,070
I think he's good. He has a full forehead,
the symbol of a successful man.

279
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,360
Not handsome.

280
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,280
A pretty face comes second,
and a successful career comes first.

281
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,380
Someone like him

282
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,040
can support all of us.

283
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,880
Are you interested?

284
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,600
Uhm, no.

285
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,540
What about this one?

286
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:58,540
Is he okay?

287
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,360
He is Bass's friend.

288
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,750
And he's the son of the golf course owner.

289
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,450
What happened to his mouth?

290
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,070
Why is it so swollen?

291
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,680
What's wrong with your mouth?

292
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,340
I'm asking Phat, not you.

293
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,450
Such round and full lips

294
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,550
mean that he can speak well.

295
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,700
Let me tell you, if you want to get rich in the future,
you need to be eloquent.

296
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,580
No, I'm afraid
I can't beat him when we argue.

297
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,200
Then...

298
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,090
Let's skip this one.

299
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,520
Hey, I haven't said anything yet.

300
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,330
He's not my type.

301
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,670
Wait a second.

302
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,770
Hey, he's handsome.

303
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,760
I like him.

304
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,600
Are you sure? His eyebrows look weird.

305
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,940
Yes, he's right.

306
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,620
This won't do.

307
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,160
He does look good,

308
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,550
but his eyebrows are too thin.

309
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,670
He must be a workaholic.

310
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,460
You'll die from the lack of attention later.

311
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,980
If you're looking for a man, you should find
someone who has time for you.

312
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,110
Here.

313
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,520
If that's your type, I recommend...

314
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,270
this guy. He is the best.

315
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,900
He has thick eyebrows.

316
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,670
It means he's a loving person.

317
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,940
And he's great in bed.

318
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,330
Ah.

319
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,690
Okay, you can send it to me.

320
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,040
Yes!

321
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,920
Who's here, Mhok?

322
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,890
Why are you here?

323
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,390
Well...

324
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,630
I saw your post on IG.

325
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,100
So I came.

326
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,710
I took the morning flight here.

327
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,740
Is this your new home?

328
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,080
Yes.

329
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,580
Are you going to stay here?

330
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,290
For now, yes.

331
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,640
Let's go home.

332
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,790
Why should I?

333
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,530
Didn't we make it clear?

334
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,100
Yes. We did.

335
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,740
I'm sorry again.

336
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,690
I almost forgot that we broke up.

337
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:52,980
By chance...

338
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,290
I like to remember
what happened in the past.

339
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,860
The feeling that we shared…

340
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,260
during the old days.

341
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,030
What are you doing here?

342
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:16,750
Well...

343
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,760
I missed you.

344
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,010
What about you?

345
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,110
Did you miss me?

346
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,640
Of course.

347
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,330
Even when you hurt me...

348
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,000
Wait, Phat.

349
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,710
I have something to tell you.

350
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,940
I went to see a psychiatrist.

351
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,770
And I quit drinking.

352
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,270
Are you not going to smile at me again?

353
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,810
You don't want me in your life anymore?

354
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,250
I'm sorry.

355
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,160
I must have hurt you all this time.

356
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,060
What I've done upsets you.

357
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
But now, I really want to change.

358
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,640
You don't have to make a decision now.

359
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,120
I'll prove it to you with my action.

360
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,310
Then we can slowly start over.

361
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,350
I still want to have you in my life.

362
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,300
Oh, look! What perfect timing! He suddenly
shows up when Phat's looking for a new husband.

363
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,720
Mhok, he's so handsome, isn't he?

364
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,820
Oh, he's good.

365
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,480
Yes.

366
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,960
Hey, you guys.

367
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,080
I'm a bit tired.

368
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,410
I'll go upstairs and take a rest.

369
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,610
Suit yourself.

370
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,500
Mr. Phatarapong, are you dead?

371
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,160
Do you want something to eat today?
I'll order it for you.

372
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,560
Do you want more?

373
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,970
I'll get it for you. Oh boy…

374
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,100
No, I just wanted to steal your food.

375
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,880
Is it funny?

376
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,160
It's funny.

377
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,190
Do you want to buy me dinner,
or are you here to gossip?

378
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,260
So you know what I'm thinking.

379
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,580
It's because you're so hypocritical.

380
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,530
Ask me anything you want to know.

381
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,360
Are you sure?

382
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,540
Yes.

383
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,680
What did you talk about with Khun?

384
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,340
About what we bought together.

385
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,570
How should we split it
if we're really going to stop living together?

386
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:54,190
Who owns most of the things?

387
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:56,980
Both of us own it.

388
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,800
The time we've been apart…

389
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,900
He told me

390
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,360
he went to a psychiatrist and quit drinking.

391
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:09,830
And...

392
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,400
And he asked me to get back together.

393
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,800
What are you going to do now?

394
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,239
Are you going to get back with him?

395
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,699
I don't know.

396
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:26,940
I...

397
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,420
don't know what my heart really wants,

398
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,230
and how I feel.

399
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,480
But he went to a psychiatrist for you.

400
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,159
I feel sorry for him.

401
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,060
Good for him, but...

402
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,120
I really don't know how I feel.

403
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,080
How about this?

404
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,850
No matter what choice you make,
I'll always support you.

405
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,520
Okay?

406
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,110
Where did Mhok go? Lets go tease him

407
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,390
to relieve our boredom.

408
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,340
Oh, you're still thinking about having fun.

409
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,470
-Hey!
-Quietly.

410
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,620
Were you asleep? You look so down.

411
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:22,970
What is it?

412
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,510
Mei invited me to hold a ceremony.
That's why I'm here to invite you.

413
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,140
But if you want to continue sleeping,

414
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:30,940
I won't mind.

415
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,240
Okay, I want to go with you.

416
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,540
Hold on.

417
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,570
What's wrong?

418
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,090
Are you angry?

419
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,690
You look so fierce.

420
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,430
Don't tell me that you are jealous of me?

421
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,790
You remind me of Mei's first love.

422
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,060
You were so jealous of her too.

423
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,620
Right? Is it my turn now?

424
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,000
I don't want you
to get involved with him anymore.

425
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,720
I see.

426
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,350
You're so cute.

427
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,560
Aww, Mhok.

428
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:34,690
Phat!

429
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,110
Come here.

430
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,340
Come here. Hurry.

431
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,580
Coming.

432
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,580
Have a seat.

433
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,430
I have something for you.

434
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,460
You told me

435
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,930
that no one paid attention to you.

436
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,030
So I think you should use something.

437
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,210
A condom?

438
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,200
Are you crazy?

439
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,110
No.

440
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,440
This is the Charming Beeswax.

441
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,720
What is it?

442
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,610
Gosh, you're so lame.

443
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,260
You've been in the US for so long.

444
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,980
Now everyone uses this.

445
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,460
Why haven't I seen it before?

446
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,100
Shut up.

447
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,120
This is the Charming Beeswax.

448
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,040
It can enhance your personal charm

449
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,330
and also improve your attraction to love.

450
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,880
Everyone who meets you will love you.

451
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,590
It can turn a single man like you
into a prince charming.

452
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,930
As for how to use it, it's very simple.

453
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,330
Just get some beeswax…

454
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,210
on your right ring finger,
and apply it on your lips.

455
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,440
I promise it will work

456
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:38,840
in three days.

457
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,680
You're exaggerating.

458
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,470
I'm not exaggerating, you know?

459
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,570
If you want to forget your ex,

460
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,170
use this. It's super easy and helpful.

461
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,450
Just apply it every Monday

462
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,860
before 9:35 p.m.

463
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,650
I promise you won't even

464
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,870
remember his name.

465
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,070
Phat.

466
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,080
It's Monday, let's start it today.

467
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,880
Go ahead.

468
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,330
If not, it'll be too late.

469
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,760
What's wrong?

470
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,760
Haven't you forgotten him yet?

471
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,750
Mhok.

472
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,330
Grab him!

473
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,210
What are you doing? What are you doing?

474
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,170
Get him to stay in place!

475
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,020
Let go of me, Mhok!

476
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,920
What are you doing to me, Mhok? I quit.

477
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,750
I quit!

478
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,550
-Say you want to forget him. Say it!
-What are you doing?

479
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,300
-Say it! Say it!
-My hand! It hurts! Let go of me!

480
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,040
Let go of me! What are you doing?

481
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,400
If I could forget him by applying this,

482
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,250
I wouldn't be here.

483
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,690
Phat!

484
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,840
Phat, I'm sorry!I didn't mean it!

485
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,810
I really didn't mean it, Mhok.

486
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,420
I know.

487
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,790
I understand.

488
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,090
Uh,

489
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,570
let me ask you something.

490
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,150
Go ahead.

491
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,250
You have to answer me honestly.

492
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,990
Do you like Phat?

493
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,400
Do you need it?

494
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,190
I'm sorry.

495
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,290
She didn't think much before she acted.

496
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,140
Hey.

497
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:00,640
It's okay.

498
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,560
I ruined the mood.

499
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,890
To be honest,

500
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,370
how can some beeswax on the lips…

501
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,050
make someone forget their ex, right?

502
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,370
I know, right?

503
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,350
We didn't mean to joke about your feelings.

504
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:26,920
We're just worried about you.

505
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,240
Mei meant well.

506
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:32,900
Don't blame her and be mad at her.

507
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,810
We did this

508
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,090
to make you start over.

509
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,480
We didn't mean to joke about your feelings.

510
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,290
But if you're still angry,

511
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,160
you can be mad at me.

512
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,180
But please forgive Mei.

513
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,470
How is Mei now?

514
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,950
She must be very upset.

515
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,660
I'll go check on her.

516
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:11,150
You can stay here.

517
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:55,400
[Director: Parnupong Chaiyo]

518
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:25,740
[In the next episode]

519
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,660
When will you arrange an event for me?

520
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,200
We're having a great event today.

521
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,880
Absolutely fantastic.

522
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:31,720
That's why I want
to take you to the moonlight bath.

523
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:33,570
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

524
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:35,780
Do you want to try it?

525
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:38,950
If you're not my brother,

526
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,560
I will think that you're pursuing me.

527
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,560
If I'm not your brother,

528
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:45,560
can I pursue you?

529
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,930
When we get hurt, we should rest

530
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,270
instead of getting hurt repeatedly.

531
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:52,420
If you ask me now,

532
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,850
I'm not ready
to give my heart to someone yet.

533
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,990
Does it hurt?

534
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:58,830
Let me bear the pain for you, okay?

535
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,560
How do you feel

536
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,820
about the kiss last night?

537
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,570
Do you feel something?

538
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:05,950
Can we date?

539
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,290
I'm not ready to give my heart to someone,
and that “someone” is you.

540
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:12,460
Understand?
