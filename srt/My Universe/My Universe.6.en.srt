00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,980
Oh no.

188
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,060
You're just like Phat.

189
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,020
Make it yourself if you want to eat.

190
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,220
I'm still drunk.

191
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,460
Darn it.

192
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,020
Make porridge yourself.

193
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,260
Darn it.

194
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,700
I'm afraid that

195
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,580
you won't go to our favorite restaurant.

196
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,180
It's just lunch.

197
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,940
What are you afraid of?

198
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,780
When I asked you out,

199
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,020
I was as nervous as our first date.

200
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,340
You know?

201
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,460
Thank you.

202
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,940
I should thank you for having lunch with me.

203
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,660
That's okay.

204
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,060
It's nothing.

205
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,020
Phat.

206
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,420
I told you before

207
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,260
that I hope you can give me another chance.

208
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,620
It's so dim.

209
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,620
Why don't you turn on the light?

210
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,940
Where's Mei?

211
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,260
She went out with Bass.

212
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,460
She said she'll be late.

213
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,180
There might be a lot of rituals.

214
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,140
What's wrong?

215
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Did you eat?

216
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,900
Yes.

217
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,340
But now I'm hungry.

218
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,940
Make me something to eat.

219
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,340
If Mei hadn't been away often,

220
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,300
your cooking would have been better.

221
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,700
What is this?

222
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,260
Fast food in the dorm.

223
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,140
It's fast food,

224
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,060
but I made it with my heart.

225
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,780
Okay.

226
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,940
I'll try it then.

227
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,260
Why are you laughing?

228
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,740
Because you're funny.

229
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,940
You want me to beat you?

230
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,860
Why are you with me all day?

231
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,620
Don't you need to prepare for the competition?

232
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,100
My knees are injured.

233
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,020
I have to rest these days.

234
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,420
That's why I'm always at home.

235
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,260
Oh.

236
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,860
I see.

237
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,500
If you get hurt, you need to rest.

238
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,060
Don't let it get worse.

239
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,020
Me too.

240
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,220
If you ask me now,

241
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,580
I'm not ready to open my heart to anyone yet.

242
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,180
What did you just say?

243
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,340
I wasn't listening.

244
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,020
Darn it.

245
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,540
Phat.

246
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,780
I know.

247
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,140
You can't date someone else

248
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,020
because you still have lingering thoughts.

249
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,730
I'm going to hold

250
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,780
a witch's heart burning ritual today.

251
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,820
Didn't we burn it last time?

252
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,100
What's going to burn this time?

253
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,940
This time is different from last time.

254
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,060
Now,

255
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,540
I want you to write down all your feelings and things related to your ex.

256
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,140
Write a whole paper

257
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,580
and burn it.

258
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,460
Burn them all.

259
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,020
Then, how should I start?

260
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,940
Close your eyes slowly.

261
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,380
Focus.

262
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,100
Take a deep breath.

263
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,500
Don't be subjective.

264
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,700
What I want you to do is

265
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,500
to recall the time you spent with him.

266
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,740
The clearer the better.

267
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,140
Just like it's happening now.

268
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,260
Now, open your eyes slowly.

269
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:04,180
Write your feelings on this paper, or draw it out.

270
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,180
Put this paper on your left chest.

271
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,500
Close your eyes.

272
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,220
Recall these things slowly.

273
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,220
Release all your emotions.

274
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,580
Time is the best antidote.

275
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,300
But now,

276
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,380
I have this.

277
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,340
Getting drunk dispels a thousand sorrows.

278
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,700
Oh.

279
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,620
Well said.

280
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,620
I specially prepared this for the end of the ritual.

281
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,300
If you can't forget him,

282
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,620
let it help you.

283
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,900
Come on.

284
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,420
Since you bought it for me,

285
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,820
let me mix the wine.

286
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,540
I promise it will make you feel heartbroken.

287
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,260
Bring it on!

288
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,060
I'm ready!

289
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,460
Mei, this is for you.

290
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,180
Bring it on.

291
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,980
I really want to drink wine.

292
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,740
-Damn Phat!
-What did you give me?

293
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,100
What did you put in there?

294
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,660
It's bitter.

295
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,740
Oh.

296
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,780
I feel dizzy.

297
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,100
I'm going to find Bass.

298
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,300
I miss my boyfriend when I get drunk.

299
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,300
Bye.

300
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,220
Cheers!

301
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,380
Cheers!

302
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,060
Don't drink too much.

303
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,300
Hey.

304
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,060
Don't mind me.

305
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,300
I'm good at drinking.

306
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,540
And I'm happy to drink with you.

307
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,340
Then drink it.

308
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,260
You know what?

309
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,100
When I was young,

310
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,220
I thought love is to have

311
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,780
someone who will smile at me doing stupid things.

312
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,370
That someone is Khun.

313
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,260
He is that person.

314
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,740
But when he stopped smiling at me,

315
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,580
and stopped laughing with me,

316
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,380
I feel like I've lost my value.

317
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,940
Everything has changed.

318
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,380
But I gave out everything for him.

319
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:50,620
Instead, I got his hurt to me.

320
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,980
But I still forgave him like a fool.

321
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,700
I don't like myself like that.

322
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,980
Useless.

323
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,940
I was so stupid that I cried for love.

324
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,139
Darn it.

325
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,699
Does it hurt?

326
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,659
Do you want me to bear some pain for you?

327
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:12,980
Thanks.

328
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,580
Wow, Mei.

329
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:18,940
This is delicious.

330
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,060
Where did you buy it?

331
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,620
Just down the alley.

332
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,820
How late did you two drink last night?

333
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,900
Three in the morning.

334
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,740
Three in the morning?

335
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,820
Who passed out first?

336
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,300
Me.

337
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,580
Your heart burning ritual weakened my power.

338
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,380
Trust me.

339
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,700
Everything will be fine.

340
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,260
Hey, I'll be back soon.

341
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,700
I'm gonna go for a smoke.

342
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,220
I wasn't drunk last night.

343
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:08,740
I know.

344
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,620
You've been avoid drinking.

345
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,580
I had feelings... for that kiss last night.

346
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,300
Did you feel it?

347
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,380
Can we be together?

348
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,940
I was happy.

349
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,660
I thought you understood.

350
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,020
I said I wasn't ready to open my heart to others,

351
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,220
including you.

352
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,340
Understand?

353
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,020
I gotta go to the bathroom.

354
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,260
Sister.

355
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:26,940
Where is Phat?

356
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,300
He said he's sleepy.

357
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,380
Maybe he went upstairs to sleep.

358
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,420
Hey.

359
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,620
Why did you close it? I was watching.

360
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,540
Are you crazy?

361
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:56,980
I think...

362
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,180
I like Phat.

363
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,300
I knew it.

364
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,860
My feeling won't go wrong.

365
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,420
Please help me.

366
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,420
Silly boy.

367
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,180
When I first asked you,

368
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,580
you didn't tell the truth.

369
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,380
Now what?

370
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,980
It's a big deal now, huh?

371
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,020
Okay, there's another way.

372
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,740
What is it?

373
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,860
Do you trust God of Matchmaking?

374
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,820
What are you talking about?

375
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:06,460
God of Matchmaking is an immortal who controls the red thread.

381

No kidding, Mhok.

382
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,700
I’m serious.

383

If God of Matchmaking really exists,

384
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,260

385

386

to be your someone?

387

It's not that I don't trust you.

388
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,260
I just don't believe in love anymore.

389
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,380
It hurts to love someone wholeheartedly.

390
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,460
Phat.

391
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,980
Are you ready to go to our date?

392
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,700
Yeah. Let's go.

393

I'm glad you quit drinking.

394
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,860
I'm still drinking.

395
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,420
I drank all night.

396
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,780
I quit for you.

397
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,820
Do you want a hug?

398
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,100
Come on.

399
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,940
Thank you for everything.

400
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,940
But I don't want to forgive you anymore.

401
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,060
Without me,

402
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,220
you need to take good care of our home.

403
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,620
Do you need my help?

404
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,780

405

Silly boy.

406
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,780
Even though you may be refused,

407
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,100
you should give it a try.

408
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,740
That way, you won't have any regrets.

409

410

I don't want to force him.

416

417

If I could,

00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:46,660
I would have done it when you had a boyfriend.

If you can make me smile,

00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,140
I might open my heart to you.

445

Do you want to hear the funniest thing in my life?

446
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,980
Do you remember when we first met?

447
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,860
I was only 16 then.

448

My dad just passed away.

449
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:24,940
We decided to throw his ashes into the sea.

450
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,620
After it was done,

451
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,020
I wanted to stay by the beach for a while.

452
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:39,740
I didn't know

453
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,540
how I felt in my heart.

454
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,740
When my dad left,

455
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,660
I didn't cry.

456
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,940
But when his ashes were gone in the sea,

457
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:06,610
I realized he was gone for good.

458
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,060
I lost my mind.

459
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,580
I didn't know when I went down the sea.

460
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:22,420
I came to my sense

461
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,100
when I choked on water.

462
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,340
Then you pulled me up.

463
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,380
I fell in love with the man named Phat.

464
00:58:55,900 --> 00:59:01,140
You remind me of my foolishness when I fell in love.

465
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,220
If I could love you once,

466
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,820
I wouldn't have any regrets.

468

You can go to bed now.

469
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,020
I'm going to sleep too.

470
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:56,220
Go.

471

No, I won't sleep.

472

473

01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,540
Why are you staring at me?

476
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:35,380
I brought you here to get some sunlight, not to stare at me.

477
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:41,340
But your face is brighter than the sun.

478

Do you know that you're like a love maniac now?

479
