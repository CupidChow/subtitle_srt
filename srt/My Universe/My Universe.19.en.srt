Why don't you tell us why Pluto

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,760
I know you don't like science,

31
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,680
but if you keep zoning out in every class,

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,560
the teacher will keep calling on you.

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,120
It's just so dull.

34
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,400
What's the point? It's not like we'll ever need it.

35
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,079
You used to be into this stuff.

It's not about liking it,

39
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,200
It’s repetitive.

Tod, seriously,

if you don't like science, why are you in the science-math program?

To be honest, moving back to Bangkok doesn't thrill me.

Ever since he heard about the move,

74
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,680
he's been so rebellious.

75
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Guess after 15, kids mature a bit.

76
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,000
Recently, he's sounding more grown-up.

179
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,240
Take it.

180
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,840
I saved it just for you.

181
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,000
It can be used in an emergency.

182
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,640
So, I'll...

183
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,880
Keep it for when you drop by.

184
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,640
Khon Kaen's just a stone's throw away, right?

185
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,840
If it's that close,

186
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,440
you'll visit often, won't you?

187
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,080
Nope.

188
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,760
Okay, maybe I'll swing by to teach you there.

189
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,840
But I'm swamped with research and tutoring.

190
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,000
My schedule's jam-packed.

191
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,560
Then,

192
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,960
block off a time slot for me.

193
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,240
You'll find new friends there...

194
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
and probably forget me.

195
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,640
Alright,

196
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,680
let's see... who ends up forgetting who.

197
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,200
Alright, I'll call you often.

198
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,960
Yeah,

199
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,760
Hey Nick,

200
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
I gotta tell you something.

201
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,480
Watch this closely.

202
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,960
You can't decipher it?

203
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,960
Guess I need more practice.

204
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,560
Morse code...

205
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,280
I memorized it as a kid...

206
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,960
but still mess it up now.

207
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,560
Let's try something else.

208
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,880
.--. .-.. ..- - ---

209
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,680
Were you upset with me back then?

210
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,160
When exactly?

211
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,120
In the beginning, when I was forced by my mom to study with you.

212
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,960
Always skipped the class, never focused.

213
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,280
One day, I even...

214
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,600
The day my pencil case vanished, right?

215
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,480
Yes, I was mad.

216
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,080
I was furious and thought that...

217
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,640
What kind of brat is this?

218
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,480
Why return it?

219
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,400
You didn't even admit to taking it.

220
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,160
Well, I felt...

221
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,360
a bit guilty.

222
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,920
I was harsh at first.

223
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,160
Everything you said is gone,

224
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,000
going in one ear and out the other.

225
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
Wait, you felt guilty?

226
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,520
About what?

227
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,600
I'm not sure.

228
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,560
Tod!

229
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,680
-Guilty about what?
-I'm not sure.

230
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,240
-But why?
-Don't know.

231
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,080
-Tod!
-I said I don’t know.

232
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,920
Hey, Tod! Todsapon!

233
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,200
I'd like to return this money.

234
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,520
It's okay, Nick. Keep it.

235
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,640
I should say sorry too, for not being his perfect mom.

236
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,760
To be honest,

237
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,680
raising a child right... it's tough.

238
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,080
Don't say that, ma'am.

239
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
I wasn't the best tutor,

240
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,480
canceling sessions easily.

241
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,680
I must have failed to take good care of Tod,

242
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,960
causing him to rebel against me

243
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,360
and even against you.

244
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,760
It's fine.

245
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,200
I told you, right?

246
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,000
I need the money.

247
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,200
Think you can dodge me, huh?

248
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,760
Should we call the cops, Nick?

249
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,360
That man... he's my brother.

250
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,800
He's probably just angry that I didn't answer his calls.

251
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,120
But who does that to their own brother?

252
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,120
If I were you, I'd never let it happen.

253
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,480
It's just a missed call.

254
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,360
Actually,

255
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
my brother just needs money.

256
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,600
But I didn't lend him any.

257
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,040
He might get angry.

258
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,520
I managed to graduate because

259
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,920
he dropped out for me.

260
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,600
Does your brother still bother you for money?

261
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,520
Is he still causing trouble?

262
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,360
He vanished after that day.

263
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,560
If he bugs you again,

264
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,760
let me handle it, okay?

265
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,360
Focus on your own stuff before jumping into mine.

266
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,200
Looks like everyone's asleep.

267
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,400
You should head inside too.

268
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
You have to get up early tomorrow, right?

269
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,760
Whoa, is it already 2 AM?

270
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,000
Safe travels tomorrow, okay?

271
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
Alright.

272
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,800
You too, get home safe.

273
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Thanks for keeping me company.

274
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,840
Thank you so much.

275
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,960
Well, I should get going.

276
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,320
See you!

277
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,960
[Pluto: Reached my room.]

278
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
Why’d you want to be a tutor?

279
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,880
As a kid, I was the class topper.

280
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:07,240
People would recognize me easily from the school vinyl banners.

281
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
You were on the banners?

282
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,080
Wow!

283
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,880
After graduating,

284
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
I tried for scholarships to study abroad,

285
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
but dad fell ill.

286
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,920
So I had to do practical training as a teacher in Chiang Mai instead.

287
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,920
I've heard teachers don't earn much here.

288
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,080
Don't even get me started.

289
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,080
Endless story.

290
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,240
Because of the low pay,

291
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,360
I decided to come to Bangkok

292
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,920
Started online tutoring.

293
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,120
But no one hired me at first,

294
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,280
until I met your mom.

295
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Back then, she was just starting too.

296
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,840
She recognized me from those banners.

297
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,280
Really?

298
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,600
Then she asked me about what I was doing,

299
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,320
and I said I was tutoring.

300
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,600
Then I said that no one had hired me yet.

301
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,040
Guess what she said next?

302
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,960
Why stick with tutoring?

303
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,960
You could've achieved so much more.

304
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,080
Whoa, did she tell you that harshly?

305
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,720
Honestly,

306
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:59,200
I was peeved, not at her, but at myself.

307
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,320
But your mom was a lifesaver in the end.

308
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,240
She recommended me to her friends for research.

309
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,200
Even recommended me to her students.

310
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,640
More students came my way, and word got around.

311
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,040
Whenever students say

312
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,240
I helped them pass the exams,

313
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,240
I just feel...

314
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,880
over the moon.

315
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,200
So, I think

316
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
staying here isn't so bad.

317
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,880
But part of me...

318
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,600
still dreams of going further.

319
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,040
Can I have your number, Nu? Er, Nick.

320
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,720
Why now?

321
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,680
You usually don't want to talk to me.

322
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,640
Well,

323
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,080
now we're back to studying together.

324
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,760
Might need your advice down the line.

325
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,080
Pluto...

326
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
What's with the Pluto username?

327
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,320
Back when I was 15, like you now...

328
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,840
I got this chance for a US scholarship for high schoolers,

329
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Only 9 kids were chosen,

330
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,880
each symbolizing a planet.

331
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,000
And I was Pluto.

332
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh, that’s so cool.

333
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Ah, this is why.

334
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Don't cut in, not done yet.

335
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,360
Turns out, I didn't get to go.

336
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,960
I was told I didn't qualify.

337
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
And guess what?

338
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,160
That same year, NASA said Pluto wasn't a planet anymore.

339
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
According to the scientists,

340
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
NASA had new criteria then.

341
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,800
A planet needs to meet three conditions,

342
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,160
and Pluto failed the third.

343
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,920
It lacked gravity,

344
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,920
so it was downgraded to a dwarf planet.

345
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,440
That's when I felt like Pluto myself.

346
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,520
I was so close.

347
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,120
Those who got it had famous surnames.

348
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,160
That's just not fair.

349
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,800
for both you and Pluto.

350
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,240
But think about it this way,

351
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,120
Pluto didn't do anything wrong.

352
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,960
Its only job is to keep orbiting.

353
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,920
And when you talk about going further,

354
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
how far do you mean?

355
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,600
I guess as far as it takes.

356
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Actually, I'm quite content with where I am now.

357
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,960
You know, life's full of unexpected encounters.

358
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,560
Sometimes it's like running into a meteorite,

359
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,520
but no matter how much it shakes us up,

360
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,120
all we can do is keep orbiting on our path.

361
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,400
Are you comparing your brother to a meteorite?

362
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,160
It could be two things:

363
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,240
either a meteorite

364
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,040
or a comet...

365
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,240
Here...

366
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,040
Sorry for stealing this,

367
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,960
and for skipping classes...

368
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,280
I’m sorry.

369
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,840
Never thought you'd return it.

370
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,920
By the way,

371
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,640
you mentioned life's full of odd encounters.

372
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,280
What about me?

373
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,360
In your orbit, am I...

374
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,120
not just a meteorite, right?

375
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,960
I'd say...

376
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,160
you're more like...

377
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,960
[Teacher] A black hole is a cosmic object
with extremely high gravity.

378
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,880
Anything that enters a black hole can never escape,

379
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,480
especially near the 'event horizon.'

380
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,720
Excuse me, ma'am!

381
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:09,440
So, no scientist has ever entered
a black hole and come back, right?

382
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,120
There might be, but some theories suggest...

383
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,280
those who enter might end up in another universe,

384
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,760
unable to return and explain what’s inside a black hole.

385
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,560
Sounds mysterious,

386
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,040
like 'come in if you dare, but you can never leave.

387
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,000
Yeah, anyone who goes in

388
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,520
might not want to leave.

389
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,520
Perhaps another universe he is facing,

390
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,840
is better than ours.

391
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,360
Actually,

392
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
you're like a black hole.

393
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,040
Me? A black hole?

394
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,160
Absolutely, you are a real enigma.

395
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,320
Apparently approachable, but it is not that.

396
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,600
Even after knowing you,

397
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,160
it's hard to figure out what kind of person you are.

398
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,680
[Teacher] Turn to page 100.

399
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,680
Did you use the cream I bought you?

400
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,080
I am using it now.

401
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,160
Thought you'd ignore it.

402
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,400
I've grown up, gotta use it.

403
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,880
My face will brighten.

404
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,520
Can't have acne ruining my charm.

405
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,000
Well,

406
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,600
Nick, someone called me a black hole today.

407
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,400
What's weird about that?

408
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,760
Black hole, what's the issue?

409
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,160
What did you mean by it?

410
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,360
Well,

411
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,840
you're like a mystery theory.

412
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,960
Sometimes mature in speech,

413
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,960
but your actions...

414
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,160
kinda childish.

415
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,120
Sometimes you're good,

416
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,120
other times a rebel.

417
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,280
Like a black hole, ready to absorb it all.

418
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,320
It's been a month already,

419
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,640
but I'm still not used to it.

420
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,640
Bangkok seems to have more to offer.

421
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,720
At least you get to sleep earlier there.

422
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,680
It's kind of suffocating.

423
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,480
Living with my parents feels like...

424
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,560
No freedom at all.

425
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,800
Hey, what do you feel like eating?

426
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,080
I can send you something.

427
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,920
No,

428
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,120
I'd rather see you in person.

429
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,280
Come visit me here sometime.

430
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,120
My mom said I can invite you.

431
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,480
I'm really busy these days.

432
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,240
Right after I finished tutoring you,

433
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,000
my schedule's packed for three months.

434
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,160
Kids are prepping for exams, you know.

435
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,320
So, we won't talk much anymore, right?

436
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,520
That’s why you barely reply during the day.

437
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,680
Now you'll see who forgets who.

438
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,600
You should be hitting the books too.

439
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,200
Tell me when you're free,

440
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,200
I might arrange to give you tutoring first.

441
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,200
I prefer just chatting casually.

442
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,840
Don't worry about my exams,

443
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,120
I'll pass them, no sweat.

444
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,080
When you said casual talks,

445
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,400
what do you want to talk?

446
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,560
William...

447
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,080
-Shakesbeer,
-Hey!

448
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,040
Be serious, Tod!

449
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,360
Alright,

450
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,520
how about...

451
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,200
Ever kissed anyone?

452
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,680
That's not casual talks.

453
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,920
Just answer casually. I am not serious.

454
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,080
Yes, I have.

455
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,760
Really? Who?

456
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,320
My partner.

457
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,120
Which one?

458
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,239
When was this?

459
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,239
A while back, don't recall.

460
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,480
Why?

461
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,239
Thinking of kissing someone?

462
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,440
No, just curious.

463
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,920
Ah,

464
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,800
a 16-year-old getting romantic thoughts?

465
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,880
Enough talk, I'm off to play football.

466
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,199
Wait up, Tod!

467
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,040
Who was that guy just now?

468
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,840
Looks familiar.

469
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,640
That's Third.

470
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,760
My junior from the university.

471
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,240
He just broke up with his girlfriend.

472
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,040
Thought it was someone from that companion app.

473
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,080
Haven't used that app much lately.

474
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,320
Need to save money now.

475
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,320
And I only hired two people ever, not a bunch like you.

476
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
That's good to hear.

477
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,680
Lately, that app's been chaotic,

478
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,200
full of randoms.

479
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,560
I used to hire them for lunch when I felt lonely.

480
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,720
Back when the app was popular.

481
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,600
Geez, didn’t you stop because of Tod?

482
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,120
Ever since you got close to him,

483
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,880
you've changed a lot.

484
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,560
Just be careful with a minor.

485
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,760
You're exaggerating.

486
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,360
Tod and I are like brothers.

487
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,760
And his parents have been very kind to me.

488
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,600
I just look out for him, that's all.

489
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,320
And now that he's gone,

490
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,160
you finally have time for me...

491
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
You’re so...

492
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,600
typical you.

493
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,240
But from now on,

494
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm gonna be swamped.

495
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,600
Got plans to wrap up tutoring

496
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,720
and start studying for a big exam.

497
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,520
Oh? Which exam?

498
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,800
I'm considering a scholarship in the States.

499
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,760
Thot's mom also offered me to help.

500
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,240
Now?

501
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,280
Isn't that a bit late?

502
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,360
Just giving it a shot. If it works out, great;

503
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,120
if not, no big deal.

504
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,960
I'm curious to see how far I can go with this.

505
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,960
Tod's planning to come back to Bangkok,

506
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,080
and I've... said yes to him staying at my place.

507
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,440
I mean,

508
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,600
his parents have been super kind to me.

509
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,080
And it wasn't easy to connect with Tod.

510
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,560
With him, I don't feel alone.

511
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,520
Sometimes I think...

512
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,720
having a younger brother might be better than an older one.

513
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,200
I'm glad to see you're not as sad as before.

514
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,520
If Tod really moves in next year,

515
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,800
maybe...

516
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,960
the universe you're looking for is right here.

517
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,920
[T.O.D.: Nick, my mom mentioned you're aiming for a U.S. scholarship?]

518
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,680
[Pluto: I'm teaching now. Will call you tonight.]

519
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,720
[Pluto]

520
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,880
[Pluto]

521
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,480
Call again, call again.

522
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,000
Just call again.

523
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:04,800
[Pluto: I applied for the scholarship because I am considerate of your mother. But it's difficult. I may not get it. And I promised you that you could stay with me.]

524
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,800
[Pluto: Don't be upset.]

525
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,000
[Pluto: Sending a voice message.]

526
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,520
[Pluto] Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry...

527
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,920
When you're mad, you ignore texts. Can't you change that.

528
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,720
You didn't reply me since the afternoon.

529
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,280
I was teaching, plus had to correct research papers. Busy all day.

530
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,720
- You must be worn out.
- And you? Why still up?

531
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,640
Disturbing your parents?

532
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,880
No, just stepped out for a chat.

533
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,760
Careful with mosquitos.

534
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,920
Listen to this.

535
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,280
Ouch!

536
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,120
That's what you get.

537
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,080
Grab some bug spray.

538
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,880
The bat's useless.

539
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,720
No, it stinks.

540
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,480
Then go to sleep, it's late.

541
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,480
Tomorrow's a day off.

542
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,240
No school, remember?

543
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,360
Right, forgot...

544
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:09,000
See? So buried in work I even forget the date.

545
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,320
Wait, it's still 2023, right?

546
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,960
You're funny, dude!

547
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,600
What about the long weekend? Got classes?

548
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,680
Ah, right, long weekend...

549
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,400
No wonder kids are booking me for tutoring.

550
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,160
We've hardly had time to chat lately.

551
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,400
You're not secretly dating someone, are you?

552
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,600
When would I even have the time to date? You crack me up.

553
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,600
Hey Tod, look, stars in the sky tonight.

554
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,960
Where? I don't see any.

555
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,720
Nope, no stars!

556
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,120
Dash, dot, dot, dot...

557
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,360
Dot, dash, dot...

O

569
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,240
Bro...

570
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,160
So you pretended not to understand that day?

571
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,200
What's up, Mom?

572
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,760
Just going over some research Nick asked me to review.

573
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,800
Umm,

574
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,160
So, is Nick really thinking about that scholarship you mentioned?

575
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,400
Not sure,

576
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,200
he seems hesitant. I don't want to push him.

577
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,520
I’ll let him decide.

578
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,920
Maybe Nick doesn't want to go.

579
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,720
He's been busy tutoring lately,

580
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:35,760
And I also talked to him about coming to Bangkok  to live with him.

581
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,600
You're making plans without consulting us?

582
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,240
Well, Mom makes decisions without asking me, too.

583
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,200
Don't be childish.

584
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,560
It's nice here. Why move to Bangkok?

585
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,520
But I've already signed up for the exam.

586
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,280
Nick even paid the fee.

587
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,000
Nick has his own stuff to deal with.

588
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,480
Why bother him with this?

589
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,800
I'm tired of being here.

590
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,400
Didn't you say that coming here would make everything better?

591
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,800
But after months,

592
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,360
nothing's improved.

593
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,240
Dad's barely home.

594
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,880
Don't you understand?

595
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,360
Your father has to work.

596
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,240
Don't care. I'm going to Bangkok.

597
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,520
Don't waste money. Stay here.

598
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,560
[Tod: How's your day going?
Had anything to eat yet?]

599
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,840
I might go back after we finish studying today.

600
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,800
Why, did Korn ask about you?

601
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,840
Yeah, he's just checking in.

602
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,360
You planning to leave too?

603
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,720
Or have other plans?

604
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,360
Not right away, might head into town to study.

605
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,120
This school feels eerie when it's empty.

606
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,680
Been months, still not used to it?

607
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,800
Not yet, doesn't feel like my place at all.

608
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,520
You've seemed down recently.

609
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,600
Something wrong?

610
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,840
Got stuff on my mind.

611
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,640
Just stressing over exams.

612
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,640
Why? Your midterm scores were okay.

613
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,520
Passing is already a blessing.

614
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,240
It's more than that.

615
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,880
Out of the blue, my mom won't let me go to Bangkok.

616
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,240
You never talked about it with your mom?

617
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,680
Never.

618
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,640
There you go, the black hole behavior...

619
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,960
Why make it so complex?

620
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,200
Who's a black hole?

621
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,720
-You, obviously!
-Are you stirring this?

622
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,680
Two times, two wholes, okay?

623
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,560
I am not scared.

624
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,920
Nick!

625
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,680
[Next Episode]
Slept late, didn't you?

626
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,760
Look who's talking! You're no different.

627
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,080
What's that full on legs.

628
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,280
Since we can't fix the root cause,

629
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,880
we’ll have to solve the aftermatch.

630
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,440
So, have you sold our house in Bangkok yet?

631
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,880
Not yet. I'm not planning to sell it.

632
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,320
So, does this mean

633
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,200
we can still go back to Bangkok, right?

634
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,800
Yes, it’s me.

635
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,680
I’m Todsapon's mom.

636
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,440
If you ace the exam, you may go to Bangkok.
