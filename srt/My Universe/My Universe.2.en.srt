00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,980
♫Just the way you look at me♫

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,940
♫Makes my heart melt♫

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,660
♫Get close to you and talk to you♫

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,340
♫I'm so nervous that I can barely breathe♫

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,860
♫A sense of unease overwhelmed me
and made me lost in the waves♫

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,700
♫Is this what they call a crush?♫

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,540
♫I'm like this when I see you♫

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,980
♫Are you the same as me?♫

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,740
♫Is your heart as hot and restless as mine?♫

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,740
♫Does my every move
make you nervous and tremble?♫

12
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,180
♫Do you have feelings for me too?♫

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,300
♫Only in this way can I calculate

♫Are you the same as me?♫

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,260

[Previously]

21
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,620
Rule number one.

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,140
You can't let anyone know who you are.

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,100
If anyone finds out you're Pleum,
not Kim, then...

24
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,060
You’ll have only 24 minutes left.

25
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,460
Why do I have to be in this damn body?

26
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,380
Hey!

27
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,020
Can you stop bothering my sister?

28
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,259
I talked to Aoon.

29
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,060
We decided to be friends.

30
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,180
Because I…

31
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,460
There’s someone I like.

32
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,580
That means

33
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,940
the real Kim is back.

34
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,780
If you don't want me to pursue your sister,

35
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,780
I have the right
to like someone else, right?

36
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,460
That's it, Mr. Kim.

37
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:11,500
Well...

38
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,060
Why do you want
Pleum’s phone number and his phone?

39
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,540
I want to pursue Khun Khao.

40
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,020
What?

41
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,380
Is it an aftermath of the electric shock?

42
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,420
Don't be surprised.

43
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,660
I just...

44
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,260
I want to know...

45
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,020
How Pleum pursued Khun Khao.

46
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,660
Also, what else can make

47
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,300
Khun Khao make up his mind to leave Pleum

48
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,820
and start over with me?

49
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,380
Oh, Mr. Kim.

50
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,130
Why do you work so hard?

51
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,900
I’ll just use it to play a trick.

52
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,540
Then I'll ask you to return it.

53
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,540
Uh...

54
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,860
How's mom?

55
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:46,500
I mean Pleum's mother.

56
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,900
Actually,

57
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,980
she didn't want to give it to me.

58
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,420
Because she said

59
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,020
that this is important to her son.

60
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,380
And she asked me many questions.

61
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,540
Then why did she agree in the end?

62
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,660
She asked for 200,000 baht more.

63
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,740
It’s 700,000 baht in total.

64
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,420
So she agreed?

65
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,300
Oh!

66
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,780
Why do you have his photos on your phone?

67
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,660
I just keep it to chat with Aoon.

68
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,860
Why didn't you delete it
after you saved them?

69
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,740
Do you want to keep it for yourself?

70
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,860
Pleum.

71
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,260
Why did you say that?

72
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,770
You really like him, don't you?

73
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,180
I don’t like him.

74
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,860
Aoon is the one who likes him.

75
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,220
Can we stop arguing
about these meaningless stuff?

76
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,420
Can you trust me just like how I trust you?

77
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,060
You sound like you care so much about me.

78
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,780
You hang out with your friends every day.

79
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,340
We don't look like
a couple anymore, you know?

80
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,780
You might not know

81
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,900
even if I secretly cheat on you.

82
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,620
Because you care nothing!

83
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,900
Khun Khao: If you want to cheat on me,

84
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,060
Khun Khao: then go ahead.

85
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,100
Pleum: Why are you mocking me?

86
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,820
Khun Khao: Who started it?

87
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,180
Khun Khao: If you trust me like I trust you,

88
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,780
Khun Khao: you won’t have to check anything.

89
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,860
So you’re upset that I checked your phone?

90
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,940
No.

91
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,300
But you always act up like this
after you’ve checked it.

92
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,220
Khun Khao: It's really annoying.

93
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,810
Pleum: Annoying?

94
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,180
Pleum: If you hate it so much,
why are you still with me?

95
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,340
Pleum: Then let's break up.

96
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:05,100
[Pleum: Can we talk tomorrow?]
Khun Khao: Okay. I hate it when things end up like this.
Pleum: I’m sorry. I really believe you can make me a better person.
Sorry for disappointing you and hurting you.
Pleum: See you on the balcony at 5 p.m. tomorrow. I have to tell you something.]

97
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:15,340
[Khun Khao: Where are you? I'm already here.
Pleum: The app shows that I'll be there in 24 minutes.
Khun Khao: Okay.
Khun Khao: Where are you? The sun is setting.]

98
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:22,260
[Khun Khao: I'm going home
if you’re not coming.]

99
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:36,180
[Khun Khao: Why are you doing this to me?
You're so cruel to me. Why? Is it because of me?]

100
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:48,300
[Khun Khao: Don't worry, Pleum. I believe
we'll meet again someday.]

101
00:06:49,820 --> 00:07:04,020
[Khun Khao I'll wait for you at the balcony.
If you miss me too, come and find me here.
Khun Khao: I'm sorry, Pleum.
I apologize if you see what I did today, but I miss you for real.]

102
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:12,620
[Khun Khao: I miss you. I want to talk to you.
I miss your nagging and scolding.]

103
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,940
[Khun Kao: Who's reading the message?]

104
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,460
Hello, Pun.

105
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,100
Do you have Pleum’s phone

106
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,700
with you?

107
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,900
Hello, mom.

108
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,090
I have a question.

109
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,659
Well,

110
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,290
have you let anyone
enter Pleum’s bedroom recently?

111
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,900
Yes.

112
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,300
Okay.

113
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:58,980
Uh...

114
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,740
Have you seen his phone?

115
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,380
Well...

116
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,220
Khun Khao wants the photos in his phone.

117
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:05,900
What?

118
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,050
How could you do that, mom?

119
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,460
Who did you sell it to?

120
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,580
Why didn't you just give them his number?

121
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,660
You even sold his phone?

122
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,020
Really?

123
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,220
Okay.

124
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,620
I see.

125
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,060
That's it, mom.

126
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,020
Bye.

127
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,780
So... Did your mom sell Pleum's phone?

128
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,700
Yeah.

129
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,380
Someone came to buy it.

130
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,780
He wanted Pleum’s number,

131
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,500
saying that it was a lucky number.

132
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,419
He even came to my house for it.

133
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:39,860
And he paid 700,000 baht.

134
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:40,539
Huh?

135
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:41,539
Really?

136
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,020
With 700,000 baht?

137
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,700
It’s true.

138
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,780
So my mom gave him the phone.

139
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,660
Then...

140
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
Did your mom tell you who she sold it to?

141
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:52,500
Well...

142
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,300
She didn't tell me.

143
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,060
He just showed up for a while

144
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,180
and paid the cash.

145
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,860
Damn it!

146
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,180
Will my video be leaked?

147
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,410
See?

148
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,100
You should’ve kept the phone
when I gave it to you.

149
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,460
It worths 700,000 baht.

150
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,020
My mom must have spent all her money
to buy lottery tickets.

151
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,260
If you keep it,

152
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,100
we can at least split the money.

153
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,010
Damn it!

154
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,420
But the person
who bought it is so nosy, right?

155
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,420
He secretly read the chat of a dead person.

156
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,300
Please?

157
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,460
Please get it for me.

158
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,820
Go get it yourself if you forget something.

159
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,940
I already starred in the MV for you.

160
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420
Don't ever ask me for help again.

161
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,140
Oh.

162
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,980
That's all.

163
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,500
Please go get it for me.

164
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,700
My dear sister.

165
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,460
Please...

166
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:51,900
Please...

167
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,380
Get it for me, please?

168
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,180
Did you forget something?

169
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Do you want me to get it for you?

170
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,380
He

171
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,540
left the bill in his room,

172
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,820
and he is now asking me to get it.

173
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,940
So annoying.

174
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,020
Where is it?

175
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,260
I can get it for you.

176
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:06,940
Hey.

177
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,300
It's okay, Mr. Kim.

178
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,100
Aoon...

179
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,500
Mr. Kim is here.

180
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,380
We need to finish the shoot quickly.

181
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,100
Please get it for me.

182
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:16,740
Fine.

183
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,140
Where is it?

184
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,020
I think...

185
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,980
It's either in the bag

186
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,900
or by the bed.

187
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,250
Just try to find it.

188
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,980
Hey, guys.

189
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,100
I'll take him
to the camera and have a rehearsal.

190
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,620
Okay.

191
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,740
Let's go, Kim.

192
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,130
I'll take you to the balcony.

193
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,380
Brother Kim, have you been here before?

194
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,100
Do you know
the balcony of your hotel is this beautiful?

195
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,260
I did.

196
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
Why wouldn’t I?

197
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,140
Then...

198
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,700
How many people have you brought here?

199
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,340
Only one.

200
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,820
Oh.

201
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,010
Who was that poor guy?

202
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,460
I'm not telling you.

203
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,420
Come and rehearse with me.

204
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,100
If you keep talking,

205
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,900
the teacher
won’t deduct your mark, because...

206
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,860
Your acting is great.

207
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,940
What did you just call me?

208
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,180
Well...

209
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,140
Since

210
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,940
you’re calling me Brother

211
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,940
but not “Mr.”, I want to call you

212
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,060
by your name too.

213
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,260
But your name is a bit long,

214
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,220
so I called you Khao.

215
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,860
It's nothing.

216
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,820
But no one called me that before.

217
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,340
Oh.

218
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,340
What do you want me to call you?

219
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,780
Call me whatever you want.

220
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,140
Okay.

221
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,780
How is it going?

222
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,580
You’re graduating soon
from the film studies.

223
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,780
What do you want to do

224
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,780
after that?

225
00:12:59,250 --> 00:12:59,940
Goodness.

226
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,900
You’re asking if as if we're close again.

227
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,140
Then let’s get closer.

228
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,540
If we're getting closer than we are now,

229
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,810
I'll have to call you “boyfriend”.

230
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,740
Uh…

231
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,300
What did you ask me just now?

232
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,100
Well...

233
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,420
What am I
going to do after graduation, right?

234
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,340
I think
I'll make some music videos like this.

235
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,980
And I might become a director and a screenwriter.

236
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,500
It might be a bit tiring

237
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,900
to work with my team.

238
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,900
Oh.

239
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,410
Everyone.

240
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,220
Over there!

241
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,580
Hey!

242
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,380
That guy

243
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,660
is very cunning.

244
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,300
He doesn’t even help us carry things.

245
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,940
Why do they suddenly look so close?

246
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,780
This is the power of electric shock!

247
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,580
You're right.

248
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,580
Did he use black magic on Kim?

249
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,460
But...

250
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,540
I heard from Pleum

251
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,900
that he hated Kim at first.

252
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,100
Because...

253
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,140
Kim is totally Khun’s type.

254
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,460
Besides,

255
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,060
Brother Pleum
found Kim's photo on Khun’s phone.

256
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,500
They even had a big fight.

257
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,660
Are you serious?

258
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,700
No wonder.

259
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,420
Khun always interrupts Aoon.

260
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,140
And he didn't look okay

261
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,860
when he found
that Aoon was chatting with Kim.

262
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,570
But I was also confused.

263
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,460
Does Kim never turn anyone doen?

264
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,020
I don't think it's strange.

265
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,140
My BL fantasy explodes

266
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,300
while watching this scene.

267
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,020
They're so lovey-dovey.

268
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,140
So cute.

269
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,100
Can you give me your hand?

270
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,740
How are things over there?

271
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,900
How have you been?

272
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,380
I'm fine.

273
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:52,740
What about you?

274
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,660
Do you have a new lover?

275
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,900
I miss you a lot.

276
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,820
I miss you too.

277
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,420
You've stopped peeking at me, right?

278
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,130
Do you still want to scold me
when I make you angry?

279
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,580
But I can't hear you, no matter

280
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,380
how badly you want to scold me.

281
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,340
If I were still here,

282
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,020
I won't yell at you.

283
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,100
I won't scold you.

284
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,820
I won't say anything.

285
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,740
So that you'll only remember my kindness.

286
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,860
You're not bad at all.

287
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,740
We...

288
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:51,700
Aoon.

289
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,140
We can talk after the shooting.

290
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,860
I don't want to ruin your work.

291
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,540
Just like how you ruined my feelings.

292
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:00,820
Aoon, I...

293
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,420
You know what?

294
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,980
The world changed

295
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,020
in the blink of an eye.

296
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,420
The universe has changed too.

297
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,380
Hey!

298
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,980
Why have things suddenly tensed up
between you and Aoon?

299
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,780
Did something happen?

300
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,970
I'll talk to her later.

301
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,220
Finish your work first.

302
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,580
I think you should explain to her first.

303
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,660
The universe changed.

304
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,380
I'm fine.

305
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,940
I don't have any new friends there.

306
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,580
I've been waiting to see you succeed.

307
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,180
I miss you.

308
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,940
I don't think it works.

309
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,060
We might have to shoot it again.

310
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,100
Let's watch the replay later.

311
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,820
Hello?

312
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,300
What's wrong, mom?

313
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,900
I'm filming right now.

314
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,140
What?

315
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,260
I’ll have a look first.

316
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,780
Hey.

317
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,180
My mom sent me a photo of the person
who bought Pleum's phone

318
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,700
from the CCTV footage of our house.

319
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,980
Was the person who bought Pleum’s phone

320
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,980
Brother Kim?

321
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,500
[Brother Pleum]

322
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,820
Why did you do that?

323
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:55,890
Khao...

324
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,260
Listen to me first.

325
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:57,980
I can explain.

326
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,300
Why did you do that?

327
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,220
Do you think I'm a joke?

328
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,020
I like you.

329
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,100
I just want to pursue you again.

330
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,780
I want to know why you like Pleum.

331
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,180
That's why you bought his phone,

332
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,370
so that you can secretly read our chat.

333
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,860
What a pervert.

334
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,410
I like you.

335
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,500
I’ve liked you way before Pleum did.

336
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,940
That's funny.

337
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,140
The one who used to call me that

338
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,620
was exactly Brother Pleum.

339
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,780
Can you please like me?

340
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,620
Consider it…

341
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,820
As compensation
for almost electrocuting me to death.

342
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,780
What are you talking about?

343
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,180
Okay.

344
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,820
I know you’re rich.

345
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,620
But your money...

346
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,380
It means nothing. It’s worthless.

347
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,300
But whatever it is,

348
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,220
no matter how rich you are,

349
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,820
you can't buy such things with money.

350
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,220
You bought Pleum's phone
to peek on our memories.

351
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,860
Let me tell you.

352
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,660
You’ll never replace Brother Pleum.

353
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,740
A scumbag like you

354
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,900
can't be compared
to Brother Pleum’s sincerity.

355
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,810
Please.

356
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,010
Don't make me be scared of you or hate you.

357
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,260
I mean it.

358
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,420
Don't make me be scared of you
or hate you even more.

359
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,780
One last thing.

360
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,940
All the expenses

361
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,260
for the MV,

362
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,700
the venue,

363
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,020
and the hotel,

364
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,180
I’ll take care of it myself.

365
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,420
Hey.

366
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,100
Let go of me.

367
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,020
Can I hug you one last time?

368
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,900
What are you doing?

369
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,180
It's me. I’m Brother Pleum.

370
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,380
I'm in this body.

371
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,300
You're scaring me.

372
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,780
What did you want to tell me that day

373
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,860
by sending me those words?

374
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,100
I'm right here.

375
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,700
You!

376
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,300
What were you trying to tell me?

377
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,460
Let go of me!

378
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,780
I was going to apologize!

379
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,660
What did you want to say?

380
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,900
Tell me now.

381
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,740
Let go!

382
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,820
I won't! Tell me!

383
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,170
I asked Brother Pleum out that day.

384
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,900
Because I wanted to break up with him.

385
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,700
Are you happy now?

386
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:41,180
♫You turn the thin air
into sweet fragrance of flowers♫

387
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:49,060
♫You make the dim stars
the way I dreamed of♫

388
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,780
♫You make the moment become eternity♫

389
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:59,300
♫Now my love is valuable♫

390
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,700
♫Because it's you♫

391
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,660
♫We move along the orbit
and meet like a dream♫

392
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,660
♫Light up each other♫

393
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,570
Kim.

394
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,820
-Wait! Hold on! -Hey!

395
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:32,830
Kim!

396
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,780
I know you’re rich.

397
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,540
But your money...

398
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,300
It’s not sincere at all.

399
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,180
As someone who used to be a playboy,

400
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,980
you can't never compare
to Brother Pleum's sincerity.

401
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,410
Kim!

402
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,540
-Wait! Hold on! -Hey, Kim!

403
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:34,700
♫You make the moment become eternity♫

404
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:40,140
♫Now my love is valuable♫

405
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,580
♫Because it's you♫

♫Light up each other♫

408
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,700
♫In a universe full of love♫

409
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,460
♫Because you changed my heart♫

410
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,980
♫I no longer feel lonely
in my universe because of you♫

411
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,580
♫You make the moment become eternity♫

412
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,700
You think I'm a terrible person, right?

413
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,780
Hey!

414
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,860
You even want me to die with you?

415
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,060
Are you... Kim?

416
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,860
You already have my body.

417
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,980
What do you want?

418
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,700
Kim, why does it have to be your body?

419
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,420
Well...

420
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,660
Do you think it's all my fault?

421
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,820
Do I need to apologize?

422
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,380
It's not entirely your fault.

423
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,580
Damn it!

424
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,380
I ruined everything.

425
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,540
I was upset at first…

426
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,940
When I saw you living in my body.

427
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,780
But when I saw you trying
to pursue Khun Khao with my body…

428
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,100
However...

429
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,220
You failed because of my past.

430
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,220
You deserve it.

431
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,340
You liked Khun Khao at that time, right?

432
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,900
If I was not dating him, you might...

433
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,180
Someone like me

434
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,460
will never win Khun Khao’s heart.

435
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,740
I...

436
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,980
I'm so jealous of you.

437
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,180
You dated Khun Khao.

438
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,340
Even though you've been dead for two years,

439
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,620
he still can't forget you.

440
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,020
But as you can see,

441
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,500
I went to see him that day.

442
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,940
But he told me
that he wanted to break up with me.

443
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,250
You know that too, right?

444
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,260
Khao likes you.

445
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,220
He has always liked you.

446
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,020
But every time I thought so,

447
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,340
I felt like a fool.

448
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,380
I thought our relationship
would be broken because of someone else.

449
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,340
But in fact, it was all because of me…

450
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,780
I never trusted Khun Khao.

451
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,860
Don't think that you have no chance.

452
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,530
Although you’re in my body,

453
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,260
the one on the inside is still you, Pleum.

454
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,780
You're the only one
who can make Khun Khao smile again.

455
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,860
But I've told Khun Khao
that it is me living in this body.

456
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,130
Why haven't I disappeared yet?

457
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,740
Because you didn't make Khun Khao believe...

458
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,540
That you’re the one inside.

459
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,740
And even if I want to return to this body,

460
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,940
I don't know how to live anymore.

461
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,980
But if you want to stay in my body...

462
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,580
Go after him,

463
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,090
or stay with him for a longer time.

464
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,610
You can have my body.

465
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,940
I'm happy
that you can make people around me smile.

466
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,100
And I believe

467
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,620
that you can become
a better version of me than I can.

468
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,660
I’m sorry, Kim.

469
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,020
I stole your body.

470
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,580
You don't have to apologize.

471
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,580
I should thank you more.

472
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,740
And I believe that you can be
the better Pleum and Kim than me.

473
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,700
Good luck.

474
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:49,340
♫You turn the thin air
into sweet fragrance of flowers♫

475
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:56,140
♫You make the dim stars
the way I dreamed of♫

476
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,180
Can I help you?

477
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,620
I'm sorry.

478
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:55,820
Hey.

479
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,540
It's okay.

480
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,900
You don't have to explain anything.

481
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,940
I understand.

482
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,780
I'm sorry.
I shouldn’t have said that to you.

483
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,100
I know you're doing what you should.

484
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,660
And I know…

485
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,100
How much you love and care about me.

486
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,620
You may be more mature than me now.

487
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,620
Let's go.

488
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,610
Let's go home.

489
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,260
Screw it.

490
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,500
What about the rest of the MV?

491
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,660
There's only one scene left.

492
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,300
Can't you ask Kim to finish it?

493
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,460
We’re almost done.

494
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,500
Dumbass.

495
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,700
Didn't you see that?

496
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:15,500
In other words,

497
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,500
Kim bought Pleum’s phone, his phone number, and read the chat

498
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,780
because he wants to pursue you.

499
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:22,980
Oh my God!

500
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,820
How frightening!

501
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,260
That’s scary.

502
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,740
But strangely,

503
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,420
Khet's secretary
has returned Pleum’s phone to me.

504
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,020
Do you want to keep it?

505
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,580
So...

506
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,340
He was just kidding?

507
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,660
What kind of person is that?

508
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,900
He’s so mean.

509
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,500
Uh…

510
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,100
Does your mom need to

511
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:54,940
return the money?

512
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,700
Do you think my mom is going to return it?

513
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,940
But Khet told her to keep it.

514
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,620
But strangely...

515
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,020
Kim called and apologized to my mom.

516
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,460
He said that she should pay
off the debt with the money.

517
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,739
And he asked me to take good care of her.

518
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,420
I don't think it's strange

519
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,219
that he’s not asking the money back.

520
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,500
But his words sound weird.

521
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,260
Does Kim tell fortune?

522
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,300
My mom said the same thing during our call.

523
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,219
What a jerk.

524
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,500
It's so creepy.

525
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,340
Uh,

526
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,090
but there's something more horrible.

527
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,580
I found this

528
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,739
on the balcony.

529
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,500
Here.

530
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,060
Read it.

531
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,420
Don't be surprised

532
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,340
by what I’m saying next.

533
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:44,100
Okay.

534
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,020
Kim's handwriting...

535
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,739
Is exactly the same as Pleum's.

536
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,620
I remember Pleum’s handwriting.

537
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,020
And one more thing...

538
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,340
I asked Khet's secretary
for his handwriting.

539
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,900
It doesn't look like
Pleum’s handwriting at all.

540
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,180
When I saw this card,

541
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,580
I got goosebumps.

542
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,780
Because...

543
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,620
It doesn’t look like

544
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,100
Kim's wording.

545
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,780
Muey: Are you saying...

546
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,300
That Pleum is parasitizing Kim’s body?

547
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,580
Pun: If it were me, I would believe it too.

548
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,260
Ohm: Hey!

549
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,940
Pleum has passed away for two years.

550
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,740
Muey: Kim changed
after you got him electrocuted.

551
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,100
And he lost two years of his memory.

552
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,860
Is it possible...

553
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,260
That the person in Kim's body

554
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,110
is really Pleum?

555
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,180

556
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:26,830
Oh.

557

Hey.

558
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,850
Who’s the one inside your body?

559
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,100
Is it Brother Pleum?

560
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,380
Is Brother Pleum the one inside?

561

I failed to maintain our relationship.

568
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,540
It's all my fault. I never trusted you.

569
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,500
I should have made you happier.

570
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,460
I know you're afraid of me now.

571
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,580
But don't be afraid.

572
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,300
I'll be gone in a few minutes.

This is the rule to stay in this body.

I should be the one to apologize.

If I had known
that you would leave like this that day,

588

I wouldn't have broken up with you.

You love me and care about me a lot.

596

Don't blame yourself, Khao.

606
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,140
You didn't look at me all the time, right?

607
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,340
You’re not scolding me secretly

609
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,580
But no matter how you scolded me,

I couldn't hear you.

611

I won't yell at you.

613

it’s normal
to be separated in life and death.

00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,380
Hey!

735
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,820
Let me tell you.

736
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,620
Nowadays, whether the screenwriters
are from Thailand or foreign countries,

737
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,900
they don't need that kind of experience
to write those scenes.

738
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,940
There are so many erotic movies.

739
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,700
Also...

740
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,540
Even if we haven’t done anything,

741
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,140
it doesn't mean
that I've never done it with someone else before.

742
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,220
Uh!

743
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,900
You haven't done anything with me, huh?

744
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,180
Mr. Kim.

745
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,420
What are you doing?

746
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,140
Mr. Kim.

747
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,380
What are you doing?

748
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:52,700
Well...

749
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,940
I’ll help you edit the MC scene.

750
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,100
By the way, you can really help.

751
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:00,820
Which role do you want to play?

752
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,020
A doctor?

753
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,300
A police?

754
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,500
A thief?

755
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,260
Or...

756
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,140
The male lead in Japanese porn?

757
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:09,780
I'm fine with anything.

758
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,020
Really?

759
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:11,410
Yes.

760
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,180
Then I'll be...

761
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:16,540
The servant.

762
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,900
Master Kim!

763
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,780
I want to be punished!

764
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,420
I want to be punished!

765
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,140
I want to be punished!

766
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:23,810
I want to be punished!

767
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,700
♫Are you the same as me?♫

768
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:35,500
♫Is your heart
as hot and restless as mine?♫

769
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:41,460
♫Does my every move
make you nervous and tremble?♫

770
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,300
♫Do you have feelings for me too?♫

771
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,860
Kim!

772
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,260
What are you laughing at?

773
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,820
♫I like every IG post of yours♫

774
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,500
♫I always peek at you
whenever someone gets close to you♫

775
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,460
♫I always like to praise you inadvertently♫
