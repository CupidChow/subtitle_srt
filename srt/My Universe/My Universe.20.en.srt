[Previous episode]
If Tod really moves in next year,

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
maybe...

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,840
the universe you're looking for is right here.

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,400
Tod!

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,960
there are stars in the sky tonight.

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,240
Dash, dot, dot, dot...

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Nick!

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,680
You said you had a hectic teaching week.

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,600
How come you're here?

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,280
Someone told me to add his name to my schedule today.

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,560
You look thinner.

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,120
Your face seems worn.

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,400
Staying up late?

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,800
Look who’s talking?

36
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,720
Same goes for you.

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,920
And these marks here, here, and here... what are they?

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,079
Where to now?

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,200
-Check this out!
- Check what?

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,440
-Here... acetic acid.
-No, it’s not.

41
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,160
Is this your handiwork?

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,400
Yep, all mine.

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
-Great!
-Stop it! I'm flattered.

44
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,200
Close it already! Go there...

45
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,560
If the source is unsolvable, tackle the symptoms.

46
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,880
Your sudden visit caught me unprepared.

47
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,960
No need to prepare anything.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,320
Seing you've gained weight makes me happy.

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,880
You said you didn't like anything,

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,680
but surely not food.

51
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,800
Already teasing about my weight?

52
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,840
Can't you find another joke?

53
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,000
Focus on your exam.

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,520
Don't get distracted.

55
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,640
Like earlier, more play than study.

56
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,720
Is he the one who calls you a black hole?

57
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,760
Yeah, he's the twin.

58
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,720
We've been study buddies lately.

59
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,640
He's smart,

60
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,800
but not as much as you.

61
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,040
His tutoring style differs from yours.

62
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,520
Keep this repellent.

63
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,680
If it's a hassle, no need to call me outside the house.

64
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,560
I try to wrap up early.

65
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,080
And talking curfew at 10 p.m.

66
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,000
What? Curfew?

67
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,360
Are you setting new rules?

68
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,400
It's because I care.

69
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,920
Mosquito bites on you are like they're on me.

70
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,000
Then I feel responsible.

71
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,840
Overdramatic, much?

72
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,880
Look here!

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,360
Sharpshooter, that's me.

74
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,160
Oh, I miss it.

75
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,040
Watch me!

76
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,360
I miss it too.

77
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,360
Not my best performance today.

78
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,400
Already tired?

79
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,680
Man, aging hits hard, huh?

80
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,960
Truth is, I'm tired too.

81
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,440
Since you're here,

82
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,040
why not stay here a few nights?

83
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,720
That’s a pity.

84
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm tied up today, and tomorrow's full of classes.

85
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,159
Was gonna bring some stuff over,

86
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,600
but forgot it all.

87
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,440
Thought of bringing my laptop too.

88
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,440
Left it at home in the end.

89
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,200
Hey, stop it!

90
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,640
Not just my legs,

91
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,040
now my arms too?

92
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,840
Haven't I said I don't like that?

93
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,840
You know, today's been my happiest day.

94
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,280
You call me dramatic, yet you're the same.

95
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,280
Next time, skip the surprise, okay?

96
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,080
If you plan to visit, just tell me.

97
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,480
We'll find a nice place to eat together.

98
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,560
I came without expectations.

99
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,560
Just to see you like this.

100
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,200
Nick,

101
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,240
can I ask something?

102
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Of course.

103
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,080
Do you treat me nicely just because my mom helped you out?

104
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,240
Partly, but not entirely.

105
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,080
Remember when Cham hit me?

106
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,480
I was ready to return your mom's money that day.

107
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,960
And to stop tutoring you.

108
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,159
Ah, I see...

109
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,640
Back then, I didn't want you to put up with me either.

110
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,880
I felt like a meteorite

111
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,680
constantly crashing into you.

112
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,360
But we should thank certain meteors that hit us.

113
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,040
Those wounds from that day,

114
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,240
they brought you back to study with me.

115
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,640
And who's calling you a black hole?

116
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,520
I think it's quite correct.

117
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,600
So this black hole thing, is it good or bad?

118
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,840
I'm confused now.

119
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,800
The real reason I'm here today is
because I want to confess something...

120
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,400
I haven't been calling you much lately

121
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,520
because Champ asked to stay with me temporarily.

122
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,400
But... he won’t stay for long.

123
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,800
Then why'd you let him move in?

124
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,320
You know Cham is good to me too

125
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,920
He dropped out of school and worked
to support me until I graduated.

126
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,840
Did he just ask for a place to stay?

127
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,000
He hasn't troubled you this time, right?

128
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,760
Can you promise not to tell your mom?

129
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,440
No, she's even more bipolar now.

130
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,320
If she finds out, she'll never let me live with you next year.

131
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,720
But here's my promise...

132
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,800
If we move in together,

133
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,640
I won't let Champ interfere with you.

134
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,520
But before next year,

135
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,200
you've got to get through this year, right?

136
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,640
I have to go, or I'll miss my flight.

137
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,920
Nick!

138
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Can you ask Champ to leave?

139
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,680
[Pluto: I've already told Champ to leave.]

140
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,800
[T.O.D.: Have a good day at work, okay?]

141
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,040
[T.O.D.: I'm off to study with my friends.]

142
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,360
[Pluto: Take care!]

143
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,320
Champ, have you seen my laptop?

144
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,280
Didn't you take it? I saw you with your bag.

145
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,520
I thought so, but it wasn't in there.

146
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,080
So, you think I took it?

147
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,480
Did you?

148
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,600
Got any proof? Don't accuse me without evidence.

149
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,800
Pawned it again, didn't you?

150
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,880
Just tell me where, I'll get it back.

151
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,800
You have cash, huh?
Why not just lend it when I asked?

152
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,920
Do you even see me as your brother anymore?

153
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,320
And you? Do you still see me as your brother?

154
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,600
I paid for that laptop, remember?

155
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,480
Whether it's lost or sold, that's my call.

156
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,360
But it's mine.

157
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,520
Where'd you pawn it? Just tell me...

158
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,920
Tell me now!

159
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,160
Hey there!

160
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:25,080
[Kun: How's it going? You looked off today. Feeling okay?]

161
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,760
[T.O.D.: Yeah, just a small argument with mom.]

162
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:40,760
[Kun: Wanna study together over a call?]

163
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,120
[T.O.D.: I'm sleepy. See you tomorrow morning.]

164
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,320
[Kun: Remember to bring your dad’s cofee.]

165
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,640
[T.O.D.: Alright, night.]

166
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,080
Why are you up so late, Tod?

167
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,920
Was waiting for you to get back.

168
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,360
Using your phone in the dark will ruin your eyes.

169
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,720
You could join mom in bed.

170
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,000
I’ll sleep on the sofa.

171
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,600
Sleeping down here will only hurt your back.

172
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,520
Better go to bed,

173
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
you've got school tomorrow.

174
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,840
Have you been busy lately? You're hardly home.

175
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,480
Always out early, home late.

176
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,960
Yeah, this job's harder than in Bangkok.

177
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,240
Tougher work, less pay.

178
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,920
So, has mom sold the house in Bangkok yet?

179
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,760
Not yet. I don't want to sell.

180
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,560
That's why I try to earn money to support us all.

181
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,680
Does this mean we may have to return to Bangkok?

182
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,200
Want to move back there?

183
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,720
Mom didn't tell you about my Thawiwat school exam?

184
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,160
Heard something about it. When's the test?

185
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,160
Next month.

186
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,680
Just study but take it easy.

187
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,360
Could you talk to mom about it?

188
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,720
She seems against the idea.

189
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,000
Then let's drop the plan.

190
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,960
Seems like your mom doesn't want to go back to Bangkok.

191
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
I've tried convincing her several times,

192
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,640
doesn't look hopeful.

193
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,720
I'll get ready for a shower.

194
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,760
How about this?

195
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,079
You want to move in with Nick, right?

196
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,359
Maybe Nick can talk to her.

197
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,920
She might listen to him.

198
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,640
Thank you!

199

The number you have dialed cannot be reached at the moment...

202
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,560
[Pluto]

203
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,800
Hello, Nick. Where did you disappear to?

204
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,680
Tod...

205
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,520
My mom, she passed away.

206
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,520
Sorry for not telling you...

207
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,120
I'm so sorry.

208
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,360
Why are you up so early, anyway?

209
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,600
Where are you now?

210
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,880
In Chiang Mai. Just finished funeral prep.

211
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,560
I’ll ask my parents to take me to you.

212
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,320
No, don't bother.

213
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,720
It's only a three-day thing,

214
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
and I prefer keeping it low-key.

215
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,360
I might be busy for a while,

216
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,200
a lot of things to handle.

217
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,440
You just focus on your studies,

218
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,320
don't worry about me.

219
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,120
I want to be there to support you.

220
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,720
Don't come. It's a long way,

221
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,120
and tickets are pricey. Don't tell your parents.

222
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,440
I'll reach out after it's over.

223
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,400
But Nick, your mom just died. I should be there.

224
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,520
Nick, I really am sorry.

225
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,800
Hello... Nick...

226
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:10,160
[Pluto: Sorry for hanging up.]

227
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,600
[Pluto: We'll talk later.]

228
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,000
-I don’t know.
-How can I do this?

229
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,160
-It's simple. Can’t figure it out?
-Nope, I can’t.

230
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,840
-This one?
-How about a different question?

231
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,320
Finished the others, just this one left. Got it?

232
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,800
Done? Can I see?

233
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,960
Attention! Mr. Todsaphon, grade 9, room 1,
please report to the principal's office immediately.

234
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,800
Attention! Mr. Todsaphon, grade 9/1
please report to the principal's office immediately.

235
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,080
Come in, Todsaphon!

236
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,560
Here’s your chance to confess.

237
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,680
What were you up to sneaking into the science lab?

238
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,280
Well, I...

239
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,040
This boy is a tutor close to Tod.

240
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,920
He came to visit at home that day.

241
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,880
Tod's mother asked him to visit Tod at school.

242
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,720
That's not the point here, sir.

243
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,080
Your son was bringing an outsider, who is not a school staff, inside.

244
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,200
You saw the video, right?

245
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,200
Yes, I watched it.

246
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,200
But I don't see these two doing anything more than
just sitting and chatting.

247
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,200
What are you trying to imply?

248
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,040
You're defending your son in the wrong way.

249
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,720
The actions of your son in this video...

250
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,040
don't seem to be just brotherly, as you think.

251
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,320
And also... lifting the legs to apply the ointment like this,

252
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,880
you think that's normal behavior?

253
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,480
This is too much.

254
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,400
You're implying something more than what we can see.

255
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,560
And as I said, that man is like a real brother to Tod.

256
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,280
Regarding sneaking into the room without permission,

257
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,360
it’s wrong, I agree.

258
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,720
If you want to punish my son for that,

259
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,560
it's understandable.

260
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,880
But let's not dive into baseless speculation.

261
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,720
I know my son.

262
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,440
If we just imagine and blame children like this,

263
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,560
how can we be good adults?

264
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,080
Honestly, you didn't need to defend me.

265
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,320
Even if the principal or you had criticized me,
it wouldn't have affected me.

266
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,440
I knew it wouldn't bother you.

267
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,360
But I don't see any reason to scold you.

268
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,160
Hearing the principal say that stuff... just made me think,

269
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,560
what era are we in now?

270
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,920
I'm really your son, aren't I?

271
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,280
-You mean that in a good way, right?
-Of course!

272
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,400
Where's mom today?

273
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,880
Why did you come instead?

274
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,240
She's at Nick's mom's funeral in Chiang Mai.

275
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,200
But she'll be back tonight.

276
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,120
Oh, Nick asked me not to tell mom and dad.

277
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,600
Has mom talked to Nick?

278
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,880
She went without telling Nick either.

279
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,320
She tried calling since morning but got no response.

280
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,760
She's just as worried about Nick as you are.

281
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,440
I know you've always wanted an older brother.

282
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,680
Your feelings for Nick are just brotherly,
right? Not what the principal implied.

283
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,440
Your mom always says I don't pay enough attention to you.

284
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,160
But I want you to know;

285
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,160
although I am not always attentive

286
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,680
it doesn't mean I don't care about you.

287
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,960
My son is so headstrong.

288
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,960
So hard-headed that I don't know if there's any water in there

289
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,200
since it never seems to leak out.

290
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,360
Shall we follow mom to see Nick?

291
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,080
How much is a flight?

292
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,440
You should head back to class.

293
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,520
I've got to get to work.

294
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,600
See you at home.

295
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,480
[Khon Kaen (KKC) > Chiang Mai (CNX) 3,820 baht.]

296
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,720
-Everything okay there?
-Yeah.

297
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,480
He's left with just his brother.

298
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,480
It’s just very sad though.

299
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,040
Here, Nick sent these for you.

300
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,520
Give Nick some time, alright?

301
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,080
He asked you to focus on your exams.

302
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,520
We've talked about letting you move to Bangkok with him.

303
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,520
If you pass the exam, you can go there.

304
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Really, mom?

305
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,200
Yes, but pass the exam first.

306
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,080
After tonight, mom and dad can go to bed first.

307
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,880
I'll sleep on the sofa here.

308
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,960
I’ll study harder to pass the exam.

309
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,840
[T.O.D.: Everything will be okay, bro! I'm always here for you, always supporting you.]

00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:11,160
[T.O.D.: Heading into the exam now.]
[Pluto: I'm teaching until 6, will call you right after.]

312

313
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,920

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,560

6:00 p.m.

316
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,400
Hey, Nick. Just got out of my exam

317
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,240
How'd it go?

318
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,680
Almost didn't finish,

319
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,120
but I managed to complete it.

320
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,040
See, I told you.

321
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
Without your help last week,

322
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,200
I might not have made it.

323
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,080
Done teaching for the day?

324
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,880
Actually, I ended up not teaching today. The student cancelled.

325
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,960
Oh, why's that?

326
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,120
I'm currently looking at new condos.
Will send you pictures of the room soon.

327
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,520
Really?

328
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,120
So, Champ didn't move, did he?

329
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,040
Does that mean you're moving out instead?

330
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,520
Not exactly.

331
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,240
Right now, I don't think Champ will bother me for a bit.

332
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,800
Just for a bit?

333
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,160
So, he might come back to bother you?

334
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,200
By the way, which area are you looking in?

335
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,720
Pick somewhere near my school.

336
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,960
I don't want a long walk.

337
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,320
And I'd rather not wake up too early.

338
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,560
I'm scouting near your school,

339
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,280
but also considering other areas.

340
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,600
I haven’t decided to move yet,

341
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,240
need to save a bit more.

342
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,240
Thinking about getting a loan this time,

343
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,400
seems like a good investment.

344
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,560
If I move there, I’ll ask my parents to help with your expenses.

345
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,040
No worries. I've got it all planned out,

346
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,840
including stuff for you.

347
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,920
Tod, I've made my decision.

348
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,160
I’m not going to America.

349
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,600
I'd rather stay here, look after you,

350
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,040
watch you grow up.

351
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,680
See how high school life treats you.

352
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,600
Even if the exam results aren't great,

353
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,000
it's fine.

354
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,440
I'll always support you.

355
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,160
We'll wait for the day we can live together...

356
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,480
still orbiting around each other, right?

357
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,840
When do you have to return to Chiang Mai?

358
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,680
In two months, after the hundredth day of my mom’s passing.

359
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,640
Just hypothetically,

360
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,480
If I don’t pass any exams

361
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,280
and we don't end up living together,

362
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,960
would you be sad?

363
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,640
Yeah, I’d be.

364
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,480
The last time I left you, I was very upset.

365
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,480
Especially when you didn't read my texts on the way back,

366
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,360
it hit me even harder.

367
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,120
I hate seeing you upset or hurt.

368
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,680
I really wanted Champ out of your life for good,

369
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,560
But during Mom's funeral, Champ actually helped me a lot.

370
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:30,360
Back then, I should've used the money you gave
to fly over and be with you.

371
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,800
I want to know how you're doing. Can you eat?

372
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,840
Are you sleeping okay? I'm really worried.

373
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,160
I'm very worried about you.

374
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,440
I'm okay now.

375
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,240
That day when Mom went to see you,

376
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,760
what did you guys talk about?

377
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,240
Why did she suddenly agree to let me live with you?

378
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,360
Not telling. It's a secret.

379
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,840
Hey, I even spilled about the principal's office incident.

380
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,880
Change the subject...

381
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,480
How about this? My turn to ask.

382
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,880
Hypothetically...

383
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,120
What if I changed my mind and went to America?

384
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,160
But you just told me today you're not going, right?

385
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,800
Just hypothetically.

386
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,520
I'd be heartbroken,

387
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,920
especially after what you said after my exam.

388
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,720
So sad that you cried, like real tears?

389
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,880
I'm not you.

390
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,200
ince we've known each other, you've cried way more than me.

391
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,120
True, but I've never seen you cry.

392
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,160
Are tears rare for you?

393
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,920
Do you remember the last time you cried?

394
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,000
Maybe when I was little... when my granny died.

395
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,560
You should let your tears out when you're sad. It helps.

396
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,560
Nah,

397
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,280
I guess I haven't felt sad enough to cry yet.

398
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,840
You really are tough, just like your dad said.

399
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,000
Back to your hypothetical question...

400
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,480
Are you still unsure about going to America?

401
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,040
Is that it?

402
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,040
Well... I did apply,

403
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,040
but I doubt I'll get in.

404
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,640
What? But mom said you weren’t going.

405
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,120
Yeah, actually your mom helped me with the application.

406
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,640
So, if you do get it, would you really pass up the chance?

407
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,240
I might.

408
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,160
If I have to move there, it's worrying.

409
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,320
Going there for five years,

410
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,159
and maybe longer if I land a job.

411
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,520
Some scholarship recipients even got to work at NASA.

412
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,520
But not going would be a huge letdown for me.

413
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,760
It's these worries that keep me on the fence.

414
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,719
Quiet, huh?

415
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,480
When did you submit your application?

416
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,360
Right at the deadline.

417
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,520
After I applied for my exam?

418
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,360
Tod...

419
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,320
I haven't made up my mind about going.

420
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,560
But doing this feels like a betrayal.

421
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Okay, sorry about that.

422
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,080
What can I do to make it up to you?

423
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,000
No need to. It's just the way things are.

424
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,400
Come on Tod, don't be upset.

425
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,560
Fine, fine. I'll drop by next week.

426
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,600
Which day? Tell me the day.

427
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,400
Saturday. I'll stay the night,

428
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,600
-the entire night.
-For two nights?

429
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,160
Alright, two nights then.

430
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,640
And promise you won't go to America.

431
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,080
Okay, I promise I won’t go.

432
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,960
Hello?

433
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,400
Yes, it's me.

434
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,320
This is Todsaphon's mom.

435
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,680
Yes!

436
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,800
From Thawiwat Sueksa School, right?

437
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,640
Yes, thank you very much.

438
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,000
Hey, Tod. What's going on? I'm teaching, will call back...

439
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,120
Nick, I flunked the test.

440
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,560
Oh... really

441
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,520
[Nick to his student]
Terd, read this for now, I'll be back soon.

442
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,920
Now what do I do?

443
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,680
Did you try applying somewhere else? Maybe you'll get lucky...

444
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,960
I think I won’t go live with you.

445
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,520
You said you wanted to see me grow.

446
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,080
I also want to know what my life will be like in high school.

447
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,800
It might be better if I stay with my parents.

448
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,680
You passed the exam. The school called to inform.

449
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,560
Aren’t you happy, Mom?

450
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,360
Nick also got a scholarship in the States,

451
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,440
but he said he'd turn it down...

452
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,600
If he was going to reject, he should have done it already.

453
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,560
Still haven't seen his decision,

454
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,640
not sure what he's waiting for.

455
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,640
He never told me he got the scholarship.

456
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,160
And he recently said

457
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,040
even if he did, he'd reject it.

458
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,960
I think Nick should go to America.

459
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,920
Don’t worry about me.

460
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,320
I can stay comfortably with my parents.

461
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,400
Let's just say... we have tried our best.

462
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,120
But I promised you that I wouldn't go.

463
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,640
If you weren't going, you would've said no by now.

464
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,360
I know you're eager to go.

465
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,080
Just go.

466
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,680
It might be time for Pluto...

467
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,920
to become part of the solar system again.

468
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,640
I'm sorry I didn't cry.

469
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,160
But no tears doesn't mean I'm not upset.

470
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,280
I get it, really.

471
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,680
Go as far as you can.

472
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,840
Go to the farthest reaches of the universe.

473
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,160
If you encounter a black hole,

474
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,800
I'll be waiting for you at the event horizon.

475
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,880
And what if I don't go after all?

476
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,440
Then come back.

477
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,440
Don't forget, there are black holes in Thailand too.

478
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,760
Like Tod's black hole, right here...

479
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,560
[Present]

480
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,320
Spray some on me too.

481
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,920
-Doesn't smell bad now?
-Nope, not at all.

482
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,160
You can bathe me too.

483
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,040
Oh, wait a sec!

484
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,680
-Here, some snacks.
-Alirght.

485
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,480
Kun!

486
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:33,800
Huh?

487
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,600
Actually, I passed the exam that day.

488
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,000
Oh!

489
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,480
Then why did you tell me you failed?

490
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,880
There were several reasons.

491
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,720
Wanted to stay with my folks,

492
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,080
and...

493
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,320
Was it because of that guy who visited us?

494
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,160
Yes!

495
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,240
Still in touch with him?

496
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,840
Not much.

497
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,240
He must be busy with studies.

498
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,240
He only replies occasionally.

499
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,040
That's not strange.

500
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,560
These days, I'm also talking to many people.

501
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,920
Chatting and then they disappear.

502
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,440
Maybe they're in another world.

503
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,080
An hour for us might be seven years for them.

504
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,320
Kun!

505
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,600
Sorry, dude,

506
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,960
for everything that's happened.

507
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,960
It's okay.

508
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,040
Being friends is great, right?

509
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,360
I understand.

510
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,480
Hearing your story about him,

511
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,640
I understand now.

512
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,280
No wonder you still miss him.

513
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,200
You know what...

514
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,520
If back then...

515
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,280
I had known it was our last meeting,

516
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,520
I would've...

517
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,280
So, haven't seen him since?

518
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,320
Nope.

519
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,520
He took the scholarship at the last minute

520
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,760
and flew out a few weeks later.

521
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,160
He said he’d come

522
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,200
but never showed up in the end.

523
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,280
You were really angry at the principal then, right?

524
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,400
Everyone at school gossiped about it,

525
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,520
especially after that science lab video leaked.

526
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:46,920
Actually,

527
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,440
you should have taken action against her.

528
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,320
She might have leaked the clip, I guess.

529
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,360
Let it be.

530
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:09,480
At least that clip is the only evidence...

531
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,320
that he and I ever touched.

532
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,720
You said like you and he never touched.

533
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,440
Hard to believe, but

534
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,040
we barely ever touched.

535
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,280
Except that one time and...

536
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,480
Hello?

537
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,120
Oh, really?

538
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,880
Tod, can you help Nick with this? I'll be right back.

539
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,720
Alright.

540
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,520
Here’s a tissue.

541
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,720
A tissue!

542
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,480
Just leave it. I can apply it myself.

543
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,720
You see the wound on your face?

544
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,600
My hand is already clean.

545
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,520
Don’t worry about pain, I have a gentle touch.

546
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,880
Hold still!

547
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,480
Tod, do you think the universe has an end?

548
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,280
And if it does, where would that be?

549
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,640
As long as the world keeps spinning

550
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,360
and time keeps moving like this,

551
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:18,360
then the universe will never end.

552
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,360
Your answer sounds familiar.

553
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,520
Is that the answer you were looking for?

554
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,760
From what you've told me,

555
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,560
this theory you once told me about

556
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,120
seems to work the best.

557
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,560
Tod, I've gotta head out,

558
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,800
they're calling for me.

559
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,040
Once I'm there, I’ll call you often.

560
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,000
Hypothetically,

561
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,280
if I decide not to go to America

562
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,000
and Tod comes to live with me,

563
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,840
maybe the universe I'm searching for
is just in a room with you.

564
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,440
You're set to fly soon, too late for second thoughts.

565
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,120
Saying that, I could change my mind and keep you here.

566
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,800
If we stick together,

567
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,840
it might not be as sad as it is now.

568
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,640
Before I go,

569
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,440
we should see each other one last time.

570
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,520
That day you came here,

571
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,000
if I'd known it was our final goodbye,

572
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,480
I would've hugged you tight,

573
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,040
just once...

574
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,800
one hug would've been enough.

575
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,440
Nick!

576
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,920
You mean the universe to me.

577
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,120
[Next Episode]
So... is this person dead?

578
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,120
Just look at him!

579
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,560
Awake at last, huh?

580
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:51,360
You... we had an appointment today, right?

581
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,200
Bringing me to this no-signal spot...

582
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,200
You’re not planning to kill me, are you?

583
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,560
We had not agreed on an overnight rate.

584
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,320
Plus, I don't do overnights with just anyone.

585
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,560
Can you tell me...

586
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,440
What do you normally have to do when someone rents you?

587
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,320
Using the term 'rent', huh?

588
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,520
It involves a bit of psychology.

589
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,440
Dislike veggies? Favorite hangouts? Movie preferences?

590
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,400
-Ever bumped into a ghost?
-Gosh!

591
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,520
Sounds like after-sales service..

592
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,120
But from what I hear,
it seems like you just keep the conversation going.

593
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,280
That's harsh... really harsh.

594
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,240
Hey... let's toast!

595
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,240
When women talk to each other,

596
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,800
why does everything seem so simple?

597
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,240
So you're not going to leave
your job as a travelling companion, right?

598
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,520
If you don't quit, I'm breaking up with you, deal?

599
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,520
You knew that already, didn't you?

600
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,520
