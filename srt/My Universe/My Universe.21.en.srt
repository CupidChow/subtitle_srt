00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,520
♫Just a single glance, from your eyes straight to mine,♫

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,239
♫and my heart starts to melt.♫

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,400
♫As I come closer, I talk to you,♫

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,760
♫ I tremble, till I'm almost breathless.♫

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,840
♫ A restlessness overwhelms me, losing myself in the tide.♫

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,040
♫Is this what they call symptoms of love,♫

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,320
♫It happens every moment,♫

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,760
♫when I get a glimpse of you,

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,840
♫Are you feeling like me, perhaps,♫

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,320
♫A burning, restless whirl within the heart, do you feel so?♫

[Cash only, no scanning here].

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,039
Sir!

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,320
Sir!

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,560
Sir!

25
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,600
Come on, he's pretty heavy.

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,920
That’s bad.

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,360
-Carry him well.
-Boo!

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,880
Bro, is it you who pick up my call?

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,360
So...

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,240
he's already dead, right?

31
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,280
Well, just look at him.

32
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,120
Your friend isn't dead, just drunk.

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,960
But he vomited already, right?

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,200
Yep, he did.

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
So...

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,280
You can go ahead and close the shop.

37
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,160
I'll handle the rest.

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,720
Thanks for coming

39
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,600
Without you, I wouldn't have been able to go home.

40
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,160
Wait!

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,120
You´ll have to pay a fine for your friend's vomiting.

42
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,120
How much?

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,720
Three thousand baht.

44
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,079
Got a QR code for that?

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,560
How about I pay tomorrow...

46
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,400
ATM's down the road, 500 meters.

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,080
You can withdraw and come back.

48
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,520
Here's the thing,

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,960
I'm not anything special with him.

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,840
I just called him because...

51
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,880
he's got work for me tomorrow.

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,680
-And...
-But...

53
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,880
it's just three thousand.

54
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,040
Um, you're saying that's not much?

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,440
It's the rule here.

56
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
If you don't pay,

57
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,160
do I have to?

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,360
What if we do this?

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,840
When my friend wakes up,

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,120
I'll have him transfer the payment right away.

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,079
That won't work.

62
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,960
I know it. Wait a moment.

63
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,440
You can transfer to my account.

64
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,520
But if you scan into my account,

65
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,800
I'll charge an extra five hundred.

66
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,400
Ha! You're finally up!

67
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
Is it...

68
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,800
the appointment we planned for today?

69
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,520
Sorry for kidnapping you like this.

70
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,280
Was just going to confirm our meeting last night,

71
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
but the waiter said you were too drunk.

72
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,880
I didn't know who else to call...

73
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,000
Sir!

74
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,080
Whoa, sir!

75
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,480
Come on, he's too heavy.

76
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,159
Shit!

77
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,240
Really?

78
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,120
I don't remember anything.

79
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,520
You were completely drunk and had passed out until now.

80
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,880
Okay, my bad.

81
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,280
By the way, where are we?

82
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,880
A national park. The one I mentioned.

83
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,720
Oh, the bird-watching place, right?

84
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,680
Is it here?

85
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,480
Once we're done, I'll sort out the refund through the app.

86
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,800
Is it okay, earth?

87
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,760
-Earth? My name's Third!
-Oh, shit!

88
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,040
Terd, I’m sorry.

89
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,800
It's fine.

90
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,400
I would be angry if you canceled it.

91
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,320
You really wanted to come here with me?

92
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,960
Forgot to say, there's no signal here.

93
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,240
Hand-holding counts as a service, huh?

94
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,840
Jeez!

95
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,600
Just hand-holding, right?

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,680
Friends do that, it's normal.

97
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,440
Well, have you eaten anything yet?

98
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,840
Order whatever, my treat.

99
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,919
Think you're the only one with money?

100
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,720
Did you go shopping?

101
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,880
What did you buy shopping?

102
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,559
Why didn't you tell me? I could've helped with the bags.

103
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,840
Got free hands?

104
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,640
No need for sarcasm.

105
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,720
I'm hustling so I don't lean on you like before.

106
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,600
Prang!

107
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,280
By the way, I’m taking a trip with pals tomorrow.

108
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,880
Just a heads-up, so you can't say I didn’t tell you.

109
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,520
Telling me now and leaving tomorrow isn't exactly 'advance notice'.

110
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,840
So... are you going with whom?

111
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,680
Just friends.

112
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,840
Going with whom?

113
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,720
Mei? Amy?...

114
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,760
June?

115
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,440
Say the name. I know all of your friends.

116
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,640
A new friend. You haven't met them.

117
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,600
I'll have spaghetti carbonara, and...

118
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,920
a small Hawaiian pizza,

119
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,720
and...

120
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,600
-what will you have?
-Beer, please.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,880
Nice choice. We've got a beer deal, 10 plus 2 free.

122
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,280
Just two bottles, thanks.

123
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,760
The promotion, 10 plus 2, right?

124
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,920
Yes, sir. 10 plus 2.

125
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,440
-Just two then.
-Just two bottles?

126
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,400
Make it two sets, please.

127
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
Got it.

128
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,760
How was it? The '10 plus 2' and then throwing up one more?

129
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,200
You brought me to a place with no signal...

130
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,360
You're not planning to kill me, right?

131
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,240
Scared of me?

132
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,040
Why would I be? Just curious...

133
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,240
why we had to trek out here.

134
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,840
Or are you dodging something?

135
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,440
Dodging what, exactly?

136
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,120
-Feels like... a family feud,

137
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,760
or escaping some trouble.

138
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,120
That's funny.

139
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,360
Judging from the car you drive,

140
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,280
the clothes you wear,

141
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,360
the money you offered...

142
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,080
It all adds up to something fishy.

143
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,880
You just overthink!

144
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,520
-Is it weird to hire someone to watch the birds?
-Bird-watching? All the way here?

145
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,440
There are many bird parks in Bangkok.

146
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,920
And we’re not staying overnight, right?

147
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,880
Actually, we are.

148
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,600
Seriously?

149
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,440
But we didn't agree on an overnight rate.

150
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,320
And normally, I don't stay overnight with everyone.

151
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,800
Don't make that cute face.

152
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,240
We'll be back after bird-watching tonight,

153
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,800
or I'll report on the app that you tricked me into staying without prior notice.

154
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,000
-I wouldn't do anything to you.
-Not that!

155
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,120
But you're breaking the rules.

156
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,360
What if I had a job tomorrow?

157
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,960
How could you tie me up like this? I could report you for kidnapping!

158
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,720
Report me then.

159
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,400
After this work, I will review that...

160
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,880
how drunk you were last night, forgetting our plans.

161
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,400
You forgot that I booked you...

162
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,720
for today, tomorrow, and the day after.

163
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,080
You're sly, huh?

164
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,400
I'm not that fussy.

165
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,800
Stay and hang out with me.

166
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,800
In this economy, you can't be choosy about work or people,

167
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240
and it won’t make you poor.

168
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,640
Fine, but if we wrap up bird-watching today, I'll decide whether to stay or not.

169
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,320
Can't go a day without a shower.

170
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,280
Plus, this hangover’s killing me,

171
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:36,080
I feel like crying from being teased since morning.

172
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,200
So, about last night...

173
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,920
gonna cry if we talk about it?

174
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,840
How about this? I'll find a middle ground.

175
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,960
Middle ground?

176
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,880
I'll stop the hand-holding thing, okay?

177
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,640
Just dinners, movies, outings.

178
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,880
And I’ll add a rule too, alright?

179
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,560
No touching any guest,

180
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,720
especially the women. Agreed?

181
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,560
You don't get it, do you? I want you to quit entirely.

182
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,040
I am quitting!

183
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,400
No more hand-holding, I promise!

184
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,680
I mean stop taking these kinds of jobs.

185
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
But this job hardly requires any investment.

186
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,600
I used to struggle.

187
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,800
Look now.

188
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,280
Now, anything you want, anything I want,
I can almost conjure it up for us.

189
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,880
And my feelings don't matter?

190
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,680
You want me to go back to struggling, depending on you, and feeling worthless like before?

191
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,120
-So you're not quitting, huh? This social companion stuff.
-How can I quit?

192
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,520
I'm booked through next month.

193
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,080
If you won't quit, then I'll break up with you.

194
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,560
Actually, I understand your side,

195
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,960
but I also see your girlfriend's point.

196
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,200
If I had a partner...

197
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,520
I wouldn't be cool with them doing this job,

198
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,280
or their job is to make others happy.

199
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,640
Then what's the point of having a partner?

200
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,480
Well... at least you have.

201
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,480
-For real?
-Yup.

202
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:25,200
Can professionals in this field truly disconnect after parting ways?

203
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,400
Can you honestly say you've never felt anything special?

204
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,440
Yeah, maybe there's been some.

205
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,960
But it's never gone beyond hand-holding, really.

206
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,360
And I'm pretty clear with all my guests

207
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,400
from the start about what I can and can't do.

208
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,520
You're a scumbag. I shouldn't have let you work like this.

209
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,160
Can't we break up, Prang?

210
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,560
And right now, I'm happy with my work,

211
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,040
meeting new people...

212
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,599
-bringing happiness to others. If only you'd try to understand...
-That’s enough.

213
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,319
No need to say more. It just gets worse.

214
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,079
This is yours. Don't send stuff to my place anymore.

215
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,839
Change the address to yours.

216
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,359
I'll take care of the rest when I get back.

217
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,440
So we're really breaking up?

218
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,720
Prang!

219
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,440
Maybe it's for the best.

220
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,520
I'm tired of settling my feelings every day.

221
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,640
Tired of investing emotions in your career.

222
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,360
Prang, don't leave yet.

223
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,720
A t-shirt?

224
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,760
Looks like your girl knew about your plans today.

225
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,280
Nope, it's not that.

226
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,440
Probably from Your Mate.

227
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,400
Pai, there's a card.

228
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,560
Can I read it?

229
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,200
Congrats, Mr. Bodin [Pai].

230
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,720
You're a top Your Mate, over 100 guests

231
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,040
and have been upgraded to ‘Close Friend’ status.

232
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,840
Here's a gift for your dedication. We hope...

233
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:56,680
you maintain the friendly service standards to offer exceptional experiences to our members.

234
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,120
P.S. We've included a QR Code on the back of the shirt...

235
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,720
for direct tips into your account.

236
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,160
You can use it immediately.

237
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,520
From Your Mate.

238
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,280
Wow, cool!

239
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,800
Over a hundred guests, really?

240
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,720
Honestly, not proud of this part of me.

241
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,600
It's just for fun, right?

242
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,200
Like a YouTuber celebrating a subscriber milestone.

243
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,560
But this is even cooler.

244
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,920
Bro, look at this T-shirt.

245
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,280
Who'd actually wear this?

246
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,000
You could wear it when you go on your trips.

247
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,080
It lets people know you're just a companion,

248
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,640
not anything more.

249
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,080
Plus, there's a QR code  at the back.

250
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,000
Stand still and play it cool sometimes,

251
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,080
turning back to them,

252
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,520
maybe they will give you more tips.

253
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,360
[Transfer is accepted. But if there is a signal, don't do it; enjoy your free meal instead].

254
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,680
The T-shirt is cute.

255
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,440
Stop making fun of me!

256
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,480
Here's your order.

257
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,520
Thank you.

258
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,920
Bet they don't do digital payments here.

259
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,480
Got any cash?

260
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,680
Yeah, I withdrew some this morning.

261
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,440
Can't dare to go without it now.

262
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,360
Why's that?

263
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,160
About last night,

264
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,480
I had to pay for your vomiting.

265
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,360
They didn’t accept to transfer money.

266
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,760
Darn it! Really?

267
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,400
How much?

268
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,120
You´ll have to pay a fine for your friend's vomiting.

269
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
How much?

270
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,080
Three thousand baht.

271
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,080
Do you accept scan payment here?

272
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,800
Then, how about tomorrow...

273
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,120
ATM’s not far, 500 meters. Get cash and come back.

274
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,920
Here's the thing,

275
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,160
I'm not anything special with him.

276
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,040
I just called him because...

277
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,920
he's working for me tomorrow.

278
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,040
-And...
-But...

279
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,920
it's just three thousand baht

280
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,160
Um, are you saying it's not a lot?

281
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,480
It's the rule here.

282
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,480
If you don't pay,

283
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,880
do I have to?

284
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,840
Then how about this?

285
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,120
When my friend wakes up,

286
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,120
I'll have him transfer the payment immediately.

287
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,360
That won't work.

288
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
I know it. Wait a moment.

289
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,960
You can transfer to my account.

290
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,720
But if you scan into my account,

291
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,920
I'll charge an extra five hundred.

292
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,520
Then why did you agree to pay?

293
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,120
It was because of you.

294
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,320
You threw up too much.

295
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,720
If you hadn't, there'd be no fine.

296
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,720
But if I hadn't vomited, I wouldn't have sobered up, right?

297
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,800
Better vomiting there than in your car, right?

298
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,640
Can you stop finding positives in a situation that has none?

299
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,600
Can I say sorry? Can I, huh?

300
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,040
Just give me your account, I'll pay you back.

301
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,920
Let's leave it for now. No rush.

302
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,320
Also, we don't even have any signal here anyway.

303
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,280
You're right.

304
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,200
[Transfer is accepted. But if there is a signal, don't do it; enjoy your free meal instead].

305
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,880
When will we be able to live a fully cashless life, huh?

306
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,560
To go anywhere without needing to carry cash.

307
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,720
You're all about ease, aren't you?

308
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,480
They don't accept it probably because they don't want to pay taxes.

309
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,320
Paying them is like costing both money and feelings.

310
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,120
Exactly,

311
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,400
why does convenience have to come at such a price?

312
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,920
In this era, it's easy to meet someone

313
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,440
just choose and scan to pay.

314
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,280
Sometimes, relationships

315
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,520
that are easy to start are just as easy to end.

316
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,360
And now, you can even buy them.

317
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,440
Yeah, true.

318
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:36,760
Tell me what do you usually do when people rent you?

319
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,720
You call it 'renting'?

320
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,480
Bro!

321
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,920
What do you think is your strength?

322
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,480
Don’t you like to eat vegetables?

323
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,000
I can eat it, but if I have to choose, I wouldn’t.

324
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,120
There's a bit of psychology involved, but the fun of my job is here.

325
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,280
We have to find what touches the guest's heart.

326
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,520
Don't just ask directly like...

327
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,760
What do you do when you're feeling lonely?

328
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,360
Well... watch movies... hang out at bars,

329
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,600
meet friends sometimes, but I don't really have many.

330
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
What about you,

331
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,440
what do you like to do? Can you tell me?

332
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,440
Do you see the essence of my question,

333
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,240
To excel as a travel mate, you gotta differentiate between chatty customers and the quiet ones.

334
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,720
Based on From Me by Me stats, 80% of people I meet...

335
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,440
are conversation starters.

336
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,320
The other 20% try to chat, but they're not that good at it.

337
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,160
Our job? Find the key to their heart with our questions.

338
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,520
You'll know you've nailed it from their answers...

339
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,440
figuring out which button to push.

340
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,200
What kind of movies are you into?

341
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,640
Romance, maybe action.

342
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,960
Sometimes, we don't always have to press their heart's button.

343
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,320
Try introducing something new and see their reaction.

344
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,840
Or offer alternatives they do not choose?

345
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,800
And see them, why didn't they like those?

346
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,280
Do you like horror movies?

347
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
I like them,

348
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,040
but need company to watch.

349
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,480
I am scared.

350
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,440
Ever encountered a ghost?

351
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,080
Nope, never. How about you?

352
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,440
Have you?

353
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,480
If I start, it'll be a long story.

354
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,800
I'm afraid I might exceed the hour you've hired me for.

355
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,080
It’s okay, I’ve got time.

356
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,880
I'll cover the cost.

357
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,040
I want to hear it.

358
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,400
Go ahead, tell me.

359
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,280
Interested as this, no extra charge today then.

360
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,480
I'll throw in another two hours for free.

361
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,720
But just give me a five-star review, okay?

362
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Please... please...

363
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,280
Damn!

364
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,800
That’s post-sale service.

365
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,080
But it just seems like a casual chat.

366
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,360
Doesn't sound like any special trick.

367
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,200
Listen!

368
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,800
Finding topics to talk about with someone who's paying to hang out with us...

369
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,320
isn't just about spending time together

370
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,160
We need to find topics they want to talk about

371
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,120
feelings they expect to experience.

372
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,200
And if we want to refuse when they want to have sex,

373
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,040
how do we compensate them...

374
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,000
in a way that makes them feel less bad and avoid poor reviews.

375
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,800
Ever met any bad customers?

376
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,440
Bad customers?

377
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,000
This job requires a bit of psychology,

378
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,720
Luckily I'm good at reading people from chats.

379
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,600
So, I have criteria for selecting customers right from the start.

380
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,040
Bet you're wondering why I agreed to hang with you?

381
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,840
Not telling.

382
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,760
Keep guessing.

383
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,680
Then why tell me all this, especially about dealing with guests?

384
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,560
Aren't you here to learn from me?

385
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,400
Learning what?

386
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
To be a travel companion like me?

387
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,560
You want to do this like me, right?

388
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,160
Just kidding!

389
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,640
I like that innocent look on your face.

390
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,160
How can I not feel like I'm talking to a kid?

391
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,840
Take this, bro.

392
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,320
Meant for watching mistresses!

393
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,000
Oh... my bad

394
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,400
watching birds.

395
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,560
Mistresses, what?

396
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,000
If it's heavy, I'll carry it.

397
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,320
Hey, no need, I can carry my own bag.

398
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,440
Hand it over. It's called post-sale service.

399
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,920
Seeing birds injured to the point they can't fly...

400
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,120
it's so sad

401
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,440
Did you study this? Like, being a bird doctor?

402
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,760
I've loved birds since I was a kid.

403
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,560
Dad used to take me to the forest.

404
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,920
Did he enjoy birdwatching too?

405
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,920
No, he liked shooting them.

406
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,760
After my father passed, I've dedicated
myself to aiding injured birds,

407
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,880
hoping to make up for the wrongs he did.

408
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,840
Damn! Listening to this leaves me unsure of my next move.

409
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,200
So sorry to hear that.

410
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,760
Being a bird doctor like this is good.

411
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,040
One day, when I was dumped I could ask you to heal too.

412
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,120
Heartbreak and broken wings are not the same at all.

413
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,560
Someone like you... ever been dumped?

414
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,600
Oh, sorry, you’ve been recently dumped.

415
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,600
You don't get it, do you? I want you to quit entirely.

416
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,920
I am quitting!

417
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,720
No more hand-holding, I promise!

418
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,680
I mean stop taking these kinds of jobs.

419
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,760
But this job hardly requires any investment.

420
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,760
I used to struggle.

421
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,440
Look now.

422
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Now, anything you want, anything I want,
I can almost conjure it up for us.

423
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,640
And my feelings don't matter?

424
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,400
You want me to go back to struggling,

425
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,400
depending on you, and feeling worthless like before?

426
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,400
So you're not quitting, huh? This social companion stuff.

427
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,320
How can I quit?

428
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,880
I'm booked through next month.

429
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,800
If you won't quit, then I'll break up with you.

430
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,640
Harsh... that's really harsh.

431
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,600
You can't compare someone who has just been dumped as a bird.

432
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,640
What bird is that?

433
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,280
Cuckoo!

434
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,200
You mean the bird?

435
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,360
Or maybe you.

436
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,680
Just kidding!

437
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,880
Hold on. Why is "Cuckoo" used as an insult?

438
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,239
Maybe because Cuckoos...

439
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,639
are hard to tame, stubborn,...

440
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,159
and don't listen to others.

441
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:33,199
Do you think it's crazy for someone who has a partner?

442
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,760
It depends on individual needs.

443
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,360
Some are fine with their partner in this line of work,

444
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,880
but we should also respect those who aren't.

445
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,280
What if your partner was a travel companion,

446
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,280
would you be okay with it?

447
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,000
Have you ever hired a travel companion?

448
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,680
Yeah, quite a bit. Why?

449
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,280
Really? How was it?

450
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,640
It's like supporting our community through the app.

451
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,960
We travel together, chat about this and that, usual stuff.

452
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,120
Sometimes we share funny customer stories,

453
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,320
but mostly it's just general conversation.

454
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,680
You know, you should consider being a travel companion.

455
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,960
You're youthful yet mature in conversation.

456
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,200
Customers would like you.

457
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,840
Are you implying that...

458
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,960
you are into me?

459
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,120
Huh?

460
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,080
Nothing, I'm just trying to understand

461
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,000
how those with partners handle their emotions in this job.

462
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,840
Are you investigating something?

463
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,120
[Left: birdwatching, landscape]
 [Right: camping area, toilet]

464
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,040
Is there something on your mind? You can tell me.

465
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,840
Actually,

466
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,160
I'm having a rough time with my partner.

467
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,760
Oh... really?

468
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
Why...?

469
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,320
I just found out that

470
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,320
my partner also works as a travel companion.

471
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,920
Ahhhh, I see...

472
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,200
that's why you were quiet earlier...

473
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,920
Okay, I'm starting to connect the dots.

474
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,640
So, are you hiring me to spite your partner?

475
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,520
No...

476
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,280
Well, maybe a little.

477
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,680
Seriously, I don't want to get beaten up by your boyfriend later.

478
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,920
Nah,

479
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,680
my partner's a woman.

480
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,200
So, you're into women, yet you hired me?

481
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,680
I don't know,

482
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,560
maybe I just wanted to try.

483
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,440
My girlfriend only takes female guests,

484
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,560
so I was curious about spending time with a male companion.

485
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,200
But...

486
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,680
But being with you is alright too.

487
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,600
Should we set up camp over there?

488
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:45,680
[Left: birdwatching, landscape]
 [Right: camping area, toilet]

489
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,040
Looking for something?

490
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,960
My water bottle.

491
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,320
I must have dropped it.

492
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
Oh, so you don't have any water?

493
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,720
So, how about I become your customer for a moment?

494
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,560
What do you mean? This is my water.

495
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,880
Can I have a sip?

496
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,280
I’m thirsty.

497
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,600
Sure, but drink after me.

498
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,320
Can you drink without your lips touching the bottle?

499
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,880
I mind not drinking after other men.

500
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,680
Don´t mind it. This is my water.

501
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,840
Then, if you don’t mind...

502
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,320
can I drink first?

503
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,680
Alright, let's switch roles. I'm the bottle owner now.

504
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,440
Say after me...

505
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,520
Say what?

506
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,480
Mr. Pai, can I have some of your water?

507
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,000
Ew, that’s gross.

508
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,800
Cheeky bastard!

509
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,040
Who’s being gross? I didn’t mean anything by it.

510
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,560
Forget it, I won't drink.

511
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,040
Sure you don't want any?

512
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,960
Don't come asking later, okay?

513
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,320
I’ll drink it then.

514
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,600
Wait, don’t let it touch your lips!

515
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,160
-Please!
-What now!

516
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,560
Please, bro!

517
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,800
Here you go. No more teasing,

518
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,120
Just drink it.

519
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,880
But if I drink after you,

520
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,520
it’s like indirectly kissing you.

521
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,760
Take it back!

522
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,440
Hey, Terd!

523
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,760
Got any cash on you?

524
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,160
Yeah, a little.

525
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,600
Do you really want it again?

526
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,840
Another beer?

527
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,560
How was the restroom?

528
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:00,120
Well... there were urinals, toilets, sinks.

529
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,440
All normal.

530
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,880
The air freshener is nice. Should we take them home?

531
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,160
You're funny, Terd!

532
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,160
Sorry, Terd. Just got a message from a guest, inviting me on a trip next week.

533
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,520
Really...

534
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,160
Are out-of-town rates more expensive than in-town ones?

535
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,280
You staying overnight?

536
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,120
-Three days and two nights.
-I see.

537
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,400
This guest, is it a guy or a girl?

538
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,680
I only take female clients,

539
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,800
So...

540
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,280
out of the town...

541
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,880
Which province are you off to?

542
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,120
Why, planning a secret follow?

543
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,280
No...

544
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,600
Just curious if it's somewhere we've been together.

545
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,400
I wanted to suggest my favorite spots to my clients. Normal, right?

546
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,320
So, women kissing like this is normal, huh?

547
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,360
Gonna track my every move?

548
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,200
If I hadn't, would I have seen this photo?

549
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,320
Ann... I'm fine with you earning from that app,

550
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,040
but this, I can't accept.

551
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,920
-Do you get it, right?
-Yeah, I'm at fault here.

552
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,440
But if you don't want to see, don't follow me.

553
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,800
Or do you want to be the one to say it?

554
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,200
-I just want things clear. I'm ready to...
-How about a break for a week?

555
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,720
I know you don't like things that are unresolved.

556
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,000
I’m not ready to say it yet.

557
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,200
Maybe time apart will give us answers.

558
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:21,320
When I return from the trip, I promise to explain everything to you.

559
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,840

You knew all along, didn’t you?

560
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,360
Why didn't you tell me from the start if this was your plan?

561
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,040
Why keep it from me?

562
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,400
Which medicine do you need?

563
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,760
Um... the one...

564
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,160
Which one? In case I have it, you can take it from my tent.

565
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,160
It´s called...

566
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,960
-Damn it, Pai! I saw Prang at the store.
-Oh, really?

567
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,560
Terd, Pai!

568
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,760
I know you guys have been following me.

569
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,280
This was all my plan.

570
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,400
-I wanted you to fucking see it for yourself, to make it clearer.
- Is it clear enough now, huh?

571
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:58,440
