00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,420
Oh.

189
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,700
I told you.

190
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,660
Boss invited me.

191
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,900
Yes, yes.

192
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,340
I invited Aunt Bua.

193
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:54,940
Speaking of the wedding,

194
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,140
where is the bride?

195
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,340
I can't wait to see her.

196
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,820
Bride...

197
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,340
Oh...

198
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,660
It's Mei.

199
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,260
What? How did I suddenly become the scapegoat?

200
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,780
Yes.

201
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,700
I'm getting married.

202
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,100
When did you start dating?

203
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,460
Why didn't I know?

204
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,740
I just found out.

205
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,420
Does your mom know?

206
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,500
Mei is hiding this from her mom.

207
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,420
She doesn't want her family to know.

208
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,770
Mei, are you pregnant?

209
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,740
It's okay.

210
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,300
I'll be the senior family member of the bride.

211
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,460
Mei.

212
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,380
I watched you grow up.

213
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,260
Get married

214
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,380
for the child

215
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:09,860
and yourself.

216
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,020
Okay?

217
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,260
Okay.

218
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,340
Is this role too stressful for me?

219
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,060
I've been planning this day for over a year.

220
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,700
Is this all ruined?

221
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,460
Here.

222
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,300
Cheers.

223
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,650
Congratulations, Mei. You finally have a husband of your own.

224
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,420
Cheers.

225
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,020
Why is my name so ordinary all of a sudden?

226
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,220
Oh my.

227
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,700
How did it turn out like this?

228
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,340
Then...

229
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,820
What should we do now?

230
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,780
We can't cancel the wedding.

231
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,820
Tob's parents are involved as senior family members.

232
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,420
Well.

233
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,540
Do we have another choice?

234
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,740
Am I really

235
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,610
going yo be Boss's wife?

236
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,060
Well.

237
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,140
Maybe

238
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,060
it's time to get even with you.

239
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,660
Let's get even.

240
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,020
Wow.

241
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,220
Are you still joking?

242
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,220
It's all your fault.

243
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,220
You've gone too far.

244
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,540
Who knew?

245
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,260
Besides,

246
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,820
how long are you planning on

247
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,460
keeping it a secret?

248
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,220
Hurry up and tell them.

249
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,900
You know what kind of person my mom is.

250
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,340
If she knows,

251
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,700
she'll have a heart attack.

252
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,500
Why did Uncle Prem and Aunt Bua come to Bangkok?

253
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,020
How would I know?

254
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,540
I guess they came for a ride by train.

255
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,580
But the point is

256
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,820
I've invited my brother

257
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,140
to attend the wedding tomorrow.

258
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,340
If he knew it was a fake wedding,

259
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,460
I can't even imagine it.

260
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,620
I'll be dead.

261
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,900
I think it's easier to explain to your brother than to date a man.

262
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,420
I'm the real unlucky one.

263
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,060
Em.

264
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,980
I think we should go to another restaurant.

265
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,940
I feel something is wrong.

266
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,140
What?

267
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,020
What's wrong?

268
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,340
The food here

269
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,180
is very delicious.

270
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,820
The meat here is all from animals who have never been abused.

271
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,780
It goes well with our virtue-oriented lifestyle.

272
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,420
I already lied to Tob. Will heaven accept me?

273
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,050
Actually, we don't have to eat delicious food every meal.

274
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,140
We eat at a delicious restaurant

275
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,020
and can be less guilty.

276
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,380
It's okay to go a little further.

277
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,180
A little further?

278
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,700
No way.

279
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,540
We must eat here.

280
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,700
I invited you to the city.

281
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,330
We must eat here.

282
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,140
Unfortunately,

283
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,780
Mr. Prem needs to do intestinal detoxification,

284
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,420
so he can't come for the delicious food.

285
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,700
We have to eat here no matter what.

286
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,460
What about Tob?

287
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,180
Oh.

288
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,220
Isn't that Tob over there?

289
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,300
I guess Heaven isn't on my side today.

290
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,819
Didn't you say Tob...

291
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:24,940
Uh...

292
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,849
Where did she go?

293
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,140
Tob.

294
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,260
Hello, Aunt Em.

295
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,500
Hello, Tob.

296
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,140
Your mom said

297
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,660
you're busy, isn't that right?

298
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,060
Yes.

299
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,140
Yes.

300
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,340
This morning,

301
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,380
I was chatting with your mother.

302
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,460
Your mom said

303
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,660
you were busy with surgeries for cats and dogs,

304
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,860
so you couldn't come.

305
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,060
And...

306
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,460
your mother and I

307
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,740
planned to arrange a blind date for you and Emmy.

308
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,380
But now,

309
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,020
Emmy has gone back.

310
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,300
And Bua

311
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,580
disappeared too.

312
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,700
Just now,

313
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,540
she was with me.

314
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,740
I'm totally confused.

315
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,940
Mom is really... Looks like I have to nip your thought in the bud.

316
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,860
Aunt Em.

317
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:32,980
Yes?

318
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,500
Well...

319
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,860
I don't know anything about it.

320
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,060
Ah!

321
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,980
And I am seeing someone.

322
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,180
What?

323
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,540
I don't think I can go on a blind date with your daughter.

324
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,300
Did you already have a girlfriend?

325
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,100
Yes.

326
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,540
I am seeing someone.

327
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,260
This is

328
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,340
my girlfriend.

329
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,380
Yes.

330
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,420
I'm his girlfriend.

331
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,460
Huh.

332
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,660
It's me again.

333
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,020
Why am I so unlucky?

334
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,860
Are you a couple?

335
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:40,140
[Chanting Buddhist scriptures]

336
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,620
Tob.

337
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,260
I think you should go to bed.

338
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,140
I think your mom will be chanting for a long time.

339
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,420
She doesn't look calm.

340
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,140
She's shaking.

341
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,780
It's okay, Dad.

342
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,220
I'm also curious how many scriptures she can chant.

343
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,300
I'll sit here

344
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,940
to see if she can stick to it till dawn.

345
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,380
Tob.

346
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,220
In a word...

347
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,980
Mom! You arranged a blind date for me and Aunt Emm's daughter, right?

348
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,940
Yes!

349
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,500
Yes.

350
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,460
Why?

351
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,220
I want you to have a girlfriend.

352
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,090
How can you tell Aunt Em that you have a girlfriend?

353
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,420
I don't even know what to say.

354
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,700
But I didn't lie.

355
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,700
What?

356
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,060
So you're seeing someone?

357
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,980
Why didn't you bring her to me?

358
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,060
I'm not ready yet.

359
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,260
When I'm ready, I'll bring him to meet you.

360
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,620
From now on,

361
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,940
please don't set me up with anyone anymore.

362
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,380
Also, you don't have to attend

363
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,500
tomorrow's wedding.

364
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,780
But I've promised them

365
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,780
to be Mei's senior family member.

366
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,540
I have to go anyway.

367
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,780
I watched her grow up.

368
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,220
How can I let her go to the wedding alone?

369
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,660
Poor thing.

370
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,780
Mei, don't you think these shoes are too red?

371
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,140
Uh.

372
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,740
I'm sorry.

373
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,100
Even if I'm so fit that I can get on magazines,

374
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,540
it's hard to find a pair of light-colored high heels.

375
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,740
It's good that I can find these.

376
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,460
And this pair is very special.

377
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,980
My other half gave them to me,

378
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,940
so I decided to wear them to your wedding.

379
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,140
You mean

380
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,740
these are from the pilot you met on the dating app?

381
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,580
Mei.

382
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,260
You haven't even met him yet.

383
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,740
I know.

384
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,980
That's why I brought him here to see you.

385
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,420
But I didn't come to see you in them.

386
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:11,020
He is my Mr. Right.

387
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,710
I'm sorry.

388
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,340
You have to marry my Mr. Right today.

389
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,540
Well.

390
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,260
Do I really have to get married?

391
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,540
Now,

392
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,740
my mom will be here soon.

393
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,180
Okay.

394
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,860
Brother. You can come to the changing room.

395
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,420
I already talked to the staff.

396
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,900
Okay.

397
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,300
Okay.

398
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,260
My brother

399
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,260
arrived at the airport last night.

400
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,220
He's on his way.

401
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,300
I think

402
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,820
we should handle this well.

403
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:46,940
Otherwise,

404
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,450
it will be over.

405
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,300
Wow, Mei.

406
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,290
You look so beautiful.

407
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,620
But...

408
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,140
Stop!

409
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,460
I don't want to hear about my shoes.

410
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,060
Don't worry.

411
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,740
I've found a solution.

412
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,620
What do you think?

413
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,780
Now the colors of your mouth and shoes are matched.

414
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,180
Mei.

415
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,100
Is it too red?

416
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,300
It's as red as the sun.

417
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,660
Boss.

418
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,940
I saw...

419
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,860
Did he tell you to abandon Tob?

420
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,540
Who?

421
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,100
Bua, is that appropriate?

422
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,380
I'm not invited.

423
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,420
It's okay.

424
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,210
Let's go in.

425
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,660
There are not many guests today.

426
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,260
Let's be the witnesses of this couple.

427
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,180
They are like my children.

428
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,380
Okay.

429
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,820
That's it.

430
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,540
It's like I'm trying so hard to put on a show for your parents.

431
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,140
Forget it.

432
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,980
That's the only way.

433
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,050
The show is about to start.

434
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,740
Oh my god.

435
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,500
Bass.

436
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,860
She

437
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,100
is my girlfriend.

438
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,260
Yes.

439
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,460
I'm his girlfriend.

440
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,140
Are you a couple?

441
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,220
Who?

442
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,620
So,

443
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,940
you already have a boyfriend,

444
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,300
but you're still going to marry my brother?

445
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,850
What are you thinking?

446
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,740
That's...

447
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,980
Are you...

448
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,980
a master of time management?

449
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,140
Why do you have men everywhere?

450
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,820
One yesterday.

451
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,420
Another one today.

452
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,780
How could you

453
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,980
betray Tob?

454
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:44,780
Tob.

455
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,300
You're here today

456
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,220
to seek justice, right?

457
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,580
Okay.

458
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,300
Let me help you.

459
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,660
Wait, Em.

460
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,540
What's going on?

461
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,740
There must be some misunderstanding.

462
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,820
No, Bua.

463
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,740
Tob said she's his girlfriend last night.

464
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,650
I remember it very clearly.

465
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,900
It's her.

466
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,140
Is that so, Tob?

467
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,260
So,

468
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,900
I suggest you cancel this wedding.

469
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,660
What? I got everything ready.

470
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,740
Stop. There won't be a wedding.

471
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,700
Gosh.

472
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,740
It has gone too far.

473
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,420
That's right.

474
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,380
It's bad enough that the real wedding was ruined,

475
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,460
but now the fake one is ruined too?

476
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,340
Are we cursed?

477
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,700
Thank goodness.

478
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,420
It's just a fake wedding.

479
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,220
If it's a real wedding,

480
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,660
I can't even imagine it.

481
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,780
I would be so embarrassed.

482
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,740
So... Can you tell me what happened?

483
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,140
Brother, where should I start?

484
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,420
It's a long story.

485
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,450
No need.

486
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,820
So the pilot you mentioned

487
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,980
is Bass, right?

488
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,690
Don't tell me...

489
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,580
Are

490
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,020
you

491
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,260
dating?

492
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,020
No, we're just chatting.

493
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,340
I don't think we'll chat anymore.

494
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,420
Oh, no. My mouth is faster than my brain again.

495
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,370
Idiot. This is the man Heaven sent you.

496
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,700
That's why you can be willful at little things. But you have to keep chatting.

497
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,500
Right?

498
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,500
What?

499
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,220
When did you two

500
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,260
start dating?

501
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:20,940
I don't know anything.

502
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,260
Boss, I just knew he's your brother.

503
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,580
Brother.

504
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,700
Let's talk outside.

505
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,060
Em, calm down.

506
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,380
I think

507
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,740
you've misunderstood.

508
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,340
Tob and Mei are good friends.

509
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,020
They've known each other since childhood.

510
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:07,860
And

511
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,180
Tob told me last night

512
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,540
he lied to you.

513
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,660
He's very stubborn.

514
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,460
He doesn't like being controlled

515
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,140
or set up with anyone.

516
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,660
Oh no.

517
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,900
Did I

518
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,660
complicate things?

519
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,180
I broke up a couple

520
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,180
who are about to get married.

521
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,500
Bua, what should I do?

522
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,740
Let's leave it alone for now.

523
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,700
Now,

524
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,610
my mind is blank.

525
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,100
I'll tell you

526
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,980
when I think of a way.

527
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,020
Okay.

528
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,420
I should go home and meditate.

529
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,100
I'll call my daughter first.

530
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,380
I have a lot on my mind.

531
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,260
I can't drive alone.

532
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,740
Okay.

533
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,500
What are they talking about for so long?

534
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,540
Should I eavesdrop?

535
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,340
But you looked annoyed by him.

536
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,900
Gosh.

537
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,780
That's it.

538
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,620
You know what?

539
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,740
When we looked at each other at the wedding,

540
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,180
my heart hurt.

541
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,700
He seemed very disappointed in me.

542
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,540
Shouldn't he be like this?

543
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,380
Think about it.

544
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,220
You are dating him,

545
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,980
but you're going to marry his brother.

546
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,860
And Aunt Em made a scene saying

547
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,140
that you're still dating me.

548
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,540
Then...

549
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,620
Does he know you're dating Boss?

550
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,020
But you're the bride of this wedding.

551
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,140
The point is you're dating him,

552
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,620
but you're marrying someone else.

553
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,340
Isn't that wrong in the first place?

554
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,380
Think about it.

555
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,060
What would you do

556
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,820
if he was marrying someone else?

557
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,660
Well...

558
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,260
You're right.

559
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,700
But it's not my fault.

560
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,460
It's all your fault.

561
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,700
Why do you always go to me when things happen?

562
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,700
If I really break up with Bass,

563
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,460
I'll rip your head off and plant radish.

564
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,500
All right, I'm sorry.

565
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,580
But you should have a detailed talk to him.

566
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:48,980
Let me emphasize this.

567
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,260
A detailed talk.

568
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,060
Okay.

569
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,020
Got it.

570
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,020
Then...

571
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,500
What about you and Boss?

572
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,780
Are you really going to keep it from your parents?

573
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:10,699
No.

574
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,900
I just haven't figured out

575
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,179
how to make them feel less surprised.

576
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,060
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,139
I ruined everything today.

578
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,020
You don't have to say sorry.

579
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:54,900
I understand.

580
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,740
Don't think too much.

581
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,820
Things already happened.

582
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,140
But not everyone can accept it easily.

583
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
I told my brother everything.

584
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,180
He didn't say anything.

585
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,900
I'll find a chance to tell my parents as soon as possible.

586
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,540
At least

587
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,060
they can try to accept our relationship.

588
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,940
I want everyone to know

589
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,260
you are my boyfriend

590
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,620
and the person I love.

591
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,780
Thank you.

592
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,020
Thank you so much.

593
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,500
♫I can only see you among millions of people♫

594
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,180
Come, give me a hug.

595
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:11,020
♫Can you feel my love for you?♫

596
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,780
♫I love you more than anyone else♫

597
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,420
♫Even the universe can't contain my love♫

598
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:27,140
♫You turn the thin air into sweet fragrance of flowers♫

599
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,420
What are you doing?

600
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,100
No.

601
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:40,040
♫You make the moment become eternity♫

602
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,780
♫Now my love is valuable♫

603
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,340
♫Because it's you♫

604
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,820
♫We move along the orbit and meet like a dream♫

605
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,740
♫Light up each other♫

606
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,500
Even if it's so far away,

607
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,180
I can still keep thinking about it.

608
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,820
This scene makes my heart flutter.

609
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,500
So captivating.

610
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,140
Emmy.

611
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,300
What are you doing?

612
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,060
I'm going back to meditate now.

613
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,060
Mom.

614
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,380
You spoiled the show just now.

615
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,540
If you were in a hurry,

616
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,980
why don't you go back first?

617
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:54,980
Fine.

618
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,900
I'll wait for you in the car.

619
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,770
I'm speechless.

620
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,660
Where's my couple?

621
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,500
Gosh.

622
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,660
Wow.

623
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,220
Is he a god?

624
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,020
Why is he so handsome?

625
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,340
He's totally my type.

626
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,700
Don't tell me they're a couple.

627
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:16,580
Humph.

628
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:27,580
This is my Mr. Right. I can feel it.

629
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,220
Look at me!

630
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,380
This scene makes my heart flutter.

631
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,340
So tempting.

632
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,970
Were the two people you two?

633
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,220
What?

634
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,260
You must be...

635
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,700
The two people by the pool

636
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,460
last night were you, right?

637
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,860
That means

638
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,980
Tob already has a girlfriend.

639
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,740
And Mei and Boss are dating.

640
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,900
So, Bass?

641
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:35,980
Yes.

642
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,380
I'm still single.

643
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,740
(A Plant) You bastard!

644
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,220
-Mei, stop!
-Don’t...

645
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,780
Uncle. Aunt.

646
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,140
What do you think about boys liking boys?

647
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,620
Mom, really?

648
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,700
Yes.

649
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,580
Em-Orn is ready for everything.

650
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,140
Mom. Did you say you'd prepare for Boss and Mei's wedding?

651
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,300
I've decided.

652
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,700
I'll confess to my parents.

653
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,260
What?

654
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,140
Are you serious?

655
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,900
What will come will come.

656
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,340
She'll have a prayer meeting all night.

657
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,500
Yes.

658
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,140
Why are they praying tonight?

659
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,300
Should we go see them?

660
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,580
The wedding is tomorrow afternoon.

661
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,380
They must be here tonight.

662
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,060
Tell them it's canceled

663
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,860
to avoid wasting time.

664
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:25,700
Fine.

665
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,020
I think it's good.

666
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,020
Let's go.

667
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,980
Wait.

668
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,020
I don't want to go now.

669
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,180
In my opinion,

670
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,860
let's finish today,

671
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,540
then we don't need to come again.

672
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,300
Ha.

673
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:49,740
Mei.

674
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:50,380
Mei.
