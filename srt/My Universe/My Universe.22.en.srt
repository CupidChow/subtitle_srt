[Previous episode]
So... he's already dead, right?

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,560
Well, just look at him.

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,400
Ha! Finally awake, huh?

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,880
Is it...

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,600
the appointment we planned for today?

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,280
You brought me to a place with no signal...

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,160
You're not planning to kill me, right?

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,640
Are you scared of me?

29
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,880
By the way, we're not staying the night, are we?

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,600
Yes, we will.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,720
Tell me what do you usually do when people rent you?

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,600
You call it 'renting'?

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,720
There's a bit of psychology involved.

34
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
Don’t you like to eat vegetables?

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Where’d you like to go?

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,720
What kind of movies do you like?

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,479
Ever encountered a ghost?

38
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,760
Shit!

39
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,680
That’s post-sale service.

40
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,720
But it sounds like pointless talk to me.

41
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,400
Harsh... that's really harsh.

42
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,480
Can people in this kind of work really separate things after work?

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,000
And can you claim you've never felt anything special for any guest?

44
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,640
My feelings don't matter to you, right?

45
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,200
You want me to return to struggling, relying on you, and feeling worthless again?

46
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,480
So you're not quitting, huh? This travel companion stuff.

47
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,040
How can I quit?

48
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,240
I'm booked through next month.

49
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,720
If you won't quit, then I'll break up with you.

50
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,600
-Take this, bro.
-Huh?

51
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,079
Meant for watching mistresses!

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,760
Oh... my bad

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,160
watching birds.

54
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,240
Mistresses, what?

55
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,200
Is it heavy? I can carry it.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,200
No need, I can carry my own bag.

57
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,640
Hand it over. It's called post-sale service.

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,280
Seeing birds injured to the point they can't fly...

59
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,960
it's so sad

60
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
Did you study this? Like, being a bird doctor?

61
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,600
I've loved birds since I was a kid.

62
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,400
Dad used to take me to the forest.

63
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,760
Did he enjoy birdwatching too?

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,760
No, he liked shooting them.

65
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,480
After my father passed, I've dedicated
myself to aiding injured birds,

66
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,920
hoping to make up for the wrongs he did.

67
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,880
Damn! Listening to this leaves me unsure of my next move.

68
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,240
So sorry to hear that.

69
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,800
Being a bird doctor like this is good.

70
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,080
One day, when I was dumped I could ask you to heal too.

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,159
Heartbreak and broken wings are not the same at all.

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,600
Someone like you... ever been dumped?

73
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,640
Oh, sorry, you’ve been recently dumped.

74
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,280
You're a scumbag. I shouldn't have let you work like this.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,920
Can't we break up, Prang?

76
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,320
And right now, I'm happy with my work,

77
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,800
meeting new people...

78
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,360
-bringing happiness to others. If only you'd try to understand...
-That’s enough.

79
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,680
You don't get it, do you? I want you to quit entirely.

80
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,000
I am quitting!

81
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,800
No more hand-holding, I promise!

82
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,760
I mean stop taking these kinds of jobs.

83
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,840
But this job hardly requires any investment.

84
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,840
I used to struggle.

85
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,520
Look now.

86
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Now, anything you want, anything I want,
I can almost conjure it up for us.

87
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,720
And my feelings don't matter?

88
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,480
You want me to go back to struggling,

89
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,480
depending on you, and feeling worthless like before?

90
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,480
So you're not quitting, huh? This travel companion stuff.

91
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,400
How can I quit?

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,960
I'm booked through next month.

93
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,880
If you won't quit, then I'll break up with you.

94
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,880
Harsh... that's really harsh.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,320
You can't compare someone who has just been dumped as a bird.

96
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,840
What bird is that?

97
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,040
Cuckoo!

98
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,960
You mean the bird?

99
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,120
Or maybe you.

100
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,120
Just kidding!

101
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,320
Hold on. Why is "Cuckoo" used as an insult?

102
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,680
Maybe because Cuckoos...

103
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,080
are hard to tame, stubborn,...

104
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,600
and don't listen to others.

105
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,520
You think working a travel buddy even though I've coupled up, sounds cuckoo?

106
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,080
It depends on individual needs.

107
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,680
Some are fine with their partner in this line of work,

108
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,560
but we should also respect those who aren't.

109
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,960
What if your partner was a travel companion,

110
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,960
would you be okay with it?

111
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,120
How was the restroom? Is it okay?

112
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,680
Well... there were urinals, toilets, sinks.

113
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,000
All normal.

114
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,440
The air freshener is nice. Should we take them home?

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,720
You're funny, Terd!

116
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,520
Sorry, Terd. Just got a message from a guest, inviting me on a trip next week.

117
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,880
Really...

118
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,520
Are out-of-town rates more expensive than in-town ones?

119
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,640
You staying overnight?

120
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,480
-Three days and two nights.
-I see.

121
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,760
This guest, is it a guy or a girl?

122
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,039
-I only take female clients,
-Alright.

123
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,160
So...

124
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,640
out of the town...

125
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,280
Which province are you off to?

126
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,080
Why, planning a secret follow?

127
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,800
No...

128
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,120
Just curious if it's somewhere we've been together.

129
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,560
I wanted to suggest my favorite spots to my clients. Normal, right?

130
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,920
So, women kissing like this is normal, huh?

131
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,960
Gonna track my every move?

132
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,560
If I hadn't, would I have seen this photo?

133
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,920
Ann... I'm fine with you earning from that app,

134
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,640
but this, I can't accept.

135
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,520
-Do you get it, right?
-Yeah, I'm at fault here.

136
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,040
But if you don't want to see, don't follow me.

137
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,400
Or do you want to be the one to say it?

138
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,800
-I just want things clear. I'm ready to...
-How about a break for a week?

139
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,360
One weeek, right?

140
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,240
I know you don't like things that are unresolved.

141
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,520
I’m not ready to say it yet.

142
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,720
Maybe time apart will give us answers.

143
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:23,840
When I return from the trip, I promise to explain everything to you.

144
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,840
-There's so beautiful.
-Right.

145
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,320
Is this your first time hiking in the forest, Prang?

146
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,280
No, but I've never been bird-watching before. It's quite unique.

147
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
My boyfriend and I used to come here often.

148
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,160
He's really into birds,

149
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,360
so much that he specialized in studying them.

150
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,560
He knows every species.

151
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,920
Listening to him talk about birds is fascinating.

152
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,920
Forgot to say,

153
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,760
I broke up with Pai last night.

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,600
You didn't forget.

155
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,920
You were just waiting for the right moment to tell me.

156
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,560
I could see it in your eyes this morning.

157
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,200
Do you think I did the right thing, Ann?

158
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,360
I don´t know. What do you feel right now?

159
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,120
Anything unresolved?

160
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,160
Not really.

161
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,480
I feel relieved, actually.

162
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,840
At first, I thought it would be harder.

163
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,720
But seeing him happy and content with his life,

164
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,440
I can't help but feel happy for him.

165
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,920
If anyone is to blame, it's me.

166
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,240
I was the one who encouraged him to pursue that career.

167
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,160
Or maybe it's easier now

168
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,720
because you're starting to like me?

169
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,400
Probably just a snake.

170
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,640
Wait, what? No, I'm scared of snakes!

171
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,120
You're joking, right?

172
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,120
Nope.

173
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,680
First, answer my question.

174
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,520
Do you like me?

175
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,320
Maybe... I guess...

176
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,320
But it might not be you.

177
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,080
You know I just broke up with my boyfriend.

178
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,320
I don´t want anymore.

179
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,720
I'm done with it.

180
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,560
I don't want to date a travel buddy again.

181
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,080
Maybe...

182
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,640
you are the reason why I don't want to work anymore as a travelling companion.

183
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,160
You knew about this all along, didn't you?

184
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,560
How long have your girlfriend and mine been talking?

185
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,600
Almost a month...

186
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,080
You didn't know anything about this?

187
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,880
What should we do now?

188
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,920
What should we do, huh?

189
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,240
Why didn't you tell me from the start?

190
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,440
If this was your plan,

191
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,880
why keep me in the dark, Terd.

192
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,520
I hoped they were just travel buddies, like us.

193
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
But now, they've broken up with us.

194
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,160
You knew for a week, didn't you?

195
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,600
If I had known...

196
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,640
You would have handled it, right?

197
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,640
Made excuses?

198
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,880
It's not that simple for me.

199
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,200
If Ann knew what I was doing here with you, she'd be furious.

200
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,040
Or she would hate me.

201
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
If I knew, I would've stopped this trip.

202
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,680
Want them to be alerted?

203
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,800
Hide their relationship more.

204
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,880
and make us look guilty?

205
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,760
I wanted you to see it with your own eyes,

206
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,120
to make it fucking clear.

207
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,840
Is it fucking clear enough now?

208
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,800
Terd, I'm so sorry.

209
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,320
Perhaps I misunderstood.

210
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,920
Or maybe the relationship of the two is really just travelling companions.

211
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,240
Women tend to be that sweet when they're together, right?

212
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,080
Or we just expose it all.

213
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,160
Let everyone know we came here to catch our cheating partners.

214
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,000
What do you think?

215
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,760
Cheers!

216
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,880
Boohoo!

217
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,480
Why does it seem so easy when women talk to each other, bro?

218
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,200
Boo!

219
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,040
Thanks, bro!

220
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,640
For making me feel less guilty.

221
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,800
Damn, If they want to leave, they just leave.

222
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,680
Two years...

223
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,160
all meaningless.

224
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,760
Boo!

225
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,080
Bro...

226
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,080
Don't cry!

227
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,280
You're supposed to comfort me,

228
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,320
not the other way around!

229
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,680
You're the one

230
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,280
who brought me here to see everything.

231
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,840
How is it, then?

232
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,160
Let's face it together, bro.

233
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,560
Come on, cheers!

234
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,440
[Shrine]

235
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,760
What are you asking for so much?

236
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,720
Don't disturb, I might forget.

237
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,520
Are you asking about us?

238
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah.

239
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,120
I wish anyone who breaks a promise with me won't never find true love again!

240
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,880
Oh, cursing like that?

241
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,920
You know,

242
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,880
if it's about us, you don't have to ask the shrine. Ask me directly.

243
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,960
How about we make our own promise?

244
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,400
Let the shrine be our witness.

245
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,400
If we return home,

246
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,520
you will quit your job.

247
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,440
What?

248
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,440
You just said it to me earlier.

249
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,640
Or you were talking crap, huh?

250
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,120
Prang...

251
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,640
Who says things like this in the middle of the forest,

252
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,360
in front of a shrine?

253
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,480
I'm serious about you, Ann.

254
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,800
Even though we haven't known each other long,

255
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,880
I feel like we can make it. Trust me.

256
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,160
And what if you start disliking something about me later on?

257
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,640
Then so be it.

258
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,760
No promises then.

259
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,480
Let's go back to the tent, I'm hungry.

260
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,520
To the respected shrine,

261
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,720
I, Mrs. Ann, still not separated from my boyfriend,

262
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,760
cannot dare to promise in front of you that I'll be able to fulfill the agreement of this woman named Prang who brought me here.

263
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,600
Please understand the confusion in my heart and give me an answer slowly.

264
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,680
Let this trip guide us

265
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,320
and keep us undisturbed.

266
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,120
Let me find a clear answer if she's the right one for me.

267
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
And when that time comes,

268
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
I promise to take care of her,

269
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,680
do everything she wants,

270
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,440
including quitting my current job

271
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,320
to find something better,

272
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,880
Deep down,

273
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,880
I believe that Prang...

274
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,080
might just be the missing piece I've been looking for.

275
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,640
Ann,

276
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,680
I am sorry to be in a bad mood earlier.

277
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,360
I think I... understand you now.

278
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,920
[Left: bird watching and views
Right: Camping and toilet]

279
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,400
Let's just accept it, man.

280
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,960
Looks like they're not coming back.

281
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,000
If we try anything now,

282
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,000
we might just get cursed by the shrine.

283
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,720
So, what now?

284
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,400
Should we head back to Bangkok?

285
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,720
I think we should stay a bit longer.

286
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,040
We'll need to be ready for unexpected events.

287
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,880
Also, two women camping alone in the forest...

288
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,360
it's worrisome.

289
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
But I've given up, bro.

290
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,800
I'm thinking about how to break up with Ann.

291
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,880
I want to be the one to break it off.

292
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,800
It might be easier for her.

293
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,600
Aren't you going to take a shower?

294
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,320
Nah,

295
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,880
I usually don't like to shower when I'm camping.

296
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,560
Where did you get the towel from?

297
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Ran down to the shop just now.

298
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,680
Whoa,

299
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,720
you didn't buy it earlier?

300
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,160
Thought people around here would prepare it for me.

301
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,960
Didn't expect you to be the type who doesn't like shower.

302
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,120
I just dry clean, bro.

303
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,160
Oh,

304
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,640
when I went to take a shower,

305
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,080
I ran into your girlfriend.

306
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,240
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

307
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,960
She went into the same shower room as my ex.

308
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,480
This just happened...?

309
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah... why?

310
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,480
planning to sneak a peek?

311
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,680
I've changed my mind,

312
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,720
Give me your towel...

313
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,320
Damn, just kidding.

314
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,400
But even if two women go into a shower room together,

315
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,280
it's normal, right?

316
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,840
Exactly! See?

317
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,440
When it's women, it's perfectly normal.

318
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,400
Just imagine

319
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,840
if someone saw me and you

320
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,320
entering a bathroom together.

321
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,840
Then what?

322
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,240
Just the thought gives me the creeps.

323
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,280
Really?

324
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,800
Where?

325
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,440
Where's that goosebump?

326
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,040
Jeez!

327
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,880
Do you have anything I can use for my face?

328
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,000
I've got this.

329
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,840
Oh, this is good.

330
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,560
I use it too, same color.

331
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,120
Before taking care of others,

332
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,160
you must first take care of yourself.

333
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,240
That's nice.

334
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,280
You rest too little,

335
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,080
you must moisturize your skin.

336
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,280
I can feel it right away.

337
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,320
Want to buy something, young man?

338
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,760
Do you have any paracetamol?

339
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,640
Paracetamol, let me find it first.

340
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,960
Um, I think we’re out.

341
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,760
It’s indeed out.

342
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,400
We only have anti-diarrhea medicine. Want some?

343
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,600
Can it be used for fever? If so, I’ll take it.

344
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,480
Gosh, I was just kidding. I don’t think it works for that.

345
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,680
I thought so too.

346
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,160
So,

347
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,000
is there a pharmacy nearby?

348
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,640
A pharmacy? Let me think...

349
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,320
What medicine do you need?

350
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,120
Um...medicine...for...

351
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,920
What medicine? Maybe I have some, I could bring it from my tent.

352
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,120
Um... for...

353
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,560
He’s looking for paracetamol.

354
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,320
Sure, I've got it.

355
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,320
You can take it from my tent.

356
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,920
Um...no, it's fine!

357
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,360
Would you like anything, young lady?

358
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Damn it,

359
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,080
-Prang saw me at the store.
-What? Really?

360
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,360
Excuse me, I got the medicine for you.

361
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,320
Don't be considerate.

362
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,240
Isn’t he here?

363
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,000
Strange. I just saw him run into the tent.

364
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,080
Maybe he went to another tent for medicine.

365
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,560
Shall we give it to him when I see him?

366
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,360
What if he’s sick inside?

367
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,760
His behavior was so strange earlier,

368
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,640
like he didn’t want to talk to me.

369
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,360
Should I just open the tent and check?

370
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,600
I've got Covid!

371
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,400
Just leave the medicine outside,

372
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,360
thanks.

373
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,240
Okay, I'll leave it here then.

374
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,840
Should we leave?

375
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,800
I'm afraid Ann will catch me,

376
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,320
I´ll be in trouble.

377
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,320
What are you doing, Pai?

378
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,560
You want to leave, right?

379
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,640
Then let's go.

380
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,680
I was just a pawn in your plan anyway.

381
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,440
Just an employee, no need to care.

382
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,720
[Left: bird watching, views
Right: Camp site, toilet]

383
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,720
No need to care, Ann.

384
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,520
Those two followed us here on their own.

385
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,840
But wasn't this your plan from the start?

386
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,720
Are you really thinking of breaking up with Terd?

387
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,920
Why suddenly feel sorry for him?

388
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,800
-You said you felt suffocated with him.
-I'm starting to doubt...

389
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,360
if what we're doing is... going too far.

390
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,320
It is too far,

391
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,160
but we saw what it's like.

392
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,560
If they still like us,

393
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,360
why aren't they doing something about it?

394
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,200
What do you want them to do?

395
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,200
I don’t know...

396
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,840
Maybe deep down, you still have feelings for Pai,

397
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,200
rushing to give her the medicine like that.

398
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,120
And you? Deep down you say you sympathize with Terd?

399
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,080
Still not sure about us?

400
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,160
I don’t want to deceive anyone

401
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,400
or make anyone feel bad because of me.

402
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,840
So, everything you've been doing with me...

403
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,400
was just to make Terd jealous?

404
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,960
And breaking up with Pai, do you think I was deceiving you too?

405
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,400
I didn’t mean it like that.

406
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,920
I was planning to break up with Terd anyway.

407
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,720
But look what we've done,

408
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,000
We convinced Terd to follow us; Pai got dumped.

409
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,640
And now, here you are with me in this situation.

410
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,160
If we're going to do something like this,

411
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,240
don't feel guilty afterward.

412
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,320
Everything that's happening here isn't a play for me.

413
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,880
This is actually happening.

414
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,400
I have real feelings for you.

415
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,360
But if you start feeling we're doing wrong...

416
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,880
Then what? Are we going to apologize to Terd?

417
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,360
Getting back together, and saying it was all a surprise setup?

418
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,200
How often do you need to ask yourself to realize that you don't need him anymore?

419
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,120
How many times to realize that I like you.

420
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,720
How many times... until you realize you feel the same?

421
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,680
Yeah, I like you...

422
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,720
but I don’t want to like you with this guilt.

423
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,080
Don’t act like our feelings are just investments in someone else...

424
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,440
So, women kissing like this is normal, huh?

425
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,480
Gonna track my every move?

426
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,560
If I hadn't, would I have seen this photo?

427
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,440
Ann... I'm fine with you earning from that app,

428
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,160
but this, I can't accept.

429
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,040
-Do you get it, right?
-Yeah, I'm at fault here.

430
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,560
But if you don't want to see, don't follow me.

431
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,920
Or do you want to be the one to say it?

432
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,320
-I just want things clear. I'm ready to...
-How about a break for a week?

433
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,000
One week right?

434
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,840
I know you don't like things that are unresolved.

435
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,120
I’m not ready to say it yet.

436
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,320
Maybe time apart will give us answers.

437
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,160
When I return from the trip, I promise to explain everything to you.

438
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,840
Just because she brought medicine,
you’re back to feeling the same?

439
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,320
Our partners are cheating on us, you know!

440
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,480
But your girlfriend hasn’t broken up with you.

441
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,520
Don’t you think this could be your chance to make up?

442
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,200
How can you give up so easily?

443
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,520
You want me to go and make up?

444
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,360
And hurt your ex again?

445
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,880
You’re the one who told me that if someone wants to leave, let them.

446
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,800
Now you want me to chase my girlfriend who’s in love with someone else?

447
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,080
What the fuck are you thinking?

448
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,560
Don't send stuff to my place anymore.

449
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,480
Change the address to yours.

450
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,000
I'll take care of the rest when I get back.

451
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,080
So we're really breaking up?

452
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,360
Prang!

453
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,080
Maybe it's for the best.

454
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,160
I'm tired of settling my feelings every day.

455
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,280
Tired of investing emotions in your career.

456
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,000
Prang, don't leave yet.

457
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,480
Terd... Pai...

458
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,480
We know you’ve been following us.

459
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,600
But you know, this was all my plan.

460
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,040
I knew Terd would come to see Ann

461
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,199
and bring Pai here.

462
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,199
to see how asshole I am.

463
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,040
I want to say I'm sorry...

464
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,159
Don’t blame Ann.

465
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,239
If I had been straightforward from the start,

466
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,280
none of this would have happened.

467
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,639
I know this isn't something easily forgivable,

468
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,719
but I really want to say I'm truly sorry...

469
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,440
I'm so sorry.

470
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,720
How about this?

471
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,880
I'll find a middle ground.

472
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,440
Middle ground?

473
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,680
I'll stop the hand-holding thing, okay?

474
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,200
Just dinners, movies, outings.

475
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,840
And I’ll add a rule too, alright?

476
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,320
No touching any guest,

477
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,480
especially the women. Agreed?

478
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,320
You don't get it, do you? I want you to quit entirely.

479
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,800
I am quitting!

480
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,760
No more hand-holding, I promise!

481
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,200
And my feelings don't matter?

482
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,960
You want me to go back to struggling,

483
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,960
depending on you, and feeling worthless like before?

484
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,960
So you're not quitting, huh? This social companion stuff.

485
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,880
How can I quit?

486
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,440
I'm booked through next month.

487
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,720
You're a scumbag.

488
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,640
I shouldn't have let you work like this.

489
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,280
Can't we break up, Prang?

490
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,680
And right now, I'm happy with my work,

491
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,160
meeting new people...

492
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,720
-bringing happiness to others. If only you'd try to understand...
-That’s enough.

493
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,560
No need to say more. It just gets worse.

494
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,480
This is yours.

495
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,280
Don't send stuff to my place anymore.

496
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,840
Change the address to yours.

497
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,600
I'll take care of the rest when I get back.

498
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,440
So we're really breaking up?

499
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,720
Prang!

500
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,680
A seat for Bangkok, please?

501
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,040
You can pay the fare in the van.

502
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,480
Sorry I have to leave first,

503
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,920
and for not staying the full hour.

504
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,960
It’s okay...

505
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm sorry too for dragging you into this.

506
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,280
Don’t blame yourself.

507
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,640
I’m just...

508
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,480
a casual travel friend.

509
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
Thought I could handle my feelings,

510
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
but in the end...

511
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,040
When you get back to Bangkok,

512
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,960
can you let me know?

513
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,960
If you want to say anything more,

514
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,080
just leave a review or curse about me in the app.

515
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,920
I’ll let you do that.

516
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,000
Why would I do that?

517
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,160
You have your issues to sort out,

518
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,160
and so do I.

519
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,600
As for the money, you just keep it.

520
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,720
Consider it my apology for deceiving you.

521
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,360
I’ll return it.

522
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,160
Think you're the only one with money, huh?

523
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,920
I should go.

524
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
Drive safely,

525
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,600
don’t cry on the way. It’s dangerous.

526
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,920
You too!

527
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,840
If you want to cry,

528
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,680
just cry.

529
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,400
On your way home,

530
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,920
just enjoy the view.

531
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,320
It might help.

532
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,560
Alright, I'll get going.

533
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,680
Bye!

534
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,440
Got any signal yet?

535
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Not yet, might take a while.

536
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,320
And what if we call, confess, apologize,
but they still don't forgive us?

537
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,120
Ann! Stop! We’ve got signal!

538
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,320
Terd, they don't accept my transfer.

539
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,280
Then, what'd you do?

540
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,200
Do you want some cash from me first?

541
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,320
No need.

542
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,720
Can I come back with you?

543
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,600
I’m worried about you.

544
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,720
What’s this about?

545
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,000
Terd!

546
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,720
I think I...

547
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,160
I...

548
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,440
[Prang call].

549
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,080
Hello... Pai... Third...

550
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,760
This is Ann and me.

551
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,760
We wanted to say...

But your room has like a hundred mirrors, right?

553
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,360
Just use another one for now.

554
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,480
It's not the same, man.

555
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,160
Antique mirrors like this one sure have a history.

556
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,120
I knew it.

557
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,480
His name´s Marwin, my school's junior.

558
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,120
I forgot about him.

559
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,840
Found out later...

560
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,480
he died in an accident with his family.

561
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,520
Damn magical mirror!

562
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,200
If you're really magical, then bring Marvin to life!
