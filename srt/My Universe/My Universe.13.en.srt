[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,720
♫Just a single glance, from your eyes straight to mine,♫

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,040
♫and my heart starts to melt.♫

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,160
♫As I come closer, I talk to you,♫

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,200
♫ I tremble, till I'm almost breathless.♫

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,280
♫ A restlessness overwhelms me, losing myself in the tide.♫

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,720
♫Is this what they call symptoms of love,♫

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,760
♫It happens every moment,♫

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,200
♫when I get a glimpse of you,♫

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,720
♫Are you feeling like me, perhaps,♫

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,600
♫A burning, restless whirl within the heart, do you feel so?♫

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,800
♫Every symptom shows, do you tremble too, just how much,♫

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,280
♫Feeling good, alike maybe?♫

00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,720
♫then we can weight the chances in our hearts,♫

♫Are you feeling like me, perhaps,♫

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,000
♫As if I can't control myself,♫

♫Tell me, when I meet you,♫

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,840
♫Are your thoughts the same as mine,♫

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,640
♫ that we are in love?♫

21
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,240
Listen up, everybody!

22
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,479
Quick change and
let’s hit the ground  to warm up.

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,240
We're taking stats today.

24
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,840
Got it, coach!

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,560
Just hurry up!

26
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,840
Toss these out.

27
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,640
Guys!

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,880
Stop playing!

29
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,680
Let’s get moving,
or the coach will scold us again.

30
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,840
Roger that, Captain Mhok.
Heading out now.

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
You're so annoying, huh?
Come on, let's roll.

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,360
Yes, sir!

33
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,040
Team: Let’s go!

34
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,160
Head Coach: Everyone, gather here!

35
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,440
After just a two-week break,

36
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,160
many of your stas have dropped after coming back.

37
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,960
What happened?

38
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,800
Just because the match ended,
you think you can slack off?

39
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,360
You guys were reckless.

40
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,640
Did you think practice wasn't necessary
right after competing?

41
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,160
You especially, Pun!

42
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,000
Your stats have dropped
even more than before the last match.

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,680
Don't you want to play as a starter?

44
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,200
Or do you want to be a substitute until graduation?

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:06,760
Anyway, I hope that tomorrow all of you
will focus on practicing more than this.

46
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,600
That's enough for today.

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,520
Everyone, pay respect!

48
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,399
Thank you, coach!

49
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,640
Here, drink some water.

50
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,800
Thank you, coach!

51
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,120
Don’t throw in the towel, Pun.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,840
I know you're trying hard.

53
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,320
If you want extra training or help,
please let me know.

54
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
More than happy to help.

55
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,040
Alright!
Thanks a lot, coach.

56
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,800
Hang on there!
It’s gotta get better.

57
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,880
Coach Jay: Gotta see the head coach now.
Pun: Got it, Coach.

58
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,320
Stay strong!

59
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,000
Team: Pun, how’s it going?

60
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,040
Drink up, dude.

61
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,320
Already got one, but cheers!

62
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,800
Phol: When’d you get it?
Pun: Coach Jay gave it to me.

63
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,440
I didn't see it.

64
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,800
Are you alright, though?

65
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,760
Me? I’m okay.
I’m used to being scolded.

66
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,960
Mhok: No sweat, bro. We'll give it another shot.
Pun: I’m alright.

67
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,520
Come on!

68
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,000
Let’s get inside.

69
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,680
Team: Okay, let's go!
Go, go, go!

70
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,680
Team: Guys, hustle up!

71
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,640
Mhok: Let’s go, go, go!

72
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,440
Hey guys!

73
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,640
What’s up!
Still have a lot of energy, huh?

74
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,440
If you've got that much left,

75
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,160
go for five laps around the field!

76
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,080
For real, coach?

77
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,200
Do I seem like I'm kidding?

78
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,440
Or is five too easy for you?

79
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,960
How about ten laps then?

80
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,880
No, no, coach!

81
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,520
Let's go, guys!
Hurry up!

82
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,600
Sorry, sir.

83
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,040
Mhok: Pun, hurry up!
Pun: I'm running.

84
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,240
Hang in there!

85
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,600
Man, I'm beat.
I just can't go on.

86
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,240
I can’t go on anymore!

87
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,720
Pun, get up already!

88
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,040
If coach catches us, it's game over.

89
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,760
I'm done for.

90
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
One last round.
Up you go!

91
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,800
Are you going to get up or not?

92
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,600
No way!

93
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,920
You're not getting up, right?

94
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,440
No!

95
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
You’re not getting up?

96
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,440
Okay then.

97
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,680
Oi Mhok! Get off,
you weigh a ton!

98
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,440
Jeez, that’s tired.

99
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,720
Meen: Damn, I’m so tired.

100
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,960
Let’s change clothes and head out.

101
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah, or else coach might
have us running more drills.

102
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,920
Maybe the coach already left?

103
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,080
Hey Pun, you got cold water?

104
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,640
Can I snag a sip? I'm tired.

105
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,400
Pun: No clue who's it is.
Meen: It's gotta be yours, found it in your locker.

106
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,720
Definitely not mine.
How'd it get in there?

107
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,200
Maybe someone secretly put it there.

108
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,520
Did you charm someone, Pun?

109
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,760
No way!
I didn't charm anyone.

110
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,400
Or maybe it was damn Mhok,
our handsome captain.

111
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,560
You're nuts!
I've been with you all this time.

112
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,920
When did I put it there?

113
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,520
That’s right.

114
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,680
Guys, chill!
Let it go.

115
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,960
Let’s change and head home.
I’m too tired.

116
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,480
Pun, if you're not drinking,
mind if I do?

117
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,680
Pun: Take it!
Meen: Sweet!

118
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,320
[Pun: Who's around at uni?
Let’s grab a bite at the caf.]

119
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,920
[Mhok: I'm still in class.]

120
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,720
[Camp: Caught up in a group project.]

121
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,200
[Meen: Off today, just in for practice.]

122
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,800
[Phol: I haven't finished my classes yet.]

123
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,920
[Meen:  Guess I'll have to eat alone then.]

124
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,040
[Mhok: Sorry, mate!]

125
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,960
[Pun: No worries.
A lone wolf like me doesn't mind.]

126
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,720
Oh, Coach Jay!
Hello!

127
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,520
Sitting solo today?

128
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,200
Where's your team?

129
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
None of them were free.

130
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
Mind if I join you?

131
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,000
Of course, Coach.
Have a seat!

132
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Coach, can I ask you something?

133
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,840
After I was punished by the coach to run laps,

134
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,040
I went back to my locker

135
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and there was a water bottle.

136
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,920
Did you see who put it there?

137
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,160
That was me.

138
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,800
Huh?

139
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,440
But why for me?

140
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,240
Well, I thought after your practice,

141
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,160
you'd be too tired.

142
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,640
You might need some water, right?

143
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,760
So I put it in for you.

144
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,880
Oh!

145
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,400
Appreciate it.

146
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,760
Coach, do you like me?

147
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,480
Well...

148
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,400
Yes, I do.

149
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,320
Alright!
Uh... I should get going to class.

150
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,440
I'll excuse myself.

151
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
Catch you later!

152
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,400
Guys, here comes the star!

153
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,480
Whoa!

154
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,160
Finally, he has arrived.

155
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,760
Mhok: What's good!

156
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,920
You all came so early.

157
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,080
It's not early.
You're just late, Pun!

158
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,240
Late?

159
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,400
Meen: You’re late!

160
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,920
It's not even practice time yet.

161
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,320
So, ended up lunching alone earlier?

162
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,960
Nope,

163
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,200
Coach Jay joined me.

164
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,320
Hey, Meen!

165
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,480
Look at that!
Another water bottle mystery?

166
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,920
Meen: What’s going on?

167
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,240
I'm starting to wonder who’s leaving this?

168
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,520
It's gotta be someone from our team, right?

169
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,400
Camp: Was that you?
Meen: Oh, it wasn’t me.

170
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,440
How about you, Mhok?

171
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,480
You've annoyed me again.

172
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,800
I've been with you all this while.

173
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,400
When’d I have done it?

174
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,800
I was just kidding!
No need to slap at all.

175
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Done with that?
Got any left?

176
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,640
Just moment.

177
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,720
[Coach Jay: Left another water for you. Good luck today, my star.]

178
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,920
Is that a message from the one leaving the water?

179
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,120
You're all grins there, huh?

180
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,920
Who are you chatting with?

181
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,760
No, I didn’t talk to anyone.

182
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,240
You switch topics,
and suddenly you're tongue-tied, huh?

183
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,320
Phol: Are you in love, little Pun?

184
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,640
What love?
I’m really not.

185
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,920
Shouldn't we be off to practice?
Or the coach will scold us again?

186
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,160
You’re switching topics.

187
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,840
We won't get scolded;
but you will for not being ready yet.

188
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,920
Oh yeah,

189
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,280
I better get changed.

190
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,800
Wait for me please!

191
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,040
Camp: Okay, little Pun!

192
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,520
Pun: Cut it out, I’m not a kid.
Camp: Oh, just repeating what Phol said.

193
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,240
I didn’t hear it.

194
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,280
I guess you heard it,

195
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,600
but just shy 'cause Phol caught you blushing

196
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,960
About what?

197
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,560
About your sweet love.

198
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,800
Team: Yeah, that’s right.
Pub: Who’s shy?

199
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,800
I wasn’t shy.

200
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,400
Meen: Yes you’re, Pun.
Pub: No, I’m not.

201
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,280
Will you guys stop?

202
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,120
Why don’t you get changed already?
Coach will scold you for sure.

203
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,200
Fine, I'm on it.

204
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,840
Afraid of the coach's wrath or
just jealousy over Pun’s crush?

205
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,760
That sounds silly.

206
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,440
Anyone who's good to go,
hit the field for warm-ups.

207
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,880
Hey, wait for me!

208
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,960
Team: Go, go, go!
The captain is getting serious now.

209
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,880
Coach Jay, do you also use cream?

210
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,600
Yeah!

211
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,200
Even though you're a man,
you have to nourish.

212
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,760
Why that face?

213
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,840
Your skin is sensitive.
Try using this.

214
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,320
Thanks a ton.

215
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,680
Hey Hey Hey, Pun!

216
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,920
Meen: Did you just hit my friend?
Bloody hell!

217
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,440
Hey Hey Hey...
What's going on?

218
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,960
Mhok: Are you okay?
Meen: You alright?

219
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,920
Ouch, I can't stand.

220
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,640
We should probably help Parn off the pitch.

221
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,880
Mhok, Camp, take him to the side.

222
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
I think it's better for him to rest in the locker room

223
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,640
Fine.

224
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,080
Please look after him.

225
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,200
Yes, coach.

226
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,840
Come on,
get up slowly.

227
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,920
Grab my neck!

228
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,800
Walk slowly!

229
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,000
The rest of you, keep practicing.

230
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,040
Got it, Coach!

231
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,560
Camp: Easy, easy!

232
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,120
Camp: Right over here!
Mhok: Sit slowly!

233
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,520
Cheers for the help,
Mhok and Camp.

234
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,200
Back to training,
I'll take care of him.

235
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,240
Yes, Coach!

236
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,960
Please take care of him!

237
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,280
I'll be back.

238
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,840
Let’s go!

239
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,800
Where's the pain at?

240
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,520
Feels like it's on my side.

241
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,840
Can you show me?

242
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,560
You wait here for me.
I'll grab some ice for that.

243
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,200
Yes, Coach!

244
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,920
Help me open this up.

245
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Ouch!

246
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,720
Oh, I'll do it myself.

247
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,800
It's okay.
You just stay put.

248
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,080
I’ll do it for you.

249
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,720
Coach, do you really like me?

250
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,360
Yeah,

251
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,760
I'm fond of ya, for real.

252
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,680
Since when?

253
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,640
Since the first time we met.

254
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,200
So, since three months ago
when you became an assistant trainer, right?

255
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,520
Right!

256
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,080
You and I can be together?

257
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,240
Coach Jay: My bad if I got you feeling weird.
Pun: Sure!

258
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,120
Pun: We can try?
Coach Jay: For real?

259
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,920
Do you really want to be with me?

260
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,280
Yes.

261
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,760
While we're at it,
can I ask you something?

262
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,600
What is it?

263
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,040
Something between us,
you can keep it a secret for now.

264
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,520
Don't tell anyone yet.

265
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Even to your friends.

266
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
But why's that?

267
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,320
I don't want the head coach to know.

268
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,720
I'm afraid you and I will be targeted.

269
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,160
Alright!

270
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,680
Then let me ask one more thing.

271
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,960
You said there was only one.

272
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,240
I know,
but can I please ask another?

273
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,520
So, what’s that?

274
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,000
When we're together,

275
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,760
can you call me by my name?

276
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,120
That’s fine.

277
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,960
Jay!

278
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,360
Alright everyone,
that's a wrap for today.

279
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,400
Got it, Coach!

280
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,920
How’s Pun doing?

281
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,560
Yeah, what happened when you escorted him off?

282
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,440
Still seemed in pain,
don't know if it's more than just a bruise.

283
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,800
Should we check on him?

284
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,920
Phol: Sure!
Team: Let’s go!

285
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Team: Let’s go!

286
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,600
Hey, how are you doing?

287
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,080
Much better now.
Coach Jay gave me an ice pack.

288
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,040
Thank you so much.

289
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,960
No problem.
Gotta run to see the Head Coach now.

290
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,120
Pun, I think your bruise will turn purple soon.

291
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,720
Put some ointment on that,
and look after yourself.

292
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,680
Pun: Will do, Coach!
Coach Jay: Keep an eye on him, folks.

293
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,160
Meen: Got it, Coach!

294
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,360
What were you and Coach Jay chatting about earlier?

295
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,680
You seemed to enjoy

296
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,320
Before? He was telling me a funny story.
Cracked me up good.

297
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,120
How're you getting home, Pun?
Need a lift?

298
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,160
I can get back on my own.
No worries.

299
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,560
You can drop me instead.

300
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
Why?
You get back on your own.

301
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,440
Come on,
what's wrong with dropping me?

302
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,320
You’re not injured.
Go back on your own.

303
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,040
You guys are arguing again.

304
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,360
I'll take you home, Phol.

305
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,680
Oh, my little saint Mhok.
I appreciate it.

306
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,200
Thank you so much.
Not as cold-hearted as Meen over there.

307
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,640
Man, what did I do?

308
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,760
Forget the ride!

309
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,760
Why?

310
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,640
You called me 'little'.
It’s not cool.

311
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,160
Boohoo!
Looks like no ride for you.

312
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,280
Go home yourself!

313
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,840
Phol: Come here, damn Meen!

314
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,520
Guys, can I ask something?

315
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,600
What’s up!

316
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,560
What do you guys think,

317
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,920
if someone is in a relationship with you
but wants to keep talk a secret.

318
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,960
If it were you guys,
would you be okay with it?

319
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,400
What kind of talk?

320
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,960
The kind to develop a deeper relationship?

321
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,520
Yeah, that kind.

322
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,640
Nah, that ain't right.

323
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,400
Why the secrecy if it's genuine?

324
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,400
Exactly.
Doesn’t seem straight-up to me.

325
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,920
Someone asks you to be in a relationship
and keep it a secret?

326
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,360
No, just hypothetically speaking.

327
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,600
What do you say, Mhok?

328
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
I think it's not okay.

329
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,160
Hey, team!

330
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,560
Listen up!
Got some news for y'all.

331
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,120
As we've won the national university
 football championship,

332
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,720
the university is going to throw a celebration party
for us  this Friday at the hotel

333
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,760
The uni is going to treat us to a full,

334
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,840
tons of food and drinks,

335
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,200
especially alcohol.

336
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,000
So, clear your schedules.
And let's go to the event together.

337
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,800
Yes, Coach!

338
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,920
Mhok, gear up for that day.

339
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,400
You’ll be our rep to accept the award with the dean.

340
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,000
Yes, Coach!

341
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,120
Pun, you played better today.

342
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,760
If you keep this up,

343
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,920
you’ll no longer be a reserve in
the next competition.

344
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,360
Anyway, just keep at it, alright?

345
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,720
Will do, Coach!

346
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,000
Thank you!

347
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,600
Team: Thanks, Coach!

348
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,000
Team: There we go.

349
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,000
Captain Mhok’ll now shine beyond the football field.

350
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,680
And Pun's about to light up the pitch too, right!

351
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,840
My little Pun is the best.

352
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,480
Who the heck is your little Pun?

353
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,440
Oh, come on, little Pun.

354
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,600
Hooray!

355
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,480
Mhok: Let's bounce!
Team: Yeah!

356
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,240
Phol: Man, the event is big.
Meen: Totally!

357
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,560
Camp: It’s gonna be fun.

358
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,000
Team: Let's move in.
Camp: Time for party.

359
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,240
Is this yours?

360
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,000
Pun: Save some for me!

361
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,560
Phol, you are eating up alone!

362
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,320
This is good stuff.

363
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,600
Slow down, dude!

364
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,840
Man, take a breather!

365
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,400
The uni organizes a spectacular event.

366
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,880
Gotta live up to that national champ flair, right?

367
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,720
Team: That’s right!

368
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,720
Pun: Exactly!

369
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,720
Everything is delicious.

370
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,160
Right!

371
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,280
I'm gonna eat 'til I burst.

372
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,760
Chill, Phol!

373
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,520
My belly is really bursting.

374
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,800
Phol: Look at this belly!

375
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,880
Phol: Seriously tasty.
Meen: Gotcha.

376
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,680
But my throat is starting to feel dry.

377
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,240
Same here.

378
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,160
Does anyone want to drink?

379
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,120
I'll grab us some.

380
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,480
Team: We do!

381
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,560
We definitely need a toast.

382
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,400
Phol: I’ll be back.
Team: Quickly!

383
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,720
Phol, I think we need to have a wild party tonight.

384
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,440
Just to celebrate our championship,

385
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,880
and Pun, as he finally became a real player.

386
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,240
Of course!

387
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,040
Let’s do that for him.

388
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,960
Excuse me!

389
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,240
I'd like extra heavy.
Five glasses, please.

390
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,560
Bartender: Sure thing.

391
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,080
You sure about extra strong?

392
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,840
Didn't you mean it before?

393
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,400
Alright, it’s fine.

394
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,680
Thank you!

395
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,760
But man, it’s quite heavy now.

396
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,880
That’s true.
Let’s go!

397
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,000
Cheers, folk!

398
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,240
Damn strong!

399
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,800
It has to be strong, buddy!

400
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,480
Team: Let's toast!
Mhok: Man, that hits hard!

401
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,040
Seriously strong.

402
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,960
Why'd th ey go so strong?

403
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,720
Pun: To give us more energy.
Meen: Why did they make it so strong.

404
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,760
Now, the moment has come

405
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,560
for our university's president to present the award
to the football team captain,

406
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,200
on behalf of the players who brought victory to our university.

407
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,960
Please welcome the president and Captain Mhok to the stage.

408
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,360
Hey, I’ll be right back.

409
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,360
A round of applause for my buddy please.

410
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,480
You’re the coolest, mate!

411
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,400
Thank you, Mr. Mhok

412
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:36,120
for being a crucial strength in leading our football team to victory.

413
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,200
It's my absolute pleasure, Mr. President.

414
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,120
Captain Mhok, please say a few words.

415
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,480
Good evening, I'm Mhok,
the captain of the football team.

416
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,920
Team: Wow!
You’re so cool, Mhok.

417
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:02,520
I'm so happy that we were able to bring
the championship to our university.

418
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,840
I also have to thank all the players for their dedication,

419
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,160
as well as our coaches,
who have trained us tirelessly.

420
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,240
This award belongs to every single member of our team.

421
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,040
You’re so cool!

422
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,560
Camp: You look so cool!

423
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,320
Let me kiss it first.

424
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,920
One, two... Hooray!

425
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,920
C'mon!
Let's toast one more time.

426
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,040
Where should I put this?

427
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,160
Here.
Let's show it off.

428
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,120
Just show it!

429
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,960
Mhok: I ran every day for this.
Camp: Cheers, champs!

430
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,960
Now we're the winners.

431
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,080
Hooray!

432
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
Dang, that's hardcore!

433
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,000
[Coach Jay: Can we chat outside?]

434
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,800
Guys, I'll be right back.

435
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,480
Mhok: Where are you going?

436
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,920
What's he hurrying off for?

437
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,920
Maybe he needs to pee?

438
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,239
Maybe he went out with Coach Jay?

439
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,040
Nah, it might be a coincidence they both left.

440
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,000
Well, wouldn't you want to know
 where he goes?

441
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
Yes, I would.

442
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,600
Then let's follow them, folks.

443
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,760
Team: Good, good,
let's go together, let's go!

444
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,560
What's this about, Jay?

445
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,280
I just wanted to smell your perfume up close.

446
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,680
Did you call me out here for something?

447
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,080
Nothing much.

448
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,160
Just been missing you,

449
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,360
and wanted to be with you.

450
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,880
Ouch!

451
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,320
Do I hurt you?

452
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,480
Did you just slap me?

453
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,400
Do you want to slap me back?

454
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,200
Do you like it?

455
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,640
You're not worried about getting caught?

456
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,560
Nobody will see us,

457
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,840
they're all busy in the party.

458
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,760
That’s Pun!

459
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,240
They are hugging.

460
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,440
Hugging?

461
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,640
Are these two dating?

462
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,440
Obviously!

463
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,000
I guess when Pun asked us if
he dated someone

464
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,440
and he was asked to keep it a secret.

465
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,800
and then said it was hypothetical...

466
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,560
I bet it's about him and Coach Jay.

467
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,280
I'm sure of it now, man.

468
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,920
Does our little Pun have a boyfriend now?

469
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,440
Whoa!

470
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,000
Camp: Guys, let's go tease them.
Meen: Yeah, let’s go.

471
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,880
What are you doing, little Pun, Coach Jay?

472
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,000
I mean, look at you two,
talking to each other like a couple.

473
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,240
Camp: A couple, for real?
Team: Really?

474
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,080
Team: You two a couple?
Phol: Embracing, for real?

475
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,920
Phol: Are you guys dating?
Team: Hugging, really?

476
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,480
Camp: What's that about?
Meen: You're in each other's arms.
Phol: I don't think it's cold outside.

477
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,080
Team: Whoops, someone's blushing!

478
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,160
Meen: Are you shy?

479
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,000
Meen: Just a little cuddle, huh?

480
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,760
Pun: Jay!
Team: Oh, wait!

481
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,560
Guys, let me go.

482
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,400
Team: Easy there!

483
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,440
Pun, are you dating Coach Jay?

484
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,880
Was he the one you were talkin' 'bout,
wanting to keep things a secret?

485
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,760
Yes. Can you let me go?
I need to talk to him.

486
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,800
No!

487
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
You talk to us first.

488
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Pun, take it easy!

489
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,000
Calm down!
You two will sort it out.

490
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,160
I think the coach’ll understand you.

491
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,400
This is typical Lovs’s drama.

492
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,560
There could be some arguments,

493
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,480
which make the love grow stronger.

494
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,520
Take it easy, Pun!

495
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,480
Or you'll get drunk
when you talk to the coach.

496
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,600
So,

497
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,480
How'd you and Coach Jay get going?

498
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,760
Remember the day when we were punished
by the coach to run laps

499
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,320
and came back to find a mystery water bottle in my locker?

500
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,480
Yeah, I remember.

501
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,120
That was his doing.

502
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,640
How'd you know it was him?

503
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,240
When I was eating in the cafeteria with him.

504
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,240
I asked him if he knew who put the bottle there,

505
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,920
He admitted it was him.

506
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,000
I outright asked if he was into me,

507
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,040
and he said yes.

508
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,240
Meen: So, you've been an item since?
Mhok: Easy, take a breath!

509
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,520
Mhok: You'll black out before you get to the coach.

510
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,080
That's enough!

511
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,360
Since the day I got hurt
and was back in the locker room.

512
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,680
I see, the day you wanted our advice, right?

513
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,640
Hold up, Pun!

514
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,320
Yes!

515
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,000
That was the day.

516
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,760
Oh man, Pun!

517
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,560
Guys, I can't stand this anymore.

518
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,880
Tonight,

519
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,520
I'll take one of our reserved rooms, okay?
I’d love to clear things up with him.

520
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,120
Alright.

521
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,920
Pun: I'm heading out.
Team: Wait up!

522
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,720
Pun, are you sure

523
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,880
you don't want us to confirm with him
to keep your matter a secret?

524
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,400
Meen: We can handle it.
Pun: No need.

525
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,840
I'll deal with it on my own.

526
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,160
See you guys!

527
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,960
Jay, we need to talk!

528
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,880
I'm gonna spill it to the head coach.

529
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,520
Coach Jay: No way! You can’t do that.
Pun: I’m going to tell him!

530
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,880
I said no!

531
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,680
You can’t do like that, Pun!

532
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,440
How’s Pun doing now?

533
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,360
They've probably settled it by now.

534
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,760
Shall we see him?

535
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,840
Go!

536
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,080
What the...

537
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,000
Move!

538
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,000
Is that Coach Jay?

539
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,920
Right!

540
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,560
Why are the cops cuffing him?

541
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,120
What's the story here?

542
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,640
And where's Pun?

543
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,800
Camp: Pun!
Meen: Right, where’s he?

544
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,440
Team: Shit, let's find him.
