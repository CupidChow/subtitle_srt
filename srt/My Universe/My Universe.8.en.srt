00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:49,900
Korn don't know either.

187
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,500
Then we suddenly bump into each other. Bang!

188
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,380
This is called a coincidence.

189
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,290
What an interesting idea!

190
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,300
Damn.

191
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,780
It worked.

192
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,660
Bud!

193
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:03,540
Hey, Bud.

194
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,100
Are you okay?

195
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,700
Hey, I'm fine.

196
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,540
But I don't think it's okay.

197
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,060
Do you want to go to my room?

198
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,380
I'll get you some clothes.

199
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,940
Here.

200
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,480
Thank you.

201
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,140
I'll return them to you after I wash them.

202
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,700
Okay.

203
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,700
I'll go change in the bathroom.

204
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,700
Okay.

205
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,220
Can't change here.

206
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,900
The bathroom is better.

207
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,380
Here.

208
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,300
Did you lose the script?

209
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,020
Yes.

210
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,860
Mhok's been clinging to his boyfriend lately.

211
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,260
Let him relax.

212
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
It's normal for him

213
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,260
to come and go all the time.

214
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,500
Is it normal?

215
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:08,980
Yes.

216
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,620
People who have a boyfriend are all like this.

217
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,180
You'll know

218
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,500
when you're with someone.

219
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,780
Maybe.

220
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,180
Anyway, we're shooting the day after tomorrow.

221
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,460
You're ready, right?

222
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,540
We just finished blocking the scene.

223
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,940
I'm so tired.

224
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,500
Just leave it like that.

225
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:49,900
Why?

226
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,100
I still can't remember the script.

227
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,140
Good luck.

228
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,100
You too.

229
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,860
Emmy said you wanted to give me something.

230
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,060
What is it?

231
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,180
Oh, a gift.

232
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,820
That gift...

233
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,700
I'll bring it to you on the day of the shoot.

234
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,740
She's not free today.

235
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,780
Well...

236
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,500
What do you think of this dorm?

237
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,940
This dorm?

238
00:14:59,340 --> 00:14:59,980
It's good.

239
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,380
There's an air conditioner

240
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,420
and a bathroom.

241
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
It can accommodate two people.

242
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,140
But my roommate rarely goes back to the dorm.

243
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,220
So it's like I live alone.

244
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,740
You're right. It's like I live alone.

245
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,380
Why do you ask?

246
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,460
Do you want to live here?

247
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,380
Yes.

248
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,850
I want to come.

249
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,220
I want to stay in this dorm.

250
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,060
♫Just the way you look at me♫

251
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,180
♫Makes my heart melt♫

252
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,060
♫Get close to you and talk to you♫

253
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,220
♫I'm so nervous that I can barely breathe♫

254
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,140
♫A sense of unease overwhelmed me and made me lost in the waves♫

255
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,620
♫Is this what they call a crush?♫

256
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,180
♫I'm like this when I see you♫

257
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,980
♫Are you the same as me?♫

258
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,740

00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,940
♫Does my every move make you nervous and tremble?♫

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,340
♫Do you have feelings for me too?♫

261
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,250
♫Only in this way can I calculate the possibility in my mind♫

♫Let's fall in love♫

00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,820

Everyone, water is here.

274
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,020
♫Only in this way can I calculate the possibility in my mind♫

275
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,900
♫We love each other♫

276
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,860
Give me a glass of water.

277
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,940
No.

278
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,900
Why?

279
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,980
Fine, forget it.

280
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,140
I'm asking you in all seriousness.

281
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,620
Are you chasing him?

282
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,060
Take it.

283
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,820
There's only one scene left, right?

284
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,940
Yes.

285
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,340
-Emmy!
-Yeah?

286
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,490
About Korn,

287
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,820
what's our next plan?

288
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,980
I'll send him your phone number.

289
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,580
Or

290
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,700
just throw yourself on him and kiss him.

291
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,220
Enough.

292
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,980
Will it work?

293
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,780
Just kidding.

294
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,180
I just can't think of anything.

295
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,300
Will it work?

296
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,060
Of course.

297
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,180
But give me one moment to think about it.

298
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,140
One moment.

299
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,140
Hold his arm like Savitri.

300
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,420
How?

301
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,900
Let me try.

302
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,220
Like this?

303
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,660
Or like this?

304
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:11,980
Will it be better like this?

305
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,020
Let's go, Savitri.

306
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Let's run!

307
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,020
-Let's go, Savitri.
-Bud.

308
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,050
Are you there?

309
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,220
Bud.

310
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,680
Bud.

311
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,100
Are you here, Bud?

312
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,380
Bud.

313
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,980
Korn.

314
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,540
Is something the matter?

315
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,180
Well...

316
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,740
Huh?

317
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,260
The person you mentioned.

318
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,060
Fong?

319
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,740
Bud.

320
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
He's not here.

321
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,340
We've run a long way.

322
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,460
You are scared, aren't you? You are afraid that he would become your soul mate.

323
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,220
Yes, I am.

324
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,020
I'm scared too.

325
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,900
Anyway,

326
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,860
thank you.

327
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,340
I was like...

328
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,500
Where is Savitri?

329
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,420
Huh?

330
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,420
Here.

331
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,860
Savitri...

332
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,740
Does this look like Savitri?

333
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,700
Yes.

334
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,660
Like this.

335
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,100
Friend.

336
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,660
Friend.

337
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,980
What are you laughing at?

338
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,940
Why is Mek's restaurant closed today?

339
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,220
Because the old chef disappeared.

340
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,500
He's not answering his phone.

341
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,460
Mek couldn't find anyone to replace him.

342
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
That's why it's closed today.

343
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,380
So what's next for Mek?

344
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,900
Maybe she'll find a new chef.

345
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,660
I feel sorry for Mek.

346
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,660
Hey, friend.

347
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,180
I have something to tell you.

348
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,780
Don't be sad.

349
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,260
Hey, wait.

350
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,380
What?

351
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,740
Well...

352
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,020
You... My friend.

353
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,820
I'm going for an interview.

354
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,820
Oh.

355
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,900
Interview for a dorm?

356
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,860
Yes.

357
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,060
-Oh.
-Yeah.

358
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,340
Do you need any techniques to pass the interview?

359
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,740
What technique?

360
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,820
I have a technique.

361
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,820
Oh.

362
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,820
You're definitely gonna make it.

363
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,820
This is it.

364
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,420
Are you sure?

365
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:51,900
Yes.

366
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,900
Trust me.

367
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,940
We need to worship the God of Earth.

368
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,420
She'll bless you with a successful interview.

369
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,540
The competition for this dorm is very fierce.

370
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,580
We need to use our trump card

371
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,580
and ask the God of Earth to help.

372
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,820
[Burning of incense is prohibited, and any violation will be punished by God.]

373
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,260
Did you see what I saw, friend?

374
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,580
Seeing this sign is worse than seeing a ticket.

375
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,900
I'm all out of sorts.

376
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,100
What?

377
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,860
Then they'll be punished by the gods.

378
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,220
That's great.

379
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,100
We escaped a disaster.

380
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
We escaped the curse.

381
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,060
We escaped a disaster.

382
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,820
Oh my god.

383
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,500
So embarrassing!

384
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,900
Is that Korn's car?

385
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,620
It's really Korn.

386
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,540
Then we met him by chance

387
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,660
three times.

388
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,540
Wait.

389
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,740
Who is that?

390
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,140
Korn's boyfriend?

391
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,580
Korn's boyfriend.

392
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,460
OK?

393
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,820
Let's take a look first.

394
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,100
Okay.

395
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,140
It's not far from our school.

396
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,900
Let's stay here.

397
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,580
From the way you walk,

398
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,460
people will say you're dating.

399
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,980
Your subordinates...

400
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,020
kept chasing me.

401
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,540
He made me pay over 2,000 baht for the meal

402
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,300
and went on a date with a pretty girl.

403
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,740
I'm just kidding.

404
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,460
Let go of me.

405
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,420
I can't breathe.

406
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:19,980
Nua.

407
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,100
Do you have a girlfriend?

408
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,180
Does your mom know?

409
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,820
No, I'm just kidding.

410
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,450
Why did you bring me here?

411
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,700
I said I want to live in an apartment.

412
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,380
I don't know.

413
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,340
Ask your mom.

414
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,620
Are you going to ask my mom?

415
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,140
I'll get going then.

416
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:33,940
What?

417
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,690
Don't go.

418
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,370
I'll go in first.

419
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,180
Let's check it out first.

420
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,860
I said I won't live here.

421
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,340
Let's go inside and take a look.

422
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,700
Why are you forcing me?

423
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,020
Come here.

424
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,140
[The Third Coincidence]

425
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,900
Korn.

426
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,660
Bud asked me to return the clothes to you.

427
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,980
Thank you.

428
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,340
Are you okay?

429
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,620
There's something weird about you.

430
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,700
I don't know.

431
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Have you seen Bud recently?

432
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,340
No.

433
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,460
He gave this to Emmy.

434
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,780
Do you want his contact information?

435
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,260
I'll send it to you.

436
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,260
This is for you, sorceress.

437
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,180
Why did you give me so many things?

438
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,460
It's quite heavy.

439
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,940
Thank you.

440
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,980
It's just a little something.

441
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,380
We happened to see something delicious and thought of you.

442
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,420
We also want to thank you.

443
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,860
Our lives have gotten much better recently.

444
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,980
And my daughter has a new boyfriend.

445
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,300
Really?

446
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,100
Yes, sorceress.

447
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,420
She's very happy.

448
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,980
Congratulations.

449
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,620
Bring her here when you have time.

450
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,380
I promise I'll make them stay together forever.

451
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,780
Some people think

452
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,100
these are all fake.

453
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,940
But many people believe they're real.

454
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,540
Your mom didn't do anything wrong.

455
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,300
On the contrary, it's good.

456
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,140
She can make a lot of people feel good.

457
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,740
Not everyone can do that.

458
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:43,740
[Emmy: I asked around. His name is Nua. He's a relative of Mhok. There seems to be something between Nua and Korn. Everyone is gossiping. You're okay, right?

459
00:29:53,980 --> 00:30:00,980
[Korn: What's up, Bud?]

460
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,860
This is my date.

461
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,620
As long as Bud is happy,

462
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,970
I'm okay.

463
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,740
I'm fine.

464
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:34,980
What do you want to eat?

465
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,180
How about Som Tum?

466
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,220
Not bad.

467
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,900
Spicy food is good.

468
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,620
I'm so sleepy.

469
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,860
I don't know where I'm going to intern yet.

470
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,100
Emmy.

471
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,060
I can stay in the dorm now.

472
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,180
Awesome!

473
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,860
Hurray!

474
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,340
But...

475
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,210
I'm going to resign from Mek's shop.

476
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,940
-Yes.
-My mom won't let me work anymore.

477
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,500
See?

478
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,060
The chef left.

479
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,700
The waiter quit too.

480
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,139
I feel sorry for Mek.

481
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,219
I know.

482
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,460
By the way, friend,

483
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,420
when will you move in?

484
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:25,980
I don't know.

485
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,380
Bud.

486
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,980
Hi, Korn.

487
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,180
Looks like we're staying in the same room.

488
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,100
Oh.

489
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,500
In all seriousness,

490
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,860
is everything okay?

491
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,740
Are you not feeling well?

492
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,300
No.

493
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,220
Nothing.

494
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,860
I don't know how to say it.

495
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,780
Does your boyfriend live here too?

496
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,300
boyfriend?

497
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,500
I don't have a boyfriend, Bud.

498
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,420
Oh.

499
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,660
But everyone was saying...

500
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,460
I saw you hugging each other in front of the dorm that day.

501
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,020
You misunderstood.

502
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,940
That's Nua.

503
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,980
He's my junior.

504
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,060
And he's also Mhok's relative.

505
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,740
And he doesn't like boys.

506
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,340
How could we be together?

507
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,100
Would you mind

508
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,100
if I want to pursue you?

509
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:14,860
Huh?

510
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,500
I like you.

511
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,260
Are you for real?

512
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,300
Of course.

513
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,340
Why would I lie?

514
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,420
Actually,

515
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,060
you don't have to waste your time chasing me.

516
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,180
Do you have a boyfriend?

517
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,860
No.

518
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,980

00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,260
I like you too.

521
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,740
Then...

522
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,020
