1
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,080
All life is uncertain
There's the start

2
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:49,160
There's the end
Freedom from the cycle is a bliss

3
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,840
In less than no time, the body

4
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,800
Will lay on the ground

5
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,600
Get left behind without soul

6
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,720
Like an useless wood

7
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,360
CHAEMJARAT KONGNAKHAM
BORN 6 JANUARY 1953, DIED 2 FEBRUARY 2024

8
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,880
Wee.

9
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,040
Wee.

10
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,360
Auntie Rat.

11
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,400
Let him be alone for a while.

12
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,560
-But…
-Listen to him.

13
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,440
Grandma.

14
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,680
I'm trying to be happy.

15
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,760
But it's so hard, Grandma.

16
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,280
San has left.

17
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,240
Everyone that I love

18
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,760
has left me.

19
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,960
What should I do, Grandma?

20
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,360
What do you think of this scent?

21
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,320
It's nice.

22
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,160
I like it.

23
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,200
I missed this scent so much.

24
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,640
BAO GONG SHRINE

25
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,560
GODDESS NU WA

26
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,040
Goddess,

27
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,920
Mr. San is your faithful follower.

28
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
He's been taking care of this shrine.

29
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,320
He adheres to moral principles.

30
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,320
He always helps people
and follows your teachings.

31
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,160
Dear Goddess,

32
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,680
the mother of humanity,

33
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,200
please help Mr. San.

34
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,840
Please don't let his life
come to an end like this.

35
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,800
Today, I took Wee to the temple
for the columbarium interment.

36
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,880
Aren't you going to ask how he is?

37
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
He's…

38
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,160
probably sad.

39
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,880
Right, he's sad.

40
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,120
And on his saddest day,
you're not by his side.

41
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,840
You're there in my place.

42
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,560
What do you mean by that?

43
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,640
When I'm gone,

44
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,280
please take care of Wee for me.

45
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,040
What did you just say?

46
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,360
You're not only disrespecting me,
but you're also disrespecting Wee.

47
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,320
You should know
how he'd feel if he found out

48
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,640
you sacrificed your life for him,

49
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,320
He would never forget you.

50
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,560
Then what do you want me to do, Doctor?

51
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,240
Look at the state I'm in.

52
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,480
Should I have been there when
he said goodbye to his grandma?

53
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,600
I'd have made him even sadder.

54
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,480
There's nothing I could do, Doctor.

55
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,280
I could only make him cry harder.

56
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,600
Wee.

57
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Oh, Third.

58
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,040
I just dropped by to see you.

59
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,600
How are you?

60
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm sorry

61
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,080
for making everyone worried.

62
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,520
I'm…

63
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,320
I'm really awful.

64
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,760
Wee, no one thinks that.

65
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,280
Don't blame yourself.

66
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,760
Then who should I blame, Third?

67
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,800
San left because of me, didn't he?

68
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,960
You have nothing to do with that.

69
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,400
How can I not?

70
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,680
The more I think about it,

71
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,800
the more I'm sure.

72
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,880
That night, I got shot.

73
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,680
I remember the feeling.

74
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
The pain.

75
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,799
The feeling of someone who's dying.

76
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,520
But when I woke up,
there were no wounds on me.

77
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,640
San must have used
the Five-Colored Stone to heal me.

78
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm so stupid.

79
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,360
Why didn't I realize that sooner?

80
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,640
Wee.

81
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
He disappeared

82
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,280
because I stole his life.

83
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,200
I'm sure San doesn't want
to see my face anymore.

84
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,880
San doesn't want to see my face anymore.

85
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,160
It's not like that, Wee.

86
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,240
Mr. San just doesn't want you
to see him when he's weak.

87
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,080
He doesn't want you to feel bad.

88
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,360
So,

89
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,520
you know where he is?

90
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,760
Third.

91
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,720
Please tell me.

92
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,880
-I…
-I asked Auntie Rat.

93
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,320
I asked Xiong and Chu.

94
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,240
But no one told me anything.

95
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,600
Third.

96
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,760
I beg you.

97
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,480
Please let me go see San.

98
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,040
Please don't make me live
with this guilt for the rest of my life.

99
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,840
I can't live like that.

100
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,320
I can't live like that.

101
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,560
I don't want to be the one
who stole his life.

102
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,200
I don't want this life.

103
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,600
If he has to die because of me,
I don't want to live.

104
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Please.

105
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,720
Mr. San.

106
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,000
Mr. San.

107
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,880
Doctor Third, Mr. San
isn't going to make it.

108
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
San.

109
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,920
What are you doing, Doctor?

110
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,120
I'm really sorry.

111
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,600
Just talk to Wee.

112
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,440
Doctor Tao, let's go.

113
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,520
Why did you do that?

114
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,680
Mr. San said he didn't want to see Wee.

115
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,280
Wee has the right to know the truth.

116
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,400
He should get to say goodbye
to the person he loves.

117
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,600
I don't think
this will be good for anyone.

118
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,960
It'll only cause more pain.

119
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,280
Parting without knowing the truth
would be more painful.

120
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,120
When Mr. San disappeared,
Wee became anxious

121
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,240
and he blamed himself.

122
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,960
It's better to let them talk.

123
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,600
At least,

124
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,960
they'll be able to spend
the rest of the time together.

125
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,080
Does it hurt, San?

126
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,280
I'm fine.

127
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,880
Third told me everything.

128
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,040
You used the Five-Colored Stone
to save me.

129
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,240
It's because of me.

130
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,880
It's because of me that you're like this.

131
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,480
That's not it.

132
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,720
I did it willingly.

133
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,160
I've lived long enough.

134
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,480
It's a hundred years, Wee.

135
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,840
Then what will happen to me?

136
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,240
Both you

137
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,480
and Grandma will leave me.

138
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,120
I don't want to be alone.

139
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,520
I don't want to be alone.

140
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,760
I don't want to be alone.

141
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,360
You're not alone.

142
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,800
You have Chu, Rat, and Xiong.

143
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,320
And Doctor Third too.

144
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,440
It's not the same.

145
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,120
I killed you.

146
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,040
You'll be dead because of me.

147
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,560
You'll be dead because of me.

148
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,680
Wee.

149
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,440
When we fought Suchat
at the Chinese opera theater,

150
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,280
do you remember what you said?

151
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,960
You told me

152
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,080
you're willing to save me

153
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,720
because you didn't want me to feel guilty.

154
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,720
Me too, Wee.

155
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,280
I'm very glad I could save you.

156
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,800
But I'll feel bad

157
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,960
if I make you feel guilty.

158
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,960
Then…

159
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,760
can you not leave me again?

160
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,360
Please.

161
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,320
I'm sorry.

162
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,480
I didn't want you to see me in this state.

163
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
I want you to remember me in a good way.

164
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
But if you leave me again,

165
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,880
what I will remember

166
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,560
is that I didn't get to be with you
until your last day.

167
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,920
I want to use the rest of the time

168
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,800
to be with you.

169
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,760
Please.

170
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,920
I'm sorry, Wee.

171
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,440
I'm sorry for hurting you.

172
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,440
I'm not going anywhere anymore.

173
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,880
Let's go home.

174
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,560
Great-Great-Grandfather.

175
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,520
Take it easy.

176
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,440
Easy.

177
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,640
Thanks.

178
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,240
Grandfather.

179
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,200
Are you really coming back home?

180
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,160
From today until the goddess' birthday,

181
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,680
I'll have to trouble you
with a sick man like me.

182
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,280
What do you mean by trouble?

183
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,040
Guys,

184
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,480
since Great-Great-Grandfather

185
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,880
has decided to stay at home,

186
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,640
instead of being sad,

187
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,240
shouldn't we make sure
he's surrounded by happiness?

188
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,400
Yeah, I agree.

189
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,200
Rat.

190
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,560
Didn't you hear what your daughter said?

191
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,000
What are you doing?

192
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,000
I can't help it.

193
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,079
Even if you can't, you have to.

194
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,400
Hold it. Keep holding it. Hold it.

195
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,520
Rat.

196
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,040
Your face looks funny as it is.

197
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,839
But look at your face now.

198
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,160
It's awful. Right, Xiong?

199
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,839
Great-Grandfather.

200
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,400
-Mom.
-You both are the same.

201
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,640
The daughter is even worse.
You started it.

202
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,640
-Hold it, you two.
-You're home.

203
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,840
Hold it.

204
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,360
Hold it.

205
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,720
Grandfather, let's get inside.

206
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,520
You're back home now.

207
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,080
Don't cry, Mom.

208
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,280
You started it.

209
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,520
-Here it is.
-Oh, put it here.

210
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,760
-Let me help.
-Fish maw soup.

211
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,480
Your favorite, Great-Grandfather.

212
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,680
Plus, we have fruits too.

213
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,120
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

214
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,320
Oh, San.

215
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,040
Why did you come outside?

216
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,520
You weren't in the room.

217
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,720
Why are you out here at this hour?

218
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,440
I came to see the stars.

219
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,400
Come on.

220
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,000
Wee.

221
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,680
Do you think spirits are real?

222
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,800
Yes, I do.

223
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,640
You've lived for a hundred years.

224
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,800
When I'm gone,

225
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,120
I'll be the brightest star up there.

226
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,120
I'll be watching you from there.

227
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,320
You must be strong.

228
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,800
I will be strong.

229
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,280
If you feel sad,

230
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,000
just come out here.

231
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,920
I'll be watching you from there.

232
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,640
You understand?

233
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,600
CHAEMJARAT KONGNAKHAM
BORN 6 JANUARY 1953, DIED 2 FEBRUARY 2024

234
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,520
Grandma.

235
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
I brought your grandson-in-law.

236
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,880
Hurry.

237
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,520
Wee is here.

238
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,840
Three, two… Hold hands, please.

239
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,600
Rat, why are you crying?

240
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,360
Tomorrow is the goddess' birthday, Dad.

241
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,000
Great-Grandfather

242
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,440
is going to leave us.

243
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,880
Don't talk about inauspicious things.
Grandfather will worry.

244
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,480
He's not going anywhere.

245
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,080
I guess he'll stay with us forever.

246
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,080
San, does it hurt?

247
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,160
Auntie.

248
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,080
Are you okay? You seem tired.

249
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,240
I didn't sleep well.

250
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,320
Auntie!

251
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,240
Auntie!

252
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Auntie!

253
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,760
Why am I so unlucky?!

254
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,720
"The Goddess' Birthday."

255
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,680
ON THE GODDESS' BIRTHDAY, 24 FEBRUARY 2024
THE SHRINE INVITES ALL THE FOLLOWERS

256
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,080
Where's Grandpa?

257
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,960
He's been visiting temples
and hasn't come back since this morning.

258
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,720
He told us to meet him at the shrine.

259
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,800
Why do we have to take the trouble
to go to the shrine?

260
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,680
Shouldn't we just
let Great-Great-Grandfather…

261
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,920
pass peacefully at home?

262
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,400
Tao said

263
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,680
the goddess' power

264
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,920
will help guide Great-Grandfather's spirit
to a good place.

265
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,240
Let's go.

266
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,120
I'm ready.

267
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,240
BAO GONG SHRINE

268
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,800
San.

269
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,880
-Mr. San.
-Ton, Third.

270
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,080
We want to see Mr. San off too.

271
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,600
Thank you, Doctor.

272
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,880
Let's go.

273
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,800
Slowly.

274
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,680
After midnight,

275
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,200
if the 100-year reverse ceremony

276
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,640
hasn't been performed,

277
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,920
your body…

278
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,800
-will…
-Tao.

279
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,320
I know what will happen to my body.

280
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,080
When it's almost midnight,

281
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,360
you should come pray here, Mr. San.

282
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,120
Concentrate on your mind.

283
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,280
I'll perform a ritual
to help guide your spirit.

284
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,120
It's almost time.

285
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,480
Help Mr. San come sit here.

286
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,360
San, get up slowly.

287
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,400
Slowly.

288
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,200
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-Great-Grandfather

289
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,000
Great-Great-Grandfather.

290
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,880
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-San.

291
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,600
Rat.

292
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,920
Thank you so much.

293
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,680
You all have been taking care of me
all these years.

294
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,520
Must have been a lot of trouble.

295
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,160
Not at all.

296
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,680
We're happy to do it.

297
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,000
We're grateful to you,
Great-Great-Grandfather.

298
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Don't cry.

299
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,000
Chu,

300
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,600
I gotta thank you too.

301
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,080
When I'm gone, don't be stubborn.

302
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,120
Listen to Rat.

303
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,920
And take care of yourself too, Chu.

304
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,080
I should have listened to you more.

306
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,440
No.

307
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,200
It's good that you argued with me.

308
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,560
An old man like me

309
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,480
has learned a lot from you, Chu.

310
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,240
Wee.

311
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,600
From now on,

312
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,160
you have to take care of yourself.

313
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,520
San.

314
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,960
You gave me this life.

315
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,200
I'll live it to the fullest.

316
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,000
I'll take care of myself.

317
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,920
I will live happily.

318
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,440
Even though it'll be hard without you,

319
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,040
I will manage it.

320
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,720
I will be happy.

321
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,080
Don't cry, Wee.

322
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,280
It's almost time.

323
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,640
Wee.

324
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
-Wee.
-Wee.

325
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,880
Come on, Wee.

326
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,520
San.

327
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,560
Wee.

328
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,960
-San.
-Wee.

329
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,320
What's that sound?

330
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,400
I'll go check it out.

331
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,480
-I'll go with you.
-Sure.

332
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,680
Who's that?

333
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,240
I've been unlucky to the very end.

334
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,320
You. What are you doing here?

335
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,880
San!

336
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,520
San!

337
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,200
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-San!

338
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,960
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-San!

339
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,840
We're here.

340
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,120
You.

341
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,840
What do you want now?

342
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,040
Hey, calm down.

343
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,080
I come in peace.

344
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,000
What peace?

345
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,680
Whenever you come, you bring trouble!

346
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,400
-Look what's happening now!
-Wait a sec.

347
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,800
Here.

348
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,400
The Five-Colored Stone.

349
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,720
Oh, shit.

350
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,440
Oh, no.

351
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,560
I'm doomed.

352
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,560
There's a fragment of the stone left.
I don't know if it can be used.

353
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,880
A fragment of the stone,

354
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,920
can it be used, Doctor Tao?

355
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,680
I don't know either.

356
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,600
What?

357
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,560
San.

358
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,080
San.

359
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,920
San!

360
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,960
San can't take it anymore.

361
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,000
Use the fragment.

362
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,960
Hurry up, guys!

363
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
What do I do?

364
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,160
I didn't bring anything
for the reverse ceremony.

365
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,560
Doctor.

366
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,240
Water. We have to grind the stone
and mix it with water.

367
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,960
It must be done before midnight.

368
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,400
It's almost midnight.

369
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,960
We're running out of time.

370
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,280
Hey, Wee!

371
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,080
Wee, give me your hand.

372
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,880
Give it to me.

373
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,760
What are you doing, huh?
What are you doing?

374
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,160
That's not the right way.

375
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,720
San!

376
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,720
San!

377
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,400
Great-Grandfather.

378
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,200
Mr. San.

379
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,600
Mr. San.

380
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Mr. San.

381
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
Mr. San.

382
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,159
San!

383
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,679
San!

384
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,560
San!

385
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,440
San!

386
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,040
Great-Grandfather.

387
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,000
Great-Great-Grandfather.

388
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,800
He's not breathing.

389
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,720
He's not breathing!

390
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,120
Great-Great-Grandfather.

391
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,320
Excuse me.

392
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,120
His pulse is back.

393
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,000
Mr. San.

394
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,800
The goddess has answered
to the reverse ceremony.

395
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,080
Goddess Nu Wa,

396
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,120
the mother of humanity,

397
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,400
with the power

398
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,880
of the goddess who is our ancestor,

399
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
please

400
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,360
break the 100-year destiny bond.

401
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,400
San.

402
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,080
San.

403
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,040
Guys, he's alive.

404
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,680
He's alive, Auntie Rat.

405
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,760
Wake up.

406
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,280
Great-Grandfather.

407
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,560
What a moving moment.

408
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,840
In this case,

409
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,600
I'll reduce the fragment's price for you.
It'll be dirt cheap.

410
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,560
It'll be only five million.

411
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,280
I won't charge them anymore, Goddess.

412
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,360
I won't charge them. Ow!

413
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,200
I'm scared now, Goddess.

414
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,120
San.

415
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,720
I'm back, Wee.

416
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,880
And I'm not going anywhere ever again.

417
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,960
Here. It's to celebrate
making a gold nameplate

418
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,160
for Goddess Nu Wa.

419
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,240
Yes.

420
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,720
-You can come.
-If you have time,

421
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,760
please come.

422
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,320
Please come. It's on Sunday 10th March.

423
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,720
At the shrine. We're celebrating making
a gold nameplate for Goddess Nu Wa.

424
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,480
-Right.
-Please come.

425
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,240
THE SHRINE INVITES ALL THE FOLLOWERS TO
GODDESS NU WA EVENT ON 10TH MARCH

426
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,000
Are you free on 10th March?

427
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,560
-Yes.
-There's an event at the shrine.

428
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,240
Doctor Tao.

429
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,040
My mom made fried noodles for you.

430
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,800
And she said she'll come to talk to you
in the late afternoon

431
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,560
about the nameplate event.

432
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,320
-Thanks a lot.
-Sure.

433
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,480
Dear my ancestors
who took care of this shrine,

434
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,680
I did it.

435
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,080
I successfully saved Mr. San.

436
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,960
The mission that was passed on to me

437
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,720
has been accomplished.

438
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,200
I'd like to thank all my ancestors

439
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,200
for supporting me.

440
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
I promise that

441
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,040
from now on,
I'll take good care of this shrine.

442
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,360
I will make our shrine

443
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,680
even more prosperous than it is.

444
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,880
Hey, Doctor Tao.

445
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,200
So,

446
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,240
between Wee and the con girl,

447
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,080
who is the real Ms. Wad?

448
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,000
Why do you ask?

449
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,000
Because I'm curious.

450
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,120
The Five-Colored Stone
answered to both Wee and her.

451
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,320
And during the ritual,

452
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,520
both Wee and the girl
fed Great-Great-Grandfather the stone.

453
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,200
So, who's the real one?

454
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,200
Just let what happened in the past
stay in the past.

455
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,480
Right now,

456
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,640
the person Mr. San loves
and has chosen is Wee.

457
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,840
Perhaps

458
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,160
this is what the goddess wants to tell us.

459
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,080
Don't search for things of the past.

460
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,440
Live in the present.

461
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,040
Why are you out here?

462
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,520
What are you doing?

463
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,640
We have to wake up early tomorrow
to go to the shrine. Why are you still up?

464
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,120
I'm about to go to bed.

465
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,040
Let's go.

466
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,240
What?

467
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,360
It's unbelievable

468
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,200
that I got to marry you

469
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,680
and live with you like this.

470
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,440
Back then,

471
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,600
if someone'd told me
my soulmate would look like this,

472
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,200
I'd have kicked their ass.

473
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,000
Well, Tao did tell me that.

474
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,760
And I did kick him.

475
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
Why?

476
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,240
What's wrong with my face?

477
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,360
Your face is…

478
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,120
Hey, no. What are you doing?

479
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,960
Why?

480
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,880
We have to wake up early tomorrow.

481
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,640
It's not that late. We still have time.

482
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,800
Come on.

483
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,080
No. I'm going to sleep.

484
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,280
Wee.

485
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,720
Let's sleep, then. You can just lie there.

486
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,200
BAO GONG SHRINE

487
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,000
BAO GONG SHRINE

488
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,120
GODDESS NU WA

489
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,640
Bow to the goddess.

490
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,960
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

491
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,080
Would you like a lot? A lot, then.

492
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,600
Be careful.

493
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,200
-It's hot. Be careful.
-Smells very nice.

494
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,960
It's still hot.

495
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,600
Here it is.

496
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,320
-Here.
-Anything I can help with?

497
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,000
You're sweating.

498
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,680
Oh, Doctor.

499
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,160
Have you tried the vegetarian food?

500
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,080
Auntie Rat's cooking is very good.

501
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,280
I'll try later. I'm not hungry now.

502
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,040
Don't worry about it, Doctor.

503
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,880
Hey,

504
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,360
this morning, when you asked me
to read your fortune.

505
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,080
It says

506
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,440
you'll meet your soulmate soon for sure.

507
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,440
I guarantee with my reputation.

508
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,040
Well, I hope it'll come true.

509
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,240
Come on, let's go eat.
Or there won't be any left.

510
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,800
-Yeah?
-Okay.

511
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,720
Goddess.

512
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,080
I'd like to thank you again

513
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,760
for being kind to me, protecting me,

514
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,400
and leading me to Wee.

515
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,280
Now I know holding on to the past,

516
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,960
dreaming of something
that has already passed

517
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,640
only brings misery.

518
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,880
From now on,

519
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,200
I'll live in the present

520
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,640
as happily as I can.

521
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,280
Thank you, Goddess.

522
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,880
And please

523
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,240
help protect…

524
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,880
me and San.

525
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,920
And everyone like this forever.

526
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,320
Let's go.

527
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,120
Wee.

528
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,880
I don't know what will happen after this.

529
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,320
But I promise you,

530
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,880
as long as I am alive,

531
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,360
I will love you,

532
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,400
and I will never leave you.

533
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,600
And I will make you happy every day.

534
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,920
I'm happy

535
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,080
just having you with me.

536
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,080
You're my happiness.

537
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,400
I love you.

538
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,320
Let's go.

539
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,200
THE END
