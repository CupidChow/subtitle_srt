1
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,960
NO TRESPASSING

2
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,120
Mr. San already went in, Rat.
Should we call the police?

3
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,640
Yes.

4
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,400
Go. What are you waiting for?

5
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,840
-Mr. San!
-Great-Great-Grandfather!

6
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,360
-San!
-Great-Great-Grandfather.

7
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,680
Great-Great-Grandfather.

8
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,880
What I heard is true.

9
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,840
Approaching the goddess' birthday,

10
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,520
if you're not near the Five-Colored Stone,

11
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,360
you're nothing but a child.

12
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,440
Get all of them out here.

13
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,560
Come on.

14
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,960
-Don't!
-Don't!

15
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,640
-Hey!
-Don't touch me!

16
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,440
-Hey!
-Come here!

17
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,800
-Let go!
-Don't touch me!

18
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,680
Come here!

19
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,680
-Wee. Chu.
-Let go!

20
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,240
Let go!

21
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,160
Chu.

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,640
We got it, boss.

23
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,080
Last time

24
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,400
you almost got me drowned.

25
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,000
-San!
-Mr. San!

26
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,480
-Great-Great-Grandfather!
-San!

27
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,920
Mr. San!

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
Great-Great-Grandfather!

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,680
No!

30
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,680
Enough!

31
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
-San!
-Great-Great-Grandfather!

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,080
Hey!

33
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,480
-Hey!
-San!

34
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,160
-Get them!
-Let him go!

35
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,960
Let go, asshole!

36
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,640
Let go! Get off me!

37
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
San!

38
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,920
Here.

39
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,440
Huh?

40
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,800
Great-Great-Grandfather.

41
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,000
-San!
-Great-Great-Grandfather!

42
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,160
-Mr. San!
-Great-Great-Grandfather!

43
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,560
-Mr. San!
-San!

44
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,720
-Mr. San.
-San!

45
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,120
Mr. San.

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,440
Are you okay, San?

47
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,000
San!

48
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,000
Mr. San.

49
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,680
-San.
-Great-Great-Grandfather

50
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,720
Wee,

51
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,720
take everyone to Doctor Third.

52
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,840
Leave this to me.

53
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,279
Yes.

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,000
-Go.
-Let's go.

55
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,920
Hurry.

56
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,680
-Let's go.
-Go.

57
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,480
Hey.

58
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,320
-Wee!
-Wee!

59
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,920
I'm okay. You guys go to Third.

60
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,440
Doctor Tao, go find Doctor Third.
I'll help Wee.

61
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,320
Hurry.

62
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,160
Wee, are you okay?

63
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,080
Come on.

64
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,760
Come on. One, two, three.

65
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,080
Great-Grandfather.

66
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,640
Please forgive me. I've done wrong.

67
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,800
You betray even your family.

68
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,000
I have to punish you for that.

69
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,160
The goddess' birthday
is only a few days away.

70
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,200
We'll be done with the Five-Colored Stone.

71
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,920
It's not that easy, Mr. San.

72
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,160
-Let go!
-Let go!

73
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,000
Let go!

74
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,320
Let go.

75
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,680
-Wee.
-San.

76
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,680
-Chu.
-Great-Great-Grandfather.

77
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
Give me the stone

78
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,920
and I'll let them go.

79
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,160
You can't do that, San.

80
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,920
San, don't believe them.

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,440
Take the stone and run!

82
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,560
Shut up!

83
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,960
Damn you,

84
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,640
Chen.

85
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,800
You're useless.

86
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,040
You never get anything done.

87
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,840
Stop with your tricks.

88
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,360
Give me the stone.

89
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,840
-Wee!
-Wee!

90
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,000
Wee! Ow. Wee!

91
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,480
San, run! I'm okay.

92
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,760
Enough!

93
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,640
Wee!

94
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,800
Take the stone

95
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,720
but don't hurt Wee.

96
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,040
-No. No, San.
-Great-Great-Grandfather!

97
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,280
Great-Great-Grandfather.

98
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,680
San, don't.

99
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,320
Don't!

100
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,520
Let them go.

101
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,600
Kill them all!

102
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,320
-Wee!
-San!

103
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,240
-San!
-Watch out!

104
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,919
It's mine.

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,640
It's mine. Let go.

106
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,280
-Let go.
-Watch out!

107
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,840
-San!
-Great-Great-Grandfather!

108
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
Let go!

109
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,000
Hey, the stone!

110
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,240
Die, old man.

111
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,800
The stone. My stone.

112
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,360
The stone.

113
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,640
No.

114
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,440
No.

115
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,640
It's mine.

116
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,960
Wee?

117
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,000
Wee!

118
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,800
-Great-Great-Grandfather!
-Chu.

119
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,360
Great-Great-Grandfather, are you okay?

120
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,600
I'm fine. You're okay, Chu?

121
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,200
-I'm fine.
-Where's Wee?

122
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
Where's Wee?

123
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,200
San.

124
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,560
-Wee.
-Wee.

125
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,480
You're safe, right?

126
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,320
Wee, you're okay, right?

127
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,680
-Wee.
-Wee!

128
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,160
-Wee.
-Wee.

129
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,200
Wee.

130
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,880
-Wee.
-Wee.

131
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,560
Wee, hang in there.

132
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,000
-Wee?
-Doctor!

133
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,440
-Help him!
-Wee?

134
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,720
-Wee?
-Help him.

135
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,880
Mr. San, press the wound.

136
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,560
His pulse's very weak.

137
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,480
I'll get my aid kit from my car.

138
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,840
-Call an ambulance. Keep pressing it.
-I will.

139
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,280
Wee, stay with me. Wee.

140
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,840
Wee.

141
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,240
San.

142
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,480
Wee, don't talk.

143
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,480
You're okay, right?

144
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,320
I'm fine.

145
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,480
You have to be fine too.

146
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,560
Wee.

147
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm glad you're okay.

148
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,080
Wee.

149
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,560
Wee. Wee, stay with me.

150
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,920
Wee.

151
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,960
Wee.

152
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,720
You're in this state because of me.

153
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,280
This happened because of me.

154
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,240
This is my fault.

155
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,200
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,760
Wee.

157
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,400
Wee, stay with me.

158
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,200
-No, Wee. I don't wanna fail again.
-Wee.

159
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,360
I haven't saved anyone, Wee.

160
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,640
Wee.

161
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,360
I think…

162
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,960
I'm starting to understand Ms. Wad.

163
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,240
Back then

164
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,200
she must've had no regrets…

165
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,760
for saving you.

166
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,280
Come on.

167
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,600
Me too.

168
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,800
Don't you feel guilty.

169
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,960
San.

170
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,200
Promise me…

171
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,200
that you'll be happy

172
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,640
without me.

173
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,840
No, Wee.

174
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,800
I'll be happy

175
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,640
only when I have you.

176
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
I love you.

177
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,000
San.

178
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,920
-Wee.
-Wee.

179
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,720
-Wee!
-Wee!

180
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,440
Wee! Wake up!

181
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,520
Wee.

182
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,240
Tao, help him.

183
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,560
What can I do?

184
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,240
The Five-Colored Stone.

185
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,960
Wee's still breathing.
Doctor Hong used it to save me.

186
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,320
Mr. San,

187
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,560
if the stone was still intact,

188
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,960
that might work.

189
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,960
But we only have half of it.

190
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,800
And Wee's injury is severe.

191
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,560
I'm afraid that…

192
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,760
What, Doctor Tao?

193
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,720
That the stone would disintegrate.

194
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,200
And if we don't have the stone
to perform the ritual for Mr. San,

195
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,560
on the goddess' birthday,

196
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,000
Mr. San's gonna die too.

197
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,000
Do it.

198
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,440
-But…
-I made my decision.

199
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Save Wee.

200
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,640
I've lived long enough.

201
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,680
Hurry, Tao!

202
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,680
If Wee stops breathing,
the stone won't help!

203
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,960
Yeah.

204
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,960
What are you doing?

205
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,240
Don't go in there yet,

206
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,120
But Wee needs first aid!

207
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,520
Trust us!

208
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,760
Goddess Nu Wa,
the god who created humanity,

209
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,440
please save this life.

210
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,880
Let me go!

211
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,200
Doctor!

212
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,040
Wee. How are you feeling, Wee?

213
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,000
-San?
-Nothing hurts, right?

214
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,320
No.

215
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,360
Why is there no pain?

216
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,200
The bullet just grazed you.

217
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,760
The blood loss probably scared you.

218
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,160
I wouldn't let anything happen to you.

219
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,440
Or Mr. San would have killed me.

220
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,320
Get some rest, Wee. Come on, lie down.

221
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,760
You're okay, right?

222
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,880
I'm fine.

223
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,440
They're here.

224
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,320
I'm fine now.
You don't have to support me.

225
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,400
I have to.
I can't let anything else happen to you.

226
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,080
Sit down.

227
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,080
Please eat up.

228
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,320
I'll do it.

229
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,200
That's enough, San. That's too much.

230
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,080
No, you have to eat a lot.

231
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,160
Hey,

232
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,360
Doctor Third said
you could eat normally now.

233
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,000
Here you go.

234
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,760
-Great-Great-Grandfather?
-San?

235
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,200
Are you okay?

236
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,480
I'm fine.

237
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,360
I'm fine.

238
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,280
Have some water.

239
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,840
Have some.

240
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,080
He probably watched you in the hospital
without much food or sleep,

241
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,600
so he's tired.
Right, Great-Great-Grandfather?

242
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,360
Tom yum is cold now.

243
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,400
I'll reheat it, Great-Grandfather.

244
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
I'll help you.

245
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Well, eat. This one is very delicious.

246
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,320
Try it.

247
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
-Chu, eat up. Here.
-Yes.

248
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,240
The food's getting cold.

249
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,320
Watch out!

250
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,880
-Wee.
-Wee!

251
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,680
San.

252
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,040
I missed this scent so much.

253
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,040
San?

254
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,280
Didn't I get shot that day?

255
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,400
Why don't I have any scars?

256
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,880
On my leg too.

257
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,320
You passed out for two days.

258
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,560
Doctor Third healed all of them.

259
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,160
But there should be some scars left.

260
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,600
I don't know how he healed them.

261
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,640
If I run into Doctor Third, I'll ask him.

262
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm gonna get dressed.

263
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,840
San!

264
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,240
Blood.

265
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,880
Come take a seat.

266
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,480
What's wrong with you?

267
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,640
Nothing's wrong with me.

268
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,640
Seeing you like this
probably got my blood pumping.

269
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,920
I missed you so much.

270
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,080
San.

271
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,720
Stop it. You're joking around.

272
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,080
Come on.

273
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,360
I love you.

274
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,840
I love you too.

275
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,520
BAO GONG SHRINE

276
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,000
What's going on, Doctor Tao?
Have you found a way?

277
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,280
I've checked all the books.
I haven't found anything.

278
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,120
GODDESS NU WA

279
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,040
Goddess,

280
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,200
I've worshiped you at this shrine
since I could remember.

281
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,480
I've never asked you for anything.

282
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,520
But this time I'm begging you,

283
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,920
please help us.

284
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,920
Don't let it end this way.

285
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,640
It's huge.

286
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,120
PHITSAMAI, CHAYA SIAM

287
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,560
You never took me to the market.
What made you take me today?

288
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,120
I wanted to shake things up.

289
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,600
Let me know if you want something.

290
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,400
My face alone will get them for free.

291
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,000
They think I'm Xiong's grandson.

292
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,480
-You got it.
-Thank you.

293
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,920
Wanna sit and have some snacks?

294
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,920
All right.

295
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,320
The famous youtiao.

296
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,560
Eat up. I tore it for you.

297
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,840
Delicious.

298
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,120
Shumai.

299
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,560
Is it good?

300
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,320
Your lips are greasy.

301
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,040
Wipe them.

302
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,200
What's this?

303
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,760
My marriage proposal.

304
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,640
Wee.

305
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,000
Why?

306
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,800
I should be standing, right?

307
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,680
Wee,

308
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,800
let's get married.

309
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,320
We're already married.

310
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,920
This is different.

311
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,160
At the time we only
got married to undo bad luck.

312
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,800
This time I want a real ceremony.

313
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,560
The one that comes from my love.

314
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,800
This time I'll have Xiong
invite the whole market.

315
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,120
What? You're not embarrassed anymore?

316
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,280
You once said
marrying a man was embarrassing.

317
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,280
Not anymore.
I'll announce it to the world.

318
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,040
So no one will hit on you again.

319
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,240
That's why you proposed with shumai?

320
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,560
Its name is perfect for courting.

321
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,920
Jeez, San. Your joke is so outdated.

322
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,680
You really are an old man.

323
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,600
Do you love this old man?

324
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,200
Wee,

325
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,360
please marry me.

326
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,400
Really?

327
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,720
You're really marrying Brother Handsome?

328
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,080
Really, Grandma. And this time
we're not doing it to undo bad luck.

329
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,960
It's for real.

330
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,680
So I wanted to formally
ask you for his hand this time.

331
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,280
But I don't have older relatives
so I brought my descendants.

332
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,400
As for the dowry,

333
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,520
you can name your price.

334
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,560
I'm not boasting

335
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,040
but I'm saying our family is very rich.

336
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,400
Or if you want a big wedding,
just let us know.

337
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,440
Should we have a Chinese banquet
for 100 or 200 guests?

338
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,760
I have only one request, San.

339
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,960
I want you to take good care of Wee.

340
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,760
Now my mind is at ease,

341
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,880
knowing that when I'm gone,

342
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,480
someone else will take good care of Wee.

343
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,400
I promise…

344
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,120
I'll do my best to take care of Wee

345
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,240
and make him happy

346
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,520
until my last breath.

347
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,760
Oh, you're not done yet?

348
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,080
Rat, what's wrong with you?

349
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,480
Crying over the wedding souvenirs.

350
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,880
It's bad luck.

351
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,280
Well, I'm sad, Dad.

352
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,840
That day should make Great-Grandfather

353
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,200
the happiest.

354
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,000
That's right.

355
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,000
Why does it have to be this way?

356
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,120
He's been suffering for 100 years

357
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,920
waiting for the person he loves.

358
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,400
Now that he found him,

359
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,520
why does it have to be this way?

360
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,000
-Auntie Rat!
-He's coming.

361
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,800
-Quiet.
-Right.

362
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,720
Oh, Wee.

363
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,920
Are you okay, Rat?

364
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,640
Oh, she's okay.

365
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,360
She's allergic to dust.

366
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,080
And she's happy

367
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,600
you and my grandfather
are getting married.

368
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,280
-I see.
-That's right. What do you need, Wee?

369
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,720
I'm here to help with the souvenirs.

370
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,040
-Is there something I can do?
-No, no need. We don't need help.

371
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,800
If my grandfather finds out
you're doing this, he'll kill me.

372
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,280
San won't mind. Let me help.

373
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,920
That won't do.
I know my grandfather the best.

374
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,560
You should go relax
and save your energy. Okay? Go on.

375
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,600
-Are you sure?
-Yes. Trust me. Go on.

376
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,440
-Okay.
-Go relax.

377
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
That was close.

378
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,160
Stop crying.

379
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,800
Hurry up.

380
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,120
That too.

381
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,120
Chu. Wait, Chu. Chu!

382
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,239
It's really weird, Chu.

383
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,639
Why do I feel like
everyone's hiding something?

384
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,080
What's weird?

385
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,679
Well, I saw Auntie Rat cry.

386
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,560
You're overthinking it, Wee.

387
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,480
That's how my mom is.
She cries very easily.

388
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,199
When she watches TV series,

389
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,000
she always cries with them.

390
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,239
I see.

391
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,880
Really, Chu? You're not hiding
anything from me, right?

392
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,000
Really.

393
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,400
Don't worry.

394
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,360
If you do, you won't look
handsome on your wedding day.

395
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,639
Go relax.

396
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,320
Goddess!

397
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,520
Goddess,

398
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,080
please let me and San

399
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,200
live together for another 100 years.

400
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,360
San!

401
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,400
San!

402
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,400
San! Wait for me!

403
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
San!

404
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,320
San, wait for me!

405
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,200
San!

406
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,400
San!

407
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,760
San, where are you going?

408
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,160
San!

409
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,320
San!

410
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,240
San!

411
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,680
San!

412
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,880
San?

413
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,040
San?

414
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,800
San?

415
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
-San.
-Wee?

416
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,400
Where were you? You scared me.

417
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,280
What's wrong, Wee?
I just came down for some water.

418
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,160
I had a nightmare.

419
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,240
I dreamed that you left me.

420
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,440
It was just a dream, Wee.

421
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,280
As long as I live,

422
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,040
I'll never leave you.

423
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,880
I'm scared, San.

424
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,480
In the dream

425
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,040
I felt like you were really leaving me.

426
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,720
It's okay, Wee.

427
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,680
I'm not going anywhere. I'm here.

428
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,680
Let me see.

429
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Come on. Let's get back to bed.

430
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,800
Come.

431
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,280
-Thanks, Chu.
-Sure.

432
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,080
Come on. Thanks, Wee.

433
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,560
You love tofu, right?

434
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,360
Thank you.

435
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,120
Eat up.

436
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,920
Thank you.

437
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,120
Chu,

438
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,520
after you're done,
peel some fruits for me.

439
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,240
Yes.

440
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,720
Let's eat.

441
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,640
Yes, Third?

442
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,640
Yes. I'll be right there.

443
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,720
What happened?

444
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,280
My grandma's getting worse, San.

445
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,200
I'm here, Grandma.

446
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,400
What do you think?
Am I handsome in this suit?

447
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,640
Chaem's grandson is always handsome.

448
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,840
It's a shame.

449
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,240
I won't be there on your wedding day.

450
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,440
But I'm glad…

451
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,440
you have someone who will take care of you

452
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,520
and be by your side.

453
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,560
Cherish each other.

454
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
Promise me, Wee,

455
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,760
that no matter what trouble you face,

456
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
you won't let go of each other's hand.

457
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,280
That you'll hold each other's hand…

458
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,000
tightly…

459
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,720
and get past it together.

460
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,320
I promise.

461
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,280
Thank you, San.

462
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,400
As for you, don't worry.

463
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,200
I'll come and tell you
the winning numbers.

464
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,480
Jeez, Grandma.

465
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,960
You barely ever won lottery
when you're alive.

466
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,720
Will you predict correctly? Hm?

467
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,120
It's okay, Wee.

468
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,680
I already told you it wasn't scary.

469
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,560
I'll try to do what you taught me.

470
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,480
I'll live my life as happily as I can.

471
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,040
Don't worry, Grandma.

472
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,480
That's what I'm talking about.

473
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,840
You really are Chaem's grandson.

474
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,840
I used to think that before I go,

475
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,000
there would only be me and Wee,

476
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,480
but look now.

477
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,600
There are a lot of people here.

478
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,600
I'm glad.

479
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,840
It's much better than I thought.

480
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,800
Right?

481
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,520
Yeah.

482
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,840
Grandma.

483
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,560
Grandma.

484
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,000
Wee.

485
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,120
I'll deal with the hospital for you.

486
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,440
You can pick her up later.

487
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,720
Don't worry about her funeral.

488
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,480
I'll take care of it.

489
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,680
Great-Great-Grandfather!

490
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,600
Are you okay?

491
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,480
Grandfather, are you okay? Grandfather.

492
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,680
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-Grandfather.

493
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,160
Grandpa, Mom, he's getting worse.

494
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,280
I'll call…

495
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,280
-I'll call Doctor Tao.
-Hurry.

496
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,400
Hurry!

497
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,560
-Great-Great-Grandfather
-Grandfather, can you manage?

498
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,960
What about Wee? What are we gonna do?

499
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,720
-Go.
-Chu.

500
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,320
You can't let him find out.

501
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,520
Is that clear, Chu?

502
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,200
Is that clear, Chu?

503
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,560
What's going, Rat? Hurry!

504
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,000
He's not doing well.

505
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,560
Hurry. Call Doctor Third too.

506
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,880
Please hurry!

507
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,040
-Grandfather.
-Great-Great-Grandfather.

508
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,160
Are you okay?

509
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:28,880
San!

510
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,160
San, wait for me!

511
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,280
San!

512
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,360
San!

513
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,280
San, where are you going?

514
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,080
Where's San?

515
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,520
Where is he?

516
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,400
Uh… He… went out…

517
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,320
Went out where, Xiong?

518
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,800
He's running an errand, Wee. It's nothing.

519
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,440
The food's ready.
Come and eat with us. Come on.

520
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,600
-Come on. Sit down.
-Sit down.

521
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,920
Come on. Let's eat.

522
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,760
Chu, where did San go?

523
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,960
Chu.

524
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,240
Please tell me.

525
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,720
What are you guys hiding from me?

526
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,440
Please tell me where San went!

527
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,080
I couldn't find him in any rooms.
And he's not at the dining table.

528
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,040
Where is he?

529
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,160
Calm down, Wee.

530
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,840
Something happened to San, didn't it?

531
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,200
Where is he?

532
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,040
He promised my grandma
he wouldn't leave me.

533
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,280
Auntie Rat, where's San?

534
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:15,960
Xiong?

535
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,440
Chu?

536
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,400
You're not gonna tell me? Fine.

537
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,800
I'll find him myself.

538
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:31,600
-Wee! Wait, Wee!
-Wee!

539
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,160
BAO GONG SHRINE

540
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,600
Doctor Tao!

541
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,480
Are you in there, Doctor?

542
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,200
Doctor Tao!

543
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,000
Doctor Tao, are you here?

544
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,120
Doctor Tao, are you here? Doctor Tao!

545
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,840
I injected you some painkiller.

546
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,720
Thank you, Doctor.

547
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,600
A hundred years ago,
you caused Ms. Wad's death.

548
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,800
I hated your guts.

549
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,800
Never thought I'd thank you.

550
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,520
Never mind what I did.

551
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,120
I'm a doctor. I help my patients
even if they hate me.

552
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,520
Mr. San, what about Wee?

553
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,600
I thought this through.

554
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,680
Tell him after I'm gone.

555
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,880
He'd be devastated if he found out now.

556
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,240
I don't want him to blame himself.

557
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,120
I think he has the right
to know what happened.

558
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,120
I don't want to see him suffer.

559
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,360
I don't want him to be heartbroken

560
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,520
seeing me die.

561
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,160
I want him to have
a positive memory of me.

562
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,800
Our happy times.

563
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,120
Coward.

564
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,400
I think you just don't wanna face him.

565
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,080
You're both cowardly and selfish.

566
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,240
Have you ever thought
how much the news would hurt him?

567
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,600
He has the right to say goodbye
to those he loves.

568
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,280
That's your opinion.

569
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,080
But I think this is the best way.

570
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,320
Mr. San.

571
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,360
Doctor Third,
Mr. San can't take this anymore.

572
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,040
If I'm gone, you have to be strong.

573
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,320
San!

574
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,800
San!

575
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,120
