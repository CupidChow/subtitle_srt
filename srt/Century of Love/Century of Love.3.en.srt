1
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,560
It's so good.

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,160
Can I have another bite?

3
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,360
The sick one…

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,800
is me.

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,480
Grandma,

6
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,520
can't you feed your grandson?

7
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,560
What's wrong?

8
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,760
Nothing's wrong.

9
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,480
Don't lie to me.

10
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,880
Goodness.

11
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,000
Whenever something's bothering you,

12
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,560
you come to me for comfort.

13
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,680
Oh, Grandma.

14
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,800
-Huh?
-Can I ask you something?

15
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,960
Let's say there's someone you care about

16
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,360
and want what's best for them,

17
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,240
but they dismiss you

18
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,120
and only see you in a bad light,

19
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,360
what would you do?

20
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,880
What would I do?

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,720
Forget them. Duh.

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,440
I'm gonna die any day now.

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,400
Why care about someone who dismiss you?

24
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,200
If they dismiss you,
stop caring about them.

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,280
-You're right. No need to care about them.
-No need.

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,760
Why would you care?

27
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,960
-Thank you, Grandma.
-Yes.

28
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,640
A handsome guy like you
doesn't need to care.

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,000
-Right?
-True.

30
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,160
Be careful, Grandpa.

31
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,280
Oh, Grandfather.

32
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,640
I think you should stay here.

33
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,480
I'll give my statement at the station
and I'll be right back.

34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,480
But I was the one fighting them off.

35
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,800
I saw their faces.
My statement would be better.

36
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,040
Jeez, if they ask who you are

37
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,960
and want to see your ID,
it's gonna cause problems.

38
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,440
It's better if you stay here.

39
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,560
-Let's go.
-Come.

40
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,280
I hate people who deceive others.

41
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,160
Is that why you do everything for money?

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,520
What right do you have
to dig into my life?

43
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,760
And you're looking down on me!

44
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Then tell me.

45
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,600
Why did you suddenly show up
in my neighborhood?

46
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Are you gonna say
you just happened to come by?

47
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,680
You got stabbed the other day.

48
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,720
I was worried, so I came to visit you.

49
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,400
But it seems you're doing just fine now.

50
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,080
I'm sorry, then.

51
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,680
I was stupid for butting in.

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,360
You have 100 years to find Ms. Wad.

53
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,320
I'll do anything.

54
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,480
I'll face torment.

55
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,160
As long as Ms. Wad and I

56
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,920
get to share a destiny again.

57
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,840
This is her, Mr. San. The real Ms. Wad.

58
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,680
Why does it hurt now?

59
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,080
PRIVATE PROPERTY, NO TRESPASSING

60
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,400
It's not new moon tonight.

61
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,920
Are you sure he's this kid?

62
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,760
This is him. Boss showed me his picture.

63
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,240
He can turn into a kid.

64
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
Hey!

65
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,920
Are you okay? Huh?

66
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,240
What do you bastards want?

67
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,560
Don't butt in!

68
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,760
Take it easy, Mister.

69
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,520
I ran into you guys yesterday.

70
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,840
You robbed San's house.

71
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,000
No!

72
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,920
Hey, officers!

73
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,520
Over here! They're child traffickers!

74
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,720
They're child traffickers! Help!

75
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,600
You're okay, right? Huh?

76
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,400
Kid.

77
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,400
YUWADEE PHANIT, PHITSAMAI

78
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,520
Hey,

79
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,040
we get hurt whenever
we run into each other.

80
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,480
Let's go.

81
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,640
Go where?

82
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,760
Report this to the police. Duh.

83
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,760
You were almost kidnapped.

84
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,360
No need to report this. I'm going home.

85
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,960
Hey, kid.

86
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,520
We have to report this. It's a big deal.

87
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,120
Come on.

88
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,800
Kid!

89
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,280
Kid!

90
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,840
Hey, kid.

91
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,800
Do you live here?

92
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,040
Who are you to that bastard San?

93
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,240
His brother.

94
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,040
Hey, kid!

95
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,000
Kid!

96
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,840
Wait, kid. Wait up.

97
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,760
Wait.

98
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,240
You're all alone here.
I'll keep you company.

99
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,120
I can help if they come for you again.

100
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,320
Thank you.

101
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,080
Does that hurt?

102
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,640
Oh, this is nothing.

103
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,680
What's your name, by the way?

104
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,800
Sun.

105
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,400
Your brother's San and you're Sun?

106
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,400
Not very creative.

107
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,120
But, kid,

108
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,040
I hope the similarity stops there.

109
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,560
Don't be like your pompous brother.

110
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
You're that mad at him?

111
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,200
Of course.

112
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,320
I was being thoughtful,

113
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,840
wanted to pay him a visit

114
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,000
but he accused me
of working with the thieves.

115
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,240
But then again, I'm a nobody.

116
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,520
I'm lame and poor.

117
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Anyone would assume I was exploiting him.

118
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,680
I'm gonna go change.

119
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,880
Sun!

120
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,120
Sun!

121
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,320
Sun!

122
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,800
Sun!

123
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,560
Sun, are you okay?

124
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,120
Sun!

125
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,400
Sun!

126
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,680
Sun!

127
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,840
Sun!

128
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,920
Sun, are you okay in there?

129
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,600
Sun!

130
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,760
-Hey!
-Hey!

131
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,640
How are you here?

132
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,840
-Hey!
-Hey!

133
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,880
Hey!

134
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,600
Hey! Ow!

135
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,320
-Get off me!
-My leg's stuck!

136
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,640
-Hey!
-My leg's stuck!

137
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,120
-Stuck what? Oh!
-Don't know!

138
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,800
Get off me.

139
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,560
-I can't. My leg's stuck.
-Get off me.

140
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,840
Grandfather!

141
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,720
Dad, I think we should leave.

142
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,360
I agree.

143
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,840
Hey, it's not what you think!

144
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,840
Xiong, come back and help me!

145
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,760
Chu!

146
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,640
Chu! Come back and help me!

147
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,400
Get off me!

148
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,800
Please tell Sun I left.

149
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,120
What?

150
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,040
Huh?

151
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,560
I was away for just one day.

152
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,600
All those things really happened?

153
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,040
Someone tried to steal the stone.

154
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,440
Mr. San turned into a kid

155
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,320
even though it's not new moon.

156
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,600
Don't forget.

157
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,880
Great-Great-Grandfather
was naked with Wee too.

158
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,280
How many times do I have to say
it was an accident?

159
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,960
As for the Five-Colored Stone,

160
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,640
leave that matter to me.

161
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,760
I guarantee no one can steal it.

162
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,960
What will you do?

163
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,080
I'll explain after I'm done.

164
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,280
But what matters right now

165
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,480
is we have to figure out

166
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,480
why these changes are suddenly

167
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,120
happening to Mr. San's body.

168
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,240
If it's left unchecked,

169
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,400
I think it's gonna be bad for Mr. San.

170
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,600
BAO GONG SHRINE

171
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,280
I see.

172
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,839
Yesterday I asked the goddess' opinion

173
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,320
as to why Mr. San
suddenly turned into a kid

174
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
when it wasn't new moon.

175
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,360
And why he suddenly came back.

176
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,240
The goddess' opinion is…

177
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,040
I can't read it.

178
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,760
Of course you can't read it.

179
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,040
Because we need to interpret
the prophecy from these wavy lines.

180
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,920
Without my training,

181
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,880
it won't make sense.

182
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,240
Eh?

183
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,360
Eh?

184
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,560
Why are you showing us this?

185
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,360
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

186
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,360
What did you find out?

187
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,600
Per my interpretation,

188
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,720
due to the centenary is near,

189
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,600
the Five-Colored Stone
poison gets stronger.

190
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,520
From now on,

191
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Mr. San may experience
physical pain from the poison

192
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,880
or turn into a kid at any time

193
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,320
with no way to predict it.

194
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,160
-What do we do then?
-Yeah.

195
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,440
Is there a way to fix it?

196
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,360
We already found the solution yesterday.

197
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,320
-Hey.
-Hey.

198
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,080
-Then--
-What do you mean, Tao?

199
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,800
You were with Wee yesterday, right?

200
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,680
Wee is your destined mate.

201
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,840
Wee's luck supports you in every aspect.

202
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
It can lessen the blow.

203
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,400
Oh, so that means
if Wee is with Great-Great-Grandfather,

204
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,560
the strength of the poison
will be lessened?

205
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,080
Ooh.

206
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,800
That's good.

207
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,360
But to be sure,

208
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,400
Mr. San's and Wee's lucks
must be tied together.

209
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,040
Tied together?

210
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,560
How?

211
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,160
-Mr. San, hear me out. Mr. San.
-Great-Grandfather.

212
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,440
-Mr. San, calm down.
-Are you guys crazy?

213
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,640
How can I marry Wee?

214
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,760
It's a way to tie your lucks.

215
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,640
Your tied lucks will help lessen the blow.

216
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,720
But Wee is a man.
We'll be killed by a lightning.

217
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,400
Jeez, you two were all over each other
yesterday. There was no lightning.

218
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,320
I told you it was an accident.

219
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,160
There was nothing untoward.

220
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,520
It's just a ceremony.
There won't be anything untoward either.

221
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,920
I won't marry him either way.

222
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,400
I won't do it
even if the pain kills me right here.

223
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,160
-Great-Grandfather.
-Mr. San.

224
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,080
-Great-Grandfather
-Mr. San

225
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,080
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-Mr. San.

226
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,120
Great-Grandfather.

227
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,000
Great-Great-Grandfather.

228
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,520
-Grandfather.
-Great-Great-Grandfather.

229
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,120
-Mr. San.
-Great-Great-Grandfather.

230
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,120
-Mr. San.
-Grandfather.

231
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,240
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-Mr. San.

232
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,800
-I'm fine.
-Oh.

233
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,520
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-Get out.

234
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Get out.

235
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,520
I said get out!

236
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,840
Get out!

237
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,160
It's usually over by morning.

238
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,960
But he's now in pain day and night.

239
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,720
Yeah.

240
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,200
Tao.

241
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,200
Is there really no other way to help him?

242
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,040
A luck tying wedding is the only way.

243
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,800
But if Mr. San refuse to do it,

244
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,240
we have to respect his decision.

245
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,480
I believe Mr. San is a man's man.

246
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,280
He can take it.

247
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,720
-Grandfather.
-Great-Great-Grandfather.

248
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,720
Everyone…

249
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,160
I'll marry Wee.

250
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,280
-Hey!
-Mr. San.

251
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,920
-Grandfather.
-Mr. San.

252
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,840
Grandfather.

253
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,560
What do you want?

254
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,320
I need to talk to you.

255
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,360
Buy me beer first.

256
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,400
Then we'll talk.

257
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,920
Thank you for buying me beer.

258
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,040
Aren't you here to apologize to me?

259
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,360
If you won't say the word,

260
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,360
I'll keep making you buy me beer.

261
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,520
I'm sorry.

262
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,480
I misunderstood you.

263
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,800
And thanks for saving my brother.

264
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,080
Sun?

265
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,080
Jeez, don't mention it.

266
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,600
No big deal.

267
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,880
Your criminal record
was a mix-up too, right?

268
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,480
My criminal record?

269
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,760
I did do those things.

270
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,640
Back when I was about…

271
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,160
eighteen.

272
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,760
This Wee

273
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,320
aced the TCAS exam.

274
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,360
Hey.

275
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,480
Despite my appearance,
I was a good student.

276
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,560
But I couldn't afford it.

277
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,000
Believe it or not,

278
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,600
someone convinced me
to open a bank account.

279
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,880
I did.

280
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,480
As soon as I did, I got arrested.

281
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,680
I didn't get to go to school anyway.

282
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,200
It sucked so bad.

283
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,560
Of course you would misunderstand me.

284
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,680
I look like a criminal.

285
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,920
I'm sorry, Ms. Wad.

286
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,800
It's because you're hanging out
with a lowlife like me.

287
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,080
So people talk behind my back?

288
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,400
I don't care about that, San.

289
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,320
Besides, you're not a lowlife.

290
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,320
When you hang out with someone,
what matters is their nature.

291
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,680
Not their birthrights.

292
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,000
You're kind. You help people.

293
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,720
That's why I feel comfortable

294
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
having you as a friend, San.

295
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,320
But then again, I'm a nobody.

296
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,960
I'm lame and poor.

297
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,760
Anyone would assume I was exploiting him.

298
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,720
I shouldn't have judged you.

299
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,160
Let me know if you need my help.

300
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,480
I'll do what I can.

301
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,400
Well said.

302
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,880
Thank you.

303
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,800
Likewise. Let me know

304
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,440
if you need my help.

305
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,880
I'll do what I can.

306
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,720
I actually have a favor to ask.

307
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,680
What is it? Tell me.

308
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,520
Marry me.

309
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,320
Jeez.

310
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,960
Why didn't you begin by saying

311
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,600
you'd marry me to negate bad luck?

312
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,160
I was in shocked,
thinking you had a crush on me.

313
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,920
No way.

314
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,080
I'd never fancy you.

315
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,840
I already love someone else.

316
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,440
She's beautiful and noble.

317
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,000
She has proper manners.

318
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,560
She's polite and kind.

319
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,440
Wow.

320
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,600
You just described me.

321
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,400
Are you crazy?

322
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,760
You're untidy,

323
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,200
filthy, loud,

324
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,160
rowdy, cunning, foul-mouthed,

325
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,200
completely shameless.
You're nothing like her.

326
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,080
Like the sky and an abyss,

327
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,520
a swan and a starling,

328
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,560
an orchid and a bolete mushroom.

329
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,160
Anyway, marry me.

330
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,560
Jeez.

331
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,680
Why would I after all the insults?

332
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,800
But I'll pay you.

333
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,480
EMERGENCY

334
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,040
Yeah, squeeze until it's almost dry.

335
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,960
A nurse told me you booked a special room.

336
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,960
Special rooms aren't covered
by the government.

337
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,480
Where did you get the money?

338
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,080
I just got my salary.

339
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,720
Besides, it's not that expensive.

340
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,200
Wee.

341
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,080
You didn't do anything bad, did you?

342
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
Grandma,

343
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,560
do you remember
that weird guy I told you about?

344
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,920
Why?

345
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,040
I'm marrying him.

346
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,160
Huh? What did you say?

347
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,680
He said he needed to marry me
to negate bad luck.

348
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,600
Oh, I'm so happy.

349
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,320
My grandson is gonna settle down.

350
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,720
I'm not settling down, Grandma.

351
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,040
It's just a fake wedding
to negate bad luck.

352
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,920
And he's paying me to do it.

353
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,160
Even so. It's still a wedding.

354
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,840
Next time you visit me,
take your husband with you.

355
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,840
He won't be my husband.

356
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,600
He doesn't fancy me.

357
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,240
Do you fancy him?

358
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,560
Huh?

359
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,360
Jeez, Grandma.

360
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,840
-Do you?
-Change the subject.

361
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,440
Do you?

362
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,920
Change the subject.

363
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,240
Hey, that was on my feet
and now it's on your face.

364
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,480
Grandma.

365
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,760
Jeez, you're a menace.

366
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,760
Wow, you're very handsome, Grandpa.

367
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,080
-You're pretty.
-Look at this.

368
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,320
It's your dress when you were younger.

369
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,160
I miss those days.

370
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,480
You're handsome today.

371
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,000
Great-Grandfather.

372
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,800
I don't agree with this wedding.

373
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,400
Who asked your opinion?

374
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,480
Great-Grandfather,

375
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,400
You can't marry him. He's a man.

376
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,080
And he's a swindler.

377
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,800
He's not the real Ms. Wad.

378
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,280
I know.

379
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,440
But I don't have a choice.

380
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,320
Great-Grandfather,

381
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,200
please wait for me.

382
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,360
I promise you
I'll find you the real Ms. Wad.

383
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,840
I have to marry him for now.

384
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,480
Find me the real Ms. Wad and we'll talk.

385
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,400
BAO GONG SHRINE

386
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,040
-That's it. Good.
-Is this correct?

387
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,360
-Rat.
-Yes?

388
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,120
-Do the fruit too.
-Every one, right?

389
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,360
Yes, put it on every fruit.

390
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,040
I haven't put it there.

391
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,639
-Make it pretty.
-You got it.

392
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,400
Great-Grandfather.

393
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,480
Turn them upside down.

394
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,520
-The cups.
-Oh, you got it.

395
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,239
Come on now, Great-Great-Grandfather.

396
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,560
Smile a little.

397
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:41,480
Today's a good day.
If Wee sees his groom making a sour face,

398
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,840
you'll break his heart.

399
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,679
If looking at my face breaks his heart,

400
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,520
tell him not to look at my face.

401
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,000
Because I won't look at his face either.

402
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,960
Sure.

403
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,720
-Here we go.
-Chu, come on.

404
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,240
Did you put it on everything?

405
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,280
-I did.
-I'm here!

406
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,080
Wee's here.

407
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,600
This is Ton.

408
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,320
Hello.

409
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,480
-Hello.
-Hello.

410
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,000
He's my best man.

411
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,400
Or…

412
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,440
Or…

413
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,360
maid of honor?

414
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,520
Which is it?

415
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,120
I don't know.

416
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,320
Never mind that.

417
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,640
Let's just say
he's here to keep me company.

418
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,560
Oops.

419
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,600
It's almost time. Please, Wee.

420
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,080
I'm ready.

421
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,520
GODDESS NU WA

422
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,720
Thank you.

423
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,120
Make a wish.

424
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,280
No.

425
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,320
Let the groom do it.

426
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,800
Oh, okay.

427
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,640
Stand up.

428
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,760
Bow to the goddess

429
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,680
three times.

430
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,400
Bow to each other.

431
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,160
Thank you.

432
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,000
That concludes the ceremony.

433
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,680
Uh, that's it?

434
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,520
Yes.

435
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,400
It's a ceremony to negate bad luck,

436
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,120
witnessed by the goddess.

437
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,280
As for other luck tying ceremonies,

438
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,520
I'll perform them myself.

439
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,440
I see.

440
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,720
Let's take photos for the memory!

441
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
I almost forgot, Mom. Come on.

442
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,680
Come on, everyone.

443
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,680
Go there.

444
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,720
Great-Great-Grandfather, sit down.

445
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,760
That's it.

446
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,560
-Come on, Great-Great-Grandfather.
-That's it.

447
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,160
-Please, everyone.
-Yes.

448
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,640
Here we go.

449
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,560
Ten seconds.

450
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,040
One, two, three.

451
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,560
Oh.

452
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,280
We'll take our leave.

453
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,200
Goodbye.

454
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,440
-Goodbye--
-Wait a minute.

455
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,760
Share this among yourselves. For luck.

456
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,200
-Thank you very much. Thank you.
-Thank you.

457
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,680
Oh, I wired you the dowry.

458
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,120
What dowry?

459
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,040
It's his fee.

460
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,400
-We'll take our leave.
-Yes.

461
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,080
Let me know if you need my help.

462
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,760
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

463
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,800
-Goodbye.
-Good luck.

464
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,640
-Bye-bye.
-You too.

465
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,720
-Chu, close the gate.
-Yes.

466
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,360
Wee.

467
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,960
I'm going back to my apartment.

468
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,200
See you at the shop.

469
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,320
-Get home safe.
-Yeah.

470
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,520
Hey!

471
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,240
Who are you?

472
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,360
You got the wrong guy.

473
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,720
No, my boss sent me to kill you
to end this whole thing.

474
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,600
Let go!

475
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,800
Let go!

476
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,800
Let go of me!

477
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,920
San, help me. They were gonna kill me.

478
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,320
What did you do this time?

479
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,160
Hey, San, watch out!

480
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
No.

481
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,120
No.

482
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,320
No.

483
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,560
No.

484
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
No.

485
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,080
Stay with me.

486
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,320
No.

487
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,440
No!

488
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,400
San.

489
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,840
Great-Great-Grandfather!

490
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,720
Great-Great-Grandfather!

491
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,080
-Wee.
-Wee.

492
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,080
-Wee.
-Are you okay, Wee?

493
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,200
-San.
-Wee.

494
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,600
-Wee.
-San, are you okay? San?

495
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,720
What the hell is happening?

496
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,840
Let me get this straight.
San is over 100 years old?

497
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,920
Yes, your San
is my great-great-grandfather.

498
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,560
So San ate some magic stone.

499
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,840
And he has to find a woman
called Wad to reverse the effect.

500
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,040
And I'm Ms. Wad reborn.

501
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,080
No.

502
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,560
You just share Ms. Wad's fate.

503
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,600
But you're not Ms. Wad.

504
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,760
I'm looking for the real Ms. Wad.

505
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,080
So I'm just the substitute.

506
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,440
But does this magic stone really exist?

507
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,160
What does it look like? Can I see it?

508
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,120
Tao keeps it some place safe.

509
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,480
The Five-Colored Stone
belongs to Goddess Nu Wa.

510
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,080
It can extend a human's life.

511
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,480
Like the elixir of life.

512
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,320
Now someone's trying to steal it.

513
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,000
I don't know if it's related
to the attack on you today.

514
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,160
CT SUPERMARKET

515
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,480
-Thank you.
-Yes. Thank you.

516
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,120
Hey, Wee!

517
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,160
You're distracted.

518
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,240
Miss your husband?

519
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,760
Did he bed you last night?
Did he give it to you hard?

520
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,360
Yes. The hardest.

521
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,680
I barely survived.

522
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,600
There it is. I knew it.

523
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,960
I saw you walk funny.

524
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,760
"Funny" my ass.

525
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,760
My ass.

526
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,080
Hello?

527
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,640
Huh? What did you say?

528
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,800
What?

529
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,400
Hey, Wee.

530
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,480
What the heck?

531
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,960
You said she'd be okay
after the bowel resection.

532
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,400
Why is she worse?

533
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,920
We just found the spread
of the cancerous cells.

534
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,760
And her body doesn't respond well
to chemotherapy.

535
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,080
And her condition worsens
faster than expected.

536
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,600
I need you to decide

537
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,080
between forcing chemotherapy

538
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,400
and ending the treatment

539
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,960
then taking her home
to live out her final days.

540
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,040
Is it really untreatable?

541
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,720
She doesn't respond to medication.

542
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,120
I don't recommend more treatment.

543
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,920
Please think it through.

544
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,000
Thank you.

545
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,640
Thank you.

546
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,400
Grandma, please be okay.

547
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,360
Grandma.

548
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,960
-Is that you, Wee?
-Yes.

549
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,680
I just had a dream.

550
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,960
It was so dark in the dream.

551
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,400
And so scary.

552
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,840
Grandma.

553
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,920
It's just a silly dream.

554
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,880
It's not silly.

555
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,360
I saw…

556
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,960
-Saw…
-Saw what?

557
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,960
I saw…

558
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,240
Grandma.

559
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,240
I saw five numbers.

560
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,680
It's a shame I woke up too early.

561
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,600
Or we'd hit the jackpot.

562
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,160
Grandma, what are the numbers? Tell me.

563
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,480
I'll guess the last one for you.

564
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,400
We have money now, Grandma.

565
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,080
Don't expect anything from my dreams.

566
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,480
My dreams are rarely accurate.

567
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,120
-Wee.
-Yes?

568
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,280
Don't worry about me.

569
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,720
I'm gonna be okay.

570
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,480
Yes. You're gonna be okay.

571
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,640
You'll be fine soon.

572
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,760
Don't forget to play the lottery.

573
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,400
I won't.

574
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,280
Why?

575
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,080
Why?

576
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,480
Why does it have to be like this?

577
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,520
What is it this time?

578
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,200
Mac and his gang made fun of me
for not having a mom and a dad.

579
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,720
Next time tell him you did

580
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,200
but they died.

581
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,200
So you fought them. Did you win?

582
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,440
Yes.

583
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,880
Good.

584
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,080
You really are Chaem's grandson.

585
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,160
Grandma!

586
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,080
-What?
-Grandma!

587
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,400
Why are you yelling?
I'm not hard of hearing.

588
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,720
-Why?
-Grandma, I got the scholarship! Happy?

589
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,720
Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

590
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,960
Now I can spend the money I saved
for your tuition on the lottery.

591
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,680
I'm so happy.

592
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,840
But you must win, Grandma.

593
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,360
Of course I will.

594
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,640
-Don't open your eyes yet, Grandma.
-I know that.

595
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,840
Give me a second.

596
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,320
What are you doing?

597
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,200
Just a sec, Grandma.

598
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,680
Are you there?

599
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,160
Of course I am, Grandma.
I'm coming to you.

600
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,240
Open your eyes.

601
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,320
-Today is Songkran Day
-No, birthday.

602
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,480
Here we go.

603
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,520
Happy birthday, Grandma.

604
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,280
Thanks, baby. Let me see.

605
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,240
I'm only 65.

606
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,440
Why did you add another 100?

607
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,440
Duh.

608
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,440
We're family. Of course I gave you extra.

609
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,280
So you can be with me for a long time.

610
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,440
-All right, eat.
-Yes.

611
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,000
San!

612
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,320
-Wee.
-Are you okay, San?

613
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,200
The Five-Colored Stone
belongs to Goddess Nu Wa.

614
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,240
It can extend a human's life.

615
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,680
Like the elixir of life.

616
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,440
I'm gonna save you.

617
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,520
I'm gonna save you, Grandma.

618
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,560
Tao, you said
the wedding was the end of it.

619
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,200
I'm here to help you.

620
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,720
The Five-Colored Stone must be in there.

621
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,240
How am I supposed to know the code?

622
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,040
San, will you put the balm on me?

623
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,000
It hurts here too.

624
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,280
