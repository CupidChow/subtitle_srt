1
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,800
They're adorable.

2
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,840
-Yeah, right?
-Yeah.

3
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,840
Shall we learn these dances
when we have time?

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,640
You want to?

5
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,960
-Like this?
-Right.

6
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,320
Yeah.

7
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,440
Wee.

8
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,440
Since I moved here,

9
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,920
San's never come.

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,440
Grandma, San's been busy lately.

11
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,240
Did you two have a fight?

12
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,720
Is it because you stole the stone for me?

13
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,680
That's not it.
It has nothing to do with that.

14
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,920
I know you did it

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,720
because you love me.

16
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,640
Do you want me to talk to him?

17
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,600
Grandma.

18
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,200
This has nothing to do with you.

19
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,000
I just can't be with him anymore.

20
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,680
If I stay with him,

21
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,560
I'll cause him trouble.

22
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,000
You poor thing.

23
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,080
You'll be okay.

24
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,640
BAO GONG SHRINE

25
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
-Oh.
-Tao.

26
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,480
Will Great-Grandfather be okay, Tao?

27
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,240
I performed the Incense Ash
Blessing Ritual for Mr. San.

28
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,520
The incense ash has been

29
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,040
in the incense burner
since the founding of the shrine.

30
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,640
It can help alleviate his pain.

31
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,160
Make sure he keeps it on him at all times.

32
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,080
Okay.

33
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,800
Still, the ash is a temporary fix.

34
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,440
We must get the stone back no matter what.

35
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,880
But Grandfather

36
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,360
gave the Five-Colored Stone to Ms. Wad.
What should we do?

37
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,520
Chu.

38
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Do you know where Ms. Wadfah is?

39
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,160
We're here to see Ms. Wadfah in Room 222.

40
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,440
Please wait a moment.

41
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,720
CONDOMINIUM CORPORATE COMMITTEE

42
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,240
Room 222 hasn't been sold or rented out.

43
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,760
What?

44
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,000
Chu.

45
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,080
What's going on?

46
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,600
Didn't you say you talked to her
and she said she lived here?

47
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,280
That's right.

48
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,600
I did talk to her,
and I remember it clearly.

49
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,600
She said Room 222. It got my attention
'cause it's a triple number.

50
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,480
Perhaps, she's moved out?

51
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,800
She might be sad
because Mr. San loves Wee.

52
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,480
I don't think so.

53
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,040
I think there's something fishy
about this woman.

54
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,840
It's in my head,
but I don't know what it is.

55
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,120
Dammit.

56
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,080
If you can't give me that,
we don't have a deal here.

57
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,720
Are you leaving?

58
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,040
Miss, your change.

59
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,320
It's a tip.

60
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,480
Great-Grandfather, you're up now?
Where are you going?

61
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,680
I'm gonna go see Wee.

62
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,440
Grandfather.

63
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,200
Why do you want to see Wee?

64
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,720
He's a thief.

65
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,920
You should go make up
with Ms. Wad instead.

66
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,240
That way, she'll return
the Five-Colored Stone to you.

67
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,480
When I give someone something,
I won't ask for it back.

68
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,360
I want to see Wee.

69
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,880
-Wait, Grandfather.
-No.

70
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,120
-I'm begging you.
-Yeah.

71
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,640
-Please.
-Great-Grandfather, please, rest.

72
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,760
Move, Xiong.

73
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,960
-Great-Grandfather.
-No.

74
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,720
You have to take care of your health.

75
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,880
Great-Grandfather.

76
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,520
-Xiong.
-Please stop.

77
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,960
-I beg you.
-Don't get in my way.

78
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,840
-Rat.
-Think about yourself too.

79
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,880
Xiong, you don't understand.

80
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,520
-I understand.
-No.

81
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,560
Great-Great-Grandfather, you go see Wee.

82
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Chu.

83
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,320
Aren't you worried about
your great-great-grandfather?

84
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,840
Great-Great-Grandfather has chosen Wee.

85
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,000
We shouldn't intervene.

86
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,240
Great-Great-Grandfather, go get Wee back.

87
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,920
I'll take care of getting
the Five-Colored Stone.

88
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,400
Your great-great-granddaughter
will not let you die for sure.

89
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,640
Thank you, Chu.

90
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,520
It's okay, Third.

91
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,200
Don't come pick me up.
I don't want to bother you.

92
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,440
I'm just dropping by to see Ton.

93
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,360
He has a fever.

94
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,280
I'm bringing him food and I'll go back.

95
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,520
I gotta go now.

96
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,880
Ton.

97
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,160
Ton.

98
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,360
I bought some porridge for you.

99
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,000
Eat, and then you can take you medicine.

100
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,440
Why are you making that face?

101
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,680
Wee.

102
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,880
San.

103
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,240
Let's do this.

104
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,560
You two talk. I'll leave.

105
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,320
Ton!

106
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,440
Wee.

107
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,440
Wee.

108
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,520
We need to talk.

109
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,240
I have nothing to talk to you about.

110
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,560
You want to scold me some more?

111
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,240
Do it, then. Scold me.

112
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,880
I'm a thief.

113
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,880
I only got close to you
for my own benefits.

114
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,160
Do it and then just leave.

115
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,480
Ton told me everything.

116
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,440
You wanted to step away
for me and Ms. Wad.

117
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,400
If you know that, why come see me?

118
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,480
Go back to her.

119
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,560
-Wee.
-Go back now.

120
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Wee.

121
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,520
I can't be with Ms. Wad.

122
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,840
I don't love her anymore.

123
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,320
Are you insane?

124
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,960
Why did you just say?

125
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,840
How can you not love her?

126
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,120
You've waited a hundred years for her.

127
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,760
I'm a horrible person.

128
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,680
But I can't love her anymore.

129
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,360
I love you, Wee.

130
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,280
Why do you love me?

131
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,960
I'm just a fake.

132
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,960
I can't help you with anything.

133
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,880
Ms. Wad is the one who can help you.

134
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,240
San.

135
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,040
Go back to her now.

136
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,480
Go now! Go!

137
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,000
-Go.
-Wee.

138
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,000
-Go.
-Wee.

139
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,400
Wee.

140
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,280
-Wee.
-Go!

141
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,760
Wee.

142
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,800
Just go! Go.

143
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,760
Wee.

144
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,480
Wee.

145
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,960
Wee.

146
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,800
You go back to her.

147
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,680
No, Wee.

148
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,600
Wee.

149
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,800
-Let go of me.
-Wee.

150
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,560
Wee, listen.

151
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,400
-San, let go. Let go!
-Wee.

152
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,360
Wee!

153
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,280
Wee!

154
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,160
Wee.

155
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,800
-Let me go.
-Wee.

156
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,760
-Wee.
-Let go.

157
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
San!

158
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,840
San!

159
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,160
San! Are you okay?

160
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,680
What's wrong?

161
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,320
Wee.

162
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,280
Take me to the shrine.

163
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,520
San.

164
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,160
Hang in there.

165
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,400
San.

166
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,960
San.

167
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,400
San, stay with me. San.

168
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,800
San.

169
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Third.

170
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,760
Mr. San.

171
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,440
What happened? Let's go to the hospital.

172
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,240
No, we can't. We have to go to the shrine.

173
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,720
Wee. Mr. San is--

174
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,720
Trust me.

175
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,880
Take San to Doctor Tao.

176
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,320
Let's go.

177
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,280
BAO GONG SHRINE

178
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,280
Doctor Tao!

179
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,560
Doctor Tao!

180
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
San.

181
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,760
Doctor Tao!

182
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,200
San!

183
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,600
-San.
-San.

184
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,080
Great-Great-Grandfather.

185
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,160
Something is wrong with San.

186
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,880
Doctor Tao, help him!

187
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,319
The charm.

188
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,320
Wee.

189
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,080
Why did you do that?

190
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,080
Chu told me you gave Ms. Wad the stone.

191
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,080
I can't love her anymore, Wee.

192
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,920
She wanted the stone.

193
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,880
I broke the promise,

194
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,560
so I should give it to her.

195
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,680
Are you insane?

196
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,480
Doctor Tao said the time
will come in a few weeks.

197
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,360
If you don't have the stone then,
you will die.

198
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,040
I've lived long enough, Wee.

199
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,040
More than a hundred years.

200
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,680
I've never felt as happy
as when I'm with you.

201
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,360
I don't want to live if I don't have you.

202
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,720
Is someone like me

203
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,000
really worth it?

204
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,680
Don't leave me again, okay?

205
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, I don't mean any disrespect,

206
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,360
but I can't come up with any reasons
to make myself believe what you told me.

207
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,040
Some things are just

208
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,400
unexplainable.

209
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,840
If you don't believe it,

210
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,080
there's nothing wrong with that.

211
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,920
Mr. San

212
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,400
has lived to a hundred years old
because of the Five-Colored Stone.

213
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,880
And I was the person who killed
his lover in the past life?

214
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,160
GODDESS NU WA

215
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,320
How can that be possible?

216
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,160
-Mr. San.
-What are you doing?

217
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,080
Mr. San.

218
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,560
How did you get here?

219
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,520
Uncle Xiong said you two are here.

220
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,920
What's going on here?

221
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,840
Doctor, have you met Ms. Wad?

222
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,040
Yes, I have met her two times.

223
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,400
Great-Great-Grandfather,

224
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,160
did Ms. Wad ever mention Prince Trai?

225
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,400
At the Chinese opera theater,
she said she remembered that

226
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,480
she was killed by Prince Trai there.

227
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,120
Then they followed us.

228
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,480
Prince Trai.

229
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,840
I'm scared.

230
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,040
I'm scared, Mr. San.

231
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,760
Wait.

232
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,640
Ms. Wad remembers Prince Trai.

233
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,360
How come she doesn't recognize the doctor?

234
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,920
Oh my. Don't tell me…

235
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,480
She fooled all of us.

236
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,720
Who the hell is this woman?

237
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,640
The stone is here.
I'm thinking what I should do with it.

238
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,520
If you can't give me ten million,
don't call me again. The end.

239
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,120
Doctor Tao and I went look for Ms. Wad
at the condo she told me about.

240
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,560
It turned out to be an empty room,
which means she lied.

241
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,200
Who is she? Why is she doing this?

242
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,400
What's wrong with you, Ton?

243
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,640
You made up with your boyfriend
and just left my door open.

244
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,360
What if my stuff got stolen?

245
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,880
Like there's anything to be stolen
in your room.

246
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,280
Get lost.

247
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,120
We're talking about serious stuff here.

248
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,680
Oh, that's why I thought
she looked familiar.

249
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,360
What did you say? You've met her?

250
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,760
I have. I met her yesterday.

251
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,800
But she wasn't dressed like this.

252
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,640
Where did you meet her?

253
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,040
Ton, are you sure
Ms. Wad's going to come here?

254
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,280
I'm not sure.

255
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,800
It was my first time working here.

256
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,600
I accidentally met her yesterday.

257
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,640
I'm not sure if she'll come today.

258
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,720
-We should split up and look for her.
-Good idea.

259
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,880
‪Let's go.

260
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,720
Why did you have to bump into me?

261
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,960
Excuse me.

262
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,920
Excuse me.

263
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,800
Ms. Wad.

264
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,600
Excuse me.

265
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,280
Excuse me.

266
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,640
Give me the Five-Colored Stone.

267
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,880
Don't pull any tricks.

268
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,640
Don't try to stall, or you'll die.

269
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,280
Jeez, Suchat.

270
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,600
Do you really have to pull a gun on me?

271
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,160
That stone,

272
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,040
I'll give it to you anyway.

273
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,880
But can you negotiate with Mr. Chen

274
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
to get me 20 million more?

275
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,080
It's just a small amount of money
compared to what he has.

276
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,360
Ah!

277
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,200
How dare you bargain with me?

278
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,520
How much have you got from me?

279
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,600
Don't you remember

280
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,640
who bailed you out of jail?

281
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,120
Oh, come on.

282
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,840
I won't forget the kindness you gave me.

283
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,440
But you should understand
that this task is very difficult.

284
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,280
I had to disguise myself

285
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,400
as Ms. Wad and tricked Mr. San.

286
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,440
I had to pretend to be a nice lady.
I was so stressed.

287
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,480
Plus, I had to memorize stuff
that happened 100 years ago.

288
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,960
So, I had to use my talents.

289
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,640
-Take this!
-Ouch!

290
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,120
Go tell Mr. Chen.

291
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Tomorrow, give me 20 million.

292
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,760
Or there's no talk between us.

293
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,120
You're a snake.

294
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,200
You ungrateful ex-con.

295
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,800
How dare you bargain
with me and Mr. Chen, huh?

296
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,000
Jeez. Quit threatening me.

297
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,160
If I was scared,
I wouldn't be doing this. Go away.

298
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,120
Wait.

299
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,760
You forgot this.

300
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,600
Bro, don't forget to get your gun back.

301
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,120
Okay. I'm on my way.

302
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,840
Ms. Wad.

303
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,040
The investigator just sent us info.

304
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,520
It confirms everything Wee said.

305
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,360
Mr. Suchat sent people to look for
Ms. Wad's family members.

306
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,480
This tattoo artist looks very similar
to Ms. Wad.

307
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,160
It seems

308
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
everything she told Mr. San

309
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,800
was told to her by Mr. Suchat.

310
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,800
Damn you, Suchat.

311
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,760
I thought you'd change
after you'd escaped death.

312
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,400
You just won't stop doing bad things.

313
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,600
Wee. From now on, you stay out of this.

314
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,480
If they catch you, they won't let you go.

315
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,360
San, I'm fine.

316
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,280
I'll take care of this myself.

317
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,880
Are you going solo
to have a face-off with them again?

318
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,200
Don't forget that you're sick now.

319
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,080
Then what should we do?

320
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,320
Tomorrow, they will exchange stuff.

321
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,920
I have a plan.

322
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,440
Wee.

323
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,120
I just told you not to do this.

324
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,760
Stay out of it.

325
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,560
I'll take care of it myself.

326
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,160
San, don't try to stop me.

327
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,720
No matter what, I won't let you die.

328
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,760
We will be together.

329
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,160
Trust me, guys.

330
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,080
Hey, why did you tell us to come here?

331
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,800
I'm hungry.

332
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,000
Plus, if it's here,

333
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,440
you won't dare to do anything, right?

334
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,680
Twenty million.
You have it with you, right?

335
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,360
You really do have the audacity

336
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,840
to disrespect me.

337
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Oh, Mr. Chen.

338
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,160
Please calm down.

339
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,840
You're sick. Don't get angry.

340
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,680
Hurry up and give me the money.

341
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,640
Then use that stone to perform the ritual.

342
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,000
Or else it might be too late.

343
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,720
What? Open it.

344
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,160
So I know the money's really in there.

345
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,920
Wait.

346
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,960
You have to open it at the same time.

347
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,760
So, this time, we know
you really have the stone.

348
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Then I'll count to three,
and we open it at the same time.

349
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,360
One, two,

350
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,480
three.

351
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,320
Everyone, this is the Five-Colored Stone,

352
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,480
the legendary magical stone

353
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,440
that belongs to Goddess Nu Wa's.

354
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,640
It'll be the goddess' birthday
in two weeks.

355
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,880
The shrine will be

356
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,280
exhibiting this magical stone
for everyone to see.

357
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,520
Don't miss it.

358
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,720
This is the one and only real stone.

359
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,640
All the others are fakes.

360
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,200
SEE THE FULL REELS

361
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,720
Again.

362
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,400
You dared to trick us, huh?

363
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,320
I didn't trick you.

364
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,920
San gave me that stone himself.

365
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,400
You…

366
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,600
You…

367
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,280
-Oh, Mr. Chen.
-Mr. Chen.

368
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,640
-Hang in there.
-Mr. Chen.

369
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,560
Mr. Chen.

370
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,680
Go get the real stone,

371
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,240
and take your 20 million.

372
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,160
Or else,

373
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,720
it'll be a bullet in your brain instead.

374
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,160
I wonder if Wee's plan is going to work.

375
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,200
Let's see if they'll fall into our trap.

376
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,160
Mr. San.

377
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,840
Mr. San.

378
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,520
Mr. San.

379
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,600
Mr. San.

380
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,920
Mr. San.

381
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,239
Mr. San.

382
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,600
Mr. San.

383
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,120
Who's being so loud?

384
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,600
-Oh.
-Ms. Wad.

385
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,719
Wee.

386
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,760
Why are you here?

387
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,719
What a strange question.
It's my boyfriend's house.

388
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,639
Of course, I'm here with him.

389
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,360
San picked me.

390
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,840
Anyway, why are you here?

391
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,080
San already gave you the stone.

392
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,560
Don't tell me you gonna
cling to him again.

393
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,840
Wee, what's the matter?

394
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,159
Mr. San.

395
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,400
Ms. Wad is here.

396
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,800
But don't worry. She's about to leave.

397
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,880
Uh, Mr. San.

398
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,080
Aren't you leaving?

399
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,000
-Chu, see the guest out.
-Yes, Great-Great-Grandfather.

400
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,440
Mr. San.

401
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,360
-Well.
-Let's go.

402
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,680
-Let's go.
-Chu. Give me a sec.

403
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,360
-Come on.
-Chu, wait.

404
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,680
Mr. San. I'm not done yet.

405
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,240
I saw Chu's IG Story

406
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,840
about the Five-Colored Stone.

407
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,720
The stone that you gave me, is it a fake?

408
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,560
Don't call it a fake. Call it a replica.

409
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,160
What?

410
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,280
Let me explain, Ms. Wad.

411
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,640
Doctor Tao made a replica.

412
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,640
He planned to put it on display
on the goddess' birthday.

413
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,280
Unfortunately, Great-Great-Grandfather
picked up the wrong one

414
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,200
and gave it to you.

415
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,200
Is that true, Mr. San?

416
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,800
If so, what do I do?

417
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,640
What do you do?

418
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,960
You have it, so take it.

419
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,960
They look just the same, right?
They have five colors.

420
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,240
Don't be so picky.

421
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,480
Right.

422
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,280
Why are you all doing this to me?

423
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Mr. San.

424
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,640
I've waited for you for so long.

425
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,040
But you changed your mind
and fell in love with Wee.

426
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,040
You even gave me
a fake Five-Colored Stone.

427
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,120
Why is my life so unfortunate?

428
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,160
I have no one left.

429
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,720
She's so full of it.

430
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,440
Oh, Ms. Wad.

431
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,640
That's so sad. Don't cry.

432
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,320
Your face is all wet from tears.

433
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,680
Chu!

434
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,960
What cloth is this?

435
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,960
It's all stained. Let's wash it.

436
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,520
Hey!

437
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,360
-Oh, Ms. Wad.
-What are you doing?

438
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,880
-Chu! It's wet.
-Oh no, Ms. Wad!

439
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,040
What the heck?

440
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,040
-Chu!
-Chu!

441
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,200
Enough.

442
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,720
I know it's not fair for you.

443
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,760
So go get the replica.

444
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,400
I'll give you the real one.

445
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,440
Uh…

446
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,160
The stone is not with me now.

447
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,960
It's okay.

448
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,200
If you want the stone,

449
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,560
tomorrow, meet me
at the Chinese opera theater.

450
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,960
Let's switch them, so this can be over.

451
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,680
Okay.

452
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,440
Chu, see her out.

453
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,800
Yes.

454
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,760
Let's go.

455
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,000
I can leave on my own.

456
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,240
Bye-bye.

457
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,920
Why do they want a fake

458
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,640
when they have
the real Five-Colored Stone?

459
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,960
Jeez.

460
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,240
They said they'd put it on display
on the goddess' birthday or something.

461
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,400
So they need it.

462
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,120
Don't pull a trick again.

463
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,280
Jeez, I'm not pulling any tricks.

464
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,400
I'll get you the real stone quickly,

465
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,760
so this can be over.

466
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,000
The longer it takes, the worse
my headache gets. Give it to me.

467
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,920
Tomorrow, bring some people with you

468
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,680
and clean it up nicely.

469
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,560
San.

470
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,280
Come here.

471
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
What's wrong?

472
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,520
You're worried about tomorrow?

473
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,520
Yeah.

474
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,720
I'm afraid something will go wrong.

475
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,440
Hey.

476
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,760
Don't worry.

477
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,560
And don't get involved with this anymore.

478
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,000
Just wait for me here at home.

479
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,600
I'll take care of this.

480
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,400
San. Can I go with you tomorrow?

481
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,000
You're not as strong as you were before.

482
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,880
I'm not strong

483
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,400
because the Five-Colored Stone
is far from me.

484
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,080
Tomorrow, when I get the real one back,
I'll go back to the same state.

485
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,800
And I'll stop them
from giving us trouble for good.

486
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,480
You got that, Wee?

487
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,200
Yeah.

488
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,960
What?

489
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,040
Do you know

490
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,200
how much I missed you

491
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,000
when you're gone?

492
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,600
San, stop.

493
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,920
Why?

494
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,560
I don't know how much you missed me.

495
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,320
But I'm sure I missed you more.

496
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,040
Wee.

497
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,240
You're going to sleep, Wee?

498
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,200
Let's go to sleep a little late tonight.

499
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,360
San!

500
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,080
You must be careful, San.

501
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,640
I'll be okay, Wee.

502
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,760
Rat, take care of him, okay?

503
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,120
Sure, Great-Grandfather.

504
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,800
Mr. San!

505
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,080
-San!
-Great-Great-Grandfather!

506
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,080
-San!
-Great-Great-Grandfather.

507
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,040
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-Great-Grandfather.

508
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,080
San.

509
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,400
This is bad.
The incense ash has turned black.

510
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,840
Huh?

511
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,280
San!

512
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,520
San, hang in there.

513
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,000
Oh, Tao.

514
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,920
Tao.

515
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,720
I performed the Incense Ash
Blessing Ritual for him again.

516
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,760
But I'm not sure how long

517
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,600
it can keep him stable.

518
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,880
Then what should we do?

519
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,080
Grandfather is in severe pain.
If he goes there like this,

520
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,360
I'm afraid Wad will notice.

521
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,760
I'll go.

522
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,080
-Huh?
-You can't, Wee.

523
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,880
Great-Grandfather said
you must stay out of this.

524
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,200
But this is our best option.

525
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,480
I'll go quickly and be right back.

526
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,760
I guarantee I'll be back
before San wakes up.

527
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,800
Don't worry.

528
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,280
-But…
-Then I'll go with you.

529
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,840
Chu!

530
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,680
Come on, Mom. Nothing is going to happen.

531
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,000
Let's go now. Come on, Doctor Tao.

532
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,240
Huh? Me too?

533
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,640
-Of course. Quickly.
-Hurry.

534
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,760
-Let's go, Wee.
-Please take care of it.

535
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,680
Dammit.

536
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,280
It's almost two hours late.

537
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,480
And no one shows up yet.

538
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,800
I really hate people who are not punctual.

539
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,880
I wanna drag them to a clock tower
and slap them in the face.

540
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,960
We're here.

541
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,160
We're here.

542
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,960
Yeah.

543
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,280
Sorry, there was a little accident.

544
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,400
Let's just switch the stones.

545
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,320
Wait.

546
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,120
Where's San?

547
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,160
Yesterday, he said he'd come, didn't he?

548
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,840
Why are you here instead?

549
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,800
You think I'd let San come to see you?

550
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,880
Oh.

551
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,720
I know your plan.

552
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,680
You use the Five-Colored Stone
as an excuse,

553
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,600
but in fact, you want to see San, right?

554
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,960
You plan to seduce him.

555
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,840
You're very cunning.
I'm not switching them anymore.

556
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,040
-Let's go back.
-Yeah.

557
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,400
Hey, wait, stop.

558
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,080
Make it quick and just switch them.

559
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,160
Wait.

560
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,760
Her stalling is such a pain.

561
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,960
Why didn't they just switch them?

562
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,240
You're sure

563
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,520
it's the real stone?

564
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,320
Jeez.

565
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,280
Of course, we're sure.
We swear on Doctor Tao's life.

566
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,600
I don't trust you two.

567
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,280
You two back away.
And get Doctor Tao to come

568
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,640
and switch the stones with me.

569
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,680
Sure.

570
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,360
Doctor Tao.

571
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,360
I'll leave it to you.

572
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,480
Here.

573
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,440
Come on, Doctor Tao. I want to go home.

574
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,080
Yeah.

575
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,840
Wait.

576
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,360
You sure it's the real Five-Colored Stone?

577
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,840
Of course, it's the real one.

578
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,680
What about yours? Is the box empty?

579
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,440
Wee.

580
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,360
Wee. How come you're like this?

581
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,560
Wee.

582
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,280
Wee.

583
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,160
Wee.

584
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,080
Wee.

585
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,240
Wee!

586
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,440
Wee!

587
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,920
I don't want it, Goddess.

588
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,360
I don't want this.

589
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,120
I can't endure any more parting.

590
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,160
I don't want it.

591
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,600
Wee. Wee!

592
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,640
Wee.

593
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,320
-Grandfather.
-Great-Grandfather.

594
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,320
‪Great-Grandfather.

595
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,640
Wee. Where is Wee?

596
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,440
Uh, well… Well…

597
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,760
Wait, you haven't recovered.
Where are you going?

598
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,800
What's wrong with you all?

599
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,920
I told you not to let Wee go.

600
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,600
Great-Grandfather.

601
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,880
-Great-Grandfather.
-Move.

602
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,880
Great-Grandfather.

603
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,280
Mr. San.

604
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,480
Doctor.

605
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
What's wrong?

606
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,000
I need to go help Wee. Where's your car?

607
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,520
Hey. You tried to trick me?

608
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:32,960
Ow!

609
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,760
That's mine!

610
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,520
Which one is it?

611
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,560
I don't know.

612
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,880
What?

613
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,600
‪Stop.

614
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,280
-Back off.
-Chu.

615
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,200
Hey.

616
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,680
Give me the stone.

617
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,200
Give it to me.

618
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,440
-Go!
-Hurry up!

619
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,080
Uncle Suchat.

620
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,040
Give me the Five-Colored Stone.

621
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,560
Brother Suchat.

622
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,000
You came at perfect timing.

623
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,560
Brother Suchat?

624
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,400
Ah! Hey!

625
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,240
Shut up, you snake.

626
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,720
You'll die along with them.

627
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,360
Give me the Five-Colored Stone.

628
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,680
Chu, my beloved niece,

629
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,080
give me the Five-Colored Stone.

630
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,400
I promise I won't shoot you.

631
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,200
But you just said
you'll kill us and Ms. Wad.

632
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,440
Aren't you a smart girl?

633
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,840
Then die along with all of them.

634
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,800
Run, Chu!

635
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,080
-Huh?
-Hey, why did you follow us?

636
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,840
Didn't you hear?
They said they'll kill all of us.

637
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,160
You can't run away from me.

638
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,040
You okay?

639
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,640
-Give it to me.
-What?

640
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,600
Give it to me now.

641
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,520
There you are.

642
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,960
You won't survive this no matter what.

643
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,880
Kill them all. Get me the stone. Go!

644
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,040
Suchat.

645
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,360
Great-Great-Grandfather.

646
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,320
Great-Great-Grandfather.

647
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,720
San, where are you going?

648
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,520
San!

649
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,600
