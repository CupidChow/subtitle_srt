1
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,600
What's going on with all of you? Huh?

2
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,880
Wee and Grandfather are all smiley.

3
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,880
And what are you two signaling
each other about?

4
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,000
It's nothing, Dad.

5
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,000
-Just eat.
-Eat.

6
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,560
Eat up.

7
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,840
-Please eat up.
-Yes.

8
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
So you'll grow faster. One more.

9
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,080
I'm your father.

10
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,320
Well, well, well…

11
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,400
You're so in sync.

12
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,120
What are you on about, Chu?

13
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,920
Duh. You went for the same plate.

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,640
You wanted the same food.

15
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,800
If that's not being in sync,
what would you call it?

16
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
Hey.

17
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,520
-Eat.
-Yes.

18
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,920
How's it going?

19
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,680
How's what going?

20
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,720
Yeesh! Don't play dumb.

21
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,640
This thing with Wee. How's it going?

22
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,720
What's the matter?

23
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,360
I'm into Wee.

24
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,240
I fell for him.

25
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,640
Doesn't this mean I'm betraying Ms. Wad?

26
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,760
Jeez! Great-Great-Grandfather.

27
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,160
Just accept it.

28
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,000
Our family has been looking
for Ms. Wad for 100 years.

29
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
Have you found her?

30
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,320
Finding Wee makes
all the pieces fit, right?

31
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,440
Or him being a man still bothers you?

32
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,760
But it's still troubling.

33
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,520
Don't forget
that doctor's still pursuing Wee.

34
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,240
He's a doctor,
respectable, highly educated.

35
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,720
He knew Wee from before.

36
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,840
They understand each other
and they share interests.

37
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,360
While I'm…

38
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,280
just a grumbling old man. I can't compete.

39
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,040
Wow. Who would have thought

40
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,320
I'd get to see this version of you?

41
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,840
Typically you're like,

42
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,680
"Chu, you're a child.
Don't talk back to your elders.

43
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,840
Hey, if you don't listen

44
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,640
and mess up later,
I'll chew you out even worse."

45
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
See?

46
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,640
Even you think I'm a grumbling old man.

47
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,360
All right. Great-Great-Grandfather,

48
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,520
I know you grumble because you care.

49
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,240
You're taking care
of everyone in our family.

50
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,120
Despite your grumbling,
you're very reliable.

51
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,600
So when it comes to you and Wee,

52
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,320
I want you to be happy.

53
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,800
So don't worry. I'll help you!

54
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,200
Ok?

55
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,880
I have to count on
my great-great-grandchild.

56
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
I'm a lousy great-great-grandfather.

57
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,720
You're an asshole for ditching me.

58
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
I won't go accompany you anywhere again.

59
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,760
Ton, hello?
I'm not done yelling at you. Ton!

60
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,320
Wee!

61
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,560
Come on.

62
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,680
Wee! Is there something wrong?

63
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,120
I got two amusement park tickets for free.

64
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,520
I was gonna go with Ton tomorrow
but he ditched me.

65
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,440
Eh?

66
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,720
Oh… What a coincidence.

67
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,040
He just told me yesterday
he wanted to go to an amusement park.

68
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,840
I never said that.

69
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,360
He's old so he's forgetful.

70
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,800
Great-Great-Grandfather,
this is your chance

71
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
to hang out and get to know each other.

72
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,800
Yeah, right.

73
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,680
I vented to Chu yesterday
I wanted to go out and have fun.

74
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,600
What a coincidence.

75
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,160
If that's the case,
you should go with Wee.

76
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
Take him out.

77
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,800
He's over 100 years old.
Broaden his horizons.

78
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,080
San!

79
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,160
San! Come on!

80
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,880
Hey.

81
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,320
Look.

82
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,640
Dinosaurs.

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,960
Smells great.

87
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,920
I like it.

88
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,560
Uh, you like it?

89
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,800
Then I'll let you have it.

90
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,160
I'd rather you didn't.

91
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,840
I prefer it on you.

92
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,120
CT SUPERMARKET

93
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,680
Holy! For real?

94
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,800
San's got moves.

95
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,160
See? Something good
came out of me ditching you.

96
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,000
Don't change the subject.

97
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,040
Thanks to you, I'm stressed out.

98
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,440
Stressed out about what?

99
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,400
Oh. The stone you're planning to steal?

100
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,120
I'm being serious.

101
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,480
Give up.

102
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,520
Even without the stone,

103
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,160
I'm still not the one he's waiting for.

104
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,920
DOCTOR THIRD

105
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,960
Wow.

106
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,800
So you married to undo bad luck.

107
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,920
Yes, Third.

108
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,560
Then I have a chance, right?

109
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,080
A chance to do what?

110
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,680
You know I'm into you, right?

111
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,320
Since high school.

112
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,600
But I messed up by waiting
for too long to tell you.

113
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,920
Then you were gone.

114
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,320
Third.

115
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,440
But I'm back now. Let me take care of you.

116
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,720
I promise I won't leave again.

117
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,880
Wee?

118
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,320
Wee.

119
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,360
-What do you think? You're hooked?
-So delicious.

120
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,320
I know another shop.
I'll take you there next time.

121
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,440
-Ok?
-You got it.

122
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,920
Get home safe.

123
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,400
Text me when you're home.

124
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,040
-You got it. Get home safe.
-Bye-bye.

125
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,200
Doctor, don't you get it?

126
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,760
What do you want?

127
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,320
I can't believe it. Someone like you?

128
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,080
What are you saying?

129
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,040
Wee told me you two
got married to undo bad luck.

130
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,360
So I asked to date him.

131
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,040
What did Wee say?

132
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,840
I promise

133
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,280
I won't break your heart.

134
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,400
Give me a chance, Wee.

135
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,160
Thank you, Third.

136
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,320
But I…

137
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,800
I'm too late again, aren't I?

138
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
Mr. San?

139
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,080
Congrats.

140
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,800
I wish you two happiness.

141
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,240
That won't happen, Third.

142
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,000
Between me and San,

143
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,120
the best I'll ever get
is that excuse of a wedding.

144
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,520
San already loves someone else.

145
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,840
Someday he'll go back
to the person he's been waiting for.

146
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,320
If you love someone else

147
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,120
and don't want Wee, then let him go.

148
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,800
What if I don't?

149
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,000
How do you really feel about Wee?

150
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
Are you a dog in the manger?

151
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,240
I'm into him.

152
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,920
I never thought I'd ever be.

153
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,480
Next thing I knew, I already were.

154
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,200
If you're into him, tell him.

155
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,920
He's gonna be thrilled.

156
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,000
But if you ever break his heart,

157
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,200
I'll take him from you.

158
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,760
Don't worry about that.

159
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,720
I suggest you get out
of my and Wee's lives.

160
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,280
This sucks.

161
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,160
I don't know why I feel like
I lost to you before.

162
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,440
Now I lose to you again.

163
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,720
Wee. Please open the door for me.

164
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,280
I wanna talk to you.

165
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,000
Wee.

166
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,160
I know you're in there.

167
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,440
I wanna talk to you.

168
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,440
I talked to Doctor Third.

169
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,320
I know you're not sure about me.

170
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,440
I'm into you.

171
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,680
I'm really into you.

172
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,920
I wanna be with you.

173
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,640
I wanna take care of you.

174
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,520
I know you've always been alone.

175
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,040
You've had a hard life.

176
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,080
But will you give me
a chance to be in your life?

177
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,640
I will take care of you.

178
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,280
I won't break your heart.

179
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,160
I will make you happy every day.

180
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,840
Wee.

181
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,120
Wee.

182
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,000
San?

183
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,960
Eh?

184
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,840
What are you doing?

185
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,760
Wee.

186
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,160
I wanna talk to you.

187
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,280
Can I take a rain check?

188
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,040
I'm having a headache.

189
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,880
Wee.

190
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,520
I wanna talk to you.

191
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,920
Let's talk later. I'm late.

192
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,640
Something wrong, Great-Great-Grandfather?

193
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,880
Are you sure your plan will work?

194
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,720
Jeez, trust me.

195
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,280
Follow my plan and you'll win Wee's heart.

196
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,040
I'm an expert on love.

197
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,760
Despite my appearance, I've helped
many friends get into relationships.

198
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,880
If you're so good,
why haven't you found anyone?

199
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,120
Goodness.
Don't say I haven't found anyone.

200
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,520
I'm single by choice.

201
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,920
I gotta go, Ton. Stock the shelves for me.

202
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,000
San, why are you dressed up?

203
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,400
Go take a shower.

204
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,560
And dress up.

205
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,080
You're going out with me.

206
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,000
Where are you taking me?

207
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,800
Never mind that. You'll find out.

208
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,800
Go make yourself handsome. Come on.

209
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,080
Come on.

210
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,400
Give me the most handsome version.

211
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,560
Go on.

212
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,440
The owner's renting my building

213
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,120
so I asked them a small favor.

214
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,760
It's good.

215
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,400
Wee.

216
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,520
This one's good too.

217
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,760
It's my favorite.

218
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,120
What, San?

219
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,920
Dance?

220
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,160
No way. I can't dance.

221
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,800
Come on. I'll teach you.

222
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,880
Wee.

223
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,560
I wanted to tell you

224
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,360
-I…
-Don't say it.

225
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
Why not?

226
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,800
You're something else.
I was trying to avoid you.

227
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,440
Wee.

228
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,600
I talked to Doctor Third.

229
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,160
I know you're not sure about me.

230
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
I'm into you.

231
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,160
I'm really into you.

232
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,920
Wee.

233
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,840
San?

234
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,160
I wanna talk to you.

235
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,120
Can I take a rain check?

236
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,280
I'm having a headache.

237
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,400
You heard everything that night?

238
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,360
San,

239
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,760
you're not into me.

240
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,680
You're just lonely
and I happened to come by.

241
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,560
What gave you that idea, Wee?

242
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,040
You said it yourself.

243
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,480
I'm untidy, filthy,

244
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,480
loud, rowdy,

245
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,720
cunning, foul-mouthed,
and completely shameless.

246
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,160
How could you fall
for someone that horrible?

247
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,720
I was biased at the time

248
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,600
so I only saw your bad traits.

249
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Actually,

250
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,880
you're lighthearted,

251
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,800
kind,

252
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,960
care about people around you

253
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,360
and have mental strength.

254
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,840
Whatever hardship you face,
you can still smile.

255
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,800
These things I just listed

256
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,200
didn't make me fall for you.

257
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,400
But I love everything

258
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,200
that you are.

259
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,080
Both your good traits

260
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,120
and bad traits.

261
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,120
Are you sure?

262
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,400
I am.

263
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,000
Even though you already heard it,

264
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,040
I'm gonna say it again before you.

265
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,520
Give me a chance to be in your life.

266
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,680
I will take care of you.

267
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,400
I won't break your heart.

268
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,000
I will make you happy every day.

269
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Yikes. Old-fashioned lines.

270
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,320
You really are an over-100-year-old man.

271
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,080
What's your answer?

272
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,920
This is Ms. Wad,
Duke Phichitphusit's daughter.

273
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Aren't you in a hurry
to catch your criminal?

274
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
Yes, ma'am.

275
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,560
You're safe now.

276
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,200
Mister?

277
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,000
How are you feeling?

278
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,440
Did I wake you?

279
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,880
It's ok.

280
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,480
Wee?

281
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
San.

282
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,159
This ring

283
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,360
is yours.

284
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,600
-Chu, back off.
-Jeez, Grandpa, Mom.

285
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,199
-I'm gonna look for Grandfather.
-I said he'd be right soon.

286
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,600
He's been gone a long time. This won't do.

287
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,000
-Jeez, give him time.
-No. Let me go.

288
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,760
-You're overreacting.
-Wee, Grandfather, you're back.

289
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,440
Goodness, I was worried sick.

290
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,280
I was gonna look for you
but Chu stopped me.

291
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,720
I told you they'd be back soon.
You just didn't believe me.

292
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,920
-What if they weren't?
-Well, are they back?

293
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,320
Give it a rest.

294
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,680
Where were you two last night anyway?

295
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,320
I crashed at Ton's last night.

296
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,600
I ran into San at the gate just now.

297
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,640
Wait.

298
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,200
We spent the night together.

299
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,680
Spent the night? You mean slept together?

300
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,440
That's what I meant.

301
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,240
The two of us are married.

302
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,520
It's normal to sleep together.

303
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,680
Rat, Chu.

304
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,600
-Yes?
-Yes?

305
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,680
Help Wee move his stuff into my room.

306
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,360
Sure thing.

307
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,520
You got it, Great-Great-Grandfather.

308
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,040
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Good job.

309
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,080
Your breath smells great.

310
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,760
Of course.

311
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,480
Let me smell it again.

312
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,200
San.

313
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,760
What are you doing? I'm late.

314
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,200
I love this scent.

315
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,480
I'm gonna go to work.

316
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,360
Wait.

317
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,840
Kiss me first.

318
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,280
Bye.

319
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,320
Oh, what the heck?

320
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,600
San.

321
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,000
Thank you.

322
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,240
BAO GONG SHRINE

323
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,800
The investigator we hired

324
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,640
found where Ms. Wad's
descendants live in Chiang Rai.

325
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,280
But nobody's home.

326
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,720
So I'm gonna send them
a sketch of Ms. Wad to ask around.

327
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,520
No need, Tao.

328
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,800
Eh? Why not?

329
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,120
I'm convinced now

330
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,960
Wee is Ms. Wad. There's no one else.

331
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,960
Huh?

332
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,880
But Wee's a man.

333
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,160
Is that ok with you?

334
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,320
It is.

335
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,480
It's actually more than ok.

336
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,440
You can say it's wonderful.

337
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,400
Huh?

338
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,160
Goddess, why is
the Five-Colored Stone like this?

339
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,960
What's going on?

340
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,280
You're in a good mood today.

341
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,200
Nothing's going on, Grandma.

342
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,600
Oh, right. San's gonna come by
to pay you his respects today.

343
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,320
He has an errand to run first.

344
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,920
San?

345
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,760
The guy you said
married you undo bad luck?

346
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,080
So why would he pay me his respects?

347
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,480
Eh? Or…

348
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,800
Nothing, Grandma.
He just wanted to pay you his respects.

349
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,840
San happens to be a respectful person,

350
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,160
deferential to old people.

351
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,200
I'm not old yet.

352
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,520
Sure, pretty lady.

353
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,440
Eh?

354
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,400
Hello, ma'am.

355
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,600
Something wrong, Grandma?

356
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,360
No.

357
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,200
Hello, Doctor?

358
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,760
Sure, I'll be right down.

359
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,320
I'll be right back. The doctor wants me.

360
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,120
Ma'am,

361
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,600
please let me know if you need help.

362
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,240
It's strange.

363
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,120
You look just like my friend.

364
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,360
No!

365
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,640
-What the hell? Let go!
-You're gonna get it.

366
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,000
Let go!

367
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,680
Thank you very much, Mister. Thank you.

368
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,640
You're safe now.

369
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,880
Thank you very much for saving Chaem.

370
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,560
Thank him, come on.

371
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,840
Thank you again, Mister.

372
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,000
THAI STEAMED PORK DUMPLINGS

373
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,200
Mr. Handsome!

374
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,200
Here. My mom sent me to give you this.

375
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,120
Thank you, braided girl.

376
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,360
My name is Chaem.

377
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,720
So…

378
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,960
Why are you renting this house?

379
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,120
You work nearby?

380
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,280
No.

381
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,720
I heard someone who looks
like my friend just moved here.

382
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,200
So I came here.

383
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,960
In case I run into her.

384
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,080
Braided girl?

385
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,480
You're her?

386
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,200
San.

387
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,040
-Braided girl.
-San.

388
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,760
Is this really you?

389
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,080
HOSPITAL

390
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,080
So your San is my Mr. Handsome.

391
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,840
Yes.

392
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,480
What I told you
might sound a little fantastic,

393
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,200
but it's all true, Grandma.

394
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,200
You were so mean

395
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,280
for leaving without saying goodbye.

396
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,280
I'm sorry about that.

397
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,080
Back then I heard about
someone who looked like Ms. Wad,

398
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,960
so I went to look for her.

399
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,440
But it wasn't her.
When I got back, you were gone.

400
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,000
It's amazing.

401
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,680
I've gotten to see
my first love before I die.

402
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,360
What do you think, Wee?

403
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,040
You always thought
I exaggerated about Mr. Handsome.

404
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,800
Look at him. Is he handsome?

405
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,440
He's so-so, Grandma.

406
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,760
Oh, San.

407
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,880
The Ms. Wad you were looking for,

408
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,440
have you found her?

409
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,480
BAO GONG SHRINE

410
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,720
GODDESS NU WA

411
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,680
Ms. Wad?

412
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,920
You… Your name is San, right?

413
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,160
You really exist.

414
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,080
Please give San back to me, Wee.

415
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,920
It's none of your business.

416
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,640
Great-great-grandfather!

417
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,560
This Five-Colored Stone will let us know

418
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,400
who is the real Ms. Wad.

419
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,440
Why are you doing this?

420
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,240
