1
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,080
What do you want?

2
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,600
Get out.

3
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,240
-I'm living here. I'm not going!
-Hey!

4
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,440
-Hey! Get out!
-No!

5
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,560
What are you doing here?

6
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,600
-I'm going to live with you.
-Get out.

7
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,440
-What's happening?
-Grandfather.

8
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,960
Grandfather, what's going on?

9
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,120
It's him. He just showed up
with his luggage,

10
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,640
saying he's living here.
Something's wrong with him.

11
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,360
We're married,
so we have to live together.

12
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
And I'm scared.

13
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,840
What if those who want the Five-Colored
Stone came back to kill me again?

14
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,520
Well.

15
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,400
Great-Grandfather,
what Wee said is reasonable.

16
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,960
-It's dangerous for him to live alone.
-Right.

17
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,960
Yeah.

18
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,160
Please, San. Let me live with you.

19
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,000
I won't cause you any trouble.
I won't bother you. Please, San. Please.

20
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,480
Please let me stay. Please. Let me stay.

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,520
They're after you because of me.

22
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360
I have to take responsibility.

23
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,000
Thank you, San.

24
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,960
Thank you.

25
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,840
-Chu.
-Yes!

26
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,880
Find him a new place to live.

27
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,160
-Somewhere busy, with 24-hour security.
-What?

28
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,640
-No, I don't want that. Let me stay.
-Hey.

29
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,080
-Let go.
-No, I'm not letting go.

30
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,080
-No, we're married.
-What?

31
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,320
-Don't leave me, honey.
-Ew, disgusting.

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,280
-No.
-Hey!

33
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,080
-Hey!
-I'm not letting go.

34
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,320
Hey, you won't walk out
on your own, will you?

35
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,120
Fine.

36
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,320
-San, no. Please. Who--
-Mr. San.

37
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,840
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,680
Let's get inside, Tao.

39
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,920
I think you should let Wee stay.

40
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,240
See? Even Doctor Tao
is supportive of our love.

41
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Tao, you said
the wedding was the end of it.

42
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
I understand that
you feel uncomfortable, Mr. San.

43
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,120
But it's better if Wee stays here.

44
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,399
Wee's luck supports you, Mr. San.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,600
If the Five-Colored Stone poison
got to you again,

46
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,400
with Wee near, he could help you in time.

47
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,000
Listen to him. I'm here to help you.

48
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,480
-Chu.
-Yes?

49
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,000
You go prepare a room for him.

50
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,440
I don't want to be part of this anymore.

51
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,240
It gives me a headache.

52
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,800
Need a hand?

53
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,160
-It's fine, Chu.
-Okay.

54
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,440
-Ah, it's quite a lot of walking.
-Yeah.

55
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,240
Here. This room.

56
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,440
Here.

57
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
Right across from
Great-Great-Grandfather's room.

58
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,440
I actually want you to be in the same room
since you're married.

59
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,640
But I don't think he'll agree.

60
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,440
Thank you, Chu.

61
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,000
Sure. Our rooms are
in the house in the back.

62
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,840
A housekeeper comes here
to clean the place every three days.

63
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,880
If you need anything else,
feel free to tell me.

64
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,040
Okay.

65
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
-Right, Chu.
-Huh?

66
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,840
What's in the room downstairs?

67
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,880
Why is it the only room
with a digital door lock?

68
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,360
Don't tell me there's a ghost.

69
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,760
Oh, no.

70
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,240
It's for storing Great-Great-Grandfather's
antique collectibles.

71
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,960
I see.

72
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,160
-Here's your key. Make yourself at home.
-Okay.

73
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,080
A storage room.

74
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,840
The Five-Colored Stone must be in there.

75
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
My knees hurt.

76
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,480
-Oh, Wee.
-Yes.

77
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,760
There you are.
I'm here to tell you the food is ready.

78
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,160
-Come on. Everyone is waiting.
-Okay.

79
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,600
Wow.

80
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,200
You came all of a sudden today,

81
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,640
so we could only made simple dishes.

82
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Oh.

83
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,680
Well, let's have a welcome party
for you another day.

84
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,760
Auntie Rat, these are simple dishes?

85
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,000
I think this is like…

86
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,680
a mini Chinese banquet.

87
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,800
No.

88
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,640
I guess you're hungry, Wee.

89
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,520
All right, let's eat.

90
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,600
I'll dig in.

91
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,840
Oh.

92
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,120
Looks delicious.

93
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,880
It's delicious.

94
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,840
So good.

95
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,840
Woah.

96
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,920
Slow down, will you?

97
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,320
Were you starved before?

98
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,960
Well, San.

99
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,720
I rarely get to eat good food.

100
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,640
I usually eat things that are on sale
and about to expire in the store.

101
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,120
After Grandma got sick,
I gotta be even tighter with money.

102
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,080
It must be hard for you, Wee.

103
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,480
I'm used to it, Auntie Rat.

104
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,360
It was harder for me before.

105
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,799
When I was in second grade, Grandma and I

106
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,640
got kicked out of our rental house.

107
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,440
Grandma took me to sleep under a tollway,

108
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,919
and lied to me, saying we're
going boy scout camping.

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
I didn't have a clue,
so I just thought it's fun.

110
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,840
Then I told my friends about it,
and they're jealous of me.

111
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,840
Sorry, you all. It's not that sad.

112
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,600
Still, you have to
work on your table manners.

113
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,600
Don't be a glutton.

114
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,360
Jeez, Great-Great-Grandfather.
Why are you so mean?

115
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,400
When you live here, if you want anything,
or anything to eat, tell Chu.

116
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,520
What are you looking at?

117
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,040
-Keep eating.
-Okay.

118
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,040
Okay.

119
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,880
Eat a lot, Wee.

120
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,640
How am I supposed to know the password?

121
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,040
San!

122
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,280
San!

123
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,480
San, are you all right?

124
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,800
San!

125
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,880
San!

126
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,280
San!

127
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,560
Hang in there. I'll get Auntie Rat.

128
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,960
It's stopped.

129
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,520
Wee is your destined mate, Mr. San.

130
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,400
Wee's luck supports you in every aspect.

131
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,200
It can lessen the blow.

132
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,920
San.

133
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,920
Did I…

134
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,640
fall asleep?

135
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,520
Yeah, you were out for quite a while.

136
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,600
After you fell asleep,
those wounds disappeared.

137
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,640
What exactly is wrong with you?

138
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,240
Easy there.

139
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,400
The Five-Colored Stone poison

140
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,240
is painful like that.

141
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,840
It must hurt a lot.

142
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,040
But it's better than death, right?

143
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,320
Sorry, I must have been a bother to you.

144
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,680
You're not a bother at all.

145
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,600
Let's get out of here, Ms. Wad.

146
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,600
You took Wad from me!

147
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,920
San!

148
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,840
Ms. Wad.

149
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,720
Ms. Wad.

150
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,000
Ms. Wad.

151
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,480
Ms. Wad!

152
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,200
Ms. Wad.

153
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,840
There you are.

154
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,720
You hung up on me
when we didn't even finish talking.

155
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,400
That's all that happened.

156
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,040
That's all?

157
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,040
If that's all, why are you
standing here all alone?

158
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,920
Last night, when Wee came to me,

159
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,720
the Five-Colored Stone poison
suddenly subsided.

160
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,240
And it's the first night in a hundred
years that I had a good sleep.

161
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,760
That's great, isn't it?

162
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,240
What?

163
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,720
Why are you worried, Mr. San?

164
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,200
You still can't accept that he's Ms. Wad?

165
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,360
Jeez.

166
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,000
Like I told you, there's a chance

167
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,600
Wee might be someone who only
shares the same fate with Ms. Wad.

168
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,560
If, somehow, there's a woman
who's born on at the same time with Wee,

169
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,120
that person could be the real Ms. Wad.

170
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,560
That's what I hope.

171
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,840
Wee and Ms. Wad are different
as night and day.

172
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,960
Mr. San, do you really hate Wee that much?

173
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,480
If Grandma ate that stone,
would she get hurt like San did?

174
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,320
It's still better than death, though.
I gotta get it for Grandma.

175
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,320
How did you get in here?

176
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,440
I asked, how did you get in here?

177
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,000
What? I live here.

178
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,200
How did you get in here, brother?

179
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,240
Brother?

180
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,760
Are we that close?

181
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm part of this family.

182
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,080
I'm not like you.

183
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,360
Uncle Suchat!

184
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,040
Chu.

185
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,640
Why are you here?

186
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,960
Chu.

187
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,200
Why did your mom allow a lowlife
like him to live in the house?

188
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,240
He'll only bring bad luck.

189
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,600
-Hey, bro.
-What?

190
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,760
-Why are you being rude to me?
-Hey, hey, hey.

191
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,000
Uncle Suchat, Wee is married
to Great-Great-Grandfather.

192
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,000
He's part of the family too.
You can't be rude to him like that.

193
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,120
Why can't I be rude to him?

194
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,360
-What?
-Hey.

195
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,960
I dug into his past. He's a swindler,
with a criminal record.

196
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,840
This brat. I'm gonna teach him a lesson.

197
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,280
Oh!

198
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,640
Stop it! Hey!

199
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,480
-Serves you right.
-Hey!

200
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,880
-You!
-What's going on?

201
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,200
Great-Great-Grandfather.

202
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,680
Great-Grandfather, look at that brat.

203
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,000
He's such a pain.

204
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,400
You shouldn't have been rude to him first.

205
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,040
Great-Grandfather,
you should kick him out.

206
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,360
A lowlife like that is surely not Ms. Wad.

207
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,480
Plus, I got a lead about the real Ms. Wad.

208
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,880
It seems Ms. Wad's family
moved to settle in Chiang Rai.

209
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,040
After Ms. Wad died, her entire family
moved to Phetchabun.

210
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,800
I've never heard anything
about them since.

211
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,600
How come they're in Chiang Rai now?

212
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,920
Anyway, Great-Grandfather,

213
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,880
I'll find out who in that family

214
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,080
was born at the same time with that brat.

215
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,960
I still believe that if Ms. Wad's reborn,

216
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,840
she must be in this family.

217
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,560
I'll leave it to you. If there's
any update, let me know immediately.

218
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,720
Yes, Great-Grandfather.

219
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,680
Hey, Wee.

220
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,400
Something wrong?
You seemed upset during our shift.

221
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,160
-San didn't satisfy you?
-My ass.

222
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,520
-Get lost. Go take care of your stuff.
-Chill, all right?

223
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,200
I was just joking.

224
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,720
So, what's wrong? Tell me.
Maybe I can help.

225
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,480
If I tell you, you'll say I'm crazy.

226
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,640
-Wee, my friend.
-What?

227
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,400
I'm your friend.

228
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,640
You can tell me anything.

229
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
I believe you.

230
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,240
CT SUPERMARKET

231
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,440
Are you crazy? That's nonsense.

232
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,880
Go see a doctor.

233
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,320
Didn't you say you'd believe me, huh?

234
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,040
You want me to believe San's over 100
years old because he ate a magical stone,

235
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,520
and you're his ex reborn?

236
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,720
Look at you.

237
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,320
I'm not even sure you were
a human in your past life.

238
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Ton, after you said all that,
I'm convinced you hate me.

239
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,040
I don't hate you.

240
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,120
But I think

241
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm not Ms. Wad reborn.

242
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,320
I just share the same fate with her.

243
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,080
And they're looking for
the real Ms. Wad now.

244
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,920
If they find her, I'll be kicked out
of his house for sure.

245
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,360
Then I won't be able to steal
the Five-Colored Stone to help Grandma.

246
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,640
What should I do, Ton?

247
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,240
Go see a doctor,
and get your brain checked, my friend.

248
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,600
-You got a screw loose.
-Ton!

249
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,400
Wee, you should get some good sleep.

250
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,680
BAO GONG SHRINE

251
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Tao, how's it going with
the Five-Colored Stone? Is it okay?

252
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,440
I need two more days for the ritual.

253
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,920
Right, Mr. San.

254
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,240
How have you been lately?
Did the poison get to you again?

255
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,040
No. I haven't had any pain
since that night.

256
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,040
But I am sure Wee is not Ms. Wad.

257
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,160
Whatever you say, Mr. San.

258
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,400
But having him in your life

259
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,320
is good for you.

260
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,920
I think you shouldn't hate him.

261
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,880
Dammit. What's the password?

262
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,840
Huh?

263
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,800
Is the stone hidden here?

264
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,640
What are you doing here?

265
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,120
I'm sorry.

266
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,880
That's expensive.

267
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,080
I'm sorry, San. I'm sorry.
It's an accident. I'm sorry.

268
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,880
How did you get in here?

269
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,080
The door was open.

270
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,920
I walked in to look around.
I didn't know you're in here.

271
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,000
These photos needed to be brought out
by mercury vapor.

272
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,960
Take one and you get one.
You can't have copies.

273
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,720
Oh.

274
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,960
Sounds inconvenient.

275
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,160
Unlike these days, you can take photos
and record videos with just a phone.

276
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,400
Why isn't there any photos of you?

277
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,040
You don't like to take photos?

278
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,440
You're good-looking, though.

279
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,480
Why should I keep evidence that I'm
a weird human who doesn't age and die?

280
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,040
You're right.

281
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,960
Well, the magical stone
that stopped your aging,

282
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
what does it look like? Can I see it?

283
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,360
I don't think so.

284
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,200
You've been too involved in this.

285
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,160
When Suchat finds Ms. Wad,
you can be free from it.

286
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,240
It must be uncomfortable for you.

287
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,440
Uncomfortable?

288
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,320
Why would I be uncomfortable?

289
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,920
You are a man.

290
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,320
And you had to marry me, even though it's
just a fake wedding to negate bad luck.

291
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,400
You must feel uncomfortable.

292
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,240
Oh, San. This is it? I don't mind at all.

293
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,000
Why not?

294
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,680
If people knew you married a man,

295
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,680
they would speak ill of you.

296
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,800
Let them talk.

297
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,680
It's my life. I don't care what they say.

298
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,240
And I don't mind if it's a man.

299
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
What do you mean?

300
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,680
To be honest,

301
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,600
I've dated both women and men.

302
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,840
But actually, I did not just date them.

303
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,800
Well…

304
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,560
-I've had experience.
-Enough.

305
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,280
I don't want to hear it.

306
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,840
How could you say something
so morally inappropriate?

307
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,960
It's the truth.

308
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,800
It's us people who came up with
these moral values.

309
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,640
If people change, they should change too.

310
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,800
But I can't accept it.

311
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,240
You don't have to.

312
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,400
Because, even if you don't accept it,
it won't change the fact that,

313
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,960
in this world, there are men who like men,
and women who like women, not--

314
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,600
Can we change the topic?

315
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,440
Ah! What a headache!

316
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,880
How can I make San trust me enough
to tell me where the stone is?

317
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,480
I did that, and that too. Didn't work.

318
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,680
Jeez.

319
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,080
Hey, don't worry, Wee.

320
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,280
Great-Great-Grandfather is an old man.

321
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,200
He might be a bit behind
about gender diversity.

322
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
Well, whatever makes him happy.

323
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,280
Oh, no. You must be so sad, right?

324
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,160
Don't listen to him.
He has a sharp tongue.

325
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,720
But actually, he really likes you.

326
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,800
Huh? He likes me?

327
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,240
Of course. You know what?

328
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,200
After he first met you,

329
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,160
he had a dream about you.

330
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,320
-A dream?
-And it's not just a dream.

331
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
It's that kind of dream, like…

332
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,080
Like…

333
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,440
Huh? Pretty?

334
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
Jeez. Come closer.

335
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,320
Wet dream.

336
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,240
-Like that?
-Yes.

337
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,640
So, he's probably just confused right now.

338
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,560
Don't take it to heart, okay?

339
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,320
-Confused?
-Yeah.

340
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,320
-Thank you, Chu.
-Yeah.

341
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
He had that kind of dream about me.

342
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,200
If I could make San mine,

343
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,920
he'd be so in love with me
and give me the Five-Colored Stone.

344
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,920
What's the matter?

345
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,040
What? So, what is it?
Why are you staring at me?

346
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,640
Uh… Actually…

347
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,240
I don't know what happened to me.
Suddenly, I just…

348
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,440
started feeling dizzy.

349
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,200
Why didn't you catch me?

350
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,600
I didn't know you're gonna fall.
You were standing fine just now.

351
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,640
What exactly is wrong with you?
Do you feel unwell?

352
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,400
Wanna see a doctor?

353
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,520
No need. Just give me a soothing balm.

354
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,560
What if I get a bump on my head?

355
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,320
San, apply the balm for me.

356
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,239
Do it yourself.
Your hand isn't hurt, is it?

357
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,440
Jeez, you're so mean.

358
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,400
Do it for me, please.

359
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,239
Please.

360
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,760
Ow! My head hurts.

361
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,600
Fine.

362
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,400
Come here.

363
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,760
Hey!

364
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,280
Why did you take your shirt off?

365
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,720
So you can apply the balm.

366
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,960
Your head hurts.
I don't think you need your shirt off.

367
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,640
Actually… My back also hurts a little.

368
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
But not just my back.

369
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,840
It hurts here too.

370
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,960
Will you apply the balm for me?

371
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,800
Wait, San. Wait.

372
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,280
San. San, open the door.

373
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,320
Open the door for me.

374
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,280
San, open the door for me please. Please.

375
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,520
San.

376
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,960
I guess I'm not attractive enough.

377
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,520
Stupid kid.

378
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,960
Why did he do that?

379
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,320
Master, you should
quit reciting the sutra.

380
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,400
If you want to go to paradise,

381
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,160
there's a shortcut.

382
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,600
Let's see if you can endure this.

383
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
You lose.

384
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,520
Again?

385
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,600
Put them here.

386
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,200
-Here.
-Careful when you put them down.

387
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,200
-Oh, don't spill it.
-Okay.

388
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,040
All right, are you done?

389
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,480
Oh, Dad. Where's Great-Grandfather?

390
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,480
Breakfast is ready.

391
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,080
He said we can go ahead
and eat without him.

392
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,200
Huh?

393
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
He went into the Buddha room to pray.

394
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
-Huh?
-Huh?

395
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,160
Pray?

396
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,600
He's religious.
The plan to seduce him isn't gonna work.

397
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,680
Oh.

398
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,600
Tao.

399
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,520
Tao.

400
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,680
Now, I know who Wee is.

401
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,680
Who? Ms. Wad?

402
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,440
No.

403
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,240
Wee is the fox that conceals himself
in Ms. Wad's fate.

404
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,880
Like the nine-tailed fox
that possessed the consort Daji.

405
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,200
Did you watch Naruto again?

406
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,840
Listen.

407
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,920
I had a dream last night,
and I think it's a precognitive dream.

408
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,280
In my dream, Wee was a fox demon, and he…

409
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,960
He what?

410
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,640
You had an obscene dream again, right?

411
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,880
No… It's…

412
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,000
Hey.

413
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,960
I think I know
why you have dreams like this.

414
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,120
Deep down, you secretly like him.
And you want to do things to him.

415
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,560
You should pray and meditate
when you have free time, Mr. San.

416
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,360
It's not like that.

417
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,920
Whatever. I'm not here today
to talk about your dirty dreams.

418
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,000
But I'm here because of this.

419
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,880
-And what about that?
-Everything is all right, Mr. San.

420
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,400
That kid lives in San's house now.

421
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,280
If he gets the Five-Colored Stone,

422
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
everything will be ruined.

423
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,440
-Proceed with the plan quickly.
-Yes, sir.

424
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,240
Hey.

425
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,880
Why are you so loud?
The nurse will come and scold you.

426
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,560
How could I keep quiet?

427
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,680
My fingers were bitten off.

428
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,880
You're so silly.

429
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,880
Oh, I'm tired.

430
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,480
Grandma, San and his family
actually planned to come visit you today.

431
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,520
But at the market, the roof collapsed,
so Grandpa Xiong had to go check on it.

432
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,720
So, I told them to come another day.
We can come together.

433
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,040
It's a shame, right?
Or San and his family would be here too.

434
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,840
Grandma.

435
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,280
-How's it going today?
-We had some customers.

436
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,360
This is for the rent.

437
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,760
-Thanks. I hope you sell well today.
-Yeah.

438
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,240
ATTACHMENT ONE MOVIE

439
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,960
-Mom.
-Huh?

440
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,240
-Mom.
-What?

441
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,000
Mom.

442
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,600
What?

443
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,120
-What's wrong?
-Great-Great-Grandfather.

444
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,040
Who sent it?

445
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,640
I don't know, but I'm afraid they might be
those thieves who broke into our house.

446
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,160
-Dad doesn't pick up the phone.
-Grandpa.

447
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,840
Let me go find my dad too.

448
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,040
No, Rat. You go to the police station.

449
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,960
Chu and I will go
look for him at the market.

450
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,440
Where are you all going?

451
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,880
We can't reach Grandpa. Don't know
where he is. We'll go look for him.

452
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,520
Let me go with you.

453
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,080
No, you stay here.

454
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,560
In case Xiong comes back.

455
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,360
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

456
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,000
I'll leave the house with you.

457
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,000
Where is it?

458
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,240
It must be in here.

459
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,640
Whoa.

460
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,280
-Mr. San.
-Tao.

461
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,520
What did you get?

462
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,960
I know where they are.

463
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,040
Whoever touches my people,
I won't let them go.

464
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,880
Lately, San's been really nice to me,

465
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,360
so I…

466
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,280
Third.

467
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,480
Wee.

468
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,480
-Has Wee told you that I'm…
-So what?

469
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,080
-From now on, stay away from that doctor.
-Why?

470
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,720
You have no right to control me.
I don't like it.

471
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,640
I think you look familiar.

472
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,640
