00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,120
GODDESS NU WA

2
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,120
My name is Wadfah.

3
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,400
I always have dreams about you.

4
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,040
All I know is that your name is San.

5
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,920
In my dreams,

6
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,880
it's as if we're lovers.

7
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,039
Your ancestors were dukes, weren't they?

8
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,440
That's right.

9
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,280
My family bloodline descended
from Duke Phichitphusit.

10
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,560
It's her, Mr. San.

11
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,600
We sent people to look for her
in Chiang Rai.

12
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,160
Would you please

13
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,520
tell me your birth date and birth place?

14
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,880
Sure.

15
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,360
It's 26th August 2000.

16
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,640
At 7:35 a.m.

17
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,200
I was born at Paolo Hospital Chokchai 4.

18
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,160
Whoa.

19
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,000
Exactly the same with Wee.

20
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,880
San.

21
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,760
-Wee?
-Something wrong?

22
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,000
MS. WADFAH

23
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,320
-San.
-Huh?

24
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm leaving for work now.

25
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,280
Okay.

26
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,200
-I'm off, Chu.
-Yeah.

27
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,360
Tao wants to talk to you about something.
He's coming.

28
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,560
Please wait.

29
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,960
This place…

30
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,600
I remember this place.

31
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,600
You and I came here before.

32
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,920
The two of us…

33
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,040
We ran in here.

34
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,480
Ms. Wad, let's hide in here for now.

35
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,360
And…

36
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,920
Then they followed us.

37
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,880
Prince Trai.

38
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,360
Prince Trai.

39
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,520
You took Wad from me!

40
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,560
San!

41
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,400
No.

42
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,840
No.

43
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,440
Mr. San, I'm scared.

44
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,640
I'm scared.

45
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,680
Mr. San.

46
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,280
I'm scared.

47
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,960
Great-Great-Grandfather.

48
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,240
Why are you doing this?

49
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,400
Chu.

50
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,040
Wee.

51
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,080
Mr. San.

52
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,560
Wee.

53
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,320
Wee, hear me out.

54
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Wee.

55
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Wee.

56
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,800
It's not what you think.

57
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,200
Wee.

58
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,360
Hear me out.

59
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,000
Wee.

60
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm not ready to talk.

61
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,640
Can you leave me alone?

62
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,200
Don't follow me, or I'll hit you.

63
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,040
Then do it, Wee. Hit me.

64
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,320
But don't go. Listen to me first.

65
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,920
Why did you do that?

66
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,440
I told you

67
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,960
you didn't love me.

68
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,960
You're just lonely.

69
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,440
But you kept pushing me to believe you.

70
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,600
Why didn't you just let me go then?

71
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,960
Wee.

72
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,840
It's not like that.

73
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,320
I love you.

74
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,320
If you love me, why did you do it?

75
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,640
If you love me, why did you do it, huh?

76
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,360
Who is she?

77
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,840
Since when?

78
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,440
When did you meet her?

79
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,800
How many times have you met her?

80
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,560
I've only met her recently.

81
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,160
Wee.

82
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,640
It's complicated.

83
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,840
It's not complicated.

84
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,640
It's just that you love someone else.

85
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,520
Wee.

86
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,200
-Let go of me.
-Wee, hear me out.

87
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,120
Wee.

88
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,760
-Wee.
-I said let go.

89
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,400
-Wee.
-I said let go.

90
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,560
Wee.

91
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,360
-Wee, hear me out.
-No.

92
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,280
-Wee.
-Wee.

93
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,440
-Let go.
-Wee.

94
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,360
-Wee, stop it.
-No.

95
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,400
-Listen.
-Wee.

96
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,840
Wee.

97
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,680
Wee, listen to me.

98
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,640
This woman

99
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,000
is Ms. Wad.

100
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,480
My goodness.

101
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,560
They look identical.

102
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,200
She's… She's the real Ms. Wad.

103
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,000
I've had dreams about you
for as long as I can remember.

104
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,520
At first, it was just a blur.

105
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,160
But after some time,

106
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,040
it became clearer and clearer.

107
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,960
I remember everything.

108
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,680
From the first day I met you, Mr. San,

109
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,080
to the day…

110
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,240
I was killed.

111
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,600
But…

112
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,320
Wee is Ms. Wad reborn.

113
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,240
Doctor Tao said that.

114
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,480
It's because I calculated it
from his birth date.

115
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,680
And Ms. Wadfah

116
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,880
shares the same birth date
and birth time with Wee.

117
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,760
Jeez, what is going on?

118
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,560
Seriously, Doctor.

119
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,080
Is there any way to prove
who is the real Ms. Wad reborn?

120
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,040
Right.

121
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,000
This Five-Colored Stone is tied
to the spirit of Ms. Wad in the past life.

122
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,440
It'll give us a signal
who the real Ms. Wad is.

123
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,160
Jeez.

124
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,840
How are we supposed to know
who the real one is?

125
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,840
What's going on, Doctor Tao?

126
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,200
Why did the Five-Colored Stone
react to both Wee an Ms. Wadfah?

127
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,080
I don't understand either.

128
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,280
Maybe it's because

129
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,920
the two share the same
birth date and time.

130
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,520
I'll find another way to prove
who the real one is.

131
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,080
No need to prove. Just choose Wee.

132
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
Great-Great-Grandfather
and Wee are married.

133
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,760
As for that woman…

134
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,960
Send her back to Chiang Rai.

135
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,040
It's not that easy.

136
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,400
According to the textbook,
it must be the real Ms. Wad

137
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,120
who feeds Mr. San the stone.

138
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,160
If we picked the wrong one,
Mr. San could die.

139
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,880
Jeez! Why is this so messy?

140
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,120
Alright. You tell me, Doctor Tao.

141
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,080
Between Wee and Ms. Wadfah,
who looks more promising?

142
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,600
To be honest,

143
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,920
right now, Ms. Wadfah has the advantage.

144
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,560
She remembered Mr. San, and she
remembered what happened in the past.

145
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,800
Plus, she looks exactly like Ms. Wad.

146
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
I think…

147
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,960
Then what about Wee? What can he do?

148
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,840
Where are you going?

149
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,720
I'll go back to sleep at my apartment.

150
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,440
I'm not letting you go.

151
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,280
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

152
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,920
How do you expect me
to stay here with you?

153
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,920
The person you're waiting for is back.
Shouldn't I leave?

154
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,840
At first, I thought
you'd changed your mind.

155
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,920
She took you away from me.

156
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,200
But in fact,

157
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,400
I'm the one who came later.

158
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,720
Maybe it's not like that, Wee.

159
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,480
How could it not be like that?

160
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,160
She remembered everything
about when she's with you.

161
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,960
But I…

162
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,520
Even now, I can't remember a thing.

163
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,000
Isn't it obvious?

164
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,960
I don't know.

165
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,600
I don't know anything, Wee.

166
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,760
But can you not go? Stay with me for now.

167
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,840
Please stay with me.

168
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,920
CT SUPERMARKET

169
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,520
You're spacing out.

170
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,360
Oh, well.

171
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,880
Did San give it to you hard last night?

172
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,760
You're messing up the shelves.

173
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,920
What?

174
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,080
Hey, Wee.

175
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,240
What's wrong with you?

176
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,480
Normally, you'd have gotten back at me.

177
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,160
Did you have a fight with San?

178
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,680
What do you want to talk to me about?

179
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,960
You and Mr. San…

180
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,320
What's your relationship?

181
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,600
Are you dating?

182
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,720
Well…

183
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,120
Something like that.

184
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,320
I wonder why this happens to us.

185
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,600
I've had dreams about Mr. San

186
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,600
for as long as I can remember.

187
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,560
At first, I thought I was crazy.

188
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,400
I kept dreaming about the same person.

189
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,680
But when I met him,

190
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,040
when I realized

191
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,280
he really does exist,

192
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,640
instead, he…

193
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,800
I'm sorry.

194
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,000
Wee.

195
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,440
Please give San back to me, Wee.

196
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,000
You can call me a bad person

197
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,560
or anything,

198
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,200
but I'm sure

199
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,120
I'm the Ms. Wad that he's waiting for.

200
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,240
I'll not let his 100 years go to waste.

201
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,760
I…

202
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,520
I…

203
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,760
Wee.

204
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,720
If you really love him,

205
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,520
you know

206
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,920
what you should do, right?

207
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,040
Wee.

208
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,560
Is something wrong?

209
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,160
No.

210
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,520
What's the matter, Third?
Why are you here to see me?

211
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,840
UNDERSTANDING GOODBYE

212
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,360
At my friend's hospital, there's a program
for relatives of terminally ill patients.

213
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,320
I think, if you can join,
it might be useful for you.

214
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,800
Thank you, Third.

215
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,880
You can ask San to go with you,

216
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,280
so he can be sure
I'm not trying anything with you.

217
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,920
And when the time comes,

218
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,960
he can be there with you and help you.

219
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,840
Yes, Doctor?

220
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,480
Huh?

221
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,240
ELEVATOR OPERATION HOURS
7:00 A.M. - 7:00 P.M.

222
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,240
THIRD FLOOR, SPECIAL ROOMS,
SHARED ROOM (MALE), SHARED ROOM (FEMALE)

223
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,040
-Grandma!
-Wee!

224
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,080
-Grandma!
-Wee!

225
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,680
-Grandma!
-Stay back, Wee.

226
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,720
Wee.

227
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,280
What wrong with my grandma?

228
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,000
The patient's having difficulty breathing
from fluid buildup in the pleural space.

229
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,760
The doctor is draining
the pleural space now.

230
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,520
Please wait outside.

231
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
-Grandma!
-Wee, let's get out for now.

232
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,600
-Grandma!
-Wee.

233
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,640
-Let's get out.
-Please leave for now.

234
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,800
-Mister.
-Wee.

235
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,040
Grandma, you can't die.

236
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
Grandma!

237
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,920
EMERGENCY

238
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,880
Third.

239
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,160
What's wrong with my grandma? Will she…

240
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,800
I can't say anything for sure right now.

241
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,600
Why? You're a doctor. You have to know.

242
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,280
Please tell me.

243
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,640
I'm begging you.
What's wrong with my grandma?

244
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,400
I'm worried about her.

245
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,560
It's pleural effusion in cancer patients.

246
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,360
Usually, it happens because
of the cancer that has spread.

247
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,120
If she's lucky and
there are no other complications,

248
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,800
after the draining, she should be fine.

249
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,880
But if not…

250
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,200
Wee.

251
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
San.

252
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,440
Your Five-Colored Stone.

253
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,360
Can I have part of it to save my grandma?

254
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
No, you can't.

255
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,040
We've prayed to the gods.
I hope everything will be in peace now.

256
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,720
Jeez.

257
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,120
Wee hasn't come back yet?

258
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,440
Great-Grandfather, what's wrong?

259
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
-Oh! Great-Great-Grandfather.
-Great-Grandfather.

260
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,320
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-Great-Grandfather.

261
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,760
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-Grandfather.

262
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,000
-Great-Grandfather.
-Great-Great-Grandfather.

263
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,600
Great-Great-Grandfather.

264
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,760
What's wrong with Great-Grandfather?

265
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,680
Get Tao here quickly!

266
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
Great-Great-Grandfather.

267
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
Grandfather.

268
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,680
Oh, no.

269
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,600
-What's wrong with Mr. San?
-We have no idea.

270
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,080
But from the looks of it,

271
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,560
it's probably related to
the Five-Colored Stone.

272
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,320
The Five-Colored Stone is gone.

273
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,240
Hey!

274
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,120
Hey, why were you running?

275
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,080
Ton!

276
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,680
Yes, it's me.

277
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,720
Late in the afternoon,
you suddenly rushed somewhere.

278
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,200
You left your bag,
so I'm returning it to you.

279
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,440
Ton, take me to the hospital.

280
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,080
-Hospital?
-Yes, quick.

281
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,000
Hospital.

282
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,360
-What's with you?
-Just go to the hospital quickly.

283
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,560
-Slowly.
-Easy there.

284
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,040
The closer the goddess' birthday gets,

285
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,320
the more Mr. San's body becomes sensitive.

286
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,160
The Five-Colored Stone

287
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,960
should be near him.

288
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,640
Because the stone was moved,

289
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,760
you're hurting now.

290
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
-Grandfather.
-Mr. San.

291
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,880
Great-Great-Grandfather.

292
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,160
So, this is

293
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,920
the magical stone that made San immortal?

294
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,840
That's right, Grandma.

295
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,800
I'll give part of
the Five-Colored Stone to you,

296
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,640
and I'll return the rest to San.

297
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,000
You'll be fine, okay?

298
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,440
You'll be with me for a long time.

299
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,760
Wee.

300
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,000
How do you know, if we take a part of it,

301
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,520
San will still be able to use the rest?

302
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,640
Well…

303
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,240
I think it's likely.

304
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,800
Even so, I don't want it.

305
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,160
San's already saved my life once.

306
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,400
How could I steal the life he has left?

307
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,400
Wee.

308
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
It's my time.

309
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,600
Grandma.

310
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,600
Don't you love me anymore?

311
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,720
Why are you leaving me? Huh?

312
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,280
I love you the most.

313
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,280
There's never been a day
that I don't love you.

314
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,120
But this is how life is.

315
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,400
When it's time, it has to end.

316
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,400
If there's a way you can stay,

317
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,360
you should stay with me.

318
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,720
Isn't that right?

319
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
Get up slowly.

320
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,120
I'm tired.

321
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,760
I don't want to live in this deteriorating

322
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,400
sick body any longer.

323
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,280
I want to rest.

324
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,560
But Grandma…

325
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,800
I know you're sad.

326
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,720
And I'm sad too

327
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,200
for having to leave you like this.

328
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
But it's life.

329
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,640
Because…

330
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,600
Everything has to come to an end.

331
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,640
That's why memories are valuable.

332
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,000
If it goes on forever,

333
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,920
everything

334
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,440
will never matter.

335
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Don't you agree?

336
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,679
But Grandma,

337
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,440
I'm scared.

338
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,239
I don't want to be alone. You know?

339
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,280
You won't be alone.

340
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,840
I will always be with you.

341
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,360
I'll be in here.

342
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,040
I'll be in here forever.

343
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,480
The goddess' amulet paper
should help a little.

344
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,000
Still, we have to hurry and get
the Five-Colored Stone back.

345
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,400
Mr. San will only recover then.

346
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,800
Wee turned off his phone.
I can't reach him.

347
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,480
Where is he
at such a critical time like this?

348
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,680
You tried so hard to steal it,

349
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,520
but your grandma didn't even use it.

350
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,600
You should hurry and return it

351
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,640
before the others realize
it's been stolen.

352
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,600
This way, Ton.

353
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,680
Perhaps…

354
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,680
Could it be Wee?

355
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,000
Wee might have stolen
the Five-Colored Stone.

356
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,160
Huh?

357
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,600
That's impossible.

358
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,640
Wee would never steal
the Five-Colored Stone.

359
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,800
But I heard his grandmother
is very sick, isn't she?

360
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,600
He might have stolen it
to try to save his grandmother.

361
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,840
Don't just make wild guesses.

362
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,480
Wee really loves Great-Great-Grandfather.

363
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,480
There's no way he would betray us.

364
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,600
He's Great-Great-Grandfather's
destined mate.

365
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,560
It's good that you brought this up.

366
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,600
Actually, today,
Doctor Tao and I had a talk.

367
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,760
He told me

368
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,960
Mr. San's destined mate

369
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,160
-is more likely to be me.
-Huh?

370
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,360
Is that true, Tao?

371
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,240
If we're talking probability,

372
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,760
I believe so.

373
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Hey.

374
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,040
We need to choose the right person.

375
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,320
If we use the wrong person in the ritual,

376
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,560
Mr. San might die.

377
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,720
Or maybe…

378
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,640
Wee might have realized he's a fake,
so he stole the stone.

379
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,760
And that's why Mr. San
is in pain like this.

380
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,880
I told you not to make wild guesses.

381
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,280
I don't think Wee is trustworthy.

382
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,440
-Hey, Wee! Wee, don't! Wee!
-Wee.

383
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
Wee.

384
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,120
How come the Five-Colored Stone's
with you?

385
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,920
I stole the stone.

386
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,400
What Ms. Wad said is right.

387
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,160
I planned to use the Five-Colored Stone
to cure my grandma.

388
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,200
But I didn't know how to use it.

389
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,760
I thought I'd return it
without anyone noticing.

390
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,680
But I got caught.

391
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,680
It's not true, right, Wee?

392
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,880
Enough, Chu.

393
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,280
Wee.

394
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,440
Why are you like this?

395
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,680
You know

396
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,720
how much Grandfather trusts you, right?

397
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,320
Don't tell me,

398
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,800
all this time,

399
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,240
you'd been trying to steal
the Five-Colored Stone.

400
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,600
Yes.

401
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,160
When I got stabbed,

402
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,880
it wasn't because I tried
to protect the stone for San.

403
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,560
I tried to steal it too.

404
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,880
But Suchat managed to take it.

405
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,200
Why did you do it?

406
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,560
You wasted the love

407
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,520
and the trust we had for you.

408
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,680
We thought you were family.

409
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,280
You're no different than Suchat.

410
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,640
Get lost.

411
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,000
Someone like you isn't welcome here.

412
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,720
Grandpa.

413
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,920
Go!

414
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,800
Just go.

415
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,840
Why?

416
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,200
-Grandfather.
-Great-Great-Grandfather.

417
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,160
Grandpa.

418
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,160
Woah!

419
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,600
Goodbye, San.

420
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,840
This ring, I'll give it back to you.

421
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
It should be with its real owner.

422
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,120
Wee.

423
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
-Wee.
-Wee.

424
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,240
Wee.

425
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,360
Oh! Mr. San!

426
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,680
-Grandfather!
-Mr. San!

427
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,280
-Grandfather!
-Great-Great-Grandfather!

428
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,720
Wee!

429
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Will you stop?!

430
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,760
What is wrong with you?

431
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,400
Do you realize what you just said?

432
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,800
I really did what I said.

433
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,120
You said it as if you didn't love San.

434
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,920
Should someone like me love him?

435
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,320
A horrible person like me

436
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,640
who used him.

437
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,080
I'm useless for him.

438
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,560
It's Ms. Wad who can save his life.

439
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,560
Getting with her must be better
than staying with me, don't you think?

440
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,520
Damn!

441
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,440
My grandma is dying.

442
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,080
I don't want San to die too.

443
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,200
Even though I can't be with him,

444
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,800
I can see him live his life.

445
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,120
He can be happy with someone he loves.
Isn't that enough?

446
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,800
Uh, Mr. San?

447
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,280
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-Great-Grandfather.

448
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,520
How are you?

449
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,600
Ms. Wad

450
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,120
went to buy some porridge for you.

451
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,440
Grandfather, have some first.

452
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,880
Thank you, Ms. Wad.

453
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,640
-Great-Grandfather.
-Grandfather.

454
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,920
Where are you going?

455
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,880
Why don't you eat first?

456
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,080
I'm gonna go find Wee.
I need to talk to him.

457
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,080
Yesterday, didn't you hear it?

458
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,240
He confessed that he stole
the Five-Colored Stone.

459
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,720
And it wasn't the first time he did it.

460
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,240
I heard that, but I don't believe it.

461
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,920
I think he must have some reason
for saying that.

462
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,680
I'm coming with you.

463
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
-Oh. Ow.
-Ahem.

464
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,840
Ouch.

465
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,640
Easy there. Are you okay, Ton?

466
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,520
I'm okay.

467
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,880
Is Wee here with you?

468
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,320
No, he isn't.

469
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,760
And where is he?

470
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,440
Well… He told me
not to tell you where he is.

471
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,880
San.

472
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,840
He had a reason for doing that.

473
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,440
And I understand him.

474
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,240
Please let him go.

475
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,400
Don't make it difficult for him.

476
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,000
At least, it'll be good for both of you.

477
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,840
Excuse me.

478
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,920
Please let me through.

479
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,280
Wee, come eat.

480
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,920
Hey, if you need anything else, tell me.

481
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,080
Oh.

482
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,120
I already feel bad for bothering you.

483
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,040
You helped transfer my grandma,

484
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,120
and let me stay here in your condo too.

485
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,600
Wee,

486
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,520
did you have a fight with San?

487
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,640
Well…

488
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,120
I…

489
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,880
You can tell me.

490
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,200
Thank you.

491
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,200
I'm really grateful to you

492
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,320
for everything.

493
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,280
Okay, tell me when you feel better.

494
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,680
I'll bring San here to talk it out
with you. Sounds good?

495
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,680
No need to do that.

496
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,440
The two of us,

497
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,160
San and I,

498
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,120
we really can't go on.

499
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,640
San.

500
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,360
I'm winning. Just a sec.

501
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,040
Ah!

502
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,560
Look, San. I lost.

503
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,920
How will you make it up to me?

504
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,160
Can I do something else for you?

505
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,600
San.

506
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,960
I told you I like this scent.

507
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,360
Great-Great-Grandfather.

508
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,680
Come in, Chu.

509
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,560
I went to see Grandma Chaem
at the hospital.

510
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,200
I thought she might know where Wee is.

511
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,800
What did you find out?

512
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,760
They said she'd transferred
to another hospital.

513
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,880
But they wouldn't tell me where it is.

514
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,080
It's an abrupt transfer.
It must be his doing.

515
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Doctor.

516
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,200
Wee's with you, right?

517
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,000
He's not ready to see you.

518
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,720
Ready or not,

519
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,240
it's none of your business.

520
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,440
Take me to him.

521
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,320
Please calm down.

522
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,280
Doctor, please tell us where Wee is.

523
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,440
When Wee wants to see Mr. San,
I'll bring him to you.

524
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,520
Give Wee back.

525
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,360
-Mr. San.
-What are you doing?

526
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,960
Mr. San.

527
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,800
How did you get here?

528
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,880
Uncle Xiong said you two are here.

529
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,920
What's going on here?

530
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,480
-Hey.
-Great-Great-Grandfather.

531
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,120
-Mr. San.
-Is this the reason?

532
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,200
Wee ran away because you cheated on him.

533
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:20,960
That's not it.

534
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,480
I saw it just now.

535
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,040
You promised me
you wouldn't break his heart.

536
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,760
And look at what you did. Huh?

537
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,800
He cried all night because of you.

538
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,600
I was next door,

539
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,000
listening to him crying
because of a horrible person like you.

540
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,440
Do you know how much it hurt me?

541
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,480
Please calm down.

542
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,640
Mr. San isn't in the wrong here.

543
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,720
I remember you.

544
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,720
You went to see Wee the other day.

545
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,040
What did you say to him?

546
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,240
He seemed upset since then.

547
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,560
How could you two do this?

548
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,240
Great-Great-Grandfather.

549
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,920
Chu.

550
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,200
Why are you crying?

551
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,280
I was the one who got hit.

552
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,040
And the wound has already healed.

553
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,720
I'm frustrated.

554
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,400
I don't know how I can help you anymore.

555
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,720
I worry my great-great-granddaughter.

556
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,480
I'm such a bad great-great-grandfather.

557
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,040
The doctor did the right thing
telling me off.

558
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,160
I know

559
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,280
what you have to face is not easy.

560
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,000
If I were you, I wouldn't know
what to do myself.

561
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,400
If Ms. Wadfah is the real Ms. Wad,

562
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,360
and you choose Wee,

563
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,200
it means we can't perform
the reverse ceremony.

564
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,360
That's why we're stuck here
and can't move forward.

565
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,680
You're right.

566
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,840
It shouldn't be like this.

567
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,400
I need to make my decision.

568
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,200
You called me here. What's the matter?

569
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,360
Where are the others?

570
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,000
They went out for work.

571
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,240
That means…

572
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,240
We are alone.

573
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,160
What are you doing?

574
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,280
I'm sorry, Ms. Wad.

575
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,600
This is all my fault.

576
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,160
Oh, Mr. San.

577
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,240
If this is about you and Wee,

578
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,680
I don't mind.

579
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,200
It's a misunderstanding.

580
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,880
It's not a misunderstanding.

581
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,520
I love him.

582
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,240
What? How can you love Wee

583
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,160
when he's not the real Wad?

584
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,360
It's me.

585
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,280
I am Wad.

586
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,720
I remember our story.

587
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,280
I know.

588
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,280
But…

589
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,640
But I love Wee.

590
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,760
It doesn't matter if he's Wad or not.

591
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,440
I love him for who he is.

592
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,280
I love him, Ms. Wad.

593
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,600
I'm sorry.

594
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,840
I'm a bad person.

595
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,000
I betrayed you.

596
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,720
All this time, I've waited for you,

597
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,520
but you betray me.

598
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,480
Since you say you love Wee so much,

599
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,680
do you dare to give
the Five-Colored Stone to me?

600
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,240
That stone.

601
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,040
A hundred years ago,

602
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,680
I saved your life,

603
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,920
and you used the stone to wait for me.

604
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,720
I have the right to have
the Five-Colored Stone too.

605
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,840
I'll let you choose.

606
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,800
Are you going to choose Wee,

607
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,000
or me?

608
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,320
What the heck?

609
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,720
It's raining so hard.

610
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,200
Is the world crumbling?

611
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,640
Oh.

612
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,320
GODDESS NU WA

613
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,240
Are you sure

614
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,760
that you're going to give me
the Five-Colored Stone?

615
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,640
Of course, I am.

616
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,040
The Five-Colored Stone belongs to you.

617
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,280
Oh, what's going on?

618
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,280
-The rain is suddenly pouring.
-Yeah.

619
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,400
Jeez.

620
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,360
-Grandfather.
-Great-Great-Grandfather.

621
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,320
Great-Grandfather.

622
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,280
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-Great-Grandfather, what's wrong?

623
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,600
-Grandfather.
-Great-Great-Grandfather.

624
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,400
Great-Great-Grandfather.

625
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,680
Great-Great-Grandfather, go get Wee back.

626
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,320
I'll take care of getting
the Five-Colored Stone.

627
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,760
Do you know where Ms. Wadfah is?

628
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,680
We need to talk.

629
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,960
I have nothing to talk to you about.

630
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,200
You go back to her.

631
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,720
Wee!

632
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,480
-Let me go.
-Wee.

633
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:27,800
Ms. Wad.

634
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,280
