1
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,640
You scared me to death.

2
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,480
Don't ever do that again.

3
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,040
Jeez, what did I do wrong?

4
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,880
Tong bought a new car
and asked me to take a ride.

5
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,360
You were overthinking things.

6
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,680
Hey, you didn't answer your phone.
How could we not worry?

7
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,680
-Yeah.
-Jeez.

8
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,640
So who sent us
that video of you to mislead us?

9
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,280
Is that blood?

10
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Wee.

11
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,759
Great-Great-Grandfather!

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,800
Wait for me.

13
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,680
-Slow down.
-Great-Great-Grandfather!

14
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,560
-Wee!
-Wee.

15
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,400
Great-Great-Grandfather!

16
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,560
You shouldn't move him.

17
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,480
It's dangerous.

18
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,280
Hello?

19
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,640
Hospital, right?

20
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,880
Yes, someone's wounded.

21
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,880
Send an ambulance now.

22
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,760
Yes.

23
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Ms. Wad

24
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,160
Ms. Wad.

25
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,320
Wee!

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Stay with me, Wee.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,160
Wee, can you hear me?

28
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,560
Wee!

29
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,360
-Wee.
-Wee, open your eyes.

30
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,280
Wee.

31
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,120
-Wee.
-Wee.

32
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,480
-Wee.
-I'm sorry.

33
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,440
I have to cut off your clothes.

34
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,160
How is he?

35
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,520
Please give us some time.

36
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,120
We're examining his stab wounds

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,440
to see which internal organs are affected.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,920
Please excuse me.

39
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,160
Mr. San!

40
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,640
Mr. San.

41
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,560
Tao, what did you find?

42
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,000
I found their location.

43
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,440
Good.

44
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,400
Whoever touches my people,

45
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,040
I won't let them go.

46
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,160
Mr. Chen.

47
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,920
Don't forget your promise to me.

48
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,520
I won't.

49
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,360
Your debt is settled.

50
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,840
And I'll reward you with 20 million.

51
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,960
Good enough?

52
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,320
Great-Grandfather.

53
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,040
Still remember this ancestor of yours,

54
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,040
Suchat?

55
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,360
I suspected foul play

56
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,480
so I put a bug
and a GPS tracker on the box.

57
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,600
That stone is fake.

58
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,080
So is your doctor.

59
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,120
What do you mean?

60
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,680
Otherwise he would've known to perform
the ritual on the goddess' birthday.

61
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,200
Get him

62
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,880
and make him tell you
where he hides the stone.

63
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,040
Get him!

64
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,080
You should've known you couldn't fight me.

65
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,360
It won't help you
even if you get the real stone.

66
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,400
Great-Grandfather,

67
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,680
don't lie to me.

68
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,640
Tao says

69
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,640
the other half of the stone is tied to me.

70
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,800
I have to give it to you willingly

71
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,040
for the ritual to work.

72
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,080
What the hell!

73
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,640
Suchat,

74
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,640
I told you to befriend good people.

75
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,080
This one doesn't cut it.

76
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,240
He's wanted for many crimes.

77
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,720
I asked Tao to call the police.

78
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Use another exit.

79
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,120
NATIONAL POLICE DEPARTMENT

80
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,720
Freeze!

81
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,640
I said freeze!

82
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,320
Run over them!

83
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,640
Sergeant, look everywhere.

84
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,880
I can't believe Chat would go this far.

85
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,080
I knew he couldn't be trusted.

86
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,440
We're his family

87
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,920
-and he still betrayed us.
-Yeah.

88
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,120
Oh, Grandfather.

89
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,360
-Great-Great-Grandfather.
-Great-Grandfather.

90
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,760
How was it, Mr. San? Did we get them?

91
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,520
They won't mess with us again.

92
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,120
Leave the rest to the police.

93
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,840
How's Wee doing?

94
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,240
The doctor said his vital organs
were intact. He's fine.

95
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,720
He just woke up and fell back asleep.

96
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,200
Great-Great-Grandfather and Mom
went to see Wee early this morning.

97
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,680
He forgot his phone
and the battery ran out.

98
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,920
I came to tell Mr. San

99
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,080
about hiring someone to look for
a woman who shares Wee's date of birth.

100
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,480
I took care of it.

101
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,120
This one's a cop.
Very good at locating people.

102
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,760
I'm sure we'll find something.

103
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,240
What if they can't find one?

104
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,960
That means

105
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,320
Wee is really Ms. Wad.

106
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,640
No matter how much Mr. San hates Wee,

107
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,240
he'll have to accept it.

108
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,440
But I think

109
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,560
this thing between him and Wee

110
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,600
may not be as impossible as we think.

111
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,880
EMERGENCY

112
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,480
Wee?

113
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,480
How are you?

114
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,480
Does anything hurt?

115
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,760
Should I get a doctor?

116
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
No need.

117
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,400
The doctor checked on me this morning.

118
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,520
But my grandma doesn't know

119
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,960
about me being here, right?

120
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,080
I don't want her to know.

121
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,720
Don't worry.

122
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,840
I asked Chu to go visit your grandma today

123
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,560
and tell her you're tied up with work.

124
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,200
She'll never find out.

125
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,440
Thank you.

126
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,920
Hold on.

127
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,040
That's fine.

128
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,480
Want something to eat? I brought fruit.

129
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,040
I'm sorry.

130
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,240
About the stone.

131
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,360
Don't worry about that.

132
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,760
It's not stolen. I made sure of that.

133
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,960
It's me who should apologize

134
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,640
for putting you in danger.

135
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,520
Don't do that again.

136
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,200
Do what?

137
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,120
Fight them to protect the stone.

138
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,160
Ok.

139
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,160
Come on.

140
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,720
Eat.

141
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,120
Eat up so you heal faster.

142
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,520
Have some more.

143
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,840
Ow, it's hot.

144
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,120
Too hot.

145
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,800
Too hot.

146
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,280
Aww, feed me more.

147
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,440
More, please.

148
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,040
Please, please, please.

149
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,760
Stay still.

150
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,160
It's good.

151
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,280
Didn't know you were such a good cook.

152
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,000
I'll make more when you get home.

153
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,640
I'll make it for you every day.

154
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,240
I want Chinese food.

155
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,280
I want something like…

156
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,480
fish maw? That soft thingy.

157
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,080
Let Chu buy you some for now.

158
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,680
Don't do that again.

159
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,080
Do what?

160
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,960
Fight them to protect the stone.

161
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,800
Hey!

162
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,120
What the heck were you doing?

163
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,560
I wanted to see

164
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,880
how thick your skin really is.

165
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,200
You tried to steal the stone, but they
thought you tried to catch the thief.

166
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,440
Instead of fessing up,

167
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,800
you acted innocent like you knew nothing.

168
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,760
Quit reminding me.

169
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,320
I feel horrible.

170
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,280
But…

171
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,680
lately, San's been really nice to me,

172
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,040
so I…

173
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,440
Fell for him, didn't you?

174
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,240
See? I knew you were into him.

175
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,960
That's crazy!

176
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,800
Why would I fall for someone
who will never fall for me?

177
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,480
He's super straight.

178
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,560
San already has a woman
he's been waiting for.

179
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,400
He's been nice to me out of pity.

180
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
Really. I'm not into him.

181
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,040
Aren't you gonna ask me how I'm doing

182
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,200
or if I feel better?

183
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,080
No.

184
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,360
Wee,

185
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,000
is something wrong?
Why do you seem down today?

186
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,120
It's nothing.

187
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
I'm fine.

188
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,120
You're not warm.

189
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,440
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

190
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,880
It's ok. I can manage.

191
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
The doctor will check the wounds.

192
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,120
You took Wad from me!

193
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,920
San!

194
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,320
Third!

195
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,200
Wee?

196
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,200
It's really you.

197
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,640
I thought your name sounded familiar.

198
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,680
What about my usual doctor?

199
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,360
He went abroad to study. I got your case.

200
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,440
Wow.

201
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,480
Never thought I'd run into you here.

202
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,720
It's been ages since I last saw you.

203
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,000
Are you doing well?

204
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,280
I am.

205
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,200
So how are you feeling?

206
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,720
This doctor

207
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,280
is Wee's senior in high school?

208
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,200
What do you think?

209
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,600
I think he's…

210
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,520
quite handsome.

211
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,400
Tao, that's not what I was wondering.

212
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,760
He looks like Prince Trai,

213
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,080
Ms. Wad's ex-fiancé.

214
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,560
Is it possible for him
to be reborn as this doctor?

215
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,920
Wait a minute.

216
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,280
If this doctor is Ms. Wad's fiancé reborn

217
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,280
in the same exact face,

218
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,680
why was Wee who is Ms. Wad

219
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,880
born in a different face and gender?

220
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,720
So this means Wee isn't Ms. Wad,

221
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,040
right, Tao?

222
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,600
I don't know.

223
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,760
-Eh?
-Eh?

224
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,920
How can you not know? You're a doctor.

225
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,080
Eh? Must doctors know everything?

226
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,280
I know only about people involved with
the other half of the Five-Colored Stone.

227
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,800
Ms. Wad's fiancé

228
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,960
never touched the stone.

229
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,600
How am I supposed to know?

230
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
You took Wad from me!

231
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,320
San!

232
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,240
Ms. Wad.

233
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,520
Wee.

234
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,040
San.

235
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,240
Wee.

236
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,640
You're ok, right?

237
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,160
I'm ok.

238
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,880
Good.

239
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,880
Wee.

240
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,840
Wee.

241
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,440
Wee.

242
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,680
Wee. Wee?

243
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,720
Wee!

244
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,680
Wee.

245
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,840
Ah, I'm finally getting out of here.

246
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,760
I've been so bored.

247
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,320
It's good you're coming home.

248
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,480
Chu's asking for you every day.

249
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,960
Now she'll stop complaining.

250
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,840
But there's someone

251
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,600
who hasn't been complaining
but has missed Wee the most.

252
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,280
I'm gonna pay Third a visit.

253
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,000
Wait.

254
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,000
Why would you bother him?

255
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,240
He's a doctor.

256
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,200
He's busy.

257
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,280
You're right.

258
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,200
I'll call him and let him know later.

259
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,680
Wee.

260
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,280
From now on, stay away from that doctor.

261
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,160
Why?

262
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
He looks exactly like Prince Trai,
Ms. Wad's fiancé.

263
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,440
I suspect he might be Trai reborn.

264
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,960
Prince Trai caused Ms. Wad's death.

265
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,640
He's a bad guy.

266
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,560
But people can look similar.

267
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,760
As far as I know,

268
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,600
he's a very good guy.

269
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,720
He was great at school and basketball.

270
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,760
Everyone loved him.

271
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,400
Don't judge a book by its cover.

272
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,200
Trust me.
It's safer to stay away from him.

273
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,560
But…

274
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,960
Hello, Third?

275
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,240
Yes, I'm about to leave.

276
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,600
Chu.

277
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,160
Go pack everything so we can leave.

278
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,000
-Eh?
-Hurry.

279
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,400
Oh, Mr. San.

280
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,600
I'm on my way to see Wee.

281
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,280
No need.

282
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,160
I have to take him home now.

283
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,320
We have plans later.

284
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,560
Really?

285
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,560
That's fine.

286
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,360
I'll pay him a visit later.

287
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
Why would you do that?

288
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,680
Wee's healed, right?

289
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
Has Wee told you that

290
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,240
I was his senior in high school?

291
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,200
So what?

292
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,280
Just an old friend.

293
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,560
Mr. San,

294
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,560
did I do something to offend you?

295
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,920
Or have we met before?

296
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,000
I think you look familiar.

297
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,160
It doesn't matter if I look familiar.

298
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,040
But from now on

299
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,800
we won't deal with each other again.

300
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,440
We're home!

301
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,480
Xiong, Rat, hello.

302
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,680
Hello.

303
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,760
I'm so glad you came home to recover.

304
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,040
What do you want for dinner?

305
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,680
We'll celebrate your return
from the hospital. Yeah?

306
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,200
Anything is fine.

307
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,720
Your food's always good.

308
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,680
Sweet talker.

309
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,000
Make something healthy.

310
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,560
Wee,

311
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,640
did you ask your doctor
what food you should avoid?

312
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,600
No need to ask, Xiong.

313
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,800
You're healed.

314
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,960
Don't bother the doctor.

315
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,520
Mom, either way you should avoid grain.

316
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,280
Someone's acting like a dog in a manger.

317
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,120
Watch your mouth.

318
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,320
No one would think
you were mute if you kept quiet.

319
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
San!

320
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,800
Why are you out here?

321
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,720
Why aren't you resting?

322
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,920
I slept a lot already in the hospital.

323
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,960
Oh, San,

324
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,400
Doctor Tao said the stone those guys stole

325
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,560
was fake.

326
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,160
Where do you keep the real one?

327
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,040
You don't need to know.

328
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,760
That info would put you in danger.

329
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,200
Why?

330
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,160
Want another hospital stay?

331
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Next time I would get a discount

332
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,080
since I'm tight with one of the doctors.

333
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,560
Wee,

334
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,280
I mean it.

335
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,360
I'm certain he's Ms. Wad's fiancé reborn.

336
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,520
So what?

337
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,400
So what?

338
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,160
He caused Ms. Wad's death.

339
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,200
But you said yourself I wasn't Ms. Wad.

340
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,920
So why should I be afraid of him?

341
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,200
Hey, San,

342
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,240
I don't care who he was or what he did

343
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,920
in his last life.

344
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,160
The Third I know is a very good person.

345
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,960
He's always there for me.

346
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,160
He doesn't mind I'm poor

347
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,880
and never thinks ill of me.

348
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,040
Unlike me

349
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,520
who always looks down on you

350
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,840
and thinks ill of you.

351
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,040
Hey, San,

352
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,720
I never said that.

353
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,920
But you think it.

354
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,200
I'm mean

355
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,680
and rude.

356
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,800
I probably hurt you with my words.

357
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,360
I can't compete with that guy.

358
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,160
San!

359
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,200
Yes.

360
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,360
-So funny.
-Totally.

361
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,800
-Right?
-Yes.

362
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,040
How could I do that back then?

363
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,560
I have no idea.

364
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,600
Look at this. I still have no idea how.

365
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,480
Oh, remember my initiation?

366
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,520
-That dance.
-Like this, right?

367
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,280
It was more humiliating. I did it alone.

368
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,560
I did it alone.

369
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,760
There were so many people.

370
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,640
Jeez.

371
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,160
It's too funny.

372
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,880
I was dancing by myself.

373
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,000
How could I do that?

374
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,080
I think…

375
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,400
Chu.

376
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,160
Come here. Chu.

377
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,840
Chu, why did you let
a stranger into our house?

378
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,120
-A stranger?
-Yeah.

379
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,760
Stop.

380
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,560
I see.

381
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,280
Doctor Third?

382
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,520
He's Wee's friend.

383
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,920
Not a stranger.

384
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,040
Everyone knew. Did you know that?

385
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,040
-For real?
-Everyone knew.

386
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,080
-Dang, I thought I was subtle.
-You showed up at my house.

387
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,280
Is there something urgent?

388
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,920
Hello, Mr. San.

389
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,840
Well, I…

390
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,880
made plans with Wee.

391
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,560
Wee,

392
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,040
I thought we agreed on this.

393
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,040
San,

394
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,480
I'm just gonna attend an art exhibition.

395
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,080
Despite my warning?

396
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,240
Fine.

397
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,000
Remember I warned you.

398
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,480
If something bad happens,

399
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,920
I won't get involved.

400
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,920
Ok.

401
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,120
I'm gonna go.

402
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,920
Let's go, Third.

403
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,480
Eh?

404
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,720
-Let's go straight to the exhibition?
-Sure.

405
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,920
It's beautiful.

406
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,640
Yeah?

407
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,080
Wow, you two look exactly the same.

408
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,200
-You think?
-Yeah.

409
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,880
How about now?

410
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Can you copy better?

411
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,920
I can't.

412
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,280
If I had to draw these,

413
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,640
it would've taken me forever.

414
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,680
Wow.

415
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,400
Look at the lines.

416
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,320
Practice. I'm sure you can do it.

417
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,320
Wee, let me ask you something.

418
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,360
After you graduated high school,

419
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,800
why couldn't I contact you?

420
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,840
I called but you changed your number.

421
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,800
You must have heard the news.

422
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,440
About my arrest.

423
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,960
I was so worried about you.

424
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,560
It was humiliating.

425
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,280
I didn't wanna see anyone.

426
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,320
Actually…

427
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,960
it still is a little.

428
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,920
Actually

429
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,440
when you hit rock bottom

430
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,240
facing your biggest problem,

431
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,640
I should've been by your side.

432
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,760
Third,

433
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,920
it was me who didn't answer your calls.

434
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,640
And you were studying abroad then.

435
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,920
But I'm back now.

436
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,640
And I'll never leave you.

437
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,199
This guy. What a grumpy poser.

438
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,000
Who does he remind me of?

439
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,040
Third, give me a heads up so I could pose.

440
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,040
You can still do that.

441
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,520
Hey, you like dinosaurs?

442
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,719
I didn't know that.

443
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Look at them. What are they talking about?

444
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,240
They're so smiley.

445
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,360
It's their business
if they smile or frown.

446
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,560
I'm more confused

447
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,440
why you had to drag me along.

448
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,160
Can't you be here as my friend?

449
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,320
I'm your great-great-grandchild.

450
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,320
Hey.

451
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,200
Aren't you worried about Wee?

452
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,880
Don't forget that doctor

453
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,440
looks like Prince Trai.

454
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,120
He might be as horrible.

455
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,680
Great-Great-Grandfather.

456
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,920
-Wow.
-Look, these are animals.

457
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,000
Hey, is that a seal?

458
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,920
-Maybe a penguin.
-It's not.

459
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,040
A seal?

460
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,160
Hey.

461
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,240
How cute.

462
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,080
I'll take a photo of you with it. Smile.

463
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,720
How rude. Taking pictures
of other people's works.

464
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,760
Jeez, boomer.

465
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,080
Photos are allowed at these events.

466
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,640
Be in a photo with me.

467
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,560
Come on.

468
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,400
Did some picture fall?

469
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,360
No idea. It startled me.

470
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,400
-It startled me.
-Totally.

471
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,680
Jeez, Great-Great-Grandfather.

472
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,160
Why did you make a scene?
We're gonna get in trouble.

473
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,680
Look at them.

474
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,840
It was inappropriate,

475
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,120
hugging in a public place.

476
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,440
Goodness. Hey,

477
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,840
be honest with me.

478
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,760
You're jealous, aren't you?

479
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,960
I'm not.

480
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,320
I'm worried.

481
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,040
I'm hungry now.

482
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Let's find something to eat.

483
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,480
Hey! Come here.

484
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,200
If you're worried, stop stalking him.

485
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,720
We've been doing that all day
and we got nothing.

486
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,400
Eh?

487
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,200
What's wrong with him?

488
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,240
Stretching his neck like a giraffe.

489
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,600
Yeah, and he barely touched dinner.

490
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,280
Chu, what happened today?

491
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,800
Jeez, ignore him.

492
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,120
He's such a stubborn poser.
I hope he misses his chance.

493
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,000
San!

494
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,000
Eh?

495
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,360
Waiting for me?

496
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,320
No.

497
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,560
I was walking and reading.

498
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,760
FATE

499
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,640
It's upside down.

500
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Where have you been?

501
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,920
Dinner and a movie. Nothing special.

502
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,800
Oh, San.

503
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,360
There was some lunatic

504
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,160
making a scene at the exhibition.

505
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,720
If I find him, I'll kick his ass.

506
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,120
What do you say, Great-Great-Grandfather?

507
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,120
Should we help find
that lunatic and bring him to justice?

508
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,760
He probably didn't mean to do it.

509
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,880
Mind your own business.

510
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,440
It's still upside down.

511
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,320
DINOSAUR WITH VIVID COLORS

512
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,000
A grumpy poser.

513
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,840
You were upset I went with Third, right?

514
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,960
Why would I be?

515
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,480
Since you didn't listen to me,

516
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,800
I wouldn't meddle.

517
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,120
So why did you follow me?

518
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,360
Fine.

519
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,320
I followed you.

520
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,240
Well, I…

521
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,880
In case he hurt you,

522
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,400
I would save you in time.

523
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,040
You hate him

524
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,280
because he looks like Ms. Wad's fiancé.

525
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,960
San, I get that you love Ms. Wad deeply
so you hold a grudge against him,

526
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,960
but to me Third is a very good senior.

527
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,240
You sure he's just a senior?

528
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,840
You're a clever guy.

529
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,960
Don't tell me
you don't know he's into you.

530
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,280
What if he is?

531
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,440
Wee!

532
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,600
Don't you get it? He was Ms. Wad's fiancé.

533
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,640
He's a bad guy.

534
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,240
It's you who doesn't get it.

535
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,120
I don't care who he was.

536
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,240
You have no right to control me.

537
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,400
I don't like it!

538
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,040
Wee.

539
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,080
Damn it.

540
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,480
BAO GONG SHRINE

541
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,560
Mr. San!

542
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,520
I got something.

543
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,160
The investigator
we'd hired to look for Ms. Wad

544
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,840
said they'd made progress.

545
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,960
Is that so, Tao?

546
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,440
The piece of info Suchat gave us

547
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,960
about Ms. Wad's bloodline
was in Chiang Rai.

548
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,000
At first I thought
he made it up to fool us.

549
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,000
But turns out it's true.

550
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,240
So they're looking into it right now

551
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,680
to see if there's anyone
with Wee's date of birth.

552
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,800
I'll leave it to you, Tao.

553
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,680
Aren't you happy, Mr. San?

554
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,400
Huh?

555
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,600
We're about to find Ms. Wad

556
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,720
but why…

557
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,600
don't you look excited or happy at all?

558
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,000
You're acting strange.

559
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,000
I don't know either, Tao.

560
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,560
In the past 100 years,
my life goal has been very clear.

561
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,920
Now I feel like
I'm wandering in a foggy forest.

562
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,840
I can't tell dreams from reality.

563
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,280
Oh, Grandfather.

564
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,480
Here we go.

565
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,240
Chu, why are there only four seats?

566
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,520
Wee's not here.

567
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,560
Where is he?

568
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,040
Oh, the doctor picked him up.

569
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,640
He said there was
a reunion party at their high school.

570
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,640
I kept telling Wee not to go with him.

571
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,520
Grandfather. Grand… Grandfather.

572
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,360
I'm sorry, Wee.

573
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,000
I shouldn't have
brought you to the reunion.

574
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,960
It's ok.

575
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,600
I'm a felon.

576
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,280
Of course my classmates
wouldn't wanna talk to me.

577
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,480
That kind of party was
for successful people to reunite.

578
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,240
-I was wrong for showing up.
-Hey, Wee,

579
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,040
everyone's life is different.

580
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,960
If that comparison makes you unhappy,

581
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,320
you shouldn't make it.

582
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,160
I know, Third.

583
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,000
But I'm a little disappointed.

584
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,880
I thought it'd be fun
to see my old friends.

585
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,800
Oh, San.

586
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,920
Doctor,

587
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,840
we need to talk.

588
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,920
I'm gonna be very clear, Doctor.

589
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,920
I don't like you taking
someone in my care out like this.

590
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,960
Then I'm gonna be very clear, Mr. San.

591
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,200
I'm into Wee.

592
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,880
I have been since high school.

593
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,000
But I missed my chance by not telling him.

594
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,160
Now that we met again,

595
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,000
I won't let him go.

596
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,920
I understand

597
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,600
you're possessive over your brother.

598
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,840
But I'm serious about Wee.

599
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,640
Brother?

600
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,400
Did Wee say that?

601
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,240
Why?

602
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,520
Wee and I are married.

603
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,280
I'm his husband.

604
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,280
What are you talking about?

605
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,600
Here.

606
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,400
A photo of our wedding.

607
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,440
I hope someone like you
knows right from wrong.

608
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,160
Leave Wee alone.

609
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,800
It's just a group photo at a shrine.

610
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,160
Nothing indicates a wedding.

611
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,840
Look here.

612
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,200
If that's true, why did Wee lie to me?

613
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,720
There's something fishy here.

614
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,640
Or maybe you forced him.

615
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,840
I can tell someone like you
enjoys controlling others.

616
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,000
Wee can't be happy.

617
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,040
-Bring it on.
-Hey!

618
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,600
Third, leave for now.

619
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,840
I'm begging you. Leave for now.

620
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,640
San,

621
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,880
I know you don't like him.

622
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,320
But must you go that far?

623
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,640
I should be the one asking.

624
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,840
Why did you lie to him I was your brother

625
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,560
when we're actually married?

626
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,480
I thought you'd be embarrassed.

627
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,280
You said yourself
you didn't like the idea.

628
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,120
And we only married to undo bad luck.

629
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,440
The reason doesn't matter.
We're still married.

630
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,160
You can't date anyone else.

631
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,960
You're controlling me again.

632
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,880
You just hate him

633
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,120
and take it out on me.

634
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,640
If that was it,
would I be going out of my mind?

635
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,240
You feel possessive over me?

636
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,720
Is that so wrong?

637
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,280
Please don't do this

638
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,680
if you don't want me.

639
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,480
Don't you know what I want?

640
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,880
Then say it.

641
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,520
I don't like guessing.

642
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,080
Must be fireworks at my school.

643
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,320
Beautiful, right?

644
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,640
Hey, Chu, Wee and Great-Grandfather
are over there!

645
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,600
-Let's go.
-Hold on, Mom.

646
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,880
Huh?

647
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,440
It's best if we let them be.

648
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,400
Even without the stone,

649
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,520
I'm still not the one he's waiting for.

650
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,080
So you married to undo bad luck.

651
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,560
Then I have a chance, right?

652
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,240
Doctor, don't you get it?

653
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,240
-Are you a dog in the manger?
-Get out of my and Wee's lives.

654
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,760
How do you really feel about Wee?

655
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,240
Hello, ma'am.

656
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,320
You look just like my friend.

657
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,840
