20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,200
Mr. Chong Yang,

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,000
this is a gift for you and Miss Nanxing.

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,120
Xici, what do you really want?

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,080
Sir,

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,560
I'm just here to bring a wedding gift.

25
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,760
You seem a bit on edge.

26
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,640
Miss Nanxing.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,560
I was thinking of buying

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,680
more flowers from you.

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,600
Any chance you're free lately?

30
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,860
She quits selling flowers.

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,360
That's really

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,240
such a shame.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
Nanxing,

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,040
Mr. Meng and I have things to discuss.

35
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,790
Please leave us alone.

36
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,160
Okay.

37
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,480
Xici,

38
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,840
I've watched you grow up.

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,600
After all these years together,

40
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,400
I wish you could stay
like you were as a kid,

41
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,840
pure and kind.

42
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,840
Seeing Miss Nanxing and you so close,

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,720
I'm happy for you.

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,550
I'll head out now.

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,080
Xici,

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,960
the Meng family and I go back centuries.

47
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,000
I hope that won't change with you.

48
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
What did you talk about?

49
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,480
It was nothing.

50
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,600
What's wrong?

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,960
If something's up, please tell me,

52
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,910
alright?

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,120
Don't keep it bottled up.

54
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,040
What's this?

55
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,240
It's nothing.

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,640
Xici gave it to me.

57
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,160
Nanxing,

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,040
you have to stay
at Ye Mansion for now.

59
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Don't go anywhere else.

60
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Okay.

61
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,320
Since you don't want to talk now,

62
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,920
I won't ask anything.

63
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,880
I'll follow your lead.

64
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,400
(Chong Yang has been)

65
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,800
(sleeping more lately.)

66
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,880
Miss Nanxing.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,840
Yingying.

68
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,880
What's the matter?

69
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,920
I need your help with something.

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,920
Nanxing.

71
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,720
Nanxing.

72
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,520
Yingying,

73
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,480
you asked me to accompany you
to Mr. Meng,

74
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,800
but it looks like he's not home.

75
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,960
How about we wait for him at the clinic?

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,840
Ji Nanxing,

77
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,360
you made it all the way here.

78
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,360
Do you think you can just leave?

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,400
Yingying, what do you mean by that?

80
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,280
Why are you even here?

81
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,520
Why did you take Yang from me?

82
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,560
If it weren't for you,

83
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,400
Changsheng would've never left.

84
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,560
And Yang would still talk to me.

85
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,720
I wouldn't be like this now.

86
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,360
Yingying.

87
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,050
But what does this have to do
with the Meng family?

88
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,880
- What are you doing? Let go!
- Don't move.

89
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,520
Miss Yingying.

90
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,440
Miss Yingying.

91
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,350
You really keep your word.

92
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,120
Mr. Meng,

93
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,370
what's going on here?

94
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,600
You two...

95
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,320
Let go.

96
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,280
Let me go!

97
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,200
Miss Nanxing,

98
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,760
sorry about this.

99
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,760
If you want the antidote

100
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,040
and your face back,

101
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,470
bring Ji Nanxing to me.

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,160
Don't let Chong Yang find out.

103
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,120
Why?

104
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,160
Do you have issues with Ji Nanxing?

105
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,920
Ms. Zhu, you don't need to
know everything.

106
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,040
All you need to know is
I can help you.

107
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,880
That's enough.

108
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
Meng Xici,

109
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,800
I didn't expect this from you.

110
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,160
What are you two plotting anyway?

111
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,960
You'll find out soon.

112
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,160
Where's the antidote?

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,680
Where is it, Meng Xici?

114
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,200
There is no antidote.

115
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,200
I lied to you.

116
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,160
How could it be?

117
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,200
You tricked me.

118
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,360
You lied to me.

119
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,480
You lied to me!

120
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,720
You owe me!

121
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,480
You owe me!

122
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,360
Meng Xici, you jerk!

123
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,080
Stop acting crazy here.

124
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,160
Get lost.

125
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,960
Meng Xici.

126
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm telling Yang everything.

127
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,760
I'll have him deal with you.

128
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,360
Yingying!

129
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,200
Meng Xici, you're out of your mind!

130
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,480
Yang.

131
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,520
Yang.

132
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
I want to go home.

133
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,160
Yang.

134
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,200
Yingying.

135
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,000
Stop shouting.

136
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,600
She's gone.

137
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,920
Wasn't Chong Yang your friend?

138
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,520
Why would you do this?

139
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,760
Be quiet.

140
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,560
If you weren't useful,

141
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,720
I wouldn't have kept you till now.

142
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,720
I've always wanted Chong Yang to feel

143
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,600
what it's like to lose someone you love.

144
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,760
Nanxing.

145
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,400
Nanxing.

146
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,800
Ling, you'll wake up any minute now.

147
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,400
She's your wife.

148
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,800
She isn't gone.

149
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,800
It's been three years.

150
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,440
She'll wake up very soon.

151
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,440
You're insane.

152
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,400
What are you planning to do to me?

153
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,120
I tested medicine on girls for Hualing

154
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,640
until I finally found

155
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,480
this special golden gu.

156
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,640
You raised the gu in girls' bodies.

157
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,960
So those missing girls
looking for the Love Flower...

158
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,920
It was you.

159
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,800
Yes.

160
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,240
The Love Flower legend isn't real.

161
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,680
They were attacked by gu in the garden,

162
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,360
and you took them away.

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,840
Am I correct?

164
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,160
There's no point hiding it now.

165
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,720
You got it right.

166
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,000
You want to use me to raise gu too.

167
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,460
It's already done.

168
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,080
I've tried so many ways.

169
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,200
Nothing worked until I found you.

170
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,960
You're the Yan Maiden.

171
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,760
Now I see only your body

172
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,200
can nurture the golden gu.

173
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,960
Ling will wake up very soon.
