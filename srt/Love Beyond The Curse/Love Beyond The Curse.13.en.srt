Don't be scared.

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,640
I'll keep you safe.

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,280
Why did you bring me here?

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,600
Look.

25
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,040
It's beautiful.

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,720
Whenever I feel alone,

27
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,520
I come here to see the city lights.

Those lights from afar

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,920
seem to have nothing to do with me.

30
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,120
So many years have passed,

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,440
but I'm still on my own.

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,360
What about Changsheng and Yingying?

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,200
To me,

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
they're still just kids.

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
I'm just their older brother.

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,360
It's okay.

37
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,150
As long as I'm here,

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,680
I'll stay by your side.

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,080
Unless...

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,000
you don't like me anymore.

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
That day will never come.

42
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,600
I'm just worried

43
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,980
I'm not able to stay with you that long.

44
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,960
I should be the one saying that.

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,440
Let's make a promise then.

46
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,460
As long as I'm alive,

47
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,500
I'll always be by your side.

48
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,440
Pinky swear.

49
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,240
Deal.

50
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,240
It's a promise now.

51
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,190
No backing out anymore.

52
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,860
My lord,

53
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,260
Mr. Chong Yang is on Ji Nanxing's boat.

54
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,460
They're watching fireworks together.

55
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,500
Watching fireworks?

56
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,300
It's been ages since I saw fireworks.

57
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,580
Let's go outside.

58
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,780
Alright.

59
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,620
All done now.

60
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,900
Yeah.

61
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,420
Leave those trivial things
to the servants.

62
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,660
No, I can't.

63
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,500
I want to handle these herbs myself.

64
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,460
I can't trust others.

65
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,500
I just don't want you working so hard.

66
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,340
I want you to take a break.

67
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,140
You care more about patients,

68
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,740
sometimes even more than me.

69
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,260
That's not true.

70
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,780
You and the patients can't be compared.

71
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,620
If everyone

72
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,900
could heal and live a long life

73
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,660
like Chong Yang

74
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,460
and Changsheng, wouldn't that be great?

75
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,540
But maybe that's not good.

76
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,380
They can only live in darkness.

77
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,700
Ling, if you could choose,

78
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,780
would you want to be a member of them?

79
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,820
No, I wouldn't.

80
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,100
They're way too lonely.

81
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,060
Sometimes, Chong Yang looks like

82
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,380
so distant and cold,

83
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,900
but I know he's scared

84
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,380
to get close to people deep down,

85
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,780
because once he cares, he can't let go.

86
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,580
He has to watch the ones he loves,

87
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,660
family or anyone, leave him behind,

88
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,900
and he's left carrying that pain forever.

89
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,260
You always worry about him,

90
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,380
but do you ever care about me?

91
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,060
He's my friend, that's all.

92
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,660
Friends look out for each other, right?

93
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,060
Just kidding.

94
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,780
You're right,

95
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,980
honestly, living so long isn't much.

96
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,380
Being with someone you love

97
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,580
matters most,

98
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,820
so whether you want to help people,

99
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,020
or do anything else,

100
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,060
I'll always support you.

101
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,780
But can you stop working so hard?

102
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,980
I'm not tired at all.

103
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,780
I've wanted to be a doctor,

104
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,100
just so I could help people.

105
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,140
Seeing them recover their health

106
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,980
with my help

107
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,660
and go back to enjoying their lives

108
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,500
with their families,

109
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,940
makes me happier than anything else.

110
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,500
Can't you spend more time
with your family too?

111
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,460
Don't make your family
wait alone at home.

112
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,660
What are you talking about?

113
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,500
Who's waiting alone at home?

114
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,900
Chong Yang,

115
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,340
why do you get to

116
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,060
live a good life in this world?

117
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,540
Why do you get to be happy?

118
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,580
I want you to know

119
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,020
what it feels like to
lose someone you love.

120
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,700
You should stay at Ye Mansion for now.

121
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,780
The boat isn't safe.

122
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,540
You don't want the wrong people
bothering you.

123
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,940
The wrong people?

124
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,860
Are you talking about Xici?

125
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,780
Just stay away from him.

126
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,660
Are you jealous?

127
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,460
Come on, say it.

128
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,780
Say it, just admit it.

129
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,300
Yeah.

130
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,540
I'm jealous.

131
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,660
What's this?

132
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,300
It's my luggage.

133
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,780
Changsheng,

134
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,100
I'm officially moving in now.

135
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,780
Who gave you the permission?

136
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,300
And stop calling me by my name.

137
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,740
Alright, alright.

138
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,300
I won't call you that anymore.

139
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,180
Just remember, I'm your sister-in-law.

140
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,380
Yang.

141
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,340
She's right.

142
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,020
You two should try to get along.

143
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,580
Yang, are you hiding something from me?

144
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,820
How could you let her

145
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,260
move into our place?

146
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,940
I like her.

147
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
If not here, where else would she go?

148
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,020
Yang.

149
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,540
That's enough.

150
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,260
Where's Yingying?

151
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,100
Yingying...

152
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,300
She's been hiding in her room lately.

153
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,300
I don't know what she's up to.

154
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,980
It's been ages since we saw Yingying.

155
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,300
It's fine.

156
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,300
Changsheng, why don't you check on her?

157
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,700
Me?

158
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,660
Go ahead.

159
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,660

00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,300
So, given the situation,

163
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,780
should I sleep on the bed,

164
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,060
or should I take the sofa?

165
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,060
You take the bed.

166
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,860
Me? On the bed?

167
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,060
That doesn't seem right.

168
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,860
