20
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,860
I thought

21
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,260
that Yang hired a new maid.

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,820
It turns out it's you.

23
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,020
Yeah, it's me.

24
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,340
I'm the maid,

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,460
Yang's personal maid.

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,260
How can you be so shameless?

27
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,420
Shameless?

28
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,140
What's that?

29
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,580
Tell me about it.

30
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,990
It smells great, Yingying.

31
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,020
Did you cook anything?

32
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,540
Why are you here?

33
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,660
Don't tell me you think
this is your home.

34
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,100
Here?

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,140
Isn't it?

36
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,940
Who said you could treat it as home?

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,420
Get out.

38
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,980
You're not welcome here.

39
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,580
I don't need your welcome.

40
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,780
As long as Yang wants me here.

41
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,380
Besides,

42
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,660
I didn't cook for you guys anyway.

43
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,780
You...

44
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,220
Take your stuff with you

45
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,660
and get out of here.

46
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,020
I'm not leaving.

47
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,940
I've been working all morning.

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,580
Why are you so hostile to me?

49
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,420
Anyway,

50
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,540
from now on,

51
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,540
we have to live under one roof.

52
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,540
We should learn to get along.

53
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,620
Who said you could live with us?

54
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,420
There isn't even a room for you.

55
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,100
It's fine,

56
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,180
I don't mind.

57
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,060
I'll just stay with Chong Yang.

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,140
Alright, let's all calm down.

59
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,220
Come on, try these.

60
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,700
I spent all morning making these.

61
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,660
Who even wants it?

62
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,260
Who knows if you spiked it?

63
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,860
You caught me.

64
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,060
So,

65
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,620
if I really did add something,

66
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,390
would you still drink it?

67
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,180
Why not?

68
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,540
I'm not scared of it.

69
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,380
Go on, have a sip.

70
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,660
Wow, it's sweet.

71
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,980
What is this?

72
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,460
It's brown sugar water.

73
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,220
Just brown sugar?

74
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,980
Not alcohol.

75
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,140
Ms. Zhu,

76
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,060
do you want some brown sugar water too?

77
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,140
Ji Nanxing!

78
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,300
(Lately, my body feels weaker.)

79
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,260
(And I notice danger less and less.)

80
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,260
(Even when dealing with the gu parasite,)

81
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,900
(I started to feel worn out.)

82
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,980
(Looks like my time)

83
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,300
(is almost up.)

84
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,340
Are you here for some peace?

85
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,620
I actually came to cook for you.

86
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,500
Did Changsheng and Yingying upset you?

87
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,620
It's nothing, really.

88
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,460
Honestly, days like this,

89
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,330
with the lively vibe, feel pretty nice.

90
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Back then, it was just me and a boat.

91
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,290
I traveled all across the country.

92
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
There were many beautiful places
along the way.

93
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,300
But I had no one to talk to.

94
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,460
Now, it's different,

95
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,180
I have you and them with me.

96
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,580
I don't feel alone anymore.

97
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,500
So...

98
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,020
So, for the rest of my life...

99
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,100
And?

100
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,260
I'll stick by your side forever.

101
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,020

I used to think what drew the gu

123
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,300
was the field bindweed scent
on Ji Nanxing,

124
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,980
but now it seems

125
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,180
it's not the field bindweed,

126
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,700
but Ji Nanxing herself.

127
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,580
Then, let's bring Ji Nanxing in right now.

128
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,900
She might be

129
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,260
the Yan Maiden you're seeking.

130
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,420
It's not that simple.

131
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,980
She's pretty close to Chong Yang.

132
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,140
Chong Yang won't say it out loud,

133
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,140
but he treats Ji Nanxing differently.

134
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,620
If we take Ji Nanxing now,

135
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,790
we'll just bring trouble on ourselves.

136
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,420
My lord, you're wise.

137
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,180
Since Chong Yang values Ji Nanxing,

138
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,180
maybe we can put this woman to use.

139
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,420
Yes.

140
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,140
I'll take my leave.

141
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,460
Ji Nanxing,

142
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,540
are you really a Yan Maiden?

143
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,020
Only Yan Maidens
can attract gu parasites.

144
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,060
I always thought it was just a legend.

145
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,260
No one has seen them
for thousands of years.

146
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,980
Hualing,

147
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,580
there's hope.

148
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,180
It's your wishful thinking.

149
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,740
I just asked you to grow flowers.

150
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,220
You mean nothing to me,

151
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,020
why talk about forever?

152
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,500
Guess it was all just wishful thinking.

153
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,860
I thought after what we've been through,

154
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,340
even a stone would have cracked open.

155
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,900
Ji Nanxing.

156
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,380
Why are you here?

157
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,220
Do you actually live here?

158
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,140
Yeah.

159
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,060
Ms. Zhu,

160
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,200
are you here to buy flowers?

161
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,780
Ji Nanxing,

162
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,300
you're out here alone with your boat,

163
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,220
sailing from place to place.

164
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,620
That can't be easy on you.

165
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,500
Why are you suddenly so concerned about me?

166
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,100
I don't care about you.

167
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,860
I just think I finally get

168
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,980
why you always cling to Yang.

169
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,580
Then tell me, Ms. Zhu,

170
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,660
why am I always around him?

171
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,220
You could sell flowers your whole life,

172
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,540
but you'd never make enough money.

173
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,540
You're just interested in

174
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,460
Yang's Ye Mansion

175
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,020
and all the wealth he owns,

176
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,340
right?

177
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,500
Ms. Zhu,

178
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,020
you're really clever.

179
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,780
But even if Yang is rich,

180
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,180
how much will he really give you?

181
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,340
This sum could buy you a hundred boats.

182
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,260
Is it a gift for me?

183
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,660
It's not for free, of course.

184
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,460
Leave Nan'an City

185
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,140
and don't ever bother Yang again.

186
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,060
Ms. Zhu,

187
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,540
I think you make a lot of sense.

188
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,060
But a hundred boats aren't my goal.

189
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,260
I'm after a thousand.

190
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,460
Maybe even ten thousand one day.

191
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,620
Can you

192
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,780
give me that much?

193
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,300
Ji Nanxing,

194
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,340
why are you so greedy?

195
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,460
Honestly,

196
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,020
who isn't a little greedy?

197
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,620
Besides,

198
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,860
if I end up with Yang,

199
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,020
I can have as many boats as I want.

200
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,860
Why would I care about your money?

201
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,020
You...

202
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,220
Do you really think

203
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,180
Yang likes you?

204
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,500
What if he gets bored

205
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,540
and dumps you?

206
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,420
You might end up with nothing at all.

207
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,860
So you better hope he moves on fast,

208
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,380
otherwise,

209
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,380
are you planning to be upset forever?

210
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,100
Ji Nanxing,

211
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,500
I'll ask you one last time.

212
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,100
Are you leaving Nan'an City or not?

213
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,500
I'm not leaving.

214
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,700
Nan'an City isn't your place.

215
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,620
You can't tell me to go.

216
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,580
Even if Yang wants me gone, I won't.

217
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,300
I'll stay as long as I want.

218
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,460
