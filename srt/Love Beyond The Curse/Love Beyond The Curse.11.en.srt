64
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,020
The deeper you love,

65
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,100
the closer you get to death.

66
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,700
I used to think

67
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,140
that this endless life we have

68
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,980
was a punishment from above.

69
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,900
But looking at it now,

70
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,780
the Yongye people's punishment

71
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,380
goes far beyond just this.

72
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,220
You have the powers

73
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,380
that ordinary people
can't even dream of.

74
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,580
Life. Youth.

75
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,540
So,

76
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,700
there should be a price to pay.

77
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,140
It's natural.

78
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,020
But now,

79
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,740
I don't know why

80
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,140
my strength is slowly fading.

81
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,300
The abilities I have

82
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,940
seem to be fading away too.

83
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,660
The closer you are to death,

84
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,180
the more your body becomes
like the ordinary.

85
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,660
In the end, even sunlight won't scare you.

86
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,220
So do you think that's good or bad?

87
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,060
(I'll make sure you live on,)

88
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,940
(but I can't let you fall for me)

89
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,740
(because)

90
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
(I can't stay with you forever.)

91
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,900
(Turns out, it was just
my wishful thinking.)

92
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,460
Miss Nanxing.

93
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,300
Mr. Meng.

94
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,060
Please, come in.

95
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,620
Mr. Meng, what brings you here?

96
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,630
I had some errands to run.

97
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,650
I heard your greenhouse is nearby,

98
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,770
so I thought I'd drop by.

99
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,660
Oh, right, Mr. Meng,

100
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,700
your Wanting Lotus is ready now.

101
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,980
It'll be delivered to your place later.

102
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,340
No rush. I was just passing by
to take a look.

103
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,620
Your greenhouse is beautiful.

104
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,460
I rely on this to support myself.

105
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,860
Besides, I enjoy flowers.

106
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,620
Mr. Meng.

107
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,020
Have some tea.

108
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,060
Sure.

109
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,100
Sorry, Mr. Meng.

110
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,180
There are lots of plants in here,

111
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,120
so there are also a few bugs around.

112
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,660
It's no problem.

113
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,300
Mr. Meng, I don't have good tea here.

114
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,180
Here you are.

115
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,700
You're too polite.

116
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,900
Miss Nanxing,
have you always lived alone?

117
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,810
Your parents aren't around.

118
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,850
They passed away when I was young.

119
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,580
I'm the only one left in my family.

120
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,380
What happened to your family?

121
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,620
When I was ten,

122
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,780
something happened to my family.

123
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,700
My parents tried to save me

124
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,540
and both of them passed away.

125
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,060
This...

126
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,740
You went through so much as a child.

127
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,260
It's honestly heartbreaking.

128
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,300
That's why I have to live my life well.

129
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,380
My parents gave me a second chance.

130
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,420
I need to make the most of it.

131
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,820
You work so hard on your own,

132
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,820
and is always moving.

133
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,340
It takes a lot of strength.

134
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,820
If you ever need anything,

135
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,660
you can always reach out to me.

136
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,760
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

139
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,940
You should give it a try.

140
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,430
Mr. Meng,

141
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,420
I really can't accept this for nothing.

142
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,820
You're being way too generous.

143
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,860
It's no trouble.

144
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,060
Just take it, miss.

145
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,380
