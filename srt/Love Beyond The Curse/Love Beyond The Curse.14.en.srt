20
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,460
Ms. Zhu,

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,780
why did you call me here in such a rush?

22
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,300
What is this stuff?

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,020
Xici, what did you make me use?

24
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,140
It's just a bottle of snow cream.

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,580
That's not true.

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,990
You did this on purpose.

27
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,220
Look at my face.

28
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,380
How did it end up like this?

29
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,780
Ms. Zhu, your face is ruined.

30
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,340
How can you still be a movie star?

31
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,300
Meng Xici!

32
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,620
You meant to do this.

33
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,660
You totally meant it.

34
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,900
Why did you hurt me?

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,460
You blame me just for some snow cream?

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,300
I'm not admitting to that.

37
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,140
You still deny it?

38
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,860
I'm going to find Yang right now.

39
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,940
He won't let you off.

40
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,780
Zhu Yingying.

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,940
Do you think Chong Yang

42
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,300
still cares about you now?

43
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,420
What do you mean?

44
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,820
From what I see,

45
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,020
his mind these days

46
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,260
is all on Miss Nanxing.

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,260
That's not true.

48
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,660
Who does Ji Nanxing even think she is?

49
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,260
He's into me,

50
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,540
only me!

51
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,140
Ms. Zhu,

52
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,660
please, calm down.

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,080
Whatever,

54
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,140
you need to solve this.

55
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,460
You better fix my face!

56
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,780
Ms. Zhu, I'm a doctor.

57
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,300
Of course, I can heal your face.

58
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,140
Plus,

59
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,260
I can make Chong Yang

60
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,260
care about you again.

61
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,820
You...

62
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,420
Got any ideas?

63
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,340
The old snow cream did have some issues.

64
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,820
Use this instead,

65
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,700
and your face will clear up in 3 days.

66
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,420
How do I know you won't lie again?

67
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,180
Right now, trusting me

68
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,460
is really your only option.

69
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,740
Miss Zhu,

70
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,180
if you want the antidote,

71
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,540
you'll have to pay a price.

72
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,820
Move these flowers to Ye Mansion,

73
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,620
then you won't need to come daily.

74
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,380
No way.

75
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,860
They just got used to the soil here.

76
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,620
Moving them will hurt their growth.

77
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,340
You never said you'd help me.

78
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,620
I don't even know how.

79
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,900
What's wrong?

80
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,180
Are you alright?

81
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,140
I'm fine.

82
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,100
Let me check.

83
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,100
You're bleeding.

84
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,900
Does it hurt?

85
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,500
It doesn't.

86
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,740
Really?

87
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,380
I'm okay.

88
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,900
I've been alone for years.

89
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,620
I've gotten hurt so many times.

90
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,140
I'm used to it now.

91
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,260
But things have changed.

92
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,140
I have you with me.

93
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,220
I'm afraid of nothing.

94
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,300
Don't worry.

95
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,380
I'm here for you.

96
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,940
I won't let you get hurt again.

97
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,380
Oh, right,

98
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,700
we haven't seen the Noctrose in ages.

99
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,380
I wonder if it's blooming now.

100
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,540
Great, another petal has bloomed.

101
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,860
There are four petals now.

102
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,700
Looks like

103
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,660
I'll need to feed it my blood more often.

104
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,740
Nanxing,

105
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,100
you don't need to use your blood anymore.

106
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,900
Why not?

107
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,260
Weren't you hoping it would bloom?

108
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,740
But you mean more to me

109
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,380
than the flower.

110
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,700
Hey, look over there.

111
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
It's snowing.

112
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,260
The snow looks beautiful!

113
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,060
It's really stunning!

114
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,100
You're smiling.

115
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,700
I saw you smile this time.

116
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,540
Your smile is amazing.

117
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,100
Yeah, I did.

118
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,700
And another thing,

119
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,900
stop wearing only dark clothes.

120
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,060
They're too dull.

121
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,820
Try lighter colors next time.

122
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,220
Starting to boss me around?

123
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,180
You don't like me caring about you?

124
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,740
I do like it.

125
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,380
Hey, when did the snow stop?

126
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,420
You young folk,

127
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,620
take it easy.

128
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,460
I've noticed,

129
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,580
my strength fades faster these days.

130
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,460
I can't even break this stone now.

131
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,900
Chong Yang,
is your Noctrose blooming soon?

132
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,780
Yeah, almost.

133
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,380
See?

134
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,300
Even my healing

135
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,620
is slowing down.

136
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,620
You Yongye people,

137
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,180
your dying takes ages.

138
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,340
I never used to fear death.

139
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,900
I even looked forward to it,

140
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,700
but now...

141
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,380
It feels different.

142
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,860
Is it too much?

143
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,780
You don't like it?

144
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,700
No, that's not it.

145
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,780
I just think...

146
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,660
I get it.

147
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,340
Do you feel like

148
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,780
I'm overstepping a bit?

149
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,540
I moved in with you

150
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,980
and changed your place to my style.

151
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,860
I went too far.

152
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,740
You're being so dramatic.

153
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,820
Well,

154
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,940
about your clothes,

155
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,580
can I change your outfit?

156
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,140
Right now?

157
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,820
You're getting bold these days.

158
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,620
I'm getting hungry.

159
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,140
