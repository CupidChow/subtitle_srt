00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,220
your brother raised you by himself

134
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,540
all these years.

135
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,900

Come on, let's have a drink.

146
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,820

147

152
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,740

153
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,860
With that grumpy face of his

154
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,140
and that sharp tongue...

155
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,860
Well, he did save me once,

156
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,540
but I helped him with his plants too.

157
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,380
Right?

158
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,820
So we're just helping each other out.

159
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,220
Why does he
always act like that towards me?

160
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,940
Hey, I'm talking to you.

161
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,940
You're not much of a drinker.

Plants?

163
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,020
Honestly,

164
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,820
you really do look like your brother.

165
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,300
Tell me.

166
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,100

Why?

168
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,500

save that useless flower

169
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,860
before you agree to marry me?

170
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,100
Let me tell you,

171
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,580
if you keep treating me,

172
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,220
I might just give up on everything.

173
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,900
I'm not staying here, putting up with

174
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,900
all this hurt.

175
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,780
Why are you here?

176
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,180
I just had some drinks with your brother.

177
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,500
What's there to be upset about?

178
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,740
And didn't you say...

179
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,580
This morning, you said

180
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,420
that you lied about liking me.

181
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,850
It's all a lie.

182
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,740
Since you don't like me,

183
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,420
who I drink with
is none of your business.

184
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,740
I'm leaving.

185
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,180
Fine, go ahead and leave.

186
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,260
Playing tough, huh?

187
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,260
Yeah.

188
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,700
You don't like me anyway.

189
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,700
So I'll just get out of your way.

190
