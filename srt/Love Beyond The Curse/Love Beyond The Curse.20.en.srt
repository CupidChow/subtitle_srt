20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,260
You want to use me to raise gu too.

21
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,300
It's already done.

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,900
I've tried so many ways.

23
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,140
Nothing worked until I found you.

24
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,780
You're the Yan Maiden.

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,540
Now I see only your body

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,020
can nurture the golden gu.

27
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,580
With this gu, I can fight poison.

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,140
It might bring Ling back.

29
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,180
Ling could wake up any minute now.

30
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,300
But...

31
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,540
You... when did you

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,060
put the gu on me?

33
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,900
(Yes! It's working.)

34
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,420
(Ling's about to wake up.)

35
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,980
(Eggs.)

36
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,380
(Gu parasite.)

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,990
(Meng Xici is from the Miao Region.)

38
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,140
(Meng Xici.)

39
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,980
How did she end up like this?

40
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,420
Three years ago...

41
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,780
The herbs are growing great.

42
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,860
Take a sniff.

43
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,940
Ling, are you okay?

44
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,460
Have some water.

45
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,780
Upset stomach?

46
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,300
Xici, you're going to be a dad.

47
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,340
You're going to be a dad!

48
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,380
Really?

49
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,300
I... I'm going to be a dad.

50
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,100
I...

51
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,820
I'm going to be a dad!

52
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,100
I'm going to be a dad!

53
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,660
Mr. Chong Yang.

54
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,100
Please, save Hualing.

55
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,740
Please, save Hualing.

56
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,580
I can't save her.

57
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,580
Xici,

58
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,820
here's my advice.

59
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,020
Some things just can't be forced.

60
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,100
She's my wife. I have to try.

61
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,020
Mr. Chong Yang,

62
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,940
the Mengs have served you for years.

63
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,460
We just ask one thing from you,

64
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,300
please save Hualing.

65
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,260
I'm begging you.

66
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,620
Xici,

67
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,380
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

68
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,660
Mr. Chong Yang.

69
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,460
Don't go, Mr. Chong Yang!

70
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,980
When Hualing was pregnant,

71
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,660
she still helped the poor with checkups,

72
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,460
but something went wrong by accident.

73
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,460
Chong Yang just stood by
and did nothing.

74
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,420
I felt completely empty inside.

75
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,140
From that moment on,

76
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,180
my only goal was to wake Ling up

77
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,940
and get revenge on Chong Yang.

78
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,820
Why do you think

79
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,700
Chong Yang can save your wife?

80
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,300
It's recorded

81
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,980
that the Yongye people can do anything.

82
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,900
But Chong Yang refused to help me.

83
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,860
My Meng family served him for years.

84
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,220
All I wanted for him
was to save my wife.

85
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,580
But he still said no.

86
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,780
Chong Yang must have his own reasons.

87
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,820
Yongye people aren't

88
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,940
- all-powerful.
- Enough.

89
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,060
Stop making excuses.

90
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,780
It doesn't matter anymore.

91
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,700
With the golden gu,

92
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,900
Ling will wake up soon.

93
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,660
Hualing is a doctor,

94
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,140
from her family tradition.

95
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,740
Yet for her sake,

96
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,700
you've cost so many innocent lives.

97
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,540
If Hualing wakes up,

98
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,620
will she even accept who you are now?

99
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,900
Shut up.

100
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,980
Ling.

101
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,780
Ling, you're awake.

102
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,780
Ling.

103
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
I've waited for this day

104
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,100
for three whole years.

105
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,020
You finally woke up, Ling.

106
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,460
Ling, are you still adjusting?

107
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,220
It's okay, Ling.

108
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,660
You'll get used to it soon.

109
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,340
I'll stay by your side.

110
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,860
Don't worry, I'm here.

111
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,900
Ling.

112
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,740
Ling!

113
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,700
Ling!

114
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,220
Ling.

115
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,260
Ling.

116
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,060
Ling, wake up. Ling!

117
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,980
Please stay with me, Ling.

118
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,140
Wake up.

119
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,420
Ling.

120
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,660
Ling, please don't go. Ling.

121
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,100
Ling.

122
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,340
Ling.

123
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,740
Wake up, Ling.

124
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,540
I've waited so long.

125
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,820
Please stay with me.

126
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,140
Ling.

127
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,260
Come back, Ling.

128
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,140
Ling.

129
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,020
I got your favorite flowers.

130
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:56,940
Ling.

131
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,740
Mr. Meng, life and death are fate.

132
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,940
Maybe it wasn't Hualing who woke up,

133
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,900
but just the gu parasite controlling her.

134
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,460
My advice, Mr. Meng,

135
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,780
is not to hold on too tight.

136
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,820
Sir.

137
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,460
