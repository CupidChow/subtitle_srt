Her name's Taochun.

87
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,940
I heard she vanished
searching for Love Flower.

88
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,180
No idea why she ended up here.

89
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,300
She was rambling about wanting my face.

90
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,380
Love Flower.

91
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,500
There's news about Love Flower
in Nan'an City lately.

92
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,940
They say if you give it
to a man you like,

93
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,060
he'll stick by your side forever.

94
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,980
Is Love Flower even real?

95
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,340
I've grown flowers for years,

96
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,380
never heard of anything
like Love Flower.

97
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,100
But girls these days all believe in it.

98
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,100
I heard in the past few years,

99
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,540
a lot of girls searching for it
went missing.

100
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,260
Missing?

101
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,100
Maybe this Love Flower

102
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,100
grew somewhere on a cliff.

103
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,980
I don't really know.

104
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,180
For the head of the Meng family,

105
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,940
Taochun really was devoted.

106
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,100
The Meng family?

107
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,260
I'll check on her body.

108
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,300
It's not haunted, right?

109
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,540
I've never seen a ghost.

110
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,060
Then how did she just vanish?

111
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,300
Or maybe she's not dead?

112
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,700
If she's alive,

113
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,580
would she disappear without a trace?

114
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,340
Well…

115
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,300
Go get some rest.

116
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,420
I'll look into it.

117
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,140
Are you just leaving me here alone?

118
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,700
I can't stay here by myself.

119
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,700
What if she comes back?

120
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,900
So what do you want?

121
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,240
Can I stay at your place?

122
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,820
There's no other room here.

123
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,280
You can crash on the couch.

124
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,860
Alright.

125
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,140
I mean the living room couch.

126
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,220
No way.

127
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,940
I'm scared to sleep alone.

128
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,430
If you won't

129
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,260
let me use your room's couch, fine.

130
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,500
Then I'll take your bed.

131
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,260
You...

132
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,140
Listen, don't mess with me.

133
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,060
If I get hurt because of you,

134
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,380
you'll have to take care of me.

135
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,900
Sir.

136
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,820
Xici,

137
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,900
I know a lot of people like you.

138
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,660
But what's up with Taochun?

139
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,940
Sir, please don't tease me.

140
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,340
Miss Taochun once came to my clinic.

141
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,380
We've met a few times.

142
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,700
But this Love Flower...

143
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,620
I really know nothing about it.

144
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,220
Something about this feels off.

145
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,100
Send someone to look into it again.

146
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,700
Alright.

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,100
Xici,

148
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,780
you've been running the clinic alone

149
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,260
and looking after me here.

150
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,060
It's been tough on you.

151
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,340
Sir, you don't need to say that.

152
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,350
The Mengs made a promise to serve you

153
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,620
for generations.

154
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,580
This is just what I should do.

155
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,540
By the way, Xici,

156
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,100
isn't Hualing's memorial day coming up?

157
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,540
She's not gone.

158
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,820
She's only in a coma.

159
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,780
Back then, I didn't save her.

160
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,380
I had my reasons.

161
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,780
You probably know this too.

162
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,660
I hope you don't mind.

163
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,020
You're right, sir.

164
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,020
I believe she'll wake up.

165
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,220
Sir,

166
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,940
I won.

167
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,220

I can't help her.

171
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,060
Xici, let me give you some advice.

172
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,780
Some things are out of our hands.

173
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,660
