=Episode 2=

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,120
Why are you here?

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,680
Have you changed your mind?

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,240
Who are they?

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,520
Them?

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,040
They're from the Meng family.

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,400
They asked me
for a hundred Wanting Lotus.

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,760
That kind is hard to grow.

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,280
So they sent a bunch of people
to bother me.

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,960
Is this your place?

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,880
Yeah.

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
I've traveled
all over the country alone,

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,430
with this one boat,

32
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,100
all to find a Yongye Clan member.

33
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,920
Didn't expect you to show up yourself.

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,960
I mean, I finally found you.

35
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,540
(Let me see for myself)

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,780
(if your blood
can make the Noctrose bloom.)

37
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,260
That's beautiful.

38
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,660
What is that?

39
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,660
What are you doing?

40
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,840
What now?

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,060
Make it bloom.

42
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,820
How do I make it bloom?

43
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,940
Feed it with blood

44
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,540
until it flowers.

45
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,260
With blood?

46
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,300
If I get it to bloom,

47
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,540
will you let me stay with you?

48
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,780
Sure.

49
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,940
That depends on

50
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,100
whether you survive until then.

51
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,820
Why should I listen to you?

52
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,740
You don't have to.

53
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,860
But ending you

54
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,620
is easy for me.

55
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,620
Still no sign of Yan Maiden?

56
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,860
Not yet.

57
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,980
A hundred Wanting Lotus.

58
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,620
How many do we have so far?

59
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,180
Only...

60
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,100
Only twenty-one so far.

61
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,140
It's been three months.

62
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,620
You know how crucial it is for my work,

63
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,060
yet you still don't take it seriously.

64
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,900
How dare you.

65
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,940
My lord, I'll find the rest soon.

66
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,780
My lord.

67
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,580
Eat this.

68
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,260
You can go now.

69
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,900
Yes.

70
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,940
Hualing,

71
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,780
I'll make sure you wake up soon.

72
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,540
If it weren't for that person,

73
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,860
we wouldn't have been apart for so long.

74
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,300
Where is this place?

75
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,980
It's beautiful here.

76
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,180
Do you always grow flowers here?

77
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,940
From now on,
you'll care for the Noctrose here.

78
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,500
So it's a deal,

79
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,730
when it blooms,

80
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,340
you'll stay with me forever.

81
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,780
It's freezing here.

82
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,260
There's snow everywhere.

83
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,620
Just like you,

84
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,100
so cold and distant.

85
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,460

since I last saw snow in Mobei.

87
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,380
It's a pity

88
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,420
that I've only got three months left.

89
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,420

Did you see that?

It's snowing.

Mr. Meng is busy.

115
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,980
- Please leave.
- Come out, Mr. Meng!

116
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,460
Please help me, Mr. Meng.

117
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,940
Sir,

118
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,130
what's going on here?

119
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,980
Please go now.

120
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,020
- No way.
- Ms. Zhang's daughter Taochun

121
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,660
once visited Mr. Meng's clinic,

122
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,020
and ever since, she fell for him.

123
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,700
But he loved his late wife the most,

124
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,060
so how could he ever like her?

125
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,100
- Besides, her face...
- This is my daughter.

126
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,060
In the end, Taochun just lost her mind.

127
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,060
She resorted to the legendary Love Flower.

128
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,340
Women seeking Love Flower
to solve romance issues

129
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,780
all disappeared, including Taochun.

130
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,220
She hasn't been back yet.

131
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,300
Can you help me?

132
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,540
Mr. Meng is here.

133
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,500
- Mr. Meng
- Mr. Meng is here.

134
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,740
- Mr. Meng.
- Mr. Meng.

135
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,340
Mr. Meng, please,

136
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,460
please help me find my daughter.

137
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,500
Honestly, I've never met Miss Taochun,

138
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,900
but I can send someone
to search for her.

139
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,920
Please go home and wait for the news.

140
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,660
Are you going to help me?

141
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,380
(Meng Mansion)
Mr. Meng is a hero.

142
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,260
He gives out food and medicine.

143
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,460
We owe him our thanks.

144
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,140
Yeah, that's right.

145
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,380
If Mr. Meng agrees, it's all settled.

146
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,250
Exactly.

147
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,140
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

148
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,700
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

149
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,740
Don't worry.

150
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,900
Alright, let's go.

151
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,140
Come on, let's move.

152
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,540
Alright.

153
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,580
Let's go.

154
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,660
Stop right there!

155
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,590
What are you doing?

156
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,980
Are you looking for trouble?

157
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,780
I took your money,

158
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,140
so I have to keep my word.

159
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,900
I'm here just to tell you,

160
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,540
my Wanting Lotus has sprouted.

161
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,780
In a few days, it'll be delivered here.

162
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,180
That's more like it.

163
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,700
So, stop picking on me from now on.

164
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,260
What's up?

165
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,220
My lord,

166
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,660
this florist says,

167
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,380
she can deliver
all the lotuses next month.

168
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,300
Good. You can go.

169
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,420
Yes.

170
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,300
Mr. Meng.

171
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,140
There was a spider

172
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,720
landing on your shoulder.

173
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,790
I was worried I'd scare you
if I spoke up,

174
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,900
so I apologize

175
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,100
if I startled you.

176
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,420
It's alright, Mr. Meng.

177
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,820
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

178
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,200
Which brand of scented powder
do you use?

179
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,700
I used to buy powder for my wife a lot.

180
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,780
Mine's made from field bindweed.

181
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,100
It's a rare species.
I got a few and turned them

182
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,100
into scented powder.

183
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,060
If that's all, Mr. Meng,

184
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,020
I'll take my leave.

185
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,700
Oh, about the Wanting Lotus,

186
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,860
I'll have someone deliver it to you.

187
