00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,140
(The blood turned red.)

21
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,220
(Will I turn into an ordinary person?)

22
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,700
(Will I die?)

23
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,100
(Why?)

24
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,420
(Just when I longed for death,)

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,620
(fate threw me a lifeline.)

26
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,500
(If I'd never known happiness,)

27
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,260
(right now,)

28
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,060
(I wouldn't feel this much pain.)

29
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,860
How much longer can I live?

30
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,340
The Noctrose is about to bloom.

31
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,620
My body

32
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,220
is getting weaker by the day.

33
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,300
Isn't this what you wanted?

34
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,620
To finally put an end to this long life,

35
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,060
I must truly fall for someone.

36
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,740
But once someone matters to you,

37
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,180
who would still want to give up?

38
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,940
God,

39
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,900
why are you putting me through this?

40
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,100
But she won't make it.

41
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,140
Her life is really short.

42
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,500
Even if you love each other now,

43
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,980
what about the ending?

44
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,580
In the end, won't you just watch her go?

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,340
Don't you feel regret?

46
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,860
I've watched people close to me die

47
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,220
one after another.

48
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,980
It's been the deepest pain.

49
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,540
But now,

50
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,300
I'd rather give up chasing death,

51
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,980
just to be with her

52
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,300
till the end.

53
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,980
What's wrong? Are you cold?

54
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,820
My head hurts a little.

55
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,860
Does it still hurt?

56
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,140
Changsheng, don't hurt Nanxing again.

57
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,660
She's made the Noctrose bloom, right?

58
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,100
You know this could kill you?

59
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,300
I told her to do it.

60
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,180
Why did you leave me behind?

61
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,500
You're all I have left.

62
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,780
But you hurt the people I care about.

63
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,660
That hurts me, too.

64
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,940
I...

65
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,260
Changsheng,

66
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,060
you and Nanxing mean everything to me.

67
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,700
If I'm gone, please take care of her.

68
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,140
She's the one
who will cause your death.

69
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,260
I don't want to see her again.

70
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,740
I really resent both of you.

71
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,540
Changsheng.

72
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,860
(Yang, I can't just watch you die.)

73
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,940
(Changsheng, I'm sorry.)

74
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,220
Chong Yang.

75
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,340
Chong Yang.

76
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,680
Chong Yang, what are you doing here?

77
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,780
It's nothing.

78
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,820
Dinner's ready, come eat.

79
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,980
Nanxing,

80
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,780
I might be away for a while.

81
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,540
Just stay at Ye Mansion for now.

82
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,540
Don't go anywhere else.

83
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,500
What's going on?

84
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,740
Is it dangerous?

85
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,540
Don't worry.

86
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,660
There's no danger.

87
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,940
Sir, are you alright?

88
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,180
Xici.

89
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,020
Xici.

90
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,380
Sir.

91
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,540
Sir.

92
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,660
(Why is he)

93
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,540
(suddenly so weak?)

94
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,140
(Don't Yongye people heal fast?)

95
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,020
(Could it be...)

96
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,260
(No heartbeat.)

97
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,340
(Where's his heart?)

98
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,180
(Legend says if Yongye people
want to end their lives,)

99
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,580
(they use their hearts as a seed)

100
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,300
(to grow a Noctrose.)

101
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,780
(When the flower blooms, life ends.)

102
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,380
(Could it be Chong Yang...)

103
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,220
Sir.

104
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,780
Sir.

105
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,980
What happened to you?

106
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,780
Xici, don't ask anymore.

107
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,140
I'll stay here for a few days.

108
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,420
Alright.

109
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,710
Stay as long as you need.

110
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,460
Should we let your family know?

111
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,260
No.

112
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,660
Don't tell them, please.

113
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,300
Especially not Nanxing.

114
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,620
Okay.

115
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,700
Don't worry.

116
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,980
Sir, you should rest now.

117
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,860
(Chong Yang, oh Chong Yang...)

118
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,140
(I've pictured the moment)

119
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,940
(you died before me so many times.)

120
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,940
(That day is coming.)

121
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,180
(But why do I feel reluctant?)

122
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,980
Great, it's about to open soon.

123
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,100
That's wonderful.

124
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,140
Chong Yang.

125
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,900
I kept the promise I made to you.

126
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,740
Sir.

127
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,880
Sir.

128
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,580
(Why is his blood red now?)

129
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,540
Sir.

130
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,220
Lie down, quickly.

131
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,820
(Chong Yang,)

132
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,060
(I wish so much)

133
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,060
(that you could've died by my hand.)

134
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,180
(If you really die...)

135
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,780
Nanxing.
