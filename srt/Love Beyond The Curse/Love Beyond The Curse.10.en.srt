20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,420
It's been a while
since we had drinks together.

21
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,260
Drinking makes people let loose.

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,940
It also helps you relax.

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,700
Is something bothering you, sir?

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,260
When you have eternal life,

25
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,740
you'll find

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,860
that nothing really gets to you.

27
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,740
Except...

28
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,180
Except...

29
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,940
What is it?

30
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,620
It's nothing.

31
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,020
It's all about deals.

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,020
All about interests.

33
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,860
Are all Yongye people like this?

34
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,380
Where are you off to, little miss?

35
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,040
Hey, mister.

36
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,900
Who are you, anyway?

37
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,060
Walking alone at night isn't safe.

38
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,060
Where are you headed?

39
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,820
Hey, mister.

40
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,700
I'm just a flower seller.

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,540
I... I don't have any money.

42
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,260
Who said we want your money?

43
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,060
We don't even know each other.

44
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,300
You wouldn't go as far as to hurt me, right?

45
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,500
Relax.

46
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,180
We're not here to hurt you.

47
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,320
But we got paid

48
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,540
to handle something for someone.

49
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,100
If you just leave Nan'an City quietly

50
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,300
and never come back from now on,

51
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,300
you'll be just fine.

52
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,500
I'll go. I'll leave.

53
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,660
But before I go, can you tell me,

54
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,860
who sent you here?

55
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,180
You little troublemaker,

56
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,620
too many questions.

57
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,670
Do you think I won't...

58
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,860
Don't yell.

59
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,580
Or you'll regret it.

60
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,260
This girl...

61
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,620
You actually look pretty good.

62
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,060
Bro.

63
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,420
Are you planning to...

64
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,580
Mister, I'm leaving now.

65
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,860
- Trying to run?
- Stop!

66
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,140
Too late.

67
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,100
Mister, I'm sorry.

68
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,220
Please, let me go.

69
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,700
Stop shouting.

70
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,700
It'd be a shame to ruin that face.

71
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,700
Quiet.

72
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,980
What's that sound?

73
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,540
Sound?

74
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,060
I didn't hear anything.

75
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,830
Sounds like Ji Nanxing.

It was a woman.

88
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,340
- Seems like a movie star.
- Yeah.

89
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,940
Her last name is Zhu.

90
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,970
Get lost!

91
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,820
Yes.

92
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,820
Bro.

93
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,660
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

94
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,460
Miss Nanxing.

95
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,840
You should thank Mr. Chong Yang.

96
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,860
We were nearby just now.

97
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,380
He heard you calling for help,

98
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,940
so he brought me here to save you.

99
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,820
Then thanks a lot.

100
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,940
Thank you.

101
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,940
I really owe you a big time.

102
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,780
So, thank you. Seriously.

103
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,980
Is that enough?

104
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,940
Miss Nanxing,

105
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,100
are you hurt anywhere else?

106
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,780
Want me to check you at my clinic?

107
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,900
It's fine, Mr. Meng.

108
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,340
I'm not hurt.

109
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,340
But,

110
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,070
those two just now

111
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,660
were sent by Zhu Yingying.

112
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,660
They tried to force me
out of Nan'an City.

113
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,900
Yingying wants you gone?

114
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,700
Why?

115
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,500
You should ask her yourself.

116
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,660
I'll talk to Yingying about this.

117
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,380
You'd better make it clear.

118
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,740
Zhu Yingying works for you.

119
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,480
You need to take responsibility.

120
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,180
What do you mean by that?

121
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,020
Miss Nanxing,

122
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,340
let me take you home.

123
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,740
No need, Mr. Meng.

124
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,380
I'm really fine now.

125
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,980
Thank you for today.

126
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,700
I'll head out first.

127
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,900
(Chong Yang,)

128
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,700
(the deeper you fall,)

129
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,140
(the more it hurts later.)

130
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,220
(Ready to feel my pain?)

131
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,980
Yang,

132
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,420
what did you want to

133
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,260
talk about?

134
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,660
Yingying,

135
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,780
what did you do to Ji Nanxing?

136
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,860
I... I didn't do anything.

137
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,900
Yang, you...

138
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,300
Why are you staring at me?

139
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,060
What about those two guys?

140
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,740
Yingying,

141
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,700
you've never been good at lying.

142
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,660
Because I never taught you to lie.

143
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,620
Just tell the truth.

144
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,340
I don't want to ask again.

145
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,220
Yes.

146
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,780
I do want Ji Nanxing to leave.

147
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,740
She's always sticking around you

148
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,380
at the Ye Mansion.

149
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,380
I can't stand her. I really can't.

150
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,420
Yingying.

151
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,860
No matter how much you dislike her,

152
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,420
you can't do that to her.

153
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,700
Then how can I make her leave?

154
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,540
You always take her side.

155
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,900
Even if I do take her side,

156
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,940
you still can't control her freedom.

157
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,620
You do favor her.

158
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,100
And you won't admit it.

159
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,940
I have my reasons for what I do.

160
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,460
But next time

161
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,540
you see Ji Nanxing,
you have to apologize.

162
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,820
Yang.

163
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,660
Right now,

164
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,220
copy the Tao Te Ching 100 times.

165
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,740
Go.

166
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,940
(Tao Te Ching)

167
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,780
(Meet me at Meng's; important talk. Xici.)

168
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,260
(Meng Mansion)

169
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,220
This is rare.

170
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,340
Why'd you ask me to meet here today?

171
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,430
Xici.

172
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,900
Ms. Zhu, please have a seat.

173
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,540
I heard your last movie was a huge hit.

174
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,140
I'm happy for you.

175
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,580
Congrats.

176
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,180
It was alright.

177
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,020
I thought it was just okay.

178
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,380
Ms. Zhu, you're too humble.

179
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,180
This is the snow cream

180
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,740
developed by my clinic.

181
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,100
It's great for beauty and skincare.

182
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,660
Ms. Zhu, wanna try it?

183
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,660
(Meng)
Can I trust your stuff?

184
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,700
Jishan Clinic is well-known here.

185
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,090
Ms. Zhu, you can rest assured.

186
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,900
Thank you, Xici.

187
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,060
About you and Mr. Chong Yang...

188
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,060
What about us?

189
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,500
We're perfectly fine.

190
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,860
If things are so great,

191
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,100
why did you hire someone
to drive Ji Nanxing away?

192
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,020
It's none of your business.

193
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,180
I'm just curious, that's all.

194
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,060
Meng Xici,

195
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,900
don't say I didn't warn you.

196
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,540
The Meng family is powerful
in Nan'an City,

197
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,100
but you're still just Yang's staff.

198
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,060
You'd better not ask about
things you shouldn't.

199
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,780
I'm Mr. Chong Yang's staff.

200
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,940
So what about you, Ms. Zhu?

201
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,980
Yang took me in when I was eight.

202
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,300
Of course, we're family.

203
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,900
As long as you know that, that's enough.

204
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,540
After all, Mr. Chong Yang

205
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,540
has someone else by his side.

206
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,580
Who does she think she is?

207
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,580
Meng Xici.

208
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,140
Here's my advice for you.

209
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,620
Maybe worry less about other people

210
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,460
and focus more on your own life.

211
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,300
After all, Hualing's been

212
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,700
barely hanging on for so long.

213
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,140
Maybe it's time to move forward,

214
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,220
instead of meddling every day.

215
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,270
Better enjoy it while you can.
