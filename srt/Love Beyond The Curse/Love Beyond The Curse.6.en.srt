00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,860
Playing tough, huh?

21
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,860
Yeah.

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,300
You don't like me anyway.

23
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,300
So I'll just get out of your way.

24
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,980
Sir,

25
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,060
I finished what you asked last time.

26
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,460
I used the money to build an academy

27
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,660
and donated to hospitals.

28
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,380
Everyone in Nan'an City
thinks I'm generous,

29
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,500
but they have no idea

30
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,820
that it was all your idea.

31
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,140
I've lived long enough.

32
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,500
Money means nothing to me now.

33
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,740
Might as well do charity.

34
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,780
Xici,

35
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,860
you've been running
the clinic for years.

36
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,100
You're worth the credit.

37
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,620
Ji Nanxing, get up!

38
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,100
Ji Nanxing!

39
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,540
Ji Nanxing, come out here now!

40
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,140
Ji Nanxing!

41
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,980
Ji Nanxing!

42
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,100
Ji Nanxing, get out here now!

43
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,140
Sir.

44
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,980
Over these past few days,

45
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,860
your life seems a lot more lively.

46
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,100
Ji Nanxing, get up!

47
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,380
Ji Nanxing, come out right now!

48
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,820
Ji Nanxing!

49
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,660
You...

50
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,780
Watch how I deal with you today.

51
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,620
What are you doing?

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,980
Let go.

53
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,060
Let go.

54
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,380
Let me go!

55
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,940
Why are you doing?

56
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,300
Yang,

57
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,180
she tricked me into drinking

58
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,660
and made me call her "sis-in-law".

59
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,380
I've never been so embarrassed.

60
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,900
Move aside.

61
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,740
I'm about to teach her a real lesson.

62
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,740
Don't make a scene.

63
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,300
Yang.

64
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,220
She embarrassed me so much.

65
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,500
I have to make her pay for it.

66
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,980
Get out.

67
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,940
You...

68
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,460
I didn't know
he couldn't handle his drinks.

69
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,140
So...

70
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,660
did anything happen

71
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,980
last night?

72
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,580
If you're up, leave.

73
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,260
Why are you still here since you're awake?

74
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,540
I...

75
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,380
I...

76
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,660
(Did something happen)

77
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,460
(between us last night?)

78
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,100
(Why can't I remember a thing?)

79
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,940
(I think something probably happened.)

80
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,300
(Otherwise, why were my clothes changed?)

81
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,060
(Then why did he act like that?)

82
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,180
(It's understandable.)

83
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,500
(Guys get shy too, you know.)

84
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,340
Are you heading out?

85
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,060
Miss Nanxing, you probably get the hint.

86
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,860
This is not your home.

87
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,500
Dropping by too often can get annoying.

88
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,340
Even if Chong Yang won't say it,

89
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,820
I'll just say it for him.

90
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,380
Ms. Zhu, but honestly,

91
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,100
Chong Yang doesn't find it annoying.

92
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,240
He's actually happy about it.

93
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,100
Ms. Zhu, you've known him for ages,

94
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,940
but I might know him even better.

95
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,700
You...

96
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,940
I've got stuff to do. We'll talk later.

97
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,420
(The flower has two petals now.)

98
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,660
(I need to speed up the process.)

99
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,380
(Ji Nanxing, what are you up to now?)

100
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,700
(This is snowmelt
from the Tianshan Mountains.)

101
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,420
(I haven't even used it myself.)

102
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,540
(It's not reacting at all.)

103
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,560
(Let me try something else.)

104
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,140
(This is top-quality Nu'er Hong.)

105
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,420
(I've heard people use wine for plants.)

106
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,060
(Let me give it a shot.)

107
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,020
(Still nothing happening.)

108
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,500
(Why is it so hard to make you bloom?)

109
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,860
(But it's alright.)

110
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,860
(Since I promised Chong Yang,)

111
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,180
(I'll definitely keep my word.)

112
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,860
(Let's pour a bit more.)

113
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,300
What are you doing?

114
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,220
Chong Yang,

115
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,060
(Nu'er Hong)
want a drink?

116
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,940
Stop messing around.

117
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,220
I'm just trying to make the Noctrose bloom.

118
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,860
Why are you so harsh?

119
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,300
Listen to me.

120
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,980
Without my permission,

121
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,940
you can't mess with the Noctrose.

122
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,180
Got it.

123
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:46,020
(Meng Mansion)

124
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,140
Why did the Meng family

125
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,740
order so many lilies?

126
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,700
It's Madam's birthday.

127
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,740
Madam used to love lilies the most.

128
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,780
It's Madam's birthday.

129
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,420
Where is Madam now?

130
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,380
She's been out for 3 years.

131
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,700
He's been devoted to her.

132
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,820
See,

133
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,420
he still keeps her portrait in the room.

134
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,440
He misses her every day.

135
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,940
Mr. Meng really is loyal to her.

136
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,260
Why do you care anyway?

137
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,240
I...

138
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,980
If you don't deliver the lotus in time,

139
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,360
just wait and see what I'll do.

140
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,340
Get back to work.

141
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,320
Did you hear the news?

142
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,580
Another girl went missing lately.

143
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,140
Seems she was searching
for the Love Flower.

144
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,980
Love Flower?

145
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,820
She just disappeared.

146
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,260
People are still looking for it?

147
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,340
They're really not scared.

148
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,620
I heard she's been gone five days now.

149
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,180
I doubt she'll come back.

150
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,980
You two, come here.

151
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,100
- (Love Flower?)
- Let's go.

152
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,180
(Is there really such a flower?)

153
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
(If it's real,)

154
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,580
(and I give it to Chong Yang,)

155
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,220
(would that mean…)

156
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,780
(But…)

157
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,260
(it does sound kind of risky.)

158
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,980
(Got it!)

159
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,860
Ling.

160
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
Today is your 26th birthday.

161
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,780
Are we there yet?

162
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,820
Why all the secrecy?

163
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,660
Alright.

164
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,500
This is where we first met.

165
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,700
You still remember.

166
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,220
From now on, this place

167
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,260
belongs to just us.

168
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,940
Happy birthday.

169
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,300
Thank you.

170
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,260
Hualing.

171
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,500
Hualing.

172
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,380
Will you marry me?

173
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,940
Ling.

174
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,500
