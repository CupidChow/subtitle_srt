00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,540
Let's eat.

21
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,500
Alright.

22
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,980
Changsheng, what are you doing?

23
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,140
Nothing special.

24
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,820
I just want that piece.

25
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,900
Here.

26
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,300
You can have it.

27
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,380
Didn't expect you

28
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,620
to like my cooking.

29
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,620
As if I care.

30
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,820
Then just don't eat.

31
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,530
But you don't let him eat either.

32
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,620
How about this,

33
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,900
we'll go out to eat.

34
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,260
I want to go too.

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,860
If you

36
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,820
want to watch us act all sweet,

37
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,380
I'm honestly fine with that.

38
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,500
You...

39
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,180
Enough.

40
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,740
Sit down and eat.

41
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,620
Here,

42
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,860
try this.

43
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,020
And you too.

44
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,140
Still mad, huh?

45
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,300
I can't stand that woman.

46
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,260
Changsheng, no matter what,

47
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,020
you're still my closest brother.

48
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,460
You're hiding something from me.

49
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,020
I don't believe you'd like

50
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,860
an ordinary woman.

51
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,820
And you favor her.

52
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,460
I really love her.

53
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,860
You...

54
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,740
So what?

55
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,780
She's just a passerby.

56
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,740
There's no way
you'll be together forever.

57
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,020
Now, with you and everyone here,

58
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,580
I don't feel lonely anymore.

59
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,460
So,

60
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,820
for the rest of my life...

61
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,900
And?

62
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,020
I'll stick by your side forever.

63
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,900
Changsheng.

64
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,140
Am I just a passerby to you?

65
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,020
Were you eavesdropping?

66
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,340
I wasn't eavesdropping.

67
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,300
Besides, you were so loud.

68
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,620
It was impossible not to hear.

69
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,980
Stop overthinking.

70
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,740
Then let me ask you.

71
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,540
When do you plan to marry me?

72
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,740
So that's what's on your mind.

73
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,740
If I don't keep it in mind,

74
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,120
what else even matters?

75
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,620
So what kind of pajamas will you wear?

76
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,460
Who?

77
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,980
Sorry.

78
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,540
I saw this herb and wanted to

79
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,540
dig it up.

80
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,380
I didn't know it had an owner.

81
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,100
Sorry, sir.

82
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,820
I'll pay you back.

83
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,180
I really didn't mean to.

84
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,780
Can I take this herb home?

85
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,420
Who are you?

86
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,540
I'm Hualing.

87
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,660
I work as a doctor outside Nan'an City.

88
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,300
Why not practice in the city?

89
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,700
Because in Nan'an City,

90
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,100
everyone goes to Jishan Clinic.

91
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,000
I heard the owner, Meng Xici,

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,100
doesn't have medical skills.

93
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,700
He just gathered
a bunch of doctors there.

94
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,180
I'm still new to this,

95
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,220
and I'm a woman,

96
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,540
so I don't stand a chance.

97
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,860
But one day,

98
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,540
I'll prove my medical skills to him.

99
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,780
Sorry again, sir.

100
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,860
I tend to talk a lot.

101
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,340
May I ask your name, sir?

102
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,180
Meng Xici.

103
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,700
Meng...

104
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,300
Mr. Meng.

105
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,360
Sorry to bother you.

106
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,220
I'll be heading out.

107
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,860
Um,

108
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,380
I wanted to ask

109
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,820
why Mr. Meng asked me here.

110
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,020
Please wait a moment.

111
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,540
He will be here soon.

112
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,180
Miss Hualing.

113
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,060
Mr. Meng.

114
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,300
Don't be nervous. Have a seat.

115
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,500
Mr. Meng.

116
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,100
Last time, I didn't recognize you.

117
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,290
Sorry for any offense.

118
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,300
Please don't take it to heart.

119
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,580
I called you here

120
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,940
not because of that.

121
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,260
Please, have a seat.

122
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,380
Come in.

123
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
You're quite young,

124
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,440
but your medical skills are impressive.

125
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,780
I heard

126
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,180
that you've handled
many complicated cases

127
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,100
in several villages outside the city.

128
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,380
At Jishan Clinic,

129
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,900
we really need doctors like you.

130
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,780
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Meng.

131
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,100
If you don't mind, Miss Hualing,

132
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,060
you can start at the clinic tomorrow.

133
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,820
I...

134
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,580
I used to want to join Jishan Clinic.

135
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,180
But now, I'm afraid I can't accept.

136
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,300
Why is that?

137
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,820
Village conditions
are tougher than in town.

138
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,380
Many villagers fall ill,

139
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,260
but can't afford to go into town for care.

140
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,980
If I keep working in the villages,

141
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,180
I can help so many patients in need.

142
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,780
A doctor's mission
is to heal and save lives.

143
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,260
Money and fame do matter,

144
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,980
but compared to lives, they're nothing.

145
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,660
So thank you, Mr. Meng.

146
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,620
But I'm afraid I have to turn you down.

147
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,980
If that's the case, I won't insist.

148
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,780
But I plan to build
a village clinic.

149
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,100
I wonder, Miss Hualing,

150
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,260
would you be willing
to run the clinic for me?

151
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,820
Then, this is an advance for you.

152
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,100
(Hualing,)

153
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,020
(I really miss you.)

154
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,660
(Chong Yang disappeared
early this morning.)

155
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,100
(Where could he have gone?)

156
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,020
Chong Yang.

157
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,300
