20
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,260
Yang, I'm hungry.

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,020
Where's that woman?

22
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,460
Tell her to cook.

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,180
She left.

24
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,460
What?

25
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,140
I can't believe it.

26
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,700
I honestly thought

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,740
she'd never move out.

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,740
Are you hungry?

29
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,100
Yeah, I am.

30
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,340
No idea what Yingying's up to lately.

31
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,380
She won't come out.

32
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,140
Who's going to cook for me?

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,740
Got it.

34
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,980
Yang,

35
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,260
how about this,

36
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,420
get that woman back to cook for me.

37
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,780
No way.

38
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,740
Fine, forget it.

39
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,740
Does it taste good?

40
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,060
Yeah, it's good.

41
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,700
So, Changsheng said he's hungry.

42
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,820
He wants you to come back and cook.

43
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,700
He really treats me as his chef.

44
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,460
Actually asked me just to cook.

45
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,380
What's this?

46
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,500
(Meng)

47
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,140
It's from Meng Xici.

48
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,420
Yeah.

49
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,140
He came to see you.

50
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,250
Yeah.

51
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,300
Why did he visit you?

52
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,900
None of your business.

53
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,020
You're living out here

54
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,220
all by yourself.

55
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,980
What if someone has bad intentions?

56
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,420
Bad intentions, huh?

57
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,140
I'm all alone.

58
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,660
Besides this boat,

59
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,740
I have nothing else.

60
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,460
I'm barely hanging on to life.

61
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,740
What could anyone want from me?

62
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,100
I just don't want you
too close to other guys.

63
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,300
Honestly, I used to think,

64
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,220
what's so bad about dying?

65
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,260
Maybe it's because I've lived so long

66
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,420
that everything in the world

67
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,300
just feels so dull,

68
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,620
boring, and exhausting.

69
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,620
That's why I felt that death

70
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,620
wasn't such a bad thing.

71
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,220
I don't like hearing you say that.

72
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,100
You think it's boring and exhausting,

73
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,900
because you never really lived.

74
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,660
Really lived?

75
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,700
Yeah, exactly.

76
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,340
Is that all?

77
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,940
So, you look down on me?

78
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,860
Doesn't mean you could beat me.

79
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,660
What does that have to do

80
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,980
with me wanting to die?

81
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,260
Let's get started.

82
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,740
Pai Gow began in the Song dynasty.

83
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,700
There are thirty-two tiles in total.

84
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,700
Each tile has a different value.

85
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,180
Ways to win also vary.

86
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,580
Let's start.

87
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,700
Double Red.

88
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,980
I win.

89
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,140
Again.

90
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,940
Double Plum.

91
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,940
I win again.

92
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,260
Yang,

93
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,260
so far, you haven't beaten me yet.

94
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,700
Ding Three with Two-Four.

95
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,100
Supreme Treasure.

96
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,500
Well? You can still give up now.

97
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,620
One more round.

98
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,020
No more rounds.

99
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,900
You should quit while you're ahead.

100
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,900
Don't get greedy.

101
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,660
You've been around for ages.

102
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,700
I thought you'd tried everything.

103
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,420
I do play chess.

104
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,300
Chess, huh.

105
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,580
Chess isn't bad either.

106
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,220
But there's so much fun

107
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
out there.

108
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,060
If you never try them,

109
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,700
how will you know what you like?

110
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,740
It's just a game.

111
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,420
You'll get bored eventually.

112
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,140
Forget it.

113
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,260
This game isn't working.

114
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,740
Let's try something else.

115
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,380
This is the one.

116
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,900
Are you just going to watch?

117
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,980
Why not help me out?

118
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,740
No, I'm not.

119
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,540
What are you even doing?

120
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,860
You made a total mess here.

121
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,180
This is a northern food tradition.

122
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,380
They grill veggies and meat
over charcoal.

123
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,460
It tastes way better than usual.

124
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,900
Want to give it a try?

125
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,370
Here, try some.

126
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,580
How is it?

127
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,980
It's delicious.

128
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,940
I'll grill a few more skewers.

129
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,420
The corn got a little burnt.

130
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,580
It's still good to eat.

131
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,820
Here, taste it.

132
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,660
I'll pass, you eat it.

133
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,500
Yingying.

134
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,860
Changsheng.

135
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,900
Where's Yang?

136
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,060
Who knows.

137
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,380
He was finding a chef for me.

138
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,660
Bet he went to that strange woman again.

139
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,900
I've helped him take care of flowers.

140
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,740
Right?

141
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,140
So we're just giving each other
what we need.

142
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,380
(What kind of flowers did she plant for him?)

143
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,340
(Yang,)

144
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,540
(I've always been by your side,)

145
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,420
(yet I can't compare to someone new.)

146
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,420
(Why does my face hurt again?)

147
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,380
I'm seriously stuffed.

148
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,660
You know what?

149
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,940
There are so many amazing foods.

150
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,580
You might never try them all
in your life.

151
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,260
You've lived alone for so long,

152
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,980
always staying in the same place.

153
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,630
Don't you think that's a bit sad?

154
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,170
How about it?

155
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,940
Doesn't what I said make sense?

156
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,580
Hey, have you ever seen
colorful snowflakes?

157
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,340
There are colorful snowflakes?

158
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,700
Of course, there are.

159
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,740
Come on.

160
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,060
Close your eyes.

161
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,930
Close your eyes, be good.

162
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,380
Wait right here.

163
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,420
Look.

164
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,860
Do you like it?

165
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,540
I do.

166
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,180
I knew you would.

167
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,500
I like you.

168
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,700
What did you say?

169
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,300
I said,

170
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,900
I like you.

171
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,340
You're right.

172
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,820
There's so much good in this world.

173
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,820
But I've never felt it.

174
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,980
I want to feel all of that.

175
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,020
Not because of those things,

176
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,820
but because of who I'm with.

177
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,060
It's you

178
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,740
that made me enjoy Pai Gow,

179
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,580
barbecue,

180
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,380
and watching fireworks.

181
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,020
They're pretty fun.

182
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,940
And you're the reason

183
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,900
that I feel

184
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,740
being alive

185
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,420
is better than giving up.

186
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,140
Chong Yang,

187
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,740
do you

188
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,460
really mean what you said?

189
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,220
Are you not drunk?

190
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,460
Will you still mean it in the morning?
