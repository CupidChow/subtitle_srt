Yingying.

21
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,500
Yingying.

22
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,540
Yang,

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,420
I'm glad you finally came.

24
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,380
What happened to you?

25
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,900
It was Xici.

26
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,460
He ruined my face like this.

27
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,220
He even tricked me
into bringing Ji Nanxing here.

28
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,020
Where's Nanxing?

29
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,580
Where's Nanxing?

30
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,420
I don't know.

31
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,690
Let's go to the clinic.

32
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,940
Yingying.

33
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,830
Yingying.

34
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,740
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,700
I just wanted too much.

36
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,710
If only we could go back
to when we were kids.

37
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,060
Yingying.

38
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,860
Yingying!

39
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,580
Now you're ordinary.

40
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,820
Chong Yang.

41
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,660
Watching someone
you care about pass away.

42
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,660
How do you feel?

43
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,060
Now you finally get it, don't you?

44
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,460
You killed Yingying.

45
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,620
Yeah.

46
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,060
What about Nanxing?

47
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,540
Relax.

48
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,180
She's still alive and well.

49
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,260
But I can't promise how long

50
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,820
she'll stay that way.

51
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,980
Meng Xici,

52
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,580
why are you doing all this?

53
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,860
You really want to know why?

54
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,700
Is it all because of Hualing?

55
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,460
Because I didn't save her 3 years ago?

56
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,340
So you blame me.

57
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,940
Shouldn't I blame you?

58
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,300
The Meng family
has served you for generations.

59
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,940
The very first rule in our family is

60
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,900
that your command comes before all else,

61
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,380
including the lives of the Mengs.

62
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,740
My ancestors all kept that promise.

63
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,940
I'm no different.

64
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,020
But what about you?

65
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,540
I've only ever asked you once

66
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,780
to save my wife's life.

67
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,300
But you said you couldn't help.

68
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,220
I really can't save her.

69
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,860
The Yongye people

70
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,340
can't wake someone
who's lost consciousness.

71
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,140
Even if I force her awake,

72
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,380
she'd just wander around, empty inside.

73
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,300
Is that what you want for Hualing?

74
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,220
So what?

75
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,620
That's still better than her being gone.

76
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,340
Now,

77
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,620
even her body...

78
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,900
What are you saying?

79
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,820
What happened to her?

80
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,460
She's gone.

81
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,340
Where's Ji Nanxing?

82
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,220
Did you put gu on Ji Nanxing?

83
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,260
That's right.

84
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,340
A Yan Maiden's body is perfect for gu.

85
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,620
Hilltop Garden. Missing girls.

86
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,420
You did all that, didn't you?

87
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,260
Yes, it was me.

88
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,100
I should've known it.

89
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,900
Back when I found that token,

90
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,480
I should've suspected you.

91
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,340
Too bad,

92
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,660
you trusted me too much.

93
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,620
Xici,

94
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,780
tell me,

95
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,420
why did we end up like this?

96
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,540
Chong Yang,

97
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,540
you're too naive.

98
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,140
Did you think we'd still be as close

99
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,460
as brothers like before?

100
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,140
I want you to feel what I felt.

101
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,820
The pain from losing the one you love.

102
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,780
Let me ask you one last time.

103
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,740
Where's Nanxing?

104
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,700
You used to have Changsheng and Yingying.

105
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,580
Now it's just you, all alone.

106
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,940
Like a stray with nowhere to go.

107
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,700
Meng Xici.

108
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,300
Where is Ji Nanxing?

109
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,900
Chong Yang.

110
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,820
You really think I don't know?

111
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,660
Now you're just like me, just ordinary.

112
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,020
Do you really think

113
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,140
you can take me down?

114
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,660
Turns out you're not afraid of sunlight.

115
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,140
Just tell me one thing.

116
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,940
Where is Ji Nanxing?

117
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,500
I'll do whatever you want if you tell me.

118
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,780
Fine.

119
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,300
If that's how it is,

120
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,060
let's do it your way.

121
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,540
Chong Yang.

122
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,930
Chong Yang!

123
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,020
Chong Yang, you need to go!

124
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,100
Don't come any closer!

125
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,860
Nanxing.

126
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,020
Nanxing!

127
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,170
- Nanxing.
- Chong Yang.

128
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,740
Chong Yang, are you okay?

129
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,620
You should leave now.

130
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,500
It's fine. Xici told me,

131
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,220
he put a gu in your body.

132
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,300
The gu is out of me now.

133
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,020
But Hualing hasn't come back.

134
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,140
Chong Yang, don't stand here.

135
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,140
Go, please.

136
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,540
I'm alright.

137
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,260
Xici killed Yingying.

138
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,700
He's lost his mind.

139
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,220
I know.

140
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,460
I know everything now.

141
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,780
Chong Yang.

142
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,860
Chong Yang.

143
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,740
Chong Yang.

144
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,190
Chong Yang.

145
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,480
- What's wrong?
- Don't bother.

146
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,380
If this was before,

147
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,500
a chain like that

148
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,980
wouldn't have slowed you down.

149
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,460
But now,

150
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,220
forget about a chain,

151
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,540
I'm not sure you could break a rope.

152
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,300
Meng Xici.

153
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,260
What do you know?

154
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,020
Chong Yang.

155
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,540
What does he mean by that?

156
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Miss Nanxing.

157
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,100
You probably don't know yet.

158
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,660
Chong Yang

159
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,060
is dying.

160
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,820
Meng Xici, stop talking.

161
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,220
Looks like fate isn't on your side.

162
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,700
You're not dying that quickly.

163
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,140
Chong Yang.

164
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,460
What did he mean by that?

165
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,220
Aren't you from the Yongye Clan?

166
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,140
I thought Yongye people couldn't die.

167
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,820
Chong Yang.

168
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,990
Bet you didn't expect

169
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,740
that I know the secret of Noctrose.

170
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,460
When you came to me hurt,

171
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,500
I figured it out.

172
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,060
Noctrose?

173
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,420
What's going on with Noctrose?

174
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,700
Chong Yang.

175
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,780
You can't even
bring yourself to tell her?

176
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,180
Fine.

177
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,820
