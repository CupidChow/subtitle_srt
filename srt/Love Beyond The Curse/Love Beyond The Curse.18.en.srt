20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,380
My lord, is Chong Yang all right?

21
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,220
Anything wrong?

22
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,460
Take care of him.

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,020
Well...

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,580
Install curtains in his room tomorrow.

25
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,180
Don't let any sunlight get in.

26
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,100
Also,

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,090
he prefers lighter meals.

28
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,060
So be mindful of the food.

29
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,220
Understood.

30
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,580
My lord.

31
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,820
I think you and Lord Chong Yang

32
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,860
have some real feeling left.

33
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,420
Don't waste my time with that.

34
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,460
Maybe there was once.

35
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,940
But ever since he let Hualing

36
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,980
die without helping,

37
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,500
all that's left is hatred.

38
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,220
The golden gu isn't ready yet.

39
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,020
Don't alert him for now.

40
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,300
Yes.

41
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,900
Mr. Chong Yang,

42
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,180
Mr. Meng said you need more rest.

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,780
I've been lying too long.

44
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,220
I wanted to take a walk.

45
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,220
Leave me alone.

46
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,620
(Why is there such a cold place?)

47
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,620
(Hualing.)

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,860
(Why is Hualing here?)

49
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,820
(These past 3 years,)

50
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,540
(Xici has kept hoping
Hualing would wake up.)

51
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,420
(Has he not given up on her?)

52
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Mr. Chong Yang.

53
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,260
Xici, what's going on here?

54
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,700
This is Hualing.

55
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,820
Don't you recognize her?

56
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,940
Of course, I know that's Hualing.

57
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,460
She's been unconscious for 3 years.

58
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,780
Are you still trying to save her?

59
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,940
She's okay.

60
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,820
She's just sleeping.

61
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,180
Xici,

62
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,260
it's been three years.

63
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,780
Are you still holding on?

64
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,620
If it were your partner,

65
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,980
would you move on in three years?

66
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,660
If something happened to Ji Nanxing,

67
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,980
would you just stand by and do nothing?

68
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,300
Meng Xici, you...

69
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,220
Don't get upset.

70
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,340
I'm just kidding.

71
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,500
With you watching over her now,

72
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,180
what could possibly go wrong?

73
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,700
Xici, let me give you
one last piece of advice.

74
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,900
You can try to wake her up,

75
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,980
but don't do anything you'll regret.

76
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,100
(Regret?)

77
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,500
(Why would I regret it?)

78
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,820
(If it means Ling wakes up,)

79
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,820
(I'll do whatever it takes.)

80
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,420
Gu Changsheng isn't here, either.

81
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,260
Zhu Yingying's not here either.

82
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,220
I'm so bored right now.

83
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,580
If I'd known, I'd have
gone back to my boat.

84
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,100
Chong Yang.

85
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,780
You're back.

86
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,980
Where have you been these days?

87
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,260
I really missed you.

88
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,340
Sorry,

89
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,540
I came back late.

90
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,180
What's this?

91
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,860
It's a gift I got for you.

92
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,660
I wasn't sure if you'd like it.

93
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,060
I love everything from you.

94
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,260
It's so pretty.

95
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,260
Why did you make a pink Noctrose?

96
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,980
Pink is you, blue is me.

97
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,740
Didn't expect you

98
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,340
to be good at cheering girls up.

99
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,260
Well, it's my first time

100
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,280
trying to make a girl smile.

101
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,780
Then from now on,

102
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,420
you can only sweet-talk me.
