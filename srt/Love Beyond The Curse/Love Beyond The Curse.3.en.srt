Mr. Meng.

00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
Mr. Meng.

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,920
Mr. Meng, you came to see me.

24
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,080
Good girl.

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,580
Once the test is done,

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,560
I'll reward you for this.

27
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,500
She tried the new drug.

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,560
Now her strength and speed

29
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,280
are way above average.

30
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,760
But her mind drifts in and out.

31
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,600
She can't control it.

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,360
Keep testing.

33
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,520
And find more test subjects.

34
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,880
Yes.

35
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,720

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
Who is it?

43
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,800
You're awake.

44
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,800
Time for breakfast.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,840
How did you get in?

46
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,320
I...

47
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,280
I have a question for you.

48
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,120
Aren't Yongye people afraid of light?

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,860
Why didn't you close the curtains?

50
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,600
And you look unaffected.

51
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Yongye people only fear direct sunlight.

52
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,800
No wonder your room's always so dark.

53
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,520
That's not your concern.

54
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,280
- I...
- I want to know how you got in.

55
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,170
I just walked in, that's all.

56
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,120
What's with this romance novel?

57
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,680
You usually act so distant.

58
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,040
Your life's kind of dull.

59
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,720
I thought you could use
a sweet love story,

60
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,080
and maybe learn something in advance.

61
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,160
I picked all these out just for you.

62
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,640
Ji Nanxing.

63
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,960
I'm not into romance novels.

64
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,480
I made soup for you.

65
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,600
Wait here for me.

66
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,400
Blood sausage.

67
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,120
Pork blood cake.

68
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,960
Spicy blood curd hotpot.

69
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,080
Pork blood tofu.

70
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,160
And a bowl of soup,

71
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,440
duck blood vermicelli soup.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,200
You've probably gotten used to being alone.

73
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,800
No one's looking out for you, right?

74
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,520
But you can count on me.

75
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,640
From now on, I'm here.

76
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,990
I'll always be by your side.

77
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,800
I won't let you struggle like this.

78
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,700
But what if

79
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,620
I'm actually pretty well-off?

80
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,180
Or maybe

81
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,640
I like being alone.

82
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,180
Then... then I...

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,860
I won't bother you.

84
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,260
Can I just quietly take care of you?

85
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,540
No need for that.

86
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,700
If the Noctrose doesn't bloom in 3 months,

87
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,780
you'll still die.

88
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,300
I'm so good-looking.

89
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,180
How could you let me die?

90
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,780
I've lived for so many years,

91
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,660
and have seen plenty of people die.

92
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,900
One more won't matter.

93
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,940
Hey, I have my pride!

94
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,280
I've taken the initiative,

95
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,420
but you still look so cold.

96
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,740
If it weren't to survive,

97
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,980
I wouldn't even talk to you.

98
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,980
If you weren't hot, who'd cook for you?

99
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,300
Wait, you're not that handsome or fit.

100
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,340
You're good at nothing.

101
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,860
I'm so mad right now.

102
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,980
Ji Nanxing, you are so embarrassing.

103
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,260
That's infuriating.

104
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,580
Don't touch my flowers. Who are you?

105
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,100
- And Taochun, her face...
- Look, this is my daughter.

106
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,660
Taochun?

107
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,780
I know you.

108
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,420
Your mom is looking for you.

109
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,180
So beautiful.

110
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,980
Your face, it's just stunning.

111
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,580
Taochun, did something happen?

112
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,060
If only I had a face like yours,

113
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,100
maybe he'd finally love me.

114
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,500
Taochun, what are you talking about?

115
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,460
Give it to me.

116
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,540
What are you doing?

117
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,700
Give me your face.

118
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,460
Give me your face.

119
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,660
I want to take your face off.

120
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,980
Taochun.

121
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,700
I'm going to peel your face off.

122
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,620
Taochun, wake up.

123
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,660
Chong Yang.

124
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,700
Chong Yang!

125
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,540
Give me back my face.

126
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,500
Give me back my face!

127
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,540
Chong Yang.

128
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,380
Chong Yang.

129
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,460
Chong Yang, are you okay?

130
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,620
It's daytime now.
