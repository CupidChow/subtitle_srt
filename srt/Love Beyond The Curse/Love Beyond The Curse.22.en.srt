Chong Yang.

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,820
You can't even
bring yourself to tell her?

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,780
Fine, then I'll tell her myself.

23
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,140
Chong Yang!

24
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,780
Chong Yang, get out of here.

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,900
Please stop.

26
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,940
Chong Yang.

27
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,220
Chong Yang.

28
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,540
Now you can't even beat me.

29
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,660
You're just useless now.

30
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,780
How will you save Ji Nanxing?

31
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,540
Meng Xici.

32
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,860
What's the truth

33
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,180
of the Noctrose?

34
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,160
Noctrose is a flower

35
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,860
that Yongye people plant
with their hearts.

36
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,900
When they wish to end their long lives,

37
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,540
they plant a Noctrose.

38
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,140
Once it blooms,

39
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,020
they fall into an endless sleep.

40
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,180
But guess what,

41
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,100
how does the Noctrose bloom?

42
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,740
Meng Xici.

43
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,380
Stop talking.

44
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,140
It only blooms when they fall in love.

45
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,900
The deeper the love,

46
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,220
the closer it is to blooming,

47
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,740
but his health gets worse.

48
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,940
Ji Nanxing, see how much he loves you?

49
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,300
With you

50
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,460
and the others with me,

51
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,460
I don't feel alone anymore.

52
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,860
So,

53
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,020
for the rest of my life...

54
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,340
And?

55
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,380
I'll stick with you forever.

56
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,740
You're so stubborn.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,420
I just asked you to grow the flower.

58
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,860
You mean nothing to me.

59
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,540
What's with forever?

60
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,180
Chong Yang.

61
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,700
Nanxing.

62
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,860
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

63
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,820
If I'd known you'd die,

64
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,780
I would've stayed away from you.

65
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,060
Why did you save me?

66
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,340
Yet here I am, hurting you instead.

67
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,420
Why is it like this?

68
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,740
Chong Yang.

69
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,060
Chong Yang.

70
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,460
Nanxing.

71
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,860
Don't cry.

72
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,980
This is my fate.

73
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,260
I can't escape it.

74
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,460
Chong Yang.

75
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,300
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,900
I can't stay with you for life.

77
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,340
Chong Yang.

78
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,900
You won't end up as tragic lovers.

79
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,100
I won't let it happen.

80
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,740
If you die,

81
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,260
Ji Nanxing has to stay alive.

82
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,500
I want her to suffer every single day.

83
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,980
I won't let you two ever meet again.

84
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,700
Nanxing,

85
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,990
promise me you'll live on.

86
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,260
Chong Yang, you need to go now.

87
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,340
Forget about me.

88
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,220
Chong Yang.

89
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,380
Chong Yang.

90
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,980
Chong Yang!

91
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,300
(Hualing,)

92
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,540
(I'm coming to join you.)

93
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,820
Chong Yang!

94
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,060
Chong Yang!

95
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,660
Chong Yang!

96
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,380
Chong Yang.

97
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,780
Chong Yang, I'm begging you.

98
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,420
Please stay with me, Chong Yang.

99
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,860
Chong Yang.

100
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,100
Chong Yang.

101
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,860
Chong Yang.

102
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,460
Chong Yang.

103
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,460
Nanxing.

104
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,420
There's no way

105
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,740
to fix this.

106
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,980
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,420
Chong Yang.

108
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,180
Chong Yang.

109
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,060
Just forget about me.

110
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,380
Chong Yang.

111
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,460
Chong Yang.

112
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,380
Chong Yang.

113
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,980
Chong Yang.

114
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,020
Chong Yang.

115
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,700
Chong Yang!

116
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,220
Don't leave me alone.

117
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,180
All these years,

118
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,060
I've always stayed with my brother.

119
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,700
If not for you, I wouldn't have known,

120
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,980
he was ready to die.

121
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,820
I don't deserve to be his brother.

122
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,660
Is there any way to wake him up?

123
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,740
There's a rumor

124
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,180
if a Yongye person

125
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,580
has a heart beating just for him,

126
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,180
he can become an ordinary human.

127
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,900
A beating heart...

128
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,660
What does that even mean?

129
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,060
No idea.

130
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,340
For centuries,

131
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,300
no one's ever succeeded.

132
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,180
Yingying is gone.

133
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,740
My brother's gone too.

134
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,220
I'm left here all alone.

135
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,140
What's the point?

136
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,100
Are you going to

137
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,580
plant Noctrose too?

138
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,620
Take care of my brother.

139
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,060
I'm leaving now.

140
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,660
Chong Yang.

141
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,260
I'll find a way

142
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,940
to wake you up again.

143
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,980
Even if it takes my whole life,

144
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,620
