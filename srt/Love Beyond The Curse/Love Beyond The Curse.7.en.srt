20
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,620
Mr. Chong Yang,

21
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,340
my grandpa asked me
to bring you these.

22
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,580
There was a fight.

23
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,140
You didn't win.

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,340
Mr. Chong Yang.

25
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,540
If that's all, I'll head back now.

26
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,820
Wait a second.

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,900
Spar with me.

28
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,100
Let's begin.

29
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,380
You've improved.

30
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,780
Sir.

31
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,340
It's late.

32
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,660
Is there something urgent?

33
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,140
Have a drink with me.

34
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,620
Xici.

35
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,220
Feels like we haven't had drinks in ages.

36
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,740
When was the last time?

37
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,460
It's been over three years.

38
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,820
Remember when you drank as a kid,

39
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,700
you'd always tell me
what was on your mind.

40
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,540
All those worries from back then.

41
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,940
When I look back,

42
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,820
none of it really matters.

43
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,300
Xici,

44
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,760
after Hualing fell unconscious,

45
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,260
you've changed a lot.

46
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,690
It's only when you lose something

47
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,940
that you start to value it.

48
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,580
Life is about losing things, after all.

49
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,940
I'm no exception, honestly.

50
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,700
I know today is Hualing's birthday.

51
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,580
I didn't want you
to be alone, overthinking.

52
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:37,780
(I'll wait for you tomorrow at 9 pm
at the foot of the hills in the suburbs.)

53
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,700
(Up to some tricks again?)

54
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,340
Is he really not coming?

55
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,420
How can he be so cold?

56
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,500
It's almost 9 pm.

57
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,340
With what we have between us,

58
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,700
does what I say not matter at all?

59
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,380
Wait,

60
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,740
I didn't sign my name
on the note I gave him.

61
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,220
He knows it was me, right?

62
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,620
Don't scare me!

63
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,180
Don't touch me!

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,420
Chong Yang.

68
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,220
I knew you'd show up.

69
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,420
That's scary.

70
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,300
It's so late.

71
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,580
What are you doing here?

72
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,700
I have good news.

73
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,460
Remember the Love Flower
I told you about?

74
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,740
Yeah, I remember.

75
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,460
It's right at the top of that hill.

76
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,440
Don't you want to check it out?

77
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,780
No, I don't.

78
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,940
But so many girls have gone missing.

79
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,140
Let's go investigate.

80
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,420
What if we find them?

81
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,860
Guess that's a good deed, right?

82
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,940
I don't really care.

83
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,060
But I do care.

84
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,900
Come on, just go with me.

85
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,900
Let go.

86
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,060
No, I won't.

87
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,820
Hey, Yang.

88
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,740
Yang.

89
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,460
Just come have a look with me.

90
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,060
Please?

91
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,990
I'm not going.

92
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,580
Come on, Yang.

93
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,420
Let's go.

94
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,420
I'm so tired.

95
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,580
Firefly!

96
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,900
Chong Yang, look!

97
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,020
There are fireflies!

98
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,620
Slow down.

99
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,020
What a beautiful garden.

100
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,540
No wonder they call this
the Mount Spirit's garden.

101
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,220
This looks like
the Wanting Lotus I planted.

102
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,580
It's so beautiful.

103
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,540
Chong Yang, look.

104
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,820
Such a pretty flower.

105
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,220
Oh wow.

106
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,300
You're smiling.

107
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,740
No, I'm not.

108
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,460
I saw you. You smiled.

109
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,420
I didn't smile.

110
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,860
That's nonsense.

111
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,100
Aren't we here for something serious?

112
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,740
Right. We're here for the Love Flower.

113
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,100
But the garden seems pretty normal.

114
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,290
Even if we don't find the Love Flower,

115
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,100
we can still leave here safely.

116
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,700
Then what about those missing girls?

117
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,460
Firefly.

118
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,020
This firefly

119
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,020
doesn't look like the ones
I usually see.

120
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,300
Why does it even bite people?

121
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,060
Something's off.

122
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,100
Let's go.

123
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,700
These aren't fireflies.

124
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,900
They're gu parasites.

125
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,140
Looks like the missing girls

126
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,940
all ran into gu here.

127
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,540
Who would plant so many flowers here

128
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,060
and use them to raise gu?

129
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,100
You're poisoned.

130
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,340
I'm feeling dizzy.

131
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,460
Nanxing.

132
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,060
Nanxing!

133
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,740
My lord,

134
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,020
the gus inside them are restless.

135
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,940
Someone is at the Hilltop Garden.

136
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,740
Send someone to check.

137
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,860
Yes.
