20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,600
(Who are you, really?)

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,240
(Why do you keep staying with me,)

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,640
(caring for me, and saving me?)

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,720
(I'm trying hard to make him love me,)

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,360
(so that I can survive.)

25
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,320
(But I ended up falling for him.)

26
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,760
Sir.

27
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,120
Xici,

28
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,120
have you heard of the Love Flower?

29
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,040
Rumor has it

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,240
that if you get the Love Flower,

31
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,760
you can win over the one you love.

32
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,980
This

33
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,960
sounds a bit too wild, doesn't it?

34
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,080
I don't think it's that crazy.

35
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,900
People in the Miao Region

36
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,500
are known for
their witchcraft of romance.

37
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,340
If I remember right,

38
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,940
Xici,

39
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,060
your ancestors were from
the Miao Region.

40
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,340
Sir,

41
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,620
my great-grandfather had

42
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,180
already settled down in Nan'an City.

43
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,340
You probably know that better than I.

44
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,180
All that Miao Region stuff

45
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,750
has been lost by my generation.

46
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,020
Really?

47
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,060
I was hoping to ask you

48
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,020
more about witchcraft and voodoo arts.

49
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,460
If you want to know,

50
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,020
I'll look into it,

51
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,860
see if anything left by my ancestors

52
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,580
mentions witchcraft and voodoo arts.

53
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,140
Sounds good.

54
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,380
Then, can you check

55
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,300
if this is yours?

56
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,980
(Meng)

57
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,060
(Meng)

58
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,900
Xici,

59
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,780
this token belongs to you, right?

60
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,140
Yes.

61
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,420
Who at your place has this token?

62
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,020
Besides me,

63
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,300
each of my managers has one.

64
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,340
Sir,

65
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,780
where did you get this token?

66
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,620
I just found it.

67
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,900
Did someone in my house break the rules?

68
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,900
I'll make sure to look into it.

69
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,460
(Meng)

70
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,100
Xici,

71
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,620
you should watch the people around you.

72
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,860
Don't let others use you for their plans.

73
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,620
Understood.

74
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,700
(Meng)

75
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,260
(Maybe that token is just a coincidence.)

76
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,180
(Xici doesn't seem like
that type of person.)

77
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,500
(Those gu parasites
in the Hilltop Garden…)

78
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,740
(Were they naturally there?)

79
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,460
(Or did someone plan this?)

80
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,740
Mr. Meng.

81
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,860
I just saw Meng Xici earlier.

82
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,580
You're awake now.

83
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,580
Why is he here?

84
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,940
You know each other?

85
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,100
How did you two meet?

86
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,300
Does he know you're from Yongye Clan?

87
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,420
I once saved the Meng Family ancestor.

88
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,820
To repay me,

89
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,820
they chose to serve me for generations.

90
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,660
Because of my identity,

91
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,100
I can't show up in public easily,

92
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,820
so they handle things for me instead.

93
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,940
The Meng family, who rule Nan'an City,

94
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,180
are actually your helpers?

95
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,140
Yang,

96
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,700
you're honestly amazing.

97
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,820
By the way, there are many Wanting Lotus
in the garden.

98
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,500
That species is hard to grow.

99
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,460
Someone from the Meng family
asked me for a bunch.

100
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,660
So, could this garden

101
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,180
have anything to do with the Mengs?

102
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,540
It's just some flowers.

103
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,900
Don't overthink it.

104
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,420
No wonder the gu parasite moved.

105
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,180
Turns out Chong Yang went to the garden.

106
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,100
Why did he go there?

107
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,900
So,

108
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,660
will Lord Chong Yang
start to suspect you?

109
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,420
He probably won't, for now.

110
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,220
But he's found the gu parasite.

111
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,900
Sooner or later,
he'll trace it back to me.

112
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,740
My lord,

113
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,460
you've been close
to Lord Chong Yang as brothers.

114
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,660
If he ever finds out

115
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,540
you've been lying to him,

116
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,180
well...

117
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,500
You know nothing.

118
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,820
Close as brothers, huh?

119
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,860
Some brotherhood that turned out to be.

120
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,580
Ever since he stood by and watched Hualing

121
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,700
die right in front of him,

122
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,860
and from the moment he didn't help,

123
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,500
all I feel is hatred for him.

124
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,020
But why was Ji Nanxing there?

125
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,260
What was she doing at Ye Mansion?

126
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,700
They seem pretty close, don't they?

127
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,580
Chong Yang,

128
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,250
are you starting to care too?

129
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,580
Mr. Meng, you're here.

130
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,330
I'm here to drop this off.

131
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,420
By the way, Nanxing,

132
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,380
I noticed your hand was hurt recently.

133
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,300
Here's the best healing balm
from my clinic.

134
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,540
Give it a try.

135
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,860
Mr. Meng, you're too kind.

136
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,660
My hand is almost healed up.

137
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,620
You're someone Mr. Chong values.

138
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,300
Of course I'll look out for you.

139
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,460
I'm really not.

140
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,900
Xici.

141
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,620
Sir.

142
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,780
What brings you here?

143
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,370
Got a box of great tea.

144
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,900
Thought I'd let you try some.

145
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,420
That's thoughtful.

146
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,180
Mr. Meng pays attention to details.

147
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,620
He even gave me med for wounds.

148
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,260
Miss Nanxing

149
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,260
can grow rare plants.

150
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,350
Her hands really need to be protected.

151
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,980
Mr. Meng, I'm flattered.

152
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,500
You're all here.

153
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,780
Xici.

154
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,060
Xici, you're here.

155
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,620
You always bring me cool stuff.

156
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,300
What is it this time?

157
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,660
This is great wine from the north.

158
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,980
Come on, try it.

159
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,580
No, thanks.

160
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,020
I don't drink.

161
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,360
He did help me out once,

162
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,060
but I took care of his flowers too.

163
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,900
Right?

164
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,860
Didn't you use to…

165
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,380
I quit it.

166
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,820
Really?

167
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,940
By the way, Miss Yingying,

168
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,180
I asked someone specially

169
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,260
to bring this scarf for you
from Yangzhou.

170
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,380
Hope you like it.

171
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,460
Xici,

172
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,860
you really know how to pick gifts.

173
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,060
Thank you.

174
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,940
Sir,

175
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,460
please try this.

176
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,540
Stay and have some tea with me.

177
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,140
Ji Nanxing,

178
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,900
make some tea.

179
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,700
The tea you pick always suits my taste.

180
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,300
I've known you for years, sir.

181
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,780
It's really nothing worth mentioning.

182
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,300
Xici.

183
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,780
Hualing...

184
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,340
She's been in a coma for 3 years.

185
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,380
Yes.

186
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,980
I know it's hard for you to let go,

187
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,340
so I never brought it up.

188
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,860
But we all have to move forward.

189
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,580
Is there someone you like now?

190
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,260
Someone I like?

191
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,780
Who do you think it could be?

192
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,460
I'm here at Ye Mansion all day,

193
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,220
so how would I know?

194
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,420
There's a new girl at Ye Mansion now.

195
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,500
What do you think of her?

196
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,300
You mean Ji Nanxing?

197
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,980
Are you interested in her?

198
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,180
I don't have any intentions,

199
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,660
especially not toward Miss Nanxing.

200
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,860
But now that I think about it,

201
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,340
you care about her even more than I do.

202
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,300
Do I, though?

203
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,860
(Chong Yang,
looks like you really like her.)

204
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,900
What are you doing?

205
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,420
I'm not doing anything.

206
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,700
Just checking what you're up to.

207
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,540
Why does it matter to you what I do?

208
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,380
Why are you so mad again?

209
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,220
When you got that gift earlier,

210
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,290
you looked pretty happy.

211
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,220
Are you jealous?

212
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
Jealous of what, exactly?

213
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,260
Here, take this.

214
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,460
(Since you're jealous,)

215
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,020
(I'll give you a little reward.)
