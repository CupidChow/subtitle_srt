=Love Beyond The Curse=

19

=Episode 1=

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,840
(The Yongye people
are blessed with eternal life.)

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,320
(But maybe this is fate's punishment.)

22
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,440
(Because their loved ones
would drift away)

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,240
(from them.)

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,480
(To end this endless existence,)

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,120
(they have to plant a Noctrose)

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
(with their hearts.)

27
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,800
(When the flower blooms,)

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,080
(they'll be free.)

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,640
(Yan Maidens of the Yan Clan
live only briefly.)

30
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,160
(To extend this fleeting life,)

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,360
(they must love a Yongye Clan member.)

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,240
(If it's true love,)

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,480
(it can break the curse of early death.)

34
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,720
Too bad,

35
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,400
I only have three months to live.

36
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,920
(The Noctrose is reacting oddly.)

37
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,640
(Yan Maiden.)

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,160
It hurts.

39
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,440
Who are you?

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,640
You're awake.

41
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,480
Who are you?

42
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Are you from Yongye Clan?

43
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,200
The scent of Yan Maiden's blood

44
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,320
attracts Yongye Clan members.

45
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,040
Looks like I guessed right.

46
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,120
You are a Yongye Clan member.

47
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,240
Aren't you scared of me?

48
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,410
No, I'm not.

49
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,780
You should already know

50
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,400
what it means to know who I am.

51
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,320
Your blood is incredibly valuable

52
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,640
to the Yongye Clan.

53
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,040
In my eyes,

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,520
you're nothing

55
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,120
but a rare delicacy.

56
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,800
Yet now you want me to save you.

57
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,920
Please save me.

58
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,920
If you don't help me now,

59
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,640
I've got three months left at most.

60
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,560
If I die now,

61
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,860
it's no different than dying later.

62
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,800
How can I save you?

63
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,240
Yan Maidens have always been florists.

64
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,000
Our lives are short, like flowers.

65
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,960
We'll wither when our time comes.

66
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,560
None of us lives past twenty-five.

67
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,520
It starts on a full moon night,

68
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,200
with burning pain and a heavy heart.

69
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,720
Then, we'll be deprived

70
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,040
of all senses and die.

71
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,560
Unless...

72
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,160
Unless I marry a Yongye Clan member,

73
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,560
I could keep living.

74
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,920
Marriage?

75
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,280
Marriage is serious.

76
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,000
Aren't you ashamed?

77
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,480
Yan Clan values walking marriage.

78
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,200
Isn't that just natural for us?

79
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,680
Ridiculous.

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,840
It's true.

81
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,490
There was once a Yan Maiden

82
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,590
who married a Yongye member.

83
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,040
She lived until she was eighty.

84
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,340
I'm begging you.

85
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,160
I don't want to die. Please help me.

86
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,320
What's so bad about dying?

87
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,720
You Yongye people live forever.

88
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,040
How could you know our struggles?

89
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,880
I just want to survive.

90
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,320
I want to live like a normal person.

91
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,080
This so-called eternal life

92
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,640
isn't always a blessing.

93
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,320
Life and death are fate. Don't force it.

94
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,120
I've searched everywhere to find you,

95
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,460
even made a boat my home.

96
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,480
It took so much to reach you,

97
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,600
but you...

98
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,120
You should be glad
I haven't hurt you yet.

99
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,280
If you help me...

100
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
If you just help me,

101
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,800
I'd serve as your comfort food forever.

102
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,800
Can you walk?

103
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,440
If you can, then leave now.

104
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,200
For centuries,

105
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,160
the Noctrose stayed a bud.

106
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,560
It never changed at all.

107
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,240
But when Yan Maiden showed up,

108
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,800
the bud opened a little.

109
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,240
Why did that happen?

110
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,120
Looks like the one destined
to bloom the Noctrose

111
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
has come.

112
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,000
Do you mean

113
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,600
the flower opens when she's here?

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,840
Or do you mean...

115
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,440
You need to

116
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,080
find the answer yourself.

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,840
Where's the flower?

118
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,240
Where is it?

119
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,520
Go look for it!

120
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,760
Hurry up!

121
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,310
What are you doing?

122
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,440
Why did you ruin my flowers?

123
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,800
Hey, what are you doing?

124
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,920
You took money from the Meng family.

125
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,680
We agreed on a one-month delivery.

126
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,960
It's way past that now!

127
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,320
Wanting Lotus isn't easy to grow.

128
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,400
Look, can't we just talk this out?

129
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,640
Why are you wrecking my flowers?

130
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,600
Stop with the excuses.

131
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
If I don't deliver on time,

132
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,880
you're the one who'll pay.

133
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,200
(I can feel it. It's that woman.)

134
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,520
Guys,

135
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,880
throw the flowers into the river.

136
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,040
Smash everything!

137
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,930
Got it.

138
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,600
I'm begging you.

139
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,880
- Please stop.
- Get lost.

140
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,860
Stop?

141
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,300
You can forget about this business.

142
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,240
I'll deliver it

143
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,880
as soon as the seeds are ready.

144
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,880
