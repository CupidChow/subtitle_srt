1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,880
(EXchange - Another Beginning)

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,880
(I'm being a little swayed right now.)

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,079
Finally, this is the last episode...

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,089
- of EXchange - Another Beginning. - Yes.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,259
In the past, EXchange consisted...

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,519
of 20 episodes, wasn't it?

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,920
- Right. - Right?

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,890
Since this one is only eight episodes, it's very short.

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,999
I knew that it'd be short, but...

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,159
It's too short.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,829
While watching the first episode,

12
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,099
I expected it to be...

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,769
fun and casual.

14
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,109
From friendship to flings,

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,579
- their emotions keep changing. - Right.

16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,409
It became escalated especially after the 1st-come, 1st-served chat.

17
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,979
Yes, it's so much fun.

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,950
In the preview, they were making their final decisions.

19
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,249
I can't wait to find out...

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,250
how this show will end.

21
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:50,259
For Kwan Woo and Hye Seon,

22
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,589
we thought that they were a couple...

23
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,259
- from the start. - Right.

24
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,629
- However, - During their last conversation?

25
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,729
It seemed like they were falling out.

26
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,229
I wonder how it will turn out.

27
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,799
Finally, we will find out everything today.

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,599
After their 1-on-1 trip,

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,669
there will definitely be a change of heart.

30
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,339
- Right. - Definitely.

31
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,170
Let's watch how things change.

32
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,380
- I can't wait to find out. - There will be changes for sure.

33
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,650
(The day of their last trip on Jeju Island)

34
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,049
Hi.

35
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,120
- Hello. - Hey.

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
I was happy.

37
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:25,090
I thought that Hwi Hyun also wanted to get to know me better.

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,489
Whom did you expect?

39
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,129
I thought that it'd be you.

40
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,230
Were you waiting for long?

41
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,430
No, I just got here too.

42
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,500
"Oh, I'm relieved that it's Kwan Woo."

43
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,699
Let's draw each other's faces...

44
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,570
and our dog.

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,800
Let's wear the shirt tonight.

46
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,170
I should draw very well.

47
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,209
It was my first time looking at her up close.

48
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,980
I was nervous in the beginning.

49
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,780
There are wedding dresses here.

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,050
Are we getting married?

51
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,220
It made me feel strange.

52
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,160
It really felt weird.

53
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,730
The photo shoot made it feel like a real date.

54
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,360
It feels like we're on a honeymoon in Bali.

55
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,200
You're really good at posing.

56
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,670
(Everyone went on a 1-on-1 trip that made their hearts flutter.)

57
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,070
- You've got some on your nose. - It's delicious.

58
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,079
I've spent most of my time...

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,780
with Min Jae.

60
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,820
It made me rely on him.

61
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,879
Of all the four days,

62
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,620
was there a moment that made you the happiest?

63
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,090
It's right now.

64
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,660
- Right now? - Yes.

65
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,160
I felt comfortable around you.

66
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,330
He was an even better person than I thought.

67
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,970
I'm so cold.

68
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,640
Hurry. I'm cold.

69
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,370
- It looks pretty. - Isn't it cute?

70
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,770
You look like a model.

71
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,510
The T-shirt looks like a luxury brand on you.

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,049
It wasn't my intention to flirt with her.

73
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,680
She looked so pretty that I couldn't help but say it.

74
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,520
(Episode 8: Another Beginning)

75
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,299
(On their way back to Jeju Island House)

76
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,530
Let's get going.

77
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,730
I wonder what we will do back in the house.

78
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,330
Are we eating something delicious?

79
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,599
Their T-shirts match.

80
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
They look cute.

81
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,469
I used up all my energy.

82
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,640
I didn't expect to work so hard.

83
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,909
I didn't expect making T-shirts would be this fun either.

84
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,950
It was fun.

85
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,779
Didn't it make you feel ambitious?

86
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,980
Yes, I wanted to do a good job, and we did.

87
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,450
We made them nice and cute.

88
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,990
I feel proud of the result.

89
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,090
Honestly, I'll be able to wear it when I go out.

90
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,700
Me too.

91
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,100
- When you go out? - Yes.

92
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,029
- It's very cute. - Let's meet up in this T-shirt.

93
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,800
It's exactly what I like.

94
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,100
Setting up a date?

95
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,510
They promised to meet so naturally.

96
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,179
When you make something together...

97
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,909
or wear something given by someone,

98
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,109
you keep thinking about that person.

99
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,480
- Right. - Definitely.

100
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,010
It will definitely happen.

101
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,820
- There's a bump. Be careful. - Gosh.

102
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,249
The bump is high.

103
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,789
- Do I park anywhere? - Yes.

104
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,260
(Hwi Hyun and Na Eon return to Jeju Island House.)

105
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,789
Nice.

106
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,730
- Thank you for driving. - Thank you.

107
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,800
- The ride was very smooth. - Yes.

108
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,470
(Hwi Hyun runs up to Na Eon with a jacket in case she's cold.)

109
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,540
(He puts his jacket on her.)

110
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,409
Thank you. Let's hurry inside.

111
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,410
It's so cold.

112
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,220
Where would Own be?

113
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,220
Is the house empty?

114
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,490
Yes.

115
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,290
Should we keep our T-shirts on?

116
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,830
- Let's keep it on. - Okay.

117
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,469
It's quite chilly now that it's the evening.

118
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,630
It's very cold.

119
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,240
(Min Jae and Lee Ji Yeon come inside right after them.)

120
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,179
- Hello. - Hi.

121
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,080
- Hello. - When did you get back?

122
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,080
- Five minutes ago. - I see.

123
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,449
What did you guys do?

124
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,580
- What? - What did you guys do?

125
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,849
This.

126
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,950
- What's that? - What is it?

127
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,960
- Did you make T-shirts? - We drew them.

128
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,429
- Did you draw it? - We drew it ourselves.

129
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,390
- Is it attached? - We also had food.

130
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,599
Today, you look like...

131
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,830
a real couple.

132
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,400
Black looks good on both of you.

133
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,770
That's nice.

134
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,449
Hi.

135
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,110
- Hello. - Did you have a safe trip?

136
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,220
Yes, we just got back.

137
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,819
What did you do?

138
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,919
- What? - What did you do?

139
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,990
We went to an amazing place.

140
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,859
- We shot a drama. - We shot a drama.

141
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,160
You shot a drama?

142
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,490
What kind of drama?

143
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,930
Did you go to a filming location?

144
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,360
A filming location for a drama.

145
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,960
- No, it wasn't a filming location. - Really?

146
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,330
Our presence turned it into a filming location.

147
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,939
I can't wait to find out...

148
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,470
- where they went. - Me neither.

149
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,639
It was beautiful.

150
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,770
I liked it.

151
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,680
Can you take a photo of me?

152
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,910
With a good shot of this T-shirt.

153
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,650
- We made T-shirts. - What's that?

154
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,810
He keeps bragging about the T-shirt.

155
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,149
As Hwi Hyun is wearing the T-shirt,

156
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,490
it looks even better.

157
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,190
- He has a nice figure. - Right.

158
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,160
What's that? It's so cute.

159
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,519
- We made T-shirt. - My gosh.

160
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,630
I'll take a photo of you.

161
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,090
They did something more fun than us.

162
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,400
Are you jealous?

163
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,930
What?

164
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:37,030
- Are you jealous? - You shouldn't have said that.

165
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,099
(Min Jae finds the situation funny.)

166
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,769
I wasn't exactly thinking.

167
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,239
Hwi Hyun's T-shirt looked so cute,

168
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,640
so it just came out.

169
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,250
That's scary.

170
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,980
Disappointed.

171
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,890
Our Uyuni Salt Flat was nice too.

172
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,590
We...

173
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,559
You must have gotten some beautiful photos.

174
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,690
(Kwan Woo is busy coming up with excuses and posing.)

175
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,460
(They take a break while drinking some coffee.)

176
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,610
What do you think of my outfit?

177
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,450
Should I just wear this?

178
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,720
Do you have a different color for the T-shirt?

179
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,790
Why do you look so sad?

180
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,260
(Na Eon wants to keep the T-shirt she made with Hwi Hyun on.)

181
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,530
I have so many clothes but nothing to wear.

182
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,970
This is the only thing I have...

183
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,180
that I can wear over this T-shirt.

184
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,449
That looks better...

185
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,579
- without the vest. - Is this better?

186
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,649
- Shall I wear this? - Yes.

187
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,149
- It looks cute. - Doesn't it look weird?

188
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,280
No, it reminds me of Christmas.

189
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,420
Holy, holy Christmas

190
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,630
Holy, holy Christmas

191
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,860
- Can you send it to me? - I put your jacket up there.

192
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,930
- Really? - Why aren't you wearing it?

193
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,570
Is that it?

194
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,670
I thought that it would look similar to his.

195
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,910
- It looks nice. - It looks like you.

196
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,710
I drew her dog, Dal on the back.

197
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,640
- You drew well. - It looks pretty.

198
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,650
She gave me a nickname "Silken Tofu Boy."

199
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
I also wanted to give her a nickname related to food.

200
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,719
The shape of her face reminded me of an acorn.

201
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,820
It looks like her.

202
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,390
Are you going upstairs?

203
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,300
- Are you going to the living room? - Wait.

204
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,700
- What are you doing? - Hurry over here.

205
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,069
I thought of an incredible game just now.

206
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,270
- What? - What?

207
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,479
A friend flirting with your girlfriend versus...

208
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,079
your girlfriend flirting with your best friend.

209
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
(Which one is worse?)

210
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,549
Wait, what did you say?

211
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,949
- What did you say? - This is insulting.

212
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,649
- It must be his girlfriend. - My girlfriend...

213
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,880
Wait a minute.

214
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,789
- Wait. - It's your best friend ever.

215
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,949
- With my best friend... - Someone you grew up with.

216
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,589
What if your best friend is flirting with your girlfriend?

217
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,860
That? I see.

218
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,590
My friend flirting with my girlfriend is worse.

219
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,030
That would be horrible.

220
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,269
(Min Jae's answer is true.)

221
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,000
- Why doesn't it detect you? - Even I...

222
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,510
I'd never do that.

223
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,709
- Goodness. - Let's do this one.

224
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,879
- Okay. - Okay.

225
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,510
How far can you go with physical contact in public?

226
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,180
- In public? - Yes.

227
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,279
Let's say that your girlfriend is here.

228
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,850
- How far can you go? - Everyone is looking at you.

229
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,450
As far as hugging.

230
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,789
- Say your answer. - As far as hugging.

231
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,619
- You can't even give her a peck? - Are you telling him to hug?

232
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,289
How can I give her a peck in public?

233
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,630
- Everyone does it. - Why not?

234
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,529
- While everyone is watching you? - Who cares?

235
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,400
I was going to ask if you could give her a French kiss.

236
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,669
(Hwi Hyun lied.)

237
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,370
You were lying.

238
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,070
What a sneaky boy.

239
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,510
"Sneaky boy?"

240
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,810
He's showing different sides of him.

241
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,850
- What a sneaky boy. - He said that he'd only hug.

242
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,749
After saying that pecking wasn't possible...

243
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,289
This is funny.

244
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,689
This is a lie.

245
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,959
The lie detector is lying.

246
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,219
You're lying.

247
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,619
This is so funny.

248
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,890
- The detector is lying. - But why...

249
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,260
Let's do this one.

250
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,430
Who do you think is the best-looking?

251
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,030
- The best-looking? - Yes.

252
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,939
That question sounds...

253
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,640
- direct. - What?

254
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,340
Ji Yeon's answer was Gyu Min.

255
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,250
- The best-looking? - Yes.

256
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,080
It's very difficult for her to answer.

257
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,720
I'll say Kwang Tae.

258
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,660
- I don't believe you. - The way she said it...

259
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,129
(Kwang Tae is the best-looking. True.)

260
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,170
- Did you change your opinion? - What?

261
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,800
They spent a long time together.

262
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,940
Is it love?

263
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,910
Hye Seon, how was your day?

264
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,720
Today?

265
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,620
It was the best date I ever had.

266
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,750
- Your best date ever? - Yes.

267
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,459
That's fascinating.

268
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,730
I don't mean the best date of my life.

269
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,399
- I mean, ever since we came here. - Okay.

270
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,730
- During our time here? - Yes, during our time here.

271
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,670
- Would you like some? - Yes.

272
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,870
It has a baby smell.

273
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,940
A baby smell with some musk.

274
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,109
It gets absorbed very quickly.

275
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,380
It isn't sticky.

276
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,180
I need some rest.

277
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,619
- Let's take a rest for a minute. - I'm so tired.

278
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,049
- Lights out? - Lights out? Okay.

279
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,390
(They decide to take a short rest.)

280
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,120
Ji Yeon.

281
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,360
- What? - Was it just comfortable...

282
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,230
hanging out with Min Jae?

283
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,770
How shall I put it?

284
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,869
I don't know if it's lovey-dovey with him.

285
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,240
It's hard to tell.

286
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,580
We talked about relationships.

287
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,110
I don't know...

288
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,510
if everyone else talks about that.

289
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,450
- It's hard to compare. - I see.

290
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,620
Kwan Woo and I talked for a while.

291
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,760
Over such...

292
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,130
a short period of time,

293
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,900
my heart has never fluttered.

294
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,000
I never had that experience.

295
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,569
On the other hand, Kwan Woo seems...

296
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,140
capable of it.

297
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,970
And so, how shall I say this?

298
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,839
He's so different from me...

299
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,880
that I'm not on the same level with him.

300
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,710
Now I feel...

301
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,780
quite comfortable with him.

302
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,460
I still don't know...

303
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,460
what kind of person he is.

304
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,390
Kwan Woo is very careful...

305
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,299
when he talks about himself.

306
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,230
I felt the same way about him.

307
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,599
He thinks before he speaks.

308
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,539
It sounds funny to put it that way.

309
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,740
Everyone thinks before they speak.

310
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,639
Sometimes, I speak without thinking.

311
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,909
- No way. - You know what I mean?

312
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,550
I often speak without thinking.

313
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,449
It seems like Kwan Woo would think before saying something.

314
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,350
He says that he filters his words 3 or 4 times.

315
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,789
I don't mind his filtering,

316
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,789
but it's hard to get to know him.

317
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,230
He hasn't talked about himself much.

318
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,300
He doesn't bring up personal things about him.

319
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,830
He answers to my questions very well.

320
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,170
However,

321
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,909
- he doesn't say more than that. - He doesn't give much information.

322
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,079
When we make a point of contact,

323
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,680
our conversation can get deeper.

324
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,009
That's when I feel touched,

325
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,520
but we haven't gotten that far yet.

326
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,090
In our conversation.

327
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,229
- Such a conversation is important. - Of course.

328
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,130
I wanted that kind of conversation because we don't have much time.

329
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,629
I asked him if he had questions for me.

330
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,269
As he asks me questions,

331
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,739
I could ask him as well.

332
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,469
If he has no questions for me,

333
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,869
it might not be polite to keep asking him questions.

334
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,409
- Some people... - It makes you more careful.

335
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,040
Some people hate talking about themselves.

336
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,780
- That's why. - Right.

337
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,379
He's very cautious.

338
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,219
The reason why Hye Seon feels that way...

339
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,219
could be Kwan Woo's personality.

340
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,419
Or she can't open up to him...

341
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,789
because he doesn't show enough interest in her.

342
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,490
- The reason could be the latter. - Right.

343
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,460
She wants to take her time to get to know him.

344
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,230
- The spark between them isn't big. - No.

345
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,999
I think it's his personality.

346
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,100
They have to see each other in private.

347
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,440
Min Jae talks about his family a lot.

348
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,380
So I felt comfortable enough to talk about my parents too.

349
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,449
I really liked that.

350
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,880
He wasn't so discreet, so I could feel the same.

351
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,150
I can talk to him about anything.

352
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,389
He's also down-to-earth.

353
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,990
That's why we get along so well.

354
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,259
- He might not agree with me. - Right.

355
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,260
(But I get along with him.)

356
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:26,730
Are you more interested in him now?

357
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,069
Yes, I feel comfortable around him.

358
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,940
It's so unfortunate that tomorrow is our last day.

359
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,170
Seriously.

360
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,570
It's true.

361
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,279
- If we had more time... - If we had a few more days...

362
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,879
(The trip seems very short.)

363
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,580
Things could be different.

364
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,379
- Right. - They get along so well.

365
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,479
They really do.

366
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,579
They're comfortable around each other.

367
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,620
Their age gap is ten years.

368
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,320
- But I don't see any gap. - Eleven? Exactly.

369
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,989
They should be given at least two weeks.

370
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,190
Everyone is so bummed out.

371
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,829
(The sun sets, and the night approaches.)

372
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,800
- Hye Im. - Yes.

373
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,600
What are you doing?

374
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,099
I'm looking at this.

375
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,439
- What is it? - Do you know...

376
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,700
this application?

377
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,769
- What is it? - I don't have time...

378
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,670
to go to department stores.

379
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,209
- I use this a lot for shopping. - Really?

380
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,349
It has many brands.

381
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,379
Their products are of good quality.

382
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,720
- Is it Handsome? - Yes.

383
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,780
- You know it, right? - Yes, I like Handsome.

384
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,420
- This looks good. - Top 100 looks good.

385
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,190
Isn't it easy to shop?

386
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,519
I bought this top on this app.

387
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,229
Really? I like your sweatshirt.

388
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,090
- Isn't it cute? Right? - The quality looks nice.

389
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,699
I like it. The jeans are cute too.

390
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,030
Let me see how they fit you.

391
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,029
They have a pretty straight fit.

392
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,030
They also have this detail.

393
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:39,339
- I also like the length. - Right?

394
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,800
They go well with your sweatshirt.

395
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,109
They look cute.

396
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,380
- This is my outfit for dinner. - You should.

397
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,040
I'm wearing a T-shirt that Hwi Hyun drew for me.

398
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,779
Is it an acorn or a person?

399
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,150
An acorn person.

400
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,080
- He says that it's Acorn Na Eon. - Seriously.

401
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,749
It's our last day. We should drink.

402
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,989
Are we getting drunk tonight?

403
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,360
(Everyone has gathered in the communal space.)

404
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,659
Hwi Hyun, you should give a toast.

405
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,170
- Me? - Go ahead.

406
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,369
Really?

407
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,299
- My drink is getting heavy. - Today...

408
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,609
- "My drink is getting heavy?" - It's been nice to get to know you.

409
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,740
Thanks to you, I feel like I'm dreaming.

410
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,339
Cheers. Wait.

411
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,539
Shall we say, "Let's go, EXchange?"

412
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,739
- Okay. - That sounds good.

413
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,180
- Let's go, EXchange! - Let's go, EXchange!

414
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Let's go.

415
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,890
That's funny. His speech...

416
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,789
- It's annoying how he's good at it. - I agree.

417
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,159
- He's so good. - That was a nice toast.

418
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,189
Seriously.

419
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,189
- If we didn't ask him... - I prepared it.

420
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,299
He's the type to be the class president.

421
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,759
- Exactly. - Right?

422
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,399
If we didn't ask him, he would've been sad.

423
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Seriously.

424
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,610
It's strong.

425
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,270
It has too much alcohol.

426
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,839
- A drink should be this strong. - Who made it?

427
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,279
- I made it. - Hwi Hyun.

428
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,579
You don't like it? Why?

429
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,880
Can I try yours?

430
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,949
- It's delicious. - Isn't it the same as yours?

431
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,120
I made them the same.

432
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,690
- Do you want some? - Are you saying that it's strong?

433
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,919
(Exclaiming)

434
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,530
- It tastes okay. - It's strong.

435
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,630
- "It's strong." - I added more tonic water to mine.

436
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,800
- I'll let it go since you're cute. - Do you want to try it?

437
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,799
- Even the color is different. - The color is different.

438
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,639
- Even the color is different. - They're very different.

439
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,340
Look at these.

440
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,640
Mine is sweet.

441
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,740
- He acted surprised. - It's very strong.

442
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,680
Hey.

443
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,350
(What will their relationship be like after their last night?)

444
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:45,130
(Hwi Hyun checks on his looks in the room.)

445
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,170
- Isn't that cologne? - Is he putting on some cologne?

446
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,970
Checking himself out.

447
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,569
Is he checking on his smell?

448
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,570
- Checking on his smell. - Checking on his smell?

449
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,710
He's planning to make some small talk.

450
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,180
(Hwi Hyun hurries off to somewhere.)

451
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,950
Are you on a date with Own?

452
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,989
- Isn't he adorable? - Yes.

453
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,630
I got closer to Own.

454
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,690
Where are you going, Own?

455
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,600
Should I play this? It's good.

456
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,770
- Is it playing? - Na Eon.

457
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,870
- What is it? - Open it.

458
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,040
What is it?

459
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,570
Did you buy the cap?

460
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,809
- It looked so good on you. - When did you buy it?

461
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,979
When you went to the restroom.

462
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,710
- Really? That's amazing. - Yes.

463
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,619
I don't have a yellow cap.

464
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,450
It looks good on you. You look like a farmer.

465
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,789
- Does it look good on me? - Yes, put it on properly.

466
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,020
- You try it on. - Will it mess up your hair?

467
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,720
I don't look good in hats.

468
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,359
Doesn't she look much better than me?

469
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,959
- It looks better on her. - Really?

470
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,429
Yes, it looks cute on you.

471
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,630
I'll take a look in the mirror.

472
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,169
Your face looks very small.

473
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,270
- It looks cute. - I told you.

474
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,339
(Hwi Hyun bought it secretly after seeing Na Eon.)

475
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,909
While looking around,

476
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,839
we found a cap that I liked.

477
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,880
While I went to the restroom, Hwi Hyun bought it for me...

478
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,280
as a gift.

479
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,749
The cap was so pretty.

480
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,050
I liked it.

481
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,549
She seemed happy, and it made her smile.

482
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,220
Giving it to her made me feel proud.

483
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,359
I wanted to thank you for driving.

484
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,730
Thank you for the pumpkin cap.

485
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,060
It looks so good on you. It definitely belongs to you.

486
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,370
It's a little big on me.

487
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
- Does it... - How small is your face?

488
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,140
- Do I look good? - Yes, it looked good on you.

489
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,740
- It fits me well. - It looks amazing on you.

490
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,640
- The color is nice on you too. - Yes.

491
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,210
It fits me very well.

492
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,520
I'll do it this time.

493
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,580
Wait.

494
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,060
(Hwi Hyun's Surprise Gift)

495
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,290
- Hwi Hyun can do things like that? - I know.

496
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,389
Do we even know him?

497
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,959
Hasn't it only been a year?

498
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,060
He became a different person after graduating.

499
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,900
- He even uses cologne. - I feel proud of him.

500
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,429
Why do I feel proud of him?

501
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,570
- That's a new side of him. - He bought a present for her.

502
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,440
It feels like watching him grow.

503
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,239
When did they go out?

504
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,440
Aren't they cold?

505
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,809
- I know. - It must be freezing outside.

506
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,179
They aren't even dressed...

507
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,780
warmly.

508
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,250
It's so passionate between them.

509
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,889
Can we listen to music...

510
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,590
for one minute?

511
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,860
- I want to make a request. - A request?

512
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,930
I listen to it the most these days.

513
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,130
There's a song called "To Lady" by Byun Jin Sub.

514
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,770
It came up right away.

515
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,440
- I'll listen to it. - I love it.

516
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,610
- You might recognize it. - Let's listen to it.

517
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,379
When I get obsessed with one song,

518
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,620
- I listen to it on repeat. - Only one song?

519
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,819
(They concentrate on the song.)

520
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,260
This song is very...

521
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,129
The lyrics speak to me a lot.

522
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,199
- Really? - Yes.

523
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,270
I'll listen to it.

524
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,800
It's like...

525
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:17,539
(I want to get to know you in detail)

526
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:24,010
(But you don't talk to me for some reason)

527
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:30,150
(I want to visit you in your dreams at night)

528
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,529
(And listen to you quietly)

529
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,959
I'm very bad at expressing myself.

530
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,200
Even when I'm interested in someone.

531
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,499
In a way...

532
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,870
During the bridge.

533
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,170
He spoke up at the right time during the bridge.

534
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,870
Right?

535
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,810
Is he a DJ or something?

536
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,039
- He's confessing his love to her. - Exactly.

537
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,379
The language of flowers is followed by the lyrics.

538
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,380
I know.

539
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:58,520
I'm very bad at expressing myself.

540
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,750
Even when I'm interested in someone.

541
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,019
In a way,

542
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,090
I could seem pathetic and timid.

543
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,989
When the other person is asleep,

544
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,889
I'll visit her in her dreams and ask.

545
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,629
That's what the lyrics are about.

546
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,799
I find that really beautiful.

547
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,829
That's why I like this song.

548
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,499
- In her dreams? - Yes.

549
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,370
- Since you can't talk in reality? - I don't have the courage...

550
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,909
to approach you and talk to you.

551
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,280
So when you're asleep,

552
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,980
I'll visit you in your dreams.

553
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,390
The lyrics are lovely.

554
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,530
They're turning...

555
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,239
their bodies toward each other.

556
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,739
After listening to a song called "To Lady,"

557
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,710
they'll listen to a song called "To My Bride."

558
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,840
That would be perfect...

559
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,839
- once the relationship gets deeper. - After that,

560
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,779
- "Old Couple in Their 60s?" - An old couple in their 60s.

561
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,780
(The 3 MCs are drawing a big picture.)

562
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,250
They make a great couple.

563
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,220
I went on a date with someone I feel very comfortable with.

564
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,390
I see.

565
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,220
We had a talk yesterday.

566
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,330
- With Park Ji Yeon? - Yes.

567
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,559
Surprisingly, we chose each other.

568
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,359
- Really? - Yes.

569
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,699
- We picked each other. - That's good.

570
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,270
Didn't it work out for you too?

571
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,099
Me? I went out with Hye Im.

572
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,140
Right.

573
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,839
I wanted to get to know Hye Im.

574
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,880
Right.

575
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,439
She has a great personality.

576
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,110
- Right? - Yes.

577
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,049
- Doesn't she smile a lot? - Yes.

578
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,019
They're amazing people.

579
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
I agree.

580
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,149
You know what would be fun?

581
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,719
Spending two more days in Jeju with someone you like.

582
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,159
That would be great.

583
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,330
- Don't you think? - Yes.

584
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,930
It was so short.

585
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,960
I expected it to be long,

586
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,530
but our time was very short.

587
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,539
- Really? - Cheers.

588
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,869
- There's a lot left. - Really?

589
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,870
(They were worried that it'd be long and boring, but it passed by fast.)

590
00:25:01,871 --> 00:25:03,939
(It feels sad to say goodbye.)

591
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,979
It's the last day.

592
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,040
From the start...

593
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,310
It's delicious.

594
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,749
I was cold, but now that we played a game...

595
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,180
- I feel heated. - That's funny.

596
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,750
The highball is really good since it's chilled.

597
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,120
What's this?

598
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,290
- This is really delicious. - Yes.

599
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,400
(The last night of their trip is coming to an end.)

600
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,199
Now that the trip is coming to an end,

601
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,969
people are getting thoughtful.

602
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,599
They're becoming more emotional.

603
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,670
Surprisingly, I'm worried about Hye Seon and Kwan Woo.

604
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,909
Hye Seon seems concerned.

605
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,910
- Yes. - I agree.

606
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:40,909
Is it because it feels awkward when they're together?

607
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,079
- Kwan Woo wasn't so enthusiastic. - Right.

608
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,809
He wasn't very talkative.

609
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,079
- So... - Right.

610
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,019
Hye Seon didn't make it obvious, but she seemed a bit disappointed.

611
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,020
Right.

612
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:53,489
The fact that she feels disappointed means...

613
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,929
- that she's interested in him. - Right.

614
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,159
They seem very similar to each other.

615
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,829
They also make a good couple. If it's just a misunderstanding,

616
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,340
- Right. - I hope that they'll sort it out.

617
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,240
(It's the morning of their last day.)

618
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,450
(Seogwipo Submarine)

619
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,220
Gosh, it's so cold today.

620
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:29,490
(He's preparing a simple breakfast.)

621
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,899
(He notices something.)

622
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,940
What?

623
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,080
What's this?

624
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:49,450
(There are 9 notes on the table.)

625
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,100
When did she write all these?

626
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,870
Na Eon wrote them.

627
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:21,580
(Na Eon wrote letters to everyone last night.)

628
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,349
- I see. - Na Eon did?

629
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,979
- Really? - To everyone?

630
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,149
Writing to nine people couldn't have been easy.

631
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,520
After listening...

632
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,819
- to that song... - Enchanted by the song?

633
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,589
She must have written them while listening to the song.

634
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,460
Na Eon is very attentive.

635
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,530
Yes.

636
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,600
- Hey, Kwang Tae. - Yes?

637
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,300
- You got a letter. - What?

638
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,869
I didn't know what it was about.

639
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,970
Go ahead and read it.

640
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,679
Isn't it that we're supposed to write to each other?

641
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,180
I was touched.

642
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,690
What? When did she write this?

643
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,020
I know. Isn't it touching?

644
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,390
Yes.

645
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,330
I'll eat upstairs.

646
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,560
It's so cold.

647
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,499
It's very cold.

648
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,770
(They go upstairs to have breakfast in the warm room.)

649
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,170
It was so short.

650
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,910
I can't believe we're leaving already.

651
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
I know.

652
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,149
- It's so cold. - It's cold.

653
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,520
- "It's freezing." - "It's freezing."

654
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,919
- "You didn't hug me." - "You didn't hug me."

655
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,690
- "Shouldn't you apologize to me?" - "Shouldn't you apologize to me?"

656
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,959
- "Apologize to me." - "Apologize to me."

657
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,089
That's hilarious.

658
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,229
It's hilarious.

659
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,790
- What is it? - I wrote them.

660
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,030
What is it?

661
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,159
I think some people took theirs. Am I wrong?

662
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,900
What is it? I'll read it.

663
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,839
- Hey. - Seriously?

664
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,869
- When did you write it? - When?

665
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,170
I wrote them because I couldn't fall asleep.

666
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,490
Goodness. Thank you.

667
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,460
This is really touching.

668
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,459
Not everyone is here.

669
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,730
My goodness.

670
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,499
Gosh, the princess is here.

671
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,970
Hye Seon, over here.

672
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,170
It's your mission card.

673
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,570
You made her nervous.

674
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,440
- Did you sleep well? - Hello.

675
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,979
- Na Eon. - Good morning.

676
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,079
- Na Eon. - Yes?

677
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,810
It was so touching.

678
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,249
When did you take it?

679
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,420
- I woke up early this morning. - Really?

680
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,390
I read it while having breakfast.

681
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,819
You almost made me cry.

682
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,060
Come on.

683
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:51,330
(Hye Seon also read the letter.)

684
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,799
Goodness. When did you write this, Na Eon?

685
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,930
Seriously.

686
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,200
How nice of her.

687
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,099
What is it?

688
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,439
- What will you wear on top? - A coat.

689
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,969
- Really? I'll wear my padded... - Is everyone wearing a coat?

690
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,710
I wanted to put something else on, but everyone else is wearing a coat.

691
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,410
- Hello. - Good morning.

692
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,979
- Hwi Hyun. - Hwi Hyun.

693
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,480
You got a letter from someone.

694
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,550
Am I supposed to write to everyone?

695
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,889
Who wrote it?

696
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,290
- I wrote one to everyone. - Na Eon.

697
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,890
Thank you.

698
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,429
I wonder what she wrote to Hwi Hyun.

699
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,799
She probably had the most to say to Hwi Hyun.

700
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,970
- Right. - He's the last one to receive it.

701
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:36,010
(Hye Seon is writing something in her notebook.)

702
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,250
(What is Hye Seon writing?)

703
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,580
Do you want me to send you photos from yesterday?

704
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,849
- Me? - Yes.

705
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,390
- Yes. - I'll send them to you.

706
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,889
- Gosh. - What's wrong?

707
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,759
- My bangs... - Send me all the photos.

708
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
I sent them all.

709
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,830
My bangs look good on me.

710
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,360
- Did you put it in? - Yes.

711
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,240
We got a text. Goodness.

712
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,600
What is it?

713
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,070
What?

714
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,079
(Your trip is over. Please write the name of a person...)

715
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,179
(you want to start a new relationship with...)

716
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,090
(and send a message to him or her.)

717
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,849
A person you want to start a new relationship with?

718
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,920
Yes, they're choosing someone to start with.

719
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,489
- A new relationship? A fling? - Yes.

720
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,789
That's a possibility.

721
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,859
Or someone you want to get to know more.

722
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,959
They didn't spend enough time...

723
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,030
- to call it love. - Right.

724
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,899
They aren't just acquaintances.

725
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,140
Their relationship is special.

726
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,369
It's too early to say...

727
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,939
- that they're in a relationship. - Right.

728
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,480
I think that it's more than friendship.

729
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,280
They will probably send the message to someone...

730
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,850
they want to continue their relationship with.

731
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,890
- It doesn't work. - It doesn't?

732
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,970
Why are you looking at me like that?

733
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,810
What?

734
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,080
What is it?

735
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,650
It seems like she's reading the look on my face.

736
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,860
(Hye Seon read the text in the room.)

737
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:38,230
(They need to send a text now.)

738
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:10,630
(Everyone's texts have been sent.)

739
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,900
(Final selection)

740
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,479
(Na Eon received a text.)

741
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,810
Why is it so long?

742
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,429
I think he referenced some things I wrote in my letter.

743
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,160
I was surprised at how long it was.

744
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:24,530
(Hwi Hyun went upstairs alone with the letter.)

745
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:30,770
(He slowly read the letter.)

746
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,639
I didn't have to think about it.

747
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,010
I sent it to Na Eon right away.

748
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,519
(I enjoyed every moment in Jeju with you.)

749
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,989
(I hope we can still see each other and talk about whatever...)

750
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,520
(even after the show. Hwi Hyun.)

751
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,859
(If you want to start a new relationship, )

752
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,789
(please go to the address below.)

753
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,360
(If not, please go to the airport.)

754
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,329
It says to go to the address below if she wants a new relationship...

755
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,100
and to go to the airport if she doesn't.

756
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,830
Wait.

757
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,670
So even if she sent a text,

758
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,539
- she could not go to meet him. - Right.

759
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,869
- Right. - You're right.

760
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:07,479
They need to meet for the selection to be complete.

761
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,080
In a way, it's not just up to Na Eon.

762
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,749
- It's up to Hwi Hyun too. - Right?

763
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,950
Hwi Hyun could go to the airport after sending the text,

764
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,790
or he could go to that location. It's up to both of them.

765
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,490
They could not come after seeing the text?

766
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,720
That's possible.

767
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:22,589
So what the text says must be really important.

768
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,130
If it's done like this,

769
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,159
I think we'll only get one or two couples.

770
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,829
When we were making predictions, we said the selection process...

771
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,469
seemed very comfortable and not overwhelming.

772
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,939
- Right. - But it could actually be harder.

773
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,809
Before, they would at least meet at the location...

774
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,979
- and say goodbye. - Right.

775
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,639
But this time, they're just left alone.

776
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,310
This is more cruel.

777
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,280
We'll have to see. They gave it a twist.

778
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,519
(If you want to start a new relationship, )

779
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,989
(please go to the address below.)

780
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,450
(If not, please go to the airport.)

781
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,850
(Where is Na Eon's heart headed?)

782
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,480
Could you open the trunk?

783
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:18,370
(Final selection: Cho Hwi Hyun chose Park Na Eon.)

784
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,340
I don't see a reason not to continue this relationship.

785
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,579
I want to continue our relationship even after the show.

786
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,809
I want to get close to her.

787
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,779
I was shaking partially because I was cold.

788
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,790
But I was also shaking because I was nervous.

789
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,600
He's cute and feels like a friend,

790
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,539
but we had so little time.

791
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,440
I thought I needed more time...

792
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,780
to get to know him.

793
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,920
Because we had so little time,

794
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,720
we couldn't get so close. I'm a bit sad about that.

795
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,419
I waited for quite a while, but she didn't come.

796
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,329
So I thought, "Did she go to the airport?"

797
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,830
"Did I come on too strong?"

798
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:20,000
(Where is Na Eon's heart headed?)

799
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:30,680
(Hwi Hyun is still waiting for Na Eon.)

800
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,720
(Right then, a car arrives.)

801
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,890
- Oh, she's here. - She's here.

802
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,030
It's not someone else, right?

803
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,000
- She's here. - No way.

804
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,900
It can't be, "Let's go to the airport."

805
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,400
- That's so cruel. - Please get out of the car, Lady.

806
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,150
(Is Na Eon in this car?)

807
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,339
(Final selection: Park Na Eon chose Cho Hwi Hyun.)

808
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,440
Hi.

809
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,310
- Where do I go? - That way.

810
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:41,980
(Hwi Hyun is finally smiling.)

811
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,319
- Hi. - Isn't it cold?

812
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,519
- What? - Isn't it cold?

813
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,459
- Why is it so hot? - It's hot?

814
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,489
- Yes, it's not cold. - Really?

815
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,929
I was totally shaking while waiting.

816
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,959
- Should I sit here? - Yes.

817
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,499
Do you want to use this as a blanket? It's warm.

818
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,800
You should. Your legs must be cold.

819
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
Okay.

820
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,769
Yes. They suit each other well.

821
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,169
She came. Spring is here.

822
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,299
This doesn't mean they're officially a couple,

823
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,740
but our reaction is almost...

824
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,039
- We're acting as if they're dating. - They're like a couple.

825
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,380
Nice.

826
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,209
Congratulations!

827
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,779
Congratulations.

828
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,509
Two nice people like them should continue...

829
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,150
- their relationship. - Exactly.

830
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,849
- They need to meet in Seoul. - Congratulations.

831
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,889
We decided on our own that they're already dating.

832
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,020
Right. I hope they continue this relationship.

833
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,860
You didn't go to the airport.

834
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,699
Did you get my text?

835
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,569
Yes, mine was so short, so I...

836
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,399
But you wrote me a long letter.

837
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,299
- Right. You saw my letter. - Yes.

838
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,570
I was so touched.

839
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,269
I wrote a long letter to some...

840
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,310
- and a short one to others. - I see.

841
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,809
So I folded all of them in the same way.

842
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,680
- Oh, really? - You were the last to take yours.

843
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,220
And yours...

844
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,319
- Yours was long. - It was one of the longer ones.

845
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,619
- It was a long one. - You totally filled...

846
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,950
- the whole page. - Right.

847
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,620
I appreciated it.

848
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,960
She seems nervous.

849
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,570
I was looking back on it, and on the first day,

850
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,770
I wrote the introductory letter about you.

851
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,939
- Oh, right. - That was random.

852
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,510
I had three options.

853
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,849
- That's really interesting. - Yes.

854
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,250
That was really random.

855
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,810
- Right. - Yes.

856
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,480
Those weren't all Hwi Hyun, right?

857
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,019
So that day, I picked Hwi Hyun for the first time.

858
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,990
That made me wonder, "What kind of person is he?"

859
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,429
That made me more interested in Hwi Hyun.

860
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,629
Looking back, that was pretty...

861
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,730
(Looking back, that day started everything.)

862
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,400
"Hwi Hyun is a kind, silken tofu-like person."

863
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,739
"I don't know him very well, and we're not very close yet,"

864
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,270
"I believe he'll be even cooler when I get to know him better."

865
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,640
Then she drew a cat.

866
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:49,980
(Things started between them by chance.)

867
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,280
(They had time to themselves thanks to Na Eon's courage.)

868
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,720
You were the person I wanted to get to know more.

869
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,620
You have a really cute face.

870
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,830
(Na Eon was honest about her feelings toward him.)

871
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,860
Your face looks very cute.

872
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,540
(Our shy silken-tofu boy started to change.)

873
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,140
I'm very bad at expressing myself.

874
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,439
Even when I'm interested in someone.

875
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,969
When the other person is asleep,

876
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,809
I'll visit her in her dreams and ask.

877
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,480
That's what the lyrics are about.

878
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,880
The lyrics are lovely.

879
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,019
(Thank you for treating me softly and tenderly...)

880
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,819
(like white silken tofu. I'm still listening to the song...)

881
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,219
(we listened to together. I kept listening to it, )

882
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,789
(and I got this peculiar feeling. It fits this season really well, )

883
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,520
(and I think this song will become important to me. Na Eon.)

884
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:35,419
(I'm glad we became so close on this trip.)

885
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,230
(Let's keep being good friends. Na Eon.)

886
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,329
I thought I wanted to spend a bit more time with you.

887
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,029
I was happy that I got to do so.

888
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,970
Right. My feelings for you grew...

889
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,509
- during that time too. - I see.

890
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,779
You're so kind, considerate,

891
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,179
and fun to be around.

892
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,380
Yes, it was fun.

893
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,949
We both came here...

894
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,280
- very light-heartedly. - Right.

895
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,620
If I had to pick one person who I want to get closer to...

896
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,419
after the show, it would obviously be you for me.

897
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,520
So I picked you for this final selection.

898
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,889
But I want you to take it not too seriously...

899
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,930
- and not too lightly. - Right.

900
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,600
That's why you picked me too, right?

901
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,769
I picked you because I wanted to hang out with you the most.

902
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,570
I appreciated that you thought positively of me.

903
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,379
And you have the cutest face.

904
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,910
(And you have the cutest face.)

905
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,579
You have the cutest face.

906
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,880
After Own?

907
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,319
- No, you're cuter than Own. - Really?

908
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,089
- Own is the cool type. - I see. It's the first time...

909
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:38,050
Own is kind of a Pomeranian-Jindo mix.

910
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,589
- A Pomeranian-Jindo mix? - Yes, a Pomeranian-Jindo mix.

911
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,689
I have a cute face?

912
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,920
Yes, you have a cute face.

913
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,560
That's nice.

914
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,499
It's true that at every moment of our trip,

915
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,230
she seemed pretty to me and gave me butterflies.

916
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,630
I want...

917
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,640
to meet her a few more times and stay close to her.

918
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:57,840
I think I'll stay true to how I feel.

919
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,680
- Oh, my! - Oh, my.

920
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,980
- He's good at expressing himself. - Right.

921
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:04,879
Go tomorrow. Have some flatfish and soju.

922
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,119
You don't have to hurry.

923
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,980
I think that was the prettiest facial expression...

924
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,249
I've seen Na Eon make.

925
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,750
The prettiest smile.

926
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,259
Smile.

927
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,360
(They grew close during their trip.)

928
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,260
Wave at the camera.

929
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,430
Hi.

930
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:26,339
Let's become even closer.

931
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,239
(All EXchange seasons assemble. You're the cutest.)

932
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,710
- Shall we turn around? - No.

933
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,110
I don't think that's it.

934
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,179
Why? Let's shoot a travel vlog.

935
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,780
No. I don't think that's it.

936
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,109
We don't get along.

937
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,710
I don't think we do.

938
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,849
Come to walk Dal.

939
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,820
Sounds good. What kind of snacks does Dal like?

940
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,220
Dal likes everything.

941
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,119
I feel bad, but I'll have to take...

942
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,620
some of Kong and Song's snacks.

943
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,029
I'll come to see Dal soon.

944
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,060
- Please come. - Of course, I should go.

945
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,860
- Seasons 2 and 3 came together. - You're right.

946
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,469
- They look so good together. - Exactly.

947
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,969
It makes me happy to look at them together.

948
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,599
We felt like that the whole time we watched them.

949
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,209
- They promised to walk their dogs. - Exactly.

950
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:06,910
Oh, goodness.

951
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,390
(A text from Kwan Woo arrived.)

952
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I saw the long text...

953
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,400
and felt a bit weird.

954
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,479
(If you want to start a new relationship, )

955
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,240
(please go to the address below. If not, please go to the airport.)

956
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,850
Oh, Hye Seon.

957
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,979
- She was thinking a lot. - She must be, seriously.

958
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:48,080
I think she'll still say she wants to get to know him more.

959
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,520
Will she go?

960
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,419
- I think Hye Seon will go. - Right.

961
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,919
I think that text must've been very important.

962
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,990
When she was...

963
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:59,630
- thinking so hard until the end... - Right.

964
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,380
Hello.

965
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,400
Our first date was the most memorable.

966
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,699
I felt on that date...

967
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:42,140
that he took care of me a lot.

968
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:47,780
(They rode ATVs together after Kwan Woo chose her.)

969
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,820
(Kwan Woo took good care of Hye Seon.)

970
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:55,719
I kept seeing afterimages of you.

971
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,350
You as a person.

972
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:59,489
- Oh, really? - Really.

973
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:01,220
Please grab each other's hands.

974
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:04,930
(And their partner yoga experience with Dong Jin and Da Hye)

975
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,959
It feels like we're on a honeymoon in Bali.

976
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,600
Korean version of Bali.

977
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,500
Natural, like a couple.

978
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,270
(My love, you are pretty and flawless.)

979
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:26,749
(Final selection: Lee Kwan Woo chose Lee Hye Seon)

980
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,280
Is there something to think about?

981
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,750
I'll be so happy if she feels the same way as me.

982
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:34,160
She expressed her feelings to me a lot.

983
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,260
I hope she's thinking about me just as much.

984
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,799
I believe she is.

985
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,830
(Kwan Woo is putting trust in Hye Seon.)

986
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,639
Okay. He came.

987
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,770
Right. I think it'd be sad for him if he didn't go.

988
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:55,940
(Meanwhile, Hye Seon seems to be deep in thought.)

989
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,080
Why does she look so sad?

990
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,690
I knew he was a good person.

991
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:13,130
But I realized I didn't know what kind of person he was.

992
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,100
He doesn't bring up personal things about him.

993
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,400
When we make a point of contact, our conversation can get deeper.

994
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,739
That's when I feel touched,

995
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,210
but we haven't gotten that far yet.

996
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,879
What do you usually do outside of work?

997
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,779
I spend most of my time working.

998
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,519
Do you like a calm atmosphere or a lively, noisy atmosphere?

999
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,890
I think it depends on the situation.

1000
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,619
- You say this a lot. - But seriously.

1001
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,120
It does make sense.

1002
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:42,390
So difficult.

1003
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,730
You can ask me questions if you have any.

1004
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,759
It's just as I said before.

1005
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,429
Is there...

1006
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:50,670
anything more to talk about?

1007
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,669
Since I don't know,

1008
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,300
I just accept things as they are.

1009
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:02,280
(And a text from Hye Seon arrived.)

1010
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:06,720
(I want to tell you thanks one last time. Hye Seon.)

1011
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,020
She wants to tell him thanks one last time.

1012
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,559
Hye Seon said.

1013
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,429
- Doesn't that mean... - This is...

1014
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,930
- Isn't she saying yes? - They both chose each other, right?

1015
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,600
(What did Hye Seon mean by "one last time?")

1016
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:43,950
(Hye Seon reads the text that Kwan Woo sent again.)

1017
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,950
I had partially...

1018
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,220
made a decision on my own.

1019
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,160
But when I saw the text,

1020
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,500
my feelings did waver.

1021
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:57,669
(A new star shines extra brightly in my universe today.)

1022
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:01,269
(It's a small and very white star, )

1023
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:04,410
(and it has started to become my sun. Kwan Woo.)

1024
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:08,280
I think he was describing me in his poem.

1025
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,950
I felt a lot from that.

1026
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:14,680
(This morning, Hye Seon gave Kwan Woo a book of poems.)

1027
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,390
- I honestly... - Thank you so much.

1028
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,759
I really love it.

1029
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,190
I especially like poetry books.

1030
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:24,690
Thank you so much.

1031
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,729
Oh, she was writing in that book.

1032
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,530
Oh, she gave it to Kwan Woo.

1033
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,169
Hye Seon said she was attracted...

1034
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,670
- by poets and painters. - Exactly.

1035
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,540
I compared Hye Seon to a star in my text.

1036
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,040
"I like you."

1037
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,740
"I enjoyed our time together today."

1038
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,249
Instead of saying that directly,

1039
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,610
I wanted to express it in a warm way.

1040
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,619
It's similar to that poem.

1041
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,989
"He came to me and became a flower."

1042
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,490
- It's similar to that. - Right.

1043
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,189
I'm not sure why her feelings wavered...

1044
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,660
after getting this message.

1045
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,389
- She wasn't going to go. - She wasn't going to go,

1046
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,729
- and then her feelings wavered. - Right.

1047
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,959
- At first... - But in her message earlier,

1048
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,569
she said she wanted to tell him one more time.

1049
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:07,040
- Later? - She just meant that she wanted...

1050
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,899
to tell him thanks one more time.

1051
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,439
- I think she means, "I want..." - One more time. Yes.

1052
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,939
"to tell him thanks one more time while we're here."

1053
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,539
- I think that's what she meant. - Oh, here?

1054
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,979
- Not later? - Yes.

1055
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,179
So this message could answer...

1056
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:20,279
some of Hye Seon's questions...

1057
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,649
- and curiosities about Kwan Woo. - Right.

1058
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,389
This could really sway her. His words were so lovely.

1059
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,959
- I think it was really sincere. - It was sincere.

1060
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,090
- I think he thought about it a lot. - Yes.

1061
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,310
Will she come?

1062
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,209
The longer I waited,

1063
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,050
the less sure I became.

1064
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,790
(After thinking for a long time, )

1065
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,890
(Hye Seon made up her mind.)

1066
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,560
Sir.

1067
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,800
Please go to the airport.

1068
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:11,970
- Why? - Why?

1069
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:14,070
Seriously?

1070
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,770
Seriously?

1071
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:23,910
It's so...

1072
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,450
- Why? - But...

1073
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,020
I think she could feel...

1074
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,149
that even the last message was too indirect.

1075
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,320
Could that be it?

1076
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,690
Please go to the airport.

1077
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:42,460
(Final selection: Lee Hye Seon didn't choose anyone.)

1078
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:53,809
(Lee Hye Seon wants to maintain the current relationship.)

1079
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:55,910
(Please head to the airport.)

1080
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,350
I was disappointed.

1081
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,500
In a way, I understand her.

1082
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:21,340
The Hye Seon I saw during our time here...

1083
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,409
was...

1084
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,540
a very careful person.

1085
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,180
I don't think she wanted to make a rash decision.

1086
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,849
This could be a decision...

1087
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:39,719
I don't regret...

1088
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,659
or a decision I do regret,

1089
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,860
but the reason I made this decision...

1090
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,859
was because I felt that 5 days and 4 nights...

1091
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,699
was too short of a time...

1092
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,600
to become certain about someone.

1093
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,070
No matter who that person may be.

1094
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:03,909
I'm sad.

1095
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:05,409
(I'm sad.)

1096
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,120
I'll think about her a lot.

1097
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:09,949
I'm really grateful.

1098
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,589
And you're such a good person.

1099
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,720
I really want you to be successful and happy.

1100
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:20,800
This trip...

1101
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,340
will leave me...

1102
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,110
with grateful...

1103
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,450
and happy memories in many ways.

1104
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,029
- Both of them were sincere. - Exactly.

1105
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,130
It's a bit...

1106
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,499
- Things are... - Right?

1107
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,999
Too out of place.

1108
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,569
They were sincere about each other.

1109
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:00,700
In the end, he wasn't selected.

1110
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,970
No.

1111
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,569
Hye Seon's decision is odd, right?

1112
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:06,569
They were getting along well at first, so I had my hopes up.

1113
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,280
- Me, too. - I think...

1114
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:12,249
she understood it as the first step of a serious relationship.

1115
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,949
Hye Seon was much more sincere about it.

1116
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:16,550
- She didn't think lightly of it. - No.

1117
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,689
Either way, it's a bummer.

1118
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,359
It sure is a bummer. It's not like she has to start...

1119
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,119
dating him right away...

1120
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,289
after choosing him. What a shame.

1121
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,659
How the two interpreted it was different.

1122
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,030
Exactly. Their views were different.

1123
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,729
- It's a shame. - Yes, a shame.

1124
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,770
It's a real shame.

1125
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,370
(Another participant is heading to their final selection.)

1126
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:57,960
(One participant is waiting for him.)

1127
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:04,500
(Final selection: Park Ji Yeon chose Kim Kwang Tae.)

1128
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,069
What? Yes. Ji Yeon is waiting for him already.

1129
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:09,699
- Really? - Ji Yeon made her decision.

1130
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,539
The two seem to be interested in each other.

1131
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,370
- Yes. They look good together. - Right?

1132
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,419
Isn't getting to know people exciting?

1133
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,650
I prefer...

1134
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,390
being with someone whom I feel comfortable around.

1135
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,190
Do you want pasta, Ji Yeon?

1136
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:32,190
I want to eat pasta.

1137
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,730
Leave some for Ji Yeon.

1138
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,070
It made me happy.

1139
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,570
Can you show me your profile for a minute?

1140
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,169
I probably look bad.

1141
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,770
You don't trust me?

1142
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:46,409
It's so funny to see you wearing it.

1143
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,610
- This? - Yes.

1144
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,779
(The two got friendship rings.)

1145
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,250
They're so smooth.

1146
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:55,980
If only we could've gotten closer a lot sooner.

1147
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:00,420
He was an even better person than I thought.

1148
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:07,200
(Ji Yeon waits for Kwang Tae with a fluttering heart.)

1149
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:31,490
(He has arrived at the final selection site.)

1150
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,730
What? Isn't he getting out?

1151
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,130
Why isn't he getting out?

1152
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:55,340
(What is Kwang Tae thinking?)

1153
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,230
- He got out. - That scared me.

1154
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:19,129
Yes. The two suit each other.

1155
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,799
- They look great together. - Right.

1156
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,739
These two are closer to...

1157
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:25,270
- A romantic relationship. - Yes, they're closer to that side.

1158
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,409
There's an air of romance around them.

1159
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:30,880
It's exciting. Now the two can run away together.

1160
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,210
- Go. - Run away to Seoul.

1161
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:41,190
(Final selection: Kim Kwang Tae chose Park Ji Yeon.)

1162
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,410
When did you get here?

1163
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,839
Me? Twenty minutes ago.

1164
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,940
Twenty minutes ago?

1165
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,250
- You got here late. - Me?

1166
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,180
Well...

1167
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,590
Isn't it warmer than yesterday?

1168
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,860
- Yes. It's warm. - Right?

1169
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,390
Did you think I'd come here?

1170
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,430
Remember coming here in secret yesterday?

1171
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,970
(In the last 1-on-1 trip)

1172
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,199
Should we run away?

1173
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,640
- What? - Should we run away?

1174
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,070
Run!

1175
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,080
Let's run away to the west.

1176
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,809
How about we set up the stone?

1177
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:39,580
Should we? Should we go down?

1178
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,720
(With that, the two went on a beach walk.)

1179
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,920
That will become a place of memory for the two.

1180
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,360
I wonder if the stone tower from yesterday is still there.

1181
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,600
- I bet it's still there. - Let's go check it out later.

1182
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:58,029
Since you wanted to see the beach,

1183
00:59:58,030 --> 00:59:59,570
I did, too.

1184
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,000
I loved it when we came here.

1185
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,540
I agree. It was really nice.

1186
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,769
- Yesterday... - I came wearing the ring.

1187
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,410
Nice. Same here.

1188
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:13,850
It's awkward.

1189
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,480
- Did you think I'd choose you? - What?

1190
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,150
Well...

1191
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,689
- No. I didn't. - Did you think I wouldn't?

1192
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:22,790
No.

1193
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:26,360
But you could choose no one.

1194
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,130
So...

1195
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,200
Why is he being awkward? How funny.

1196
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:33,300
- They look youthful. - Right?

1197
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,440
They suit each other.

1198
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:37,710
Because I wasn't getting any texts,

1199
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,680
I thought I should stay behind and go have lunch or something.

1200
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:44,009
That was what I thought, too.

1201
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:45,080
- Really? - Yes.

1202
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:49,720
The last sentence of our texts was the same.

1203
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,419
Did you read it?

1204
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:53,420
I did. But didn't you...

1205
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,489
reply to my text?

1206
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:57,590
- What? No. - For real?

1207
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:59,890
- Isn't it cool? - Yes.

1208
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:09,499
(I can't believe it's the last day. Time really flies.)

1209
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,139
(The more I get to know you, the more interesting you get.)

1210
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:14,410
(Let's go have dakgalbi in Seoul. Kwang Tae.)

1211
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,749
(Kwang Tae Vicky, thanks for making good memories with me.)

1212
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,679
(You made me laugh a ton.)

1213
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,250
(Let's go have dakgalbi in Seoul. Park Ji Yeon.)

1214
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:27,920
Ji Yeon told me that was her favorite restaurant.

1215
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:31,129
That's right in front of my workplace.

1216
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:32,530
Isn't it really cool?

1217
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:38,070
When we return to Seoul, we'll likely go to that restaurant first.

1218
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,769
- They sent the exact same thing. - I know, right?

1219
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,139
- Really? - The two must've talked about it.

1220
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,669
They must've for real.

1221
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,380
And both remembered it.

1222
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,150
Yes. You can tell right away that they suit each other.

1223
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,850
I'm always at Apgujeong...

1224
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:00,790
during lunch.

1225
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:04,930
- I'll drop by often. - Let's have lunch together.

1226
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:07,200
It's close, right?

1227
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,760
- Yes, it's close. - Good.

1228
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,200
Let's meet there next time.

1229
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,200
- After we leave. - Okay.

1230
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,610
Should we go to Seoul?

1231
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,510
- Let's go. - Shall we head to the airport?

1232
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:28,120
You must be cold. You'll catch a cold.

1233
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,350
- You were here all along. - Let's go.

1234
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,390
- What? - Let's buy some carrot cake to go.

1235
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:33,690
I'm in.

1236
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,560
Great. Let's go.

1237
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,060
I feel light-hearted now.

1238
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:43,760
A new beginning...

1239
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:45,499
doesn't necessarily mean...

1240
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,740
having to date right away.

1241
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:53,340
I found the need to get to know people slowly...

1242
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,610
and for a long time.

1243
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:57,350
I met someone...

1244
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:01,280
whom I could really get along with like Ji Yeon.

1245
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,380
I don't jump...

1246
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:05,450
the gun.

1247
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,959
Timing is important in everything.

1248
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,090
(Timing is important in everything.)

1249
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:12,290
That's right.

1250
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,600
Kwang Tae was all about someone with a cat face.

1251
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,199
- Meow. - Exactly.

1252
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,999
- He found himself a real cat face. - Ji Yeon is... Yes.

1253
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,439
Yes, a real cat face. She's a human cat.

1254
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,769
And their personalities fit.

1255
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:25,209
- Exactly. - Yes. Kwang Tae has changed a lot.

1256
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,869
- Right. - He gave off the feeling...

1257
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,579
of a runner in a rush...

1258
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:29,809
- Yes. - during EXchange.

1259
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:32,949
That gave us a good laugh.

1260
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:35,349
But he's become the calmest person.

1261
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:37,919
- Yes. He's also become cautious. - Right.

1262
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,489
His actions spoke louder than words.

1263
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:42,259
Exactly. And Kwang Tae felt that, too.

1264
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:43,819
The only flirting move...

1265
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,459
- he made was... - "Should we run away?"

1266
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:49,459
solely to Park Ji Yeon. It was only for her.

1267
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:52,269
That itself was very cool.

1268
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:54,939
There's a big possibility that they started a relationship.

1269
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,840
I agree. The two make everyone excited.

1270
01:03:58,310 --> 01:03:59,310
Let's go in.

1271
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,380
- Are your shoes all right? - Yes.

1272
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,680
- Is it gone? - Is it this one?

1273
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,749
- No. - Yes, it's this one.

1274
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,850
You're right.

1275
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:11,890
- Should we stack more up? - Yes.

1276
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,460
We placed something on top here.

1277
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,859
A small one.

1278
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,189
(Placing today's memories on yesterday's memories)

1279
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:19,230
Like that one?

1280
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,730
Stack it up.

1281
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,969
(What will their relationship build into?)

1282
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:25,200
Isn't there a small one?

1283
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:29,840
All done. It's cute.

1284
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:33,570
Nice.

1285
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,310
I've always wanted to get this close.

1286
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:38,880
Go into the water.

1287
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,080
- You want me to go into the water? - Yes.

1288
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,050
Go in.

1289
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,490
- Be careful. - Okay.

1290
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:54,130
(Kwang Tae and Park Ji Yeon's another beginning)

1291
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:59,199
Now then. Lee Ji Yeon, Min Jae, Hye Im, and Gyu Min...

1292
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,339
must make their last selection.

1293
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:05,470
I really want to know how Min Jae...

1294
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:07,069
- Right. - and Hye Im feel.

1295
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,779
I haven’t the vaguest idea.

1296
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,380
Min Jae...

1297
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:13,410
I don't think he'll choose anyone.

1298
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:16,019
Min Jae will send the text to Hye Im...

1299
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,190
but won't choose anyone. He'll head to the airport.

1300
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,290
I think so, too.

1301
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,389
In the end, Hye Im's feelings for Min Jae...

1302
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:24,389
were too intense.

1303
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:27,499
Hye Im's initial interest in Min Jae...

1304
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,830
was quite deep.

1305
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,799
But did Gyu Min...

1306
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,230
take away that interest during the four days?

1307
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,199
I'm quite curious.

1308
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,800
I don't think he did.

1309
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:38,769
- It was too short. - Too short?

1310
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:39,810
Maybe.

1311
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,120
Why am I nervous?

1312
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,990
I'm nervous.

1313
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:08,140
Ji Yeon looks happy after getting the text.

1314
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,370
Bye, Own.

1315
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:14,210
Be happy.

1316
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,659
- Hello. - Hello.

1317
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,700
(Their first encounter was awkward yet heart-fluttering.)

1318
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:40,530
- Which Chinese zodiac sign are you? - Sheep.

1319
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:43,870
"You're really tall with a pretty smile."

1320
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:45,970
Is it you?

1321
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,610
It made me really happy.

1322
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:53,979
(Like a reliable older brother...)

1323
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:57,220
(and a friend at times)

1324
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:59,850
(I had the best time today.)

1325
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:01,960
- This is... - What's with that?

1326
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:05,190
(Min Jae made her laugh and her heart pound.)

1327
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,060
I sent it to Min Jae.

1328
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:09,199
I spent...

1329
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,600
the most memorable times with him on Jeju Island.

1330
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:18,110
When I think about the person who made me laugh the most,

1331
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,370
it's Min Jae. Hence, I sent the text to him.

1332
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:37,020
(Final selection: Lee Ji Yeon chose Kwak Min Jae)

1333
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,119
(Hi, MJ.)

1334
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,719
(This trip with you was fun and full of happiness. Thanks.)

1335
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,359
(It helped me find a new side of me.)

1336
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,289
(I hope your life is filled with more happiness.)

1337
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:12,030
(Lee Ji Yeon.)

1338
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,699
I have no clue.

1339
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,359
I can't guess...

1340
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,970
who Min Jae chose.

1341
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:33,510
(Min Jae has an unreadable expression.)

1342
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:42,490
(Hye Im was curious about Min Jae and Ji Yeon's date.)

1343
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,689
- What was it? What did you do? - We just...

1344
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:46,090
It was a date, wasn't it?

1345
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:47,830
It was more of a trip than a date.

1346
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,100
You look nervous.

1347
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,769
I became nervous because you looked at me.

1348
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:53,430
Fine. I won't look at you.

1349
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,039
- That's it? - Yes.

1350
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,099
Take a look.

1351
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,340
Take one for me with Min Jae.

1352
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:01,980
(Hye Im knew him well, like an old friend.)

1353
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:15,290
Don't you know Gen Z?

1354
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:17,089
- I'm not Gen Z. - I'll take it.

1355
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:18,630
- Okay. - It's something like this.

1356
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:23,160
The more I date them, the more my feelings grow for them.

1357
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,969
- That's how I am. - Right. Me, too.

1358
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:28,640
My ideal type was always a manly guy.

1359
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,139
That was in the past.

1360
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:33,270
Now, I prefer someone sweet.

1361
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,980
We had a good conversation.

1362
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,879
(Can Min Jae and Lee Ji Yeon's coincidences lead...)

1363
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,410
(to a new relationship?)

1364
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:54,229
(Having you around was reassuring and relaxing.)

1365
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:56,359
(Thanks for taking good care of me.)

1366
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,569
(It was a short trip, but we were able to talk...)

1367
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:00,769
(and settle the little awkwardness...)

1368
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:02,999
(we had with each other.)

1369
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,610
(Min Jae.)

1370
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:22,120
(Final selection: Kwak Min Jae chose Jeong Hye Im.)

1371
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,960
He eventually chose Hye Im.

1372
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,599
I don't find it a surprise.

1373
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,699
But I'm worried Hye Im might not choose Min Jae.

1374
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:35,400
Same here. There's Gyu Min.

1375
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,140
Won't Hye Im choose Min Jae?

1376
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,410
But Min Jae's text message...

1377
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,579
I'm sure the one eating Hye Im up inside was Min Jae.

1378
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:45,350
True. But she didn't go on the 1-on-1 trip with him.

1379
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:47,080
- Right? - And yet, will she choose Min Jae?

1380
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,980
We'll have to see if Hye Im will come or not.

1381
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,859
(Kwak Min Jae wants to maintain the current relationship.)

1382
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,490
(Please head to the airport.)

1383
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,310
It was quite a shame.

1384
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:14,440
But in the given situation,

1385
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:18,980
I think I've expressed my feelings a lot.

1386
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,080
There's not much regret.

1387
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,850
If I had to spend time with someone tomorrow,

1388
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:29,860
I'd still want to spend it with Min Jae.

1389
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,229
During this trip, I was able to meet...

1390
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:34,829
a dear colleague.

1391
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:38,529
I'm very grateful.

1392
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:40,200
He's a precious friend now.

1393
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:42,500
I want to continue to get along with him.

1394
01:11:53,980 --> 01:12:01,920
(My love, you are beautiful and cheerful.)

1395
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,210
(Gyu Min has arrived at the final selection site.)

1396
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,980
I sent the text to Hye Im.

1397
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:30,450
(Final selection: Jeong Gyu Min chose Jeong Hye Im.)

1398
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,150
How about writing it to the one you want to gift it to?

1399
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:35,189
Who are you giving it to?

1400
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:36,320
I already have someone.

1401
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:38,830
(Hye Im)

1402
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:42,260
(She was my first choice.)

1403
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:45,870
I thought it was out of awkwardness.

1404
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,170
"It's 100 percent friendship."

1405
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:49,870
It was sort of insisted.

1406
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:53,140
I'd be lying if I said...

1407
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,239
my heart didn't flutter at all...

1408
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,440
while spending the day with her.

1409
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,480
She definitely gave me butterflies.

1410
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:07,490
(Gyu Min chose Hye Im throughout the whole trip.)

1411
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:12,730
(Do you think Hye Im feels the same?)

1412
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:13,960
I'm not sure.

1413
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:27,979
Hye Im could've thought...

1414
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:31,010
I was just a really nice friend.

1415
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:53,769
(Hye Im! Seeing you take care of others during this trip...)

1416
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:56,599
(made me realize you were a really nice person.)

1417
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,809
(Thank you for the 5 days and 4 nights.)

1418
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:02,980
(Let's get along more from now on. Gyu Min.)

1419
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:11,620
(Hye Im received 2 text messages.)

1420
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,530
Hye Im will appear in 1 of the 2 places.

1421
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:30,399
- Yes. - Or she might not choose anyone.

1422
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,540
True. She might not choose at all.

1423
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:35,609
(If you want to start a new relationship, )

1424
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:36,909
(please go to the address below.)

1425
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:38,549
(If not, please go to the airport.)

1426
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:39,980
(Kwak Min Jae: Pyoseondangpo-ro, Jeong Gyu Min: Taesinhaean-ro)

1427
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:51,530
Hello.

1428
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:02,100
- Please go to... - Okay.

1429
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:04,909
"Please go to..."

1430
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,469
- Please go to the airport. - The airport.

1431
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,980
What she said was quite short.

1432
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:13,450
Min Jae.

1433
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:15,120
I think it's Min Jae, too.

1434
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:16,850
What about you?

1435
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,249
Min Jae for me, too.

1436
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,120
If she chose someone, it would be Min Jae.

1437
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:22,689
The possibility is 80 to 20.

1438
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:25,660
During the date with Gyu Min,

1439
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:29,700
Hye Im didn't give off much of that atmosphere.

1440
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:31,870
- Please go to... - Okay.

1441
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:57,120
What? It's Kwak Min Jae.

1442
01:15:57,490 --> 01:15:59,059
Hold on. There's a bug on you.

1443
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:00,660
It's a small fly.

1444
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:02,560
Thank you.

1445
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:07,269
I had you come to give you this.

1446
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:08,840
It's a camellia flower.

1447
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:10,299
In the language of flowers,

1448
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,870
camellia means something like I still love you.

1449
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,210
When we came here, I realized...

1450
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,249
you were a really great person.

1451
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,610
(You're a great person.)

1452
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:24,320
While spending time together here,

1453
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:27,250
I thought you were a really nice person.

1454
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:28,760
- That's not true. - No.

1455
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:33,960
But while I watched Season 1 before appearing in Season 2,

1456
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,829
you were my first choice.

1457
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:38,330
(Gyu Min confessed his true feelings to Hye Im.)

1458
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,669
Like this. Isn't this better?

1459
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:42,240
- Yes. - We'll go with this.

1460
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,340
It felt like a date,

1461
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,110
which made me feel odd.

1462
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,080
Do you not regret coming here?

1463
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,510
- This was the best. - Was it?

1464
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:57,819
(Hye Im received two texts.)

1465
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:00,490
(Where is she heading to?)

1466
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:47,870
(Final selection: Jeong Hye Im chose Jeong Gyu Min.)

1467
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,300
For real?

1468
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:53,469
Seriously? Why did she give him the camellia?

1469
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:54,740
We got it all wrong.

1470
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,639
- We got nothing right. - But why?

1471
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:57,979
I didn't see this coming.

1472
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,949
Min Jae must've simply been...

1473
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,580
a good person.

1474
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,879
He was like that to her.

1475
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,249
Hye Im must've had...

1476
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:06,619
- a sudden change of heart. - Maybe.

1477
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,359
Gyu Min told her she was his first choice...

1478
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,189
and showed interest in her.

1479
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:13,090
Hye Im says she likes a man who likes her.

1480
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:15,730
- Can't that be the biggest reason? - Right.

1481
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,400
Gosh.

1482
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:28,779
- I was worried you might not come. - Take a seat.

1483
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:30,380
- Really? - Yes.

1484
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:32,280
Why were you worried?

1485
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:36,920
Thank you for coming.

1486
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:58,239
(Jeong Hye Im wants to maintain the current relationship.)

1487
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,170
(Please head to the airport.)

1488
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:07,979
Right.

1489
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,979
That laugh is a real response.

1490
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:11,719
It can't be helped in Min Jae's shoes.

1491
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,090
How funny.

1492
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:14,790
- I mean... - He's a cool guy.

1493
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:28,440
It was a lot more fun than I expected.

1494
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,039
Before getting here, I was filled with worries.

1495
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,909
I contemplated for almost a month.

1496
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:40,080
But I'm glad I chose to be on this show.

1497
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,780
Selecting and being selected...

1498
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:45,290
is just a part of it.

1499
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:47,320
Meeting great people...

1500
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,860
made it more meaningful.

1501
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,729
(If you were to say some last words to Hye Im?)

1502
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:56,300
I really enjoyed our trip together.

1503
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:58,430
Thank you for inviting me.

1504
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,600
Thank you for coming.

1505
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,440
- It's very awkward. - It is.

1506
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:08,480
What took you so long?

1507
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,140
Was I late?

1508
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:13,580
I wanted to come early.

1509
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:17,350
- The text message you sent... - Yes?

1510
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:19,990
Lacked sincerity.

1511
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,960
That was what worried me.

1512
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:30,160
(I'll see you outside! Hye Im.)

1513
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:32,730
"I'll see you outside."

1514
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,799
- I thought... - Yes?

1515
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,070
We'd have time to talk after I sent...

1516
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:41,340
that text message.

1517
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:43,409
I wanted to say things in person,

1518
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:45,380
so I wrote them down on paper.

1519
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:47,849
- That's why... - I see.

1520
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:51,249
If you read what you wrote, I'll forgive you.

1521
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:52,520
- Really? - Yes.

1522
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:54,420
Then I'll take my time saying them.

1523
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,320
- I have it with me. - Okay.

1524
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:00,960
First off...

1525
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:08,030
I did a lot of thinking after coming here.

1526
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:12,539
"There are other participants,"

1527
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,610
"but why will I care about Gyu Min?"

1528
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:17,379
When I thought about it,

1529
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:20,750
any relationship, be it friends,

1530
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:23,619
has to start with an interest in that person.

1531
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:24,649
Yes.

1532
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:26,889
Thinking that we'd be able...

1533
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:29,890
to get along more after we leave Jeju Island,

1534
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:32,730
I chose you as my final selection.

1535
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,600
Thanks.

1536
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:39,330
This was what "I'll see you outside" meant.

1537
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:40,500
I get it.

1538
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:42,900
While waiting for you here,

1539
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:44,740
I did some thinking.

1540
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:48,440
I didn't think you'd be the type to go to the airport...

1541
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:49,780
after...

1542
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:52,409
you received my text about selecting you.

1543
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:53,479
Of course.

1544
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,420
It made me happy. And...

1545
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:58,650
it made me reflect on myself for sending four words.

1546
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,050
I thought...

1547
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:04,189
you might go to the airport...

1548
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:05,830
after reading that.

1549
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,430
Shall we shake hands again?

1550
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:15,800
What's with this?

1551
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:25,310
When Hye Im came in, greeted me, and sat down,

1552
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,810
I got nervous...

1553
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:31,149
and could feel my heart flutter.

1554
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:34,619
"I must have a bit of romantic feelings for her."

1555
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:35,920
It made me realize that.

1556
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,789
(The end of this trip is the first step...)

1557
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:42,830
(to another beginning.)

1558
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,330
With that, everyone has made their final selection.

1559
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:48,969
Three teams made the final selection.

1560
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:51,709
It's cute how everyone became shy. Right?

1561
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:54,610
Out of the three teams,

1562
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:56,279
I think Kwang Tae...

1563
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,909
- is most likely to become... - I agree.

1564
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:59,249
- a real couple. - Same here.

1565
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,510
Yes. I think so, too.

1566
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:04,320
Compared to when they appeared on their seasons of EXchange,

1567
01:23:04,450 --> 01:23:06,389
they've matured.

1568
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:07,989
- A lot at that. - I agree.

1569
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,659
- Especially Hwi Hyun and Na Eon. - Exactly.

1570
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:12,329
They left a great impression.

1571
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:13,929
Seeing them relaxed...

1572
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:15,529
- was really pleasant. - Right.

1573
01:23:15,530 --> 01:23:18,199
What makes Ji Yeon and Min Jae...

1574
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,369
cool is that,

1575
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:21,229
although they didn't choose each other,

1576
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:23,539
both were honest and confident until the end.

1577
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,510
That was nice to see.

1578
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:28,779
(They came on this trip not knowing...)

1579
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:31,180
(what to expect with whom.)

1580
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:36,750
(Among the people they have never met before, )

1581
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:42,660
(the first day was awkward yet exciting.)

1582
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,829
Seeing the people...

1583
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:48,090
who were on TV in person itself was amazing.

1584
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:51,430
Now, I've got to know them personally.

1585
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,070
I knew them...

1586
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,610
but never had the chance to spend time with them.

1587
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:07,049
(They made fun memories on a casual trip.)

1588
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:11,919
(Those moments were more amusing as they had each other.)

1589
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:15,389
(Those moments were more amusing as they had each other.)

1590
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:16,959
I had fun...

1591
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,990
and had all the conversations I wanted to have.

1592
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:21,290
I've checked everything off my list on this trip.

1593
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:22,599
Let's shake hands.

1594
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,399
(They settled buried emotions...)

1595
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,200
(and became more comfortable with each other.)

1596
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:35,539
(All were happy when excited...)

1597
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:41,150
(and comforted each other when they became emotional.)

1598
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:42,920
You two look adorable.

1599
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,290
(Priceless memories they made together)

1600
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:47,590
Yes!

1601
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:51,960
Getting to know nine friends...

1602
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,990
was the best part.

1603
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,260
What's this?

1604
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:01,529
Each and every person has become an invaluable friend.

1605
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:03,640
We'll continue to get along well.

1606
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:08,440
(The end of this trip is the beginning of new relationships.)

1607
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:14,979
I hope everyone treasures...

1608
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:17,620
the feelings and memories...

1609
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:20,390
they made during this trip.

1610
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,599
Another beginning.

1611
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,730
It has various meanings.

1612
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:39,410
We could've found a new love...

1613
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:40,609
or...

1614
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:44,609
looked at a new version of myself.

1615
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:46,680
(Another beginning of my life)

1616
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:53,290
It was a moment where I could learn many lessons.

1617
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:55,589
For 3 nights and 4 days...

1618
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:58,219
Thanks to you, I feel like I'm dreaming.

1619
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:59,459
- Okay. - That sounds good.

1620
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:01,760
- Let's go, EXchange! - Let's go, EXchange!

1621
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,730
Let's go.

1622
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:10,099
(Thank you for watching EXchange - Another Beginning.)

1623
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:13,740
(Thank you for watching EXchange - Another Beginning.)

1624
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:16,709
Don't we have good news?

1625
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:17,879
Yes. EXchange Season Four...

1626
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,780
will return this fall. That's right.

1627
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,380
I'm saved.

1628
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:25,050
On Season Four...

1629
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:30,019
Simon Dominic. We're waiting for you.

1630
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:34,290
Now then, we'll return in the fall with EXchange Season Four.

1631
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:37,399
Let's meet again on TVING.

1632
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,429
Bye!

1633
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:40,269
Simon Dominic will be with us.

1634
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:42,069
We'll all be here.

1635
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:43,270
Season Four.

1636
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,080
(EXchange - Another Beginning)
