1
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,608
This apartment is our target's home.

2
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:12,479
I want to park the truck here,
but it can't be there for too long.

3
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,982
So I'm eyeing this park instead.

4
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:20,587
Shinoda, I want you and Suzaki to pretend
to be a flirty couple.

5
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:22,756
What?!

6
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,693
A guy by himself invites suspicion
and may get questioned.

7
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,295
He could always refuse to answer.

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,931
But then he draws even more suspicion.

9
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,067
Have you been questioned?

10
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,468
No, I haven't.

11
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,437
The officer checks your ID.

12
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,406
Yeah, I do know that.

13
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,375
Are we about to do something illegal?

14
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,743
Nothing that bad.

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,478
Just taking some sneak shots.

16
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,013
Sneak shots?

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,183
A different team was on this story.

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,485
Yutaka Takagi and Kirari.

19
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,021
-What?
-Who?

20
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:55,955
You know them?

21
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,691
Kirari is a former idol turned influencer.

22
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,527
Her video streams are famous.

23
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:01,995
I see.

24
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,898
Her channel's subscriber amount is…

25
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:06,699
-Three thousand?
-That's it?

26
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,735
She's an influencer, right?

27
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,136
A budding influencer.

28
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,371
I've never heard of that.

29
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,875
"Influencer" means they have influence,
what influence does a bud have?

30
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:19,746
That's like saying there's an experienced
newcomer or new building with history.

31
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,181
-So picky.
-Sorry.

32
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,817
And Yutaka Takagi is a former Blue Ranger.

33
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:24,751
No, Yellow.

34
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,386
No, Blue. Right?

35
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,955
-I think it was Green.
-Definitely not Green.

36
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,390
Don't look it up!

37
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,192
Let's bet on it!

38
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,194
I think it's blue. You, Shinoda?

39
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,162
It's definitely Yellow.

40
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,197
Look, who cares.

41
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,532
-Get back on topic.
-Right. Sorry.

42
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:44,037
We got word that Yutaka Takagi
and Kirari both have the day off.

43
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,606
We might catch them sleeping over.

44
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,678
This would be so much easier to get
from a car.

45
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,247
Maybe they're not that careful,
they're not big celebrities.

46
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,815
That's a good point.

47
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,486
The story's tiny,
but it could be good experience.

48
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,687
Nice.

49
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,856
Your first step as a journalist.

50
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,128
Don't look so worried.

51
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,329
You got this.

52
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,431
What's your cover?

53
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,367
-A normal couple.
-You snuck out of a party.

54
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,568
That's a good one.

55
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,504
Maybe a jacket for Suzaki.

56
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,239
And a gaudy Hawaiian shirt.

57
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,373
That's weird.

58
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,543
Shinoda will be in
a go-getter party dress.

59
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,677
It'd be like this.

60
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,679
A skirt with a fancy blouse.

61
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,715
Go buy that now.

62
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:29,749
It'll be covered.

63
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,985
Nice, you're getting free clothes.

64
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,487
Okay, meeting adjourned.

65
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,055
You guys know your jobs.

66
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,357
-Got it.
-Yes, sir.

67
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,324
Wait.

68
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,493
Just don't look like a journalist.

69
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,029
It's a tiny article, so no worries.

70
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:47,700
An outfit to trick an up-and-coming
influencer and the Blue Ranger.

71
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:48,635
Yellow!

72
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,536
Blue!

73
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,905
-I think it's Green.
-Definitely not Green.

74
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,240
-Look it up, you're wrong.
-What?

75
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:56,709
Look it up.

76
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,811
I don't care.

77
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:03,716
Tiny.

78
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:06,686
Tiny?

79
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,605
I found myself in the park

80
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,541
before I was mentally prepared.

81
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:31,644
Let's go.

82
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,283
Urged I could do it
because it was a tiny story,

83
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,953
I was made to wear this outfit,

84
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,089
and got caught in the momentum.

85
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:47,594
I'm just hoping I don't get too drunk.

86
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,264
-Shinoda.
-Yes?

87
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,166
Try not to drink.

88
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,067
Huh?

89
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,769
It's just for blending it.

90
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,706
I can't help it, since it's in my hand,

91
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,074
You can't get drunk.

92
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,210
Also,

93
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,281
can you act more like
you're having a fun time?

94
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:10,917
Sorry.

95
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,331
-So that's how it works.
-Don't peek.

96
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,500
Who knows who's watching.

97
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:28,901
Sorry.

98
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,377
What do you usually talk about
during these times?

99
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,780
I'm usually on my own,
so I don't have to chat.

100
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:42,815
I see.

101
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,223
I should probably use the swing.

102
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,624
You don't need to.

103
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,194
You don't need to do anything special,
just act natural.

104
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,498
Okay.

105
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,505
I should've brought a deck of cards
or something.

106
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,174
But maybe not.

107
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,880
What's your favorite equipment?

108
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,516
What?

109
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,419
For playgrounds. I like slides.

110
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,889
Never thought about it.

111
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,558
That makes sense.

112
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:33,032
It's a pretty big place for Takagi
to live alone.

113
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,035
Maybe they already live together.

114
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,372
Maybe.

115
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,775
I wonder how much rent is here.

116
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,014
Don't you wonder
what the purchase price is?

117
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,884
Is there a supermarket nearby?

118
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,871
Could you be talking?

119
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,574
I thought I was annoying you.

120
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,544
You can't be too loud,
but it's weird if you're silent.

121
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,180
You're right.

122
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,525
What's your hobby?

123
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,630
How do you feel?

124
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,432
About what?

125
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:43,069
Your pictures could ruin someone's life.

126
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,675
It's the chief's decision
to publish it or not.

127
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,412
Yamabuki said the same thing.

128
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,984
I'm not doing this because I want to.

129
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,621
I can't be picky if I want to eat.

130
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,190
You're right.

131
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,027
You're supposed to give me some
words of encouragement here!

132
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,495
You're my client in this.

133
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,931
I am?

134
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,133
I'm exclusive, but a freelancer.

135
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,235
But you're a Sengokusha employee.

136
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,373
I work for the Sengoku Weekly
editing department.

137
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,874
That's true.

138
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,144
No point in asking my opinion
about taking secret pictures,

139
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,079
or worrying about what we do.

140
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,817
Your job is to support me and make sure

141
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:35,221
the local residents or the police
don't find me suspicious.

142
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:36,889
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:48,634
They're here.

144
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,361
What's wrong?

145
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,063
Nothing.

146
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,009
Did you get it?

147
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,811
Got the money shot.

148
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,713
It's them all right.

149
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,248
Good work.

150
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,217
-Now then.
-Time to go home.

151
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,186
This is where it begins.

152
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,053
Huh?

153
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,788
We catch them coming out.

154
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,123
Time is important.

155
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,859
If she leaves right away,
it's not much of a scandal.

156
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,796
Okay, we're in this for the long game.

157
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,309
My heart's still racing.

158
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,045
What is this feeling?

159
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:07,947
Is it the scoop?

160
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,750
Or the alcohol?

161
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:11,717
No.

162
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,453
Is it because of the hug?

163
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,723
That can't be it.

164
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,294
Yes, I can't remember
the last time I was hugged,

165
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:27,066
but it must be my anxiety over
a potential police questioning.

166
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,405
Crap, one really showed up.

167
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,674
Why this timing?

168
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:36,876
We locked eyes.

169
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,378
I looked away!

170
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,781
Why did I do that?

171
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,053
Yup, he's coming.

172
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,654
This sucks.

173
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,892
What do I do? Hold on.

174
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,695
I have no idea what to do
about the questioning.

175
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,830
If I mess this up…

176
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,066
Mr. Suzaki.

177
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,602
Come back from the bathroom!

178
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,471
You there.

179
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,274
It's over.

180
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,848
Can we talk?

181
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,585
What do I do? Oh, crap!

182
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,054
You know who I am, right?

183
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,459
You're the Blue Ranger.

184
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,560
I'm Yellow.

185
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,597
What're you doing here?

186
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,065
Well, I mean…

187
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,302
I slipped out of a party with a guy.

188
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,503
Stop lying.

189
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,271
I'm not lying.

190
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,374
You were hugging under the tree.

191
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,075
Yes, we were.

192
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,810
You didn't hug him back.

193
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,115
Your hands were out like a frog.

194
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:50,950
Taking pictures?

195
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,420
Does the guy have the camera?

196
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,190
What are you talking about?

197
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,425
How long were you here?

198
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,794
A while, right?

199
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:03,996
Which tabloid?

200
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,232
-Huh?
-Don't play dumb.

201
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,167
You make a living on others' misery.

202
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,137
Is doing that fun for you?

203
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,706
It's a violation of privacy.

204
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,709
That's how you make a living.

205
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,878
You're the worst.

206
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,189
Was that Yutaka Takagi?

207
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,260
Crap, we're busted.

208
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,997
Did you get any info?

209
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,599
-Huh?
-What?

210
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,179
Really?

211
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,448
You made contact with the target!

212
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,616
What did he say?

213
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,587
That I hugged poorly.

214
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,789
Say what?

215
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:04,857
What else?

216
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,625
That's all.

217
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,196
Where's the recording
of this conversation? Any pictures?

218
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:17,103
Anyway, we stuck around until
the afternoon, but they never came out.

219
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,604
I see.

220
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,539
The tip's solid?

221
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,208
Yeah.

222
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,944
Yutaka and Kirari were on set by morning.

223
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,045
They slipped out.

224
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,914
There's no back exit,

225
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:32,384
so maybe they got help
from the building's janitor to get out.

226
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,553
I see.

227
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,057
I guess I gotta kill it.

228
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,458
What, really?

229
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,529
Getting caught going into
the same apartment can be a scandal,

230
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,767
but I doubt the chief is gonna give
the green light for C-list celebrities.

231
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,201
I think so too.

232
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,469
I'm sorry!

233
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,273
I mean, this was just a tiny scoop.

234
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,408
No big deal, it happens.

235
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,376
Yes.

236
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,677
Moving on.

237
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:03,382
Daisuke, you got something
that can fill half a page?

238
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,184
Let's see.

239
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,752
I've got a few in stock.

240
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,053
Great, thanks.

241
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:09,989
Anyway, good job.

242
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,426
Come in.

243
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:16,662
Can I have a moment?

244
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,297
Thank you.

245
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,932
Ms. Shinoda?

246
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,833
Yes?

247
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,937
I have a favor.

248
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,507
I want you to support Akutsu
on his stakeout.

249
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,644
Can you go take a nap now
and come back after?

250
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,479
Okay.

251
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,549
Thanks.

252
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,094
I can't sleep.

253
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,530
I can't sleep!

254
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:57,136
If I only recorded that conversation
with Yutaka Takagi.

255
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,875
If I only took a single picture
on my phone.

256
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,980
If I only hugged Mr. Suzaki harder then!

257
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,489
Are you okay?

258
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,759
Ms. Shinoda?

259
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,538
An all-night stakeout?

260
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,506
That sounds tough.

261
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,043
It's nothing compared to
what you did, Kuwabara.

262
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,511
I heard from Asuka.

263
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:43,182
You got stuck with a brutal story
as soon as you joined.

264
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,485
You got it wrong.

265
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:55,494
I was doing research for it,
but I was really just a lowly grunt.

266
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:02,635
It was the kind of job I felt lucky
to get even a sentence published.

267
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,240
I mean, I was being treated like
everyone's servant,

268
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,342
doing things anyone could do.

269
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:16,315
I just diligently carried out
trivial tasks.

270
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,718
Something anyone could do?

271
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,222
Like buying stuff
at the convenience store?

272
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,291
Yeah.

273
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,027
Then how did you get burnt out in a year?

274
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,996
If it wasn't the trivial tasks,
did you get treated that badly?

275
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,098
That's not it.

276
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,542
I couldn't push the doorbell anymore.

277
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,712
Doorbell?

278
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:56,455
I pushed the doorbell, mentioned I was
from Sengokusha, and stated my business.

279
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:02,628
Most would say they didn't know anything,
or had no idea.

280
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,164
Get out of my way!

281
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,598
It was fine.

282
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,935
It was my job to go ask around.

283
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,603
It wasn't pointless.

284
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,074
I was sent to do it
because it was necessary.

285
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,908
Sorry.

286
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,376
Leave me alone!

287
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,344
I knew it.

288
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,650
I didn't get jaded from being made
to do boring work either.

289
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:26,618
I understood.

290
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,488
But one day…

291
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,931
I couldn't push the doorbell.

292
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,738
I thought pushing the doorbell
and being ignored,

293
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:49,508
or getting blasted with insults
or sprayed with water was nothing.

294
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,387
I HATE SENGOKU WEEKLY

295
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,856
I shouldn't let it get to me.

296
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,392
I knew it in my head.

297
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:13,699
I thought I was
a stronger person than this.

298
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,938
I learned how weak I was.

299
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,446
Everyone has their
strengths and weaknesses.

300
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:32,217
I left because I couldn't cut it.

301
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:39,525
But you might be able to
keep your head down and push through.

302
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,797
Besides, it's not like failing
means your life is over.

303
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,234
I mean, I've started over
at a different department.

304
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:55,908
Ms. Shinoda, I'm rooting for you!

305
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,444
Kuwabara.

306
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,215
I have to go to a meeting now.

307
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,017
-Sure. Thank you.
-My pleasure.

308
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:09,955
Good luck!

309
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,458
I'll try.

310
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:36,882
So sweet!

311
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,424
SENGOKU WEEKLY EDITING DEPARTMENT

312
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,464
Good work today.

313
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,966
Shinoda.

314
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,034
I heard you're supporting Akutsu.

315
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,736
Yes, I'm heading there soon.

316
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,471
Okay. Good luck to you.

317
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,442
Mr. Murai, what happened with that story?

318
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,177
Which?

319
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,278
The teenage girl.

320
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:10,482
We tried to meet this girl to talk to her,

321
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,718
but somehow, she's gone missing.

322
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,087
Her name is Madoka Hashimoto.

323
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,258
Haven't received
any good information since.

324
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:20,893
I see.

325
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,129
Hey, Ms. Shinoda, did you get any sleep?

326
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,401
Let's go to the meeting room.

327
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,236
Excuse me.

328
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,840
About Akutsu's stakeout, is it…

329
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,675
You heard?

330
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,377
It's a cemetery.

331
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,179
I'll send the address.

332
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,214
Cemetery.

333
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,920
A cemetery at night?

334
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,789
TO BE CONTINUED

335
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,324
I'm scared.

336
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,926
This is way too scary.

337
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:57,930
She's an evil woman who tricked a man
to spend embezzled company money.

338
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:04,203
There's a chance of getting caught up
in something and pursued by tabloids.

339
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,772
