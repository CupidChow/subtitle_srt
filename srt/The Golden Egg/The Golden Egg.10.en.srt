1
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,412
Excuse me.

2
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:16,282
I'm Hinako Shinoda,
a reporter for the Sengoku Weekly.

3
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,651
A tabloid?

4
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:22,322
I have a photo I'd like to show you
in relation to Ms. Madoka.

5
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,092
Does anyone here look familiar?

6
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,933
I'm sorry, someone's here,
I'll be right back.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,735
I don't want to cause a scene.

8
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,370
Please come inside.

9
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,141
Thank you.

10
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,242
Sorry.

11
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:53,386
HASHIMOTO

12
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,591
I didn't want people to overhear,
so come inside.

13
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,560
I'm so sorry!

14
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:01,728
I'll come in.

15
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,401
Let's see that picture.

16
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,805
It may not relate to
Ms. Madoka's case at all,

17
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,973
but does this seem familiar to you?

18
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,777
What is this picture of?

19
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,015
We're currently following a story
on the fugitive Kota Kubozuka,

20
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,250
and this picture turned up.

21
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,622
I have one favor to ask.

22
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:34,661
Please don't share that a tabloid
reporter brought you this picture.

23
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,162
The police, too?

24
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:38,431
You mean they don't know?

25
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,166
We uncovered it ourselves.

26
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,504
But this Kubozuka
is a wanted fugitive, isn't he?

27
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,173
Usually you'd submit this.
Why wouldn't you?

28
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,509
We don't know if it's a lead or not.

29
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,181
Not telling the police first?

30
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,718
What are you after?

31
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,189
For a scoop?

32
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,459
You're doing this
to write a tabloid piece?

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,730
That's why you're hiding
something that is potential evidence?

34
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,067
Threatening me not to share it
with anyone.

35
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,507
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:31,050
That wasn't meant as a threat.

37
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,423
I'm sorry for upsetting you.

38
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,731
The reason I came here today

39
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,836
was to learn if you had heard
from Ms. Madoka lately.

40
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,238
I swear, that's all.

41
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,157
Would you look at the picture again?

42
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,830
If you don't recognize anything,
that's okay.

43
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:23,336
We'll continue to look for leads
on Ms. Madoka's whereabouts.

44
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,107
Please!

45
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,646
Please.

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,801
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,871
Could you show me again?

48
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,175
Thank you.

49
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,548
Who is this here?

50
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,017
You don't recognize them?

51
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,254
I don't think so.

52
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,322
Did they do it?

53
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,827
All I can say is there's a possibility
they're involved.

54
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,564
Then you're saying it's not Kubozuka?

55
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,165
I don't know yet.

56
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,900
We're investigating that now.

57
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,636
Sorry to ask again.

58
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,204
You're not the police?

59
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,972
No, I'm not.

60
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,976
But I think a tabloid reporter
can also have a role to play.

61
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,284
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

62
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,251
Not at all.

63
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,087
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

64
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,031
She loved these.

65
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,466
A bear?

66
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,836
She's waiting for Madoka, too.

67
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,245
I promise to bring her home to you.

68
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,232
Ms. Shinoda?

69
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,469
You're working late.

70
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,737
You, too.

71
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,339
So, are you taking a break?

72
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,275
I feel a little stuck.

73
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:43,843
Me, too.

74
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,446
The case has so much information,

75
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,115
I can barely keep up.

76
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,786
I keep wondering where the truth
of this case might be hiding.

77
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,822
The truth of the case, huh?

78
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,362
Right now,

79
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,699
all the information about the case

80
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,202
are like stars.

81
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,740
But if you draw lines between those stars,

82
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,610
you'll discover a new constellation.

83
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,713
What?

84
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,984
Something a detective said
in the novel I'm editing.

85
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:31,224
So how about you pretend to be
the protagonist of my mystery novel.

86
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,092
I want you to find a star.

87
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:40,566
I'm sure you just haven't found
the constellations in the darkness yet.

88
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:46,406
Okay, I guess I'll keep looking
for these stars you're talking about.

89
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,373
Nice!

90
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,042
You're Detective Hinako Shinoda.

91
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,345
So like this?

92
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,650
I need to work hard too.

93
00:06:58,818 --> 00:06:59,786
You got this.

94
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,422
Have a good night.

95
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:03,790
You too.

96
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,733
It was another fake tip.

97
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,268
I came up with nothing too.

98
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,404
Good work.

99
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,739
You too.

100
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:20,740
Good work.

101
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,208
So?

102
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,177
Find the Sunglasses Man?

103
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,912
Not yet, I'm sorry.

104
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,748
It's fine. Take your time.

105
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:29,949
What's that?

106
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,885
I got pictures from
the marriage mixer organizers.

107
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,991
What are the pictures of?

108
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,196
They sent every picture they've taken
for all their mixers.

109
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:49,168
There's even pictures of staff including
cooks, waiters, florists, and cameramen.

110
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,237
Thought it could help.

111
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,208
But it seems hard to find the Sunglasses
Man from all these.

112
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,677
Plus, he might not be wearing sunglasses.

113
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,380
Wait.

114
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,656
He looks somewhat similar.

115
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,425
Vaguely, though.

116
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,398
Hold on.

117
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,836
I feel like I saw him in a picture
I got from Ms. Iijima.

118
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:28,341
In a picture from an industry party.

119
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,678
Look!

120
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,013
This man.

121
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,821
They do seem alike and
have similar features around the mouth.

122
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,356
True.

123
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,925
I'll check with Ms. Iijima.

124
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,461
I'll ask the party organizer tomorrow.

125
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,362
Okay.

126
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,273
According to Ms. Iijima,

127
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:05,945
the Sunglasses Man looks like the first
victim Harue Komiyama's nephew.

128
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,780
His name is Atsuhiro Imamura.

129
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:11,083
He's the son of Harue Komiyama's
older sister.

130
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,686
She died a few years ago,

131
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:19,559
and Ms. Komiyama would give
her nephew work and financial support.

132
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,093
Financial support?

133
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,964
If he was relying on his successful aunt,
he'd be in her debt.

134
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,101
As a beauty consultant, she had money.

135
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,770
What is Imamura's job?

136
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,239
It seems he worked at a design firm,

137
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,608
but he quit and started his own company.

138
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,676
May I interject?

139
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,477
What is it?

140
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,547
Ms. Komiyama's sister
and parents passed away, right?

141
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:42,915
Yes.

142
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,453
If she earned a fortune as a consultant,

143
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,690
her nephew would
inherit everything, wouldn't he?

144
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,630
Dai, look into Imamura
and Komiyama's relationship.

145
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,497
Okay.

146
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,933
INHERITANCE?

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,802
Anything else, Murai?

148
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,104
Oh, take a look at this photo.

149
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:09,942
It's one of the photos we got
from the marriage mixer organizers.

150
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,812
This man looks like the Sunglasses Man.

151
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,215
We don't know if he's the same person.

152
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,551
Yamabuki went to verify it.

153
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,987
If it's the same person,

154
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:25,191
that connects Makiko Tanioka's case
and Harue Komiyama's.

155
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,928
Still, I'm not seeing the big picture.

156
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,001
Excuse me.

157
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,304
What was the Akasaka Cave again?

158
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,339
It's a cave bar in Akasaka.

159
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,377
It's where Ms. Komiyama met with
Kubozuka before her death.

160
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,145
A cave bar.

161
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,882
It's pretty interesting,
drinking booze in the dark.

162
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:54,553
They hand you a lantern at the entrance,
and your eyes have to adjust.

163
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,555
I had no idea what we were drinking.

164
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,592
But you ordered the drinks!

165
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,227
That's how dark it was.

166
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,195
Maybe Kubozuka drugged her then.

167
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,731
That's totally possible.

168
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:06,866
I'm back.

169
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:07,767
Great!

170
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,502
I visited the organizer's office.

171
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,503
Any pushback?

172
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,872
No, they helped look for new pictures.

173
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,340
Sorry for being so late.

174
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,575
I got details on the Sunglasses Man.

175
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,311
Let's see.

176
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,449
He was involved with the marriage mixer.

177
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,285
He was in charge of their website design.

178
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:28,821
Web designer?

179
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,557
They weren't expecting him at the party,

180
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,693
but he said he came in for work.

181
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,363
Which is why he likely got past reception
without signing in.

182
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,631
Did you get his name?

183
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,532
Yes.

184
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,535
Atsuhiro Imamura.

185
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,518
Yamabuki, go to the venue now

186
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,054
and check if he really had business there.

187
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:02,955
Okay.

188
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:07,827
Shinoda and Murai, go to
his former workplace and ask questions.

189
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,728
Okay.

190
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,598
It's Akutsu.

191
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,533
Put him on speaker.

192
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,104
Yes, what's up?

193
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,839
Good evening.

194
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:24,944
I was eavesdropping on someone
from Aoshiro's company,

195
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,680
and they were worried about
the Truth Weekly.

196
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,182
What do you mean?

197
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:35,321
It seems the Truth Weekly reporter is in
contact with one of Aoshiro's employees.

198
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,157
Why the hell are they in contact?

199
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:42,161
Apparently, the Truth Weekly got ahold
of Aoshiro's former secretary,

200
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,630
who seems to be their source.

201
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,466
Seriously? What information
is she giving them?

202
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,735
I believe it's about his relationships.

203
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,906
Ms. Kizaki, the second victim's name,
came up.

204
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,674
Yuko Kizaki.

205
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,843
This is Tsubaki.

206
00:12:58,577 --> 00:12:59,645
Yes, hello.

207
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:04,984
I got information that Yuko Kizaki
was an investor who invested in Aoshiro.

208
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:05,918
Is that right?

209
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,420
The secretary knows about that too.

210
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,024
I also heard Aoshiro gave Yuko Kizaki
a key to his apartment.

211
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,561
But Aoshiro has an alibi
for the second victim.

212
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:20,733
So the Truth Weekly thinks Aoshiro
came up with the plan

213
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,369
and Kubozuka carried it out.

214
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,204
That's my guess.

215
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,774
Which means the Truth Weekly's headline
would be like

216
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:33,913
"Handsome Businessman's Dark Secret:
The Mysterious Death of a Young Beauty."

217
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:40,553
What we fear is them finding
strong evidence against Aoshiro.

218
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,222
Akutsu, thanks for the report.

219
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,624
Of course. I'll keep watching Aoshiro.

220
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,259
I made up my mind!

221
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,564
This will be the top story
for our next issue.

222
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:54,800
Hold on.

223
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,469
We need to investigate more first.

224
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,841
Either we get outscooped
by the Truth Weekly or we outscoop them.

225
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,076
-It's one or the other.
-I get that.

226
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,846
But this is a big story
I've been chasing since last autumn.

227
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,915
Don't worry, be confident
and get back to it.

228
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,717
I don't want to fall short.

229
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,519
One wrong move, and we get sued.

230
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,454
You know that better than anyone.

231
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,157
Murai, we have an ace up our sleeve.

232
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,092
It will stain our record.

233
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,696
I urge for discretion here.

234
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,074
Look, I don't know what that man's done,

235
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,109
but I'm not covering for him.

236
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,644
He already left our company.

237
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,581
Plus, he was a designer in name only.

238
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,285
He kept bragging about
his successful aunt.

239
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,223
Also, he wasn't the type to have his fun
partying it up with everyone.

240
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,594
More like get sucked into
some weird, shady hobby.

241
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,762
A shady hobby?

242
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,930
What kind exactly?

243
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:01,133
The type of hobby I can't share.

244
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,336
Like bondage for example?

245
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:06,872
I can't say.

246
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,440
That's the nature.

247
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,976
You said you wouldn't cover for him.

248
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,611
I wouldn't cover for him,

249
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,781
but as a fellow man,
I'll protect his dignity.

250
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,684
We done?

251
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,085
Keep me anonymous, okay?

252
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,022
Thank you.

253
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,223
Thank you.

254
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,728
We're back.

255
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,497
Welcome back.

256
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,670
What happened?

257
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,374
Kitahama pulled some strings

258
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,978
to dig up the Truth Weekly's
secret weapon.

259
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,116
Turns out it's pretty big.

260
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:56,188
Aoshiro's currently dating
a famous actress.

261
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,026
It's the cherry they need to put on top
the suspicious deaths.

262
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,329
They're going to lead with it for sure.

263
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:08,367
If they do, the editor-in-chief
won't let us lead with our story.

264
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:13,672
It means all we can do
is sit back and watch.

265
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,377
Mr. Kitahama.

266
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,212
We can't.

267
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,982
Even if we break Imamura's story,
it's too late.

268
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,619
Like you said, we still have
more to investigate.

269
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,622
We were too slow.

270
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,059
Mr. Murai.

271
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,129
We ran a good race.

272
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,365
Doesn't matter if it's buried.

273
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,168
Akutsu, good work on the stakeout.

274
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:45,804
Well.

275
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,007
I'm still bitter.

276
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,076
How can it end like this?

277
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,448
Look, it happens in our industry.

278
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,384
It's cruel, sure.

279
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,220
But it's normal.

280
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:08,093
Just be sure to thank everyone
like Ms. Iijima who helped out.

281
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,329
-Yes, sir.
-Thanks.

282
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,127
Cave bar…

283
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:43,729
Darkness.

284
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,531
Kubozuka.

285
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,600
Was with her the day before her death.

286
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,372
Komiyama.

287
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,406
Inheritance.

288
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,908
Imamura.

289
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,111
A shady hobby?

290
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,951
Imamura and Komiyama.

291
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,686
Vaguely

292
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,523
resemble each other?

293
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:15,427
DARKNESS

294
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,462
SHADY HOBBY

295
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,037
What is it?

296
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:31,910
A witness said Ms. Komiyama met with
Kubozuka the day before her death.

297
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:36,315
But was it really Harue Komiyama
who Kubozuka met with?

298
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,922
We heard Atsuhiro Imamura
had a shady hobby.

299
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:48,060
Perhaps that hobby was crossdressing.

300
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,161
Crossdressing?

301
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:54,800
So maybe Kubozuka met with Imamura who
was dressed like a woman at the cave bar

302
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,835
and not Harue Komiyama.

303
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:02,774
Then Mr. Imamura killed Ms. Komiyama
and framed Kubozuka.

304
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,276
What's Imamura's motive?

305
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,612
The inheritance?

306
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,081
Most likely.

307
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,549
INHERITANCE?

308
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,784
Mr. Murai, Yamabuki.

309
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,119
Su, Dai, Attsu.

310
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:18,757
Go try to verify if Imamura
was into crossdressing.

311
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,791
Yes, sir!

312
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,960
Shinoda.

313
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,130
Good catch.

314
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,299
Can we still go for the top story?

315
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:28,700
Oh, yeah.

316
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,637
It's a walk-off grand slam.

317
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,908
This could be a big scoop.

318
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,609
-I'll go too!
-Okay.

319
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,788
TO BE CONTINUED

320
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,824
We're launching a camouflage tactic.

321
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,693
Who's good at lying low?

322
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,597
We have to find some evidence
to make it for the next issue.

323
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,333
A tabloid like us made a breakthrough.

324
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,402
It's all over for tabloids!

325
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,771
