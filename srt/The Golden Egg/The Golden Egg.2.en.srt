SENGOKU WEEKLY

2
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,511
Hello, Sengoku Weekly.

3
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:13,780
I have a scoop.

4
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:17,450
What kind of scoop?

5
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,688
I saw a cat holding a human hand
in its mouth.

6
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:22,655
A human hand?

7
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:27,427
I thought a tabloid might take action
on something like this.

8
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:33,767
Shinoda, you gotta be fed up
with people trying to trick you.

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,074
Could you tell me more?

10
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,811
How much do you pay for information?

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,249
We can discuss that after I determine
if this is a potential article.

12
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,584
Where did it happen?

13
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:58,058
It happened at an old residential area
north of the Umegaya shopping arcade.

14
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,959
The building is now abandoned,

15
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,796
but unfortunately
I don't know the exact address.

16
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,531
Is it next to a baker's shop?

17
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:05,432
Yes!

18
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,634
One moment, please.

19
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,103
By the way,

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,707
is it possible the cat had a piece
of bread in its mouth, not an arm?

21
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:15,809
Huh?!

22
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,311
Oh! It's not that I doubt you.

23
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,113
It was no bread!

24
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,514
I know what I saw!

25
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,849
When did you see it?

26
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,119
Just now!
It should still be in the area.

27
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,888
Tell me the details
from when you saw it.

28
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,593
There's a thin cinderblock wall
in the back,

29
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,530
and the cat was slowly walking on it
from the right to the left.

30
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,700
And the cat had the hand in its mouth.

31
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,103
How could you tell
it was a human hand?

32
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,504
There was a ring.

33
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,706
Could it have been a doll?

34
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,042
It was unmistakably a human hand.

35
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,911
How can you be so certain?

36
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:57,283
It was red and dirty where it was severed.

37
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,452
What's up?

38
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,522
It also smelled awful, so I'm sure of it!

39
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:07,861
The cat was walking on the wall, right?

40
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:13,933
I'm impressed you even noticed
the cat from so far away.

41
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,872
Well, I heard it cry.

42
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,976
So, um…

43
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:28,448
You said you were on the road,
and saw the ring.

44
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:33,019
Which means the back of the hand itself
was facing the road.

45
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,322
Meaning the cut should've been
on the opposite side.

46
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,491
So how could you tell it was red?

47
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,793
Did the cat make a U-turn
on the thin wall?

48
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,498
And if it cried out, it would've
had to put the hand down first.

49
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,800
So where did it drop it?

50
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,371
She hung up.

51
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,072
Sounds like a scam.

52
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,041
Probably after money.

53
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,478
There are people like that,
so stay vigilant.

54
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,616
Another dead end.

55
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:10,957
Ms. Shinoda.

56
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:11,858
Yes?

57
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,092
Are you free?

58
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,163
I need a high school girl.

59
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,266
Say what?

60
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:38,851
Sorry I took a while.

61
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,753
Sorry about this.

62
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,557
I wonder if you remember this story.

63
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:49,429
A woman who died from an unexpected
accident in a Shinagawa park last month.

64
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,998
I vaguely remember.

65
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,934
Well, we found a picture of the victim

66
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,570
with a high school girl.

67
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:03,810
We tried to meet this girl to talk to her,

68
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,212
but somehow, she's gone missing.

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,948
Her name is Madoka Hashimoto.

70
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,784
We basically have no leads.

71
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:16,155
All we know is she had a part-time
job for a few months since last fall.

72
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:22,262
It's some clothing store by the station
that's popular with young women.

73
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:26,099
It'd be really helpful if you could
pin down which shop.

74
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:34,907
I'd like you to approach them
by saying her mother asked you

75
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,443
to look for your missing classmate.

76
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,280
You could pass for a high school kid.

77
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,182
Just replace your shoes and bag.

78
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,818
So go ahead,
you'll be reimbursed for them.

79
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,588
Right now?

80
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,522
Yes.

81
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,659
Madoka Hashimoto was
part of the Movie Club,

82
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,461
and she was cheerful and outgoing,
with average grades.

83
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,865
You can show this picture if necessary,

84
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,633
but don't offer your card.

85
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,369
Good luck.

86
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,105
Wait!

87
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,242
So I find her workplace,

88
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,144
then what?

89
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:17,250
If you figure out her workplace,
we might find out where she currently is.

90
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,319
Okay, you've got this.

91
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,020
Hold on!

92
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,024
What do I wear?

93
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,795
Something fit for
a high-school girl, right?

94
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,630
Why are you asking me?

95
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,701
Anyway, you'll be fine as long as
you don't look like an office worker.

96
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,336
Sorry.

97
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,771
I'm supposed to meet someone now.

98
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,839
Good luck.

99
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:52,752
You're right, she's the only one
who could take on this mission.

100
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,789
But she's late.

101
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,691
Has she messaged you?

102
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,429
MS. SHINODA
THIS FEELS CRINGE

103
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,232
Nope, nothing.

104
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:07,934
Yeah?

105
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,471
I'm worried she might be panicking.

106
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,917
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

107
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:26,886
Mr. Murai!

108
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,289
I'm back.

109
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,357
Good job.

110
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,425
Were you okay?

111
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,661
I didn't have time to change
before coming back.

112
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,565
Let's meet up in the conference
room for a debriefing at 18:00.

113
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,000
Let Akutsu know, too.

114
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,736
Excuse me.

115
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,939
Can I get a comment?

116
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:50,877
Good work.

117
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,981
SENGOKU WEEKLY

118
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:55,882
Really?

119
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,326
Your fit is on point today.

120
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,428
Like that, right?

121
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,163
Even if you say it as a joke…

122
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,131
No, I'm quite serious!

123
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,533
Also, what was that message?

124
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,536
Sorry, I sent that to you by mistake.

125
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,006
I thought I sent that to Asuka,
a coworker in sales.

126
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,107
I see.

127
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,743
Canvassing is tough.

128
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,212
How did you do it?

129
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,649
Well.

130
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,453
There were so many shops.

131
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,057
I just basically repeatedly approached
the staff who were on the floor.

132
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,627
I asked if Madoka Hashimoto
ever worked there.

133
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,597
Then I mentioned that Madoka
hasn't been home lately.

134
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,666
Those were my talking points.

135
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,936
The first shop was a bust,

136
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:55,107
but I felt some relief when I realized
I just had to repeat these two steps.

137
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:59,245
But then the second shop
was really uncooperative.

138
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,317
And when I told the third
that her mother asked me to do this,

139
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,385
they asked me if that was true.

140
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,922
I panicked so hard,
I thought my heart would burst.

141
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,457
What gave it away?

142
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,161
It seems she didn't get along
with her mother.

143
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,865
So they doubted a mother like that
would ask me to help.

144
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,033
That makes sense.

145
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,237
We should go.

146
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,172
Yeah.

147
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,276
After hearing that,

148
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:36,682
I asked the worker how they knew that.

149
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,118
Good point.

150
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,222
According to this coworker,

151
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,325
Ms. Hashimoto worked there
from last fall to the new year,

152
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,395
hiding that she was still in high school.

153
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,798
They often had their breaks together,

154
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:57,470
and Hashimoto did mention a boy,
but the staff didn't remember the details.

155
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,474
Hashimoto also wanted to model,
and considered auditioning.

156
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,111
She told the coworker about
attending a seminar in that field.

157
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,746
That's all I've got.

158
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,816
Sounds like great work!

159
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,019
Good job. This doesn't always work out.

160
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,322
Even without results,
this legwork is important.

161
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,994
Tabloids are made up from an accumulation
of misses and dead ends.

162
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,064
We're finished if we neglect that.

163
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,133
Never forget that.

164
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,701
Anyway, great work.

165
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,104
Excuse me.

166
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,841
What do you mean by "finished"?

167
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,110
Our article quality.

168
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,413
The amount of work put in.

169
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,717
Every small detail
depends on the care we put in it.

170
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,387
If we cut corners, our quality dips.

171
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,489
If our quality dips, we lose trust.

172
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,991
If a tabloid loses trust,

173
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,360
it's finished.

174
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,964
You'll get it eventually.

175
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,100
Anyway, good work.

176
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,708
Good work today.

177
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,048
Shinoda, you can pull off disguises.

178
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:16,983
What?

179
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,285
Is it working?

180
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,489
I could use your help on something.

181
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,026
But before that,

182
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,662
I want you to go to Niigata tomorrow.

183
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,432
Here's a bullet train ticket.

184
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,002
TOKYO TO NIIGATA

185
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,537
What's the job?

186
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,810
Let's talk over dinner.

187
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,054
I hope she is safe.

188
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,556
Just go home already.

189
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,459
I'm praying nothing has happened,

190
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,163
and that this picture
won't need to get published.

191
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,465
Thanks for waiting.

192
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,468
-I'm sure you're curious about the job.
-Yes.

193
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,308
Kota Kubozuka, age 27.

194
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,013
In his teenage years,
he caused an assault case.

195
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:25,518
At the time, he was under the care
of a Mr. Kazuo Watanabe.

196
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,655
They lived in Niigata City at the time,

197
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,525
but Kubozuka moved to Tokyo with friends.

198
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:38,164
Mr. Watanabe is currently
living in a home in Tokyo.

199
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,534
But to be sure, I want to check
their Niigata residence.

200
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,638
To check if Mr. Watanabe is there?

201
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,975
Making sure he's not there
is part of the job.

202
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,879
So this is an intel gathering mission.

203
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,883
Make sure you ring the doorbell.

204
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,051
Okay.

205
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,754
And even if nobody answers,

206
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,924
can you check
if the meters are running?

207
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,995
And also walk a lap around the house.

208
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:10,930
Understood.

209
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,231
Thanks.

210
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,675
The next morning, I went to Niigata

211
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,078
with plans to come back within the day.

212
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,648
But I got lost

213
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:34,220
and now I'm in the home of a stranger
I interviewed this afternoon.

214
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,657
I managed to make it
to Mr. Watanabe's house,

215
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:43,129
but then I got lost on the way back.

216
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,097
And then it got dark.

217
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,033
And then my phone died,

218
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,802
so I couldn't call anyone.

219
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,804
And then it started raining hard.

220
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,940
And then I saw a sign that said
beware of bears--

221
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,275
Maybe come in?

222
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,477
For now, you should come in.

223
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,380
Here, dry yourself off.

224
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,416
Come on, you'll catch a cold!

225
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,185
Thank you, I'm sorry!

226
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,191
I'm terribly sorry to ask,

227
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,294
but could I charge my phone here?

228
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,596
Are you going somewhere again?

229
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,432
Back to Tokyo.

230
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,103
You can't go back today!

231
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,038
It'll be tomorrow, most likely.

232
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,707
Stay the night here.

233
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,142
We have a spare room.

234
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,578
Take a bath, get a good night's sleep,

235
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,446
and then go home tomorrow, okay?

236
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,589
Thank you very much!

237
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:58,971
Ms. Shinoda?

238
00:13:59,038 --> 00:13:59,872
Yes?

239
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,841
How's the water? Not too hot?

240
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,075
It's perfect.

241
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,376
Thank you.

242
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,945
That's good to hear.

243
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:06,979
Enjoy.

244
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,581
Thank you.

245
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,419
In the mountains of Niigata,

246
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,055
I encountered human warmth
I had not felt in a while.

247
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,793
But what am I even doing?

248
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,098
I didn't join a publisher
to do stuff like this.

249
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,349
Are my daughter's pajamas too big?

250
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,250
Not at all.

251
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:45,751
It's perfect.

252
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:46,886
Thank you.

253
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,122
Is Sengokusha that publisher?

254
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,458
Yes.

255
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,193
I read it sometimes.

256
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,430
Let's see…

257
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,766
Here.

258
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,769
That's the Weekly Truth
from our rival company.

259
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,305
This isn't it?

260
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,109
But Sengokusha is well-known.

261
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,646
-I'll help.
-Don't be silly.

262
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:14,947
Sit down.

263
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,753
But I assumed if it's a tabloid,

264
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,156
the reporters would be more experienced.

265
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,158
You're a full-time employee?

266
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,059
Yes.

267
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,295
I joined last spring after graduating.

268
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,232
They sent a girl
in her second year on the job

269
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,668
to a place this remote by herself?

270
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,671
Even if it's just research,
that's so dangerous.

271
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:43,042
It's not really research.
More like, gathering intel.

272
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,712
Watanabe wasn't there, was he?

273
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,547
No.

274
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:54,386
I think he moved to a group home
in Tokyo two years ago.

275
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,189
He lived alone,

276
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,727
so his house has been empty
for a while.

277
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,496
I knew that coming in.

278
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,666
You knew it
and they still sent you anyway?

279
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,337
Checking to make sure
he wasn't here is part of the job.

280
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,605
You're impressive for someone so young.

281
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,042
Do you visit home often?

282
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,378
I'm sure your folks worry.

283
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,482
My parents don't know I've transferred
to the Incident Team,

284
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,485
they think I'm still editing the PR zine.

285
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,488
I'm sure they'd love a call from you.

286
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,957
Can you drink?

287
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,526
I'm still on the clock.

288
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:35,961
Sorry.

289
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,629
Do you usually drink?

290
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,798
Yes, I do. A bit.

291
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,235
What'll happen if you get drunk?

292
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,770
Don't ask her that!

293
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,039
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

294
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,375
Why don't you come sit here?

295
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:50,876
Thank you.

296
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,716
I go drinking a lot
with my friend in sales.

297
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,719
And she says I don't change at all.

298
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,787
Really?

299
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,093
You hear me, stupid Sengokusha!

300
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,395
Cut it out.

301
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,230
I'm so done.

302
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,164
I'm going to quit!

303
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,767
Keep your voice down, it's embarrassing.

304
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,701
ASUKA MEGURO

305
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,536
Who cares, nobody's listening!

306
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,138
The bartender's here.

307
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,909
How much did I tell you?

308
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,545
I went to Niigata--

309
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,048
That's enough. Let's just go home.

310
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:33,752
I rang the doorbell in the rain.

311
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,421
You said that already.

312
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,222
They let you spend the night.

313
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,057
Yeah.

314
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,658
That's it.

315
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,894
You gotta listen to what happened!

316
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,062
I'm listening!

317
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,264
And then--

318
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,469
I woke up in the morning,

319
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,938
and helped with the laundry.

320
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,441
Then they fed me again.

321
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,344
Then they drove me to the station,

322
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,215
and I couldn't thank them enough.

323
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:08,220
I didn't think they'd ever
accept any money from me,

324
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,392
so I left some money and a letter
on my bedding.

325
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,359
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP

326
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,529
I think the wife will find it.

327
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,235
I'm surprised you had letter paper.

328
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,440
I always do.

329
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,810
So you really are
doing your best at work.

330
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,746
Yes, exactly, I'm trying so hard!

331
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,014
You're being relied on.

332
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,719
But if they ever ask me
to do some weird job again,

333
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,355
I'm definitely turning it down.

334
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,058
Will you though?

335
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,860
Can you?

336
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,730
I bet you're secretly feeling fulfilled.

337
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,468
Give me another!

338
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,881
MULTIPLE SUSPICIOUS DEATHS

339
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,088
HARUE KOMIYAMA

340
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,789
MADOKA HASHIMOTO

341
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,531
KOTA KUBOZUKA - FUGITIVE

342
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,320
You've reached Sengoku Weekly.

343
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,856
TO BE CONTINUED

344
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,958
We might catch them sleeping over.

345
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,562
An outfit to trick an up-and-coming
influencer and the Blue Ranger.

346
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,497
This apartment is our target's home.

347
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,232
You make a living on others' misery.

348
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,435
I thought I was
a stronger person than this.

349
