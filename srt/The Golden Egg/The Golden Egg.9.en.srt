1
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:06,806
Okay.

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,145
I'll show you what she gave me.

3
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,015
Huh?

4
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:20,320
I have it at home though,
so it'll take a little while.

5
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:25,692
We could do it at the Sengokusha office,
in our reception room.

6
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,862
Nobody would see us there,
so it would be safe.

7
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:32,999
Thank you.

8
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,620
Wow, I'm relieved you met up
with Niko-chan.

9
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,424
So, how was your first marriage mixer?

10
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,492
I didn't have time for the mixer,

11
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,462
but I managed to blend in
thanks to Ms. Iijima.

12
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,631
Hats off to her for sure.

13
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,666
It looks good on you.

14
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,404
Actually, there was a tiny incident.

15
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,641
Have you been entrusted with something?

16
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,309
I thought that was you.

17
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,544
Give me the envelope, now!

18
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,046
What are you doing? Stop it!

19
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,582
I'll be taking this.

20
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,920
You said you were visually impaired!

21
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,359
That's more than just a tiny incident!

22
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,830
Tell me everything you remember
about that man.

23
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:37,764
Okay.

24
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,866
I only vaguely remember the details.

25
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,914
He was like this.

26
00:01:56,015 --> 00:02:00,520
I'm sure it was neither Kubozuka
or Aoshiro, barring plastic surgery.

27
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,656
So we have another player.

28
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,427
You mean all three are connected
to the case?

29
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:12,832
Well, the more people involved in a crime,
the greater the chance of getting caught.

30
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,868
So fewer is always better.

31
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,537
Mr. Aoshiro has an alibi, right?

32
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,205
He does.

33
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,242
But we can't rule him out of
being involved somehow.

34
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,847
Because these two are
from the same hometown.

35
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,152
I actually went to Niigata yesterday.

36
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:37,090
I managed to talk to a few of Aoshiro's
high school classmates.

37
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:37,991
Huh?

38
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:44,697
The father of one of our classmates ran
a company more successful than Aoshiro's.

39
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:49,169
But one day, the local delinquents
started targeting him, beating him up.

40
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,839
Nobody would believe me,
but Aoshiro was behind it.

41
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,909
He ordered the delinquents to do it.

42
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,045
What do you think?

43
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,915
Mr. Aoshiro was jealous?

44
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,016
Exactly.

45
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:08,054
I was introduced to his other friends
and asked them questions, too.

46
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,690
They all said the same thing.

47
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,826
"I bet nobody would believe me."

48
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,929
"I don't have any proof, but…"

49
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,898
And finally, they said this.

50
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,202
Just between us,

51
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,439
everyone who got in his way
met a tragic fate.

52
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:33,713
The reason I can't rule Aoshiro out is
because I discovered this side of him.

53
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,683
It's hard for me to believe.

54
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,352
But they're just rumors, right?

55
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,923
Isn't there a chance
they're slandering him out of jealousy?

56
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,158
You have a point.

57
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,961
To be honest, I found him
to sound pretty fishy,

58
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:52,065
but maybe he's just easily misunderstood
in that way.

59
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,435
Does that mean Kubozuka
likely did this all by himself?

60
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,669
The interesting thing is,

61
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,405
I asked around about Kubozuka, too.

62
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,808
They all said the same thing again.

63
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,077
That he was a likeable guy.

64
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:05,778
What?

65
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:10,917
So if Aoshiro isn't involved,
and Kubozuka is innocent,

66
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,886
I thought there could be another culprit.

67
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:14,821
And then…

68
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,557
Sunglasses Man showed up.

69
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:23,129
Well, it doesn't mean the information
I found out is true.

70
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:27,567
As you said, they're just rumors.

71
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,306
I don't want anything coloring my judgment

72
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,175
and remain skeptical.

73
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,045
Ms. Shinoda.

74
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:41,848
You've grown.

75
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:42,749
Huh?

76
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:13,946
I'd like you to approach them
by saying her mother asked you

77
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,149
to look for your missing classmate.

78
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,285
Sounds like great work!

79
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,254
Shinoda, you can pull off disguises.

80
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,922
Is it working?

81
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,206
Shinoda, I want you and Suzaki to pretend
to be a flirty couple.

82
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,542
I guess I gotta kill it.

83
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,943
I'm sorry!

84
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,434
I'm scared. This is way too scary.

85
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,871
I'm Shinoda, a writer
for the Sengoku Weekly.

86
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,639
Is it still a scoop?

87
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,109
I got it from here.

88
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,543
Good work.

89
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,765
He gave the okay!

90
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,733
Nice one.

91
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,469
Just like you were in your letter,

92
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,272
I'm curious to know
where your warmth comes from.

93
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:52,111
If you would like to meet up again
sometime, this is my private information.

94
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,647
You really did a great job.

95
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:56,516
Thank you.

96
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:02,722
Right.

97
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,926
I guess I have grown.

98
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,560
This is what she gave me.

99
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,096
Data of some sort?

100
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,633
Photography was her hobby.

101
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:56,042
Unfortunately, there are so many pictures,
I don't know which ones are relevant.

102
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,211
How many are there?

103
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,445
About 2,000?

104
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,248
Can I look at them?

105
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,182
Of course.

106
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,689
Do you think one of them
is the money shot?

107
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,825
Best place to hide a tree
is in the forest.

108
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,827
Something that looks only scenic

109
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,830
could have something hidden in it.

110
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,001
Tanioka was using it to blackmail someone.

111
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,771
There's a good chance
that's what got her killed.

112
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,841
Is there really such a damning photo

113
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,277
among all these?

114
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:33,913
Wait.

115
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,483
There's something odd about this picture.

116
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,021
Mr. Murai!

117
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,857
Is this?

118
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:56,302
Earlier today, we met up with
a man named Niko-chan

119
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,071
who was friends with the third
victim Tanioka.

120
00:08:59,138 --> 00:08:59,972
Niko-chan?

121
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,909
The place he lives in
is colloquially called "Nikotama."

122
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:08,281
Right before her death, Ms. Tanioka gave
Niko-chan a USB-stick as insurance.

123
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,551
And this was one of the pictures.

124
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,024
Aoshiro!

125
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,192
Huh? How can you tell?

126
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,461
I've been after him a while.

127
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,763
Good eye, Suzaki.

128
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,998
It was indeed Seiya Aoshiro.

129
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,600
Which means

130
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:32,305
Makiko Tanioka and Seiya Aoshiro
were connected.

131
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,442
There was another curious picture,
which is this one.

132
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,679
It's Aoshiro again.

133
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,514
But, who's the man with him?

134
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,918
This man resembles the person
Shinoda met at the marriage mixer.

135
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,353
We don't know who he is.

136
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,924
These pictures were taken one week
after the second death.

137
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:58,731
My guess is that Tanioka concluded
Aoshiro was involved and blackmailed him.

138
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:04,570
So you're saying Aoshiro killed her
over these pictures?

139
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,205
No, but it is a possibility.

140
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,643
Ms. Tanioka told Niko-chan that she found
a rich man to blackmail, before she died.

141
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,146
It makes for a compelling case
if Aoshiro was this mark.

142
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:18,417
If this sunglasses guy was at the party,
we should be able to find him.

143
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:23,222
If he's involved somehow,
how did he get into the party?

144
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,057
Can you look into it?

145
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,193
Okay, I'll ask the party organizers.

146
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,997
And I'll ask my stylist contact if they
know who this guy is.

147
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:35,468
Got it. So Dai, I want you to find how
Aoshiro and Tanioka were connected.

148
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,535
-Okay.
-Then…

149
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:38,437
Where's Akutsu?

150
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,406
The bathroom. He ate too much.

151
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,575
Tell him to stake out Aoshiro.

152
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,509
Okay.

153
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,444
And Su,

154
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,380
I want you to be at the ready.

155
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:48,881
You got it.

156
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,718
Shinoda, find out with Tama-chan
who Tanioka was friends with.

157
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:53,619
Yes, sir.

158
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:56,889
But be careful.

159
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,625
The culprit's attacked
three women already.

160
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,460
Make sure not to act alone.

161
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,562
Warn Tama-chan, too.

162
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,797
It's Niko-chan.

163
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:05,798
Huh? What?

164
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,933
You've been saying Tama-chan
all this time.

165
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,108
Are you okay with the time?

166
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,612
Afternoon hours don't start
until 1:00 p.m..

167
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,714
Thank you.

168
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,785
We'll do whatever it takes to find
this sunglasses man.

169
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,354
Tell me.

170
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,124
Why's a tabloid so hellbent on this?

171
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:38,564
I mean, you've lost a friend.
We need to find out the truth.

172
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,538
But if I'm being honest,
we have our motives as a publication.

173
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,712
If we secure solid evidence
on a wanted fugitive,

174
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,114
it would make for a sensational article.

175
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:59,652
My mentor said
being the first to break the case is huge.

176
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,426
Whoever can write first about a fugitive,

177
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,329
no matter how trivial the content is,

178
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,399
is a winner in this business.

179
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:19,205
If someone beats us to it,
no matter what we publish, it's too late.

180
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:29,048
Given the scope and the notoriety,
even follow-up reports will sell.

181
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:35,554
Part of it is that we're desperately
trying not to get out-scooped.

182
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,258
You're so honest.

183
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,061
Just let me know if I can help.

184
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,897
Thank you.

185
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:48,434
Seagulls!

186
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,004
-What? Where?
-There.

187
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,109
Sorry I'm late.

188
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,078
Glad you made it.

189
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,613
Thanks.

190
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,583
Could I have the same?

191
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,518
Coming up.

192
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,954
So? What were you investigating?

193
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,724
That serial mysterious deaths case.

194
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,493
How did the undercover work go?

195
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,529
It was crazy.

196
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,264
But there was progress.

197
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,000
The whole Incident Team
is working on this.

198
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,683
So listen, I had this thought.

199
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:16,288
How would you feel if Sengokusha
pulled out of the tabloid game?

200
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,323
Will they?

201
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,624
No, hypothetically.

202
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,360
What if it discontinued?

203
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,098
I would've had an answer in April.

204
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,168
Did something change since then?

205
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,069
A little.

206
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,905
What about you, did something happen?

207
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:35,507
Yeah.

208
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,612
It's one of the new novels
that was brought in.

209
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,616
A manuscript!

210
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,352
When I read a manuscript like this,

211
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:52,324
it helps me realize there's a real person
behind the words.

212
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:57,062
This novel especially
since it's going for realism.

213
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,132
The life it depicts
doesn't seem fabricated.

214
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,101
That's why…

215
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,703
Yeah?

216
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,138
Like I mentioned before,

217
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:12,077
I'm convinced that novels and tabloids
aren't that far apart.

218
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,115
I mean, reading this
gave me a stomachache.

219
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,520
This pain was carried over from
my time at the Sengoku Weekly.

220
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,689
What about you?

221
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,626
Would you feel relieved if Sengokusha
dropped the tabloid?

222
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,094
Well.

223
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:31,931
I'd become uneasy.

224
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,332
Uneasy?

225
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:39,405
Novels and tabloids both explore reality
from different sides.

226
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,076
If you throw away one,
you halve the effort.

227
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,212
That's a questionable move
for a publisher.

228
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,548
What do you mean?

229
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:54,520
In other words, novels only cover
topics picked by the authors,

230
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,690
but tabloids can cover anything.

231
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,896
I mean, they're selective to an extent,
but most of it isn't pretty or perfect.

232
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,000
Sorry, could you say that again?

233
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,670
This probably isn't the place.

234
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,441
So you're saying if
the Sengoku Weekly got pulled,

235
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,411
these not so pretty things
wouldn't see the light of day?

236
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,781
Yes! And maybe that's where
my uneasiness comes from.

237
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,284
I see.

238
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,153
What a serious thing to think about.

239
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,759
This is all because you asked
what the purpose of tabloids was!

240
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,794
You thought about it for me?

241
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,429
Thank you.

242
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,631
Am I too serious?

243
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,167
Sorry.

244
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:51,010
SENGOKU WEEKLY

245
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,141
SENGOKU WEEKLY

246
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,391
I couldn't manage to find
a connection between Tanioka and Aoshiro.

247
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,094
If that's the case,

248
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,697
was her blackmail target
the sunglasses man instead?

249
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,968
It comes down to if he has money
worth shaking down.

250
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:54,440
I'm having my stylist contact ask around
about the sunglasses man.

251
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,108
Got it, how about the mixer?

252
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,111
After hearing we had a reporter
go in undercover,

253
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,680
they begged us not to mention them
in an article.

254
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:06,885
They agreed to check if
the sunglasses man is a member.

255
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:07,986
Okay, Akutsu.

256
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,721
How's tailing Aoshiro?

257
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,292
I found out the Truth Weekly
is tailing him, too.

258
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,127
Are you serious?

259
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,728
It was definitely the Truth.

260
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:17,930
What do we do?

261
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,236
Stay on Aoshiro and
check out that reporter.

262
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,204
Yes, sir.

263
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,806
And Su, you're on standby.

264
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,608
Standby?

265
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:33,445
Dai, I want you to switch to
investigating Kubozuka.

266
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,280
How's he funding his escape?

267
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,817
Try to take into account Aoshiro and
Sunglasses' possible involvement.

268
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,919
-Find a new perspective.
-Copy that.

269
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,356
-Mr. Murai.
-What is it?

270
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,925
Please tell me Madoka Hashimoto's
home address.

271
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:51,563
I want to ask her parents
if they've heard from her.

272
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,032
I doubt they'd talk to a tabloid.

273
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,604
Have them look at Ms. Tanioka's
photos then?

274
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,039
They might know something.

275
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:05,677
It's worth chasing down any possibility,

276
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,814
but we're the only ones
with these crucial pictures.

277
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,282
Not even the cops have it.

278
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,618
We'd need them to stay quiet.

279
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,755
They can't even tell the cops
they saw these pictures.

280
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,991
So better not show them.

281
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,425
Sorry.

282
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,127
You know what?

283
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,596
I'll leave it to you.

284
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:29,801
Even if they went to the police,
they won't take action immediately.

285
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:35,140
If they come question us,
me and Mr. Murai make ourselves scarce.

286
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,208
Right?

287
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,012
Either way, we have to go hard and fast.

288
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,182
I'm not letting the Truth Weekly
getting ahead of us!

289
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,017
Shinoda, give it a shot.

290
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:46,618
Yes, sir!

291
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,787
TO BE CONTINUED

292
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,257
You're doing this
to write a tabloid piece?

293
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,293
One wrong move and we'll get sued.

294
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,061
I want you to find a star.

295
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,963
He looks somewhat similar.

296
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,298
A shady hobby?

297
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,799
The type of hobby I can't share.

298
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,770
