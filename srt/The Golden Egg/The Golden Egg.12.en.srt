FINAL EPISODE

2
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:16,783
<i>A long day for the </i>Sengoku Weekly
<i>Incident Team was about to begin.</i>

3
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:31,898
<i>An exclusive interview with</i>
<i>the wanted fugitive Kota Kubozuka.</i>

4
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,266
This way.

5
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,337
Nice to meet you, I'm Kitahama
of the Incident Team.

6
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:41,941
Please.

7
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:48,581
What's wrong?

8
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,019
Mr. Watanabe told me

9
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,756
there was a woman
who didn't seem to belong at a tabloid.

10
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:00,693
That she had clear eyes,
and I could trust her.

11
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,962
Is she not here today?

12
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,535
I think you mean Shinoda, but she's out
looking for Madoka Hashimoto.

13
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,570
What?

14
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,940
She was with you
while you were evading the police, right?

15
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,310
How much do you know?

16
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,646
She won't get arrested, right?

17
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,315
-Don't write about Madoka.
-Don't worry.

18
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,751
She won't be in the article.

19
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,788
We won't be contacting
or handing you over to the police.

20
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:35,061
While there are only old men
with jaded eyes here,

21
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:39,065
in our hearts we just want to help you.

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,936
Please, you have nothing to worry about.

23
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,764
Will she show up?

24
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,034
I'm sure she will.

25
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:24,077
The first time I met Madoka
was at Seiya Aoshiro's apartment.

26
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:30,483
Mr. Aoshiro looked after me
when I first came to Tokyo from Niigata.

27
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:35,655
But one day, some fangirl showed up
wanting a look at Mr. Aoshiro.

28
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,391
That was Madoka.

29
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,461
You exchanged numbers?

30
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,562
Yes.

31
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,131
She came all by herself
so she caught my interest.

32
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,166
By herself?

33
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,035
How did that come to be?

34
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,704
Well.

35
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,610
Madoka was attending a seminar
for aspiring models.

36
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:02,182
It seems she was close to Harue Komiyama
who she met there.

37
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,617
And Ms. Komiyama invited her.

38
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:08,354
Have you ever met Ms. Komiyama--

39
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:09,656
No, I haven't.

40
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,225
So, I'm not acquainted with her at all.

41
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,895
The day before Ms. Komiyama's body
was discovered in the park,

42
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,198
I had plans to meet with Mr. Aoshiro

43
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:21,401
and went to the cave bar in Akasaka.

44
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:25,505
But then I got a message saying
he couldn't make it.

45
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,207
Mr. Aoshiro picked the bar?

46
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,107
Yes.

47
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,644
That's when a pretty woman approached me.

48
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,082
But I suddenly got sleepy
after drinking with her.

49
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,253
Next thing I know, I'm waking up
in a public men's room in the park.

50
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:46,893
I had no idea Ms. Komiyama was lying dead
just a few feet away in the women's stall.

51
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,528
It wasn't me who killed her!

52
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,429
We know.

53
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,898
Mr. Watanabe said the same.

54
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,902
We found out a lot of information.

55
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:02,909
Just between us, I think we can
clear your name.

56
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,884
Please tell us everything you know.

57
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,422
Okay.

58
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,160
Hey, isn't that her?

59
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,696
-Madoka!
-Let's go.

60
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,301
Hello!

61
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,339
I'm sorry for ambushing you.

62
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,174
What?

63
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,677
You're Madoka Hashimoto, right?

64
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:39,979
Who are you?

65
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,983
I'm Hinako Shinoda
from the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i>.

66
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,785
And I'm Daisuke Tsubaki.

67
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,222
What do you want?

68
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,125
Could we take you home?

69
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,428
I'm sure Kubozuka told you,

70
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,531
but he's sharing his side of the story
at our office.

71
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,534
Don't worry, he's in good hands.

72
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,503
Let's go home.

73
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,508
I don't want to.

74
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,616
The doll house!

75
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,023
I liked doll houses too.

76
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,863
The little bear was waiting for you.

77
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:32,999
You went to my house?

78
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,534
I met your mom.

79
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,704
She's really worried about you,
so please go home.

80
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,905
Don't lie.

81
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,374
Your mom mentioned your modeling.

82
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,778
I talked to her.

83
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:49,949
What's this?

84
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,352
TO MADOKA HASHIMOTO

85
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,459
Did something happen?

86
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,197
Maybe it was my fault.

87
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,302
Madoka dreams of being a model.

88
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,374
When she said she was attending
a seminar for aspiring models,

89
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,343
I was absolutely against it.

90
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,981
I told her not to attend
such a shady seminar.

91
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:23,950
Then

92
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:30,089
she accused me of being prejudiced,
and got in a huge fight.

93
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,893
I should've

94
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,063
been more open

95
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,299
and listened to what she had to say.

96
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,005
Your mom regretted her actions.

97
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,674
So let's go home.

98
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,782
A little after the first incident,

99
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,118
Mr. Aoshiro asked me for romantic advice.

100
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,892
There's this girl I can't get rid of.

101
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,860
That's tough.

102
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,596
She asks for money every time
we go on a date.

103
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,665
Can't you just break up?

104
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,136
It's not that easy.

105
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,375
Could you go get dinner with her
next time I'm abroad?

106
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,677
I'll pay for it.

107
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,345
Here.

108
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:28,981
What?

109
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,120
I'll come up with an excuse.

110
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,621
Okay?

111
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,256
Thanks, man.

112
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,094
I couldn't say no after taking the money.

113
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:47,200
I later met up with her, Ms. Kizaki,
and went back home with her.

114
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,671
I didn't plan to go,

115
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:56,409
but some weird guy with sunglasses
hassled us while we were drinking.

116
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,643
-Huh?
-What?

117
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,145
He spilled alcohol on me.

118
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:03,049
Then Ms. Kizaki offered
to wash them at her place.

119
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,951
That's why you went to her place.

120
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,752
I thought about saying no,

121
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,888
but I suddenly got sleepy

122
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,857
and ended up going to her place.

123
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,227
When I woke up, I was in bed,

124
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,296
and Ms. Kizaki was lying dead next to me.

125
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,800
The second incident…

126
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,236
YUKO KIZAKI

127
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,872
I had no idea what was going on.

128
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,407
I called Mr. Aoshiro right away
'cause I panicked.

129
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,710
I swear I didn't do anything!

130
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:34,780
<i>I know that,</i>
<i>but it doesn't look good for you.</i>

131
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,782
<i>You have a prior offense, right?</i>

132
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,987
<i>So even if you're innocent,</i>
<i>maybe you're better off running away?</i>

133
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,054
For real?

134
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,995
<i>I'd been living in fear every day</i>
<i>after that.</i>

135
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,498
After a while Mr. Aoshiro called me,
asking me to hand a letter

136
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:56,302
to a woman in Shizuoka
named Makiko Tanioka.

137
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,906
A few days after delivering it,
not suspecting anything,

138
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,308
the third death occurred.

139
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:08,681
When I read in news that the footprints
at the scene matched the second case,

140
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,716
<i>I got a bad feeling.</i>

141
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,219
WANTED
KOTA KUBOZUKA (27)

142
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,155
<i>Next thing I knew,</i>
<i>I was a wanted fugitive.</i>

143
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,527
<i>Madoka was with me at the time,</i>
<i>and she encouraged me.</i>

144
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,595
What's wrong?

145
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,598
I swear I didn't--

146
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,666
Don't worry.

147
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,769
I know it looks bad now,

148
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,238
but you'll be cleared.

149
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,975
I mean, you need to clear your name
if it wasn't you!

150
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,284
<i>I knew I shouldn't have depended on her,</i>

151
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,986
<i>but I got her involved in this.</i>

152
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,527
I'd like to apologize to Madoka's family.

153
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,465
<i>When Madoka called her mother once,</i>

154
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:03,703
<i>she told her she was with me</i>
<i>and not to tell the police.</i>

155
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,806
<i>I feel terrible for worrying her.</i>

156
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,250
Madoka.

157
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,837
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,607
I was wrong.

159
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,315
Me, too.

160
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,352
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:58,991
Welcome home.

162
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,572
Thank you for sharing your side.

163
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,110
What do you want to do now?

164
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,948
I'll stop running,

165
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,086
and try to prove my innocence.

166
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:30,656
In that case,

167
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,566
you have the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i>'s
full support.

168
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,572
Thank you.

169
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,313
You're okay being photographed then?

170
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,482
Of course.

171
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,450
Please.

172
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,486
Could you look my way?

173
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,387
Okay.

174
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,397
I'm so glad how that worked out.

175
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,298
Yes.

176
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,711
-I'll wait for you in the car.
-Thanks.

177
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:29,782
Hello?

178
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,717
<i>Hinako, is now a good time?</i>

179
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,385
Sure. What's up?

180
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,389
<i>How about next Sunday</i>
<i>for my visit to Tokyo?</i>

181
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,593
Sure, I'll take some time off.

182
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,962
<i>Okay, great.</i>

183
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,032
Hey, Mom.

184
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,033
<i>What, dear?</i>

185
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:54,740
I’ve decided to keep working
as a tabloid reporter.

186
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:57,576
<i>I see.</i>

187
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,881
<i>If that's what you decided,</i>
<i>you have my support.</i>

188
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,383
<i>Just watch your health.</i>

189
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,621
<i>Also, don't do anything</i>
<i>that will make people dislike you.</i>

190
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,424
That might be hard to do,

191
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,495
but I promise not to lie to myself.

192
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,330
So don't worry.

193
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,399
<i>Okay.</i>

194
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,801
<i>What are you doing now?</i>

195
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:26,505
I just finished delivering a missing girl
back to her mother.

196
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,476
<i>You can't surprise me anymore.</i>

197
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,813
<i>Not after the stakeouts</i>
<i>and undercover work.</i>

198
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,650
<i>But let me just say one thing.</i>

199
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,051
<i>What?</i>

200
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:44,156
Does the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i> not have
a Columbo?

201
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:45,991
<i>Here we go again.</i>

202
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,127
If you keep doing that kind of work,

203
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,864
you're gonna end up in a gun fight
or having to defuse a bomb.

204
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,201
If that happens,

205
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,870
I'll go in and help you resign.

206
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,038
Got it?

207
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,041
<i>Starting that night,</i>

208
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,743
<i>work really ramped up.</i>

209
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,978
Sorry about this, Yamabuki.

210
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,881
The more information we have, the better.

211
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,451
How's the article coming, Murai?

212
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,253
-We got the food.
-Thanks!

213
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,321
Keep it up, everyone.

214
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,023
Which picture do we go with?

215
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,027
I'd like this first picture somewhere.

216
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,996
Doesn't this one look better?

217
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:29,034
Yes, but this is the moment right after
he prepares himself for what's to come.

218
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,403
I see.

219
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,774
Okay! We'll put the headline
over this picture.

220
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,344
What's the headline? Let's see…

221
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,379
How about this?

222
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,252
"Framed Fugitive: Firsthand Account
of the Nightmarish Truth."

223
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,456
Mr. Murai, that's perfect. We'll use that.

224
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:51,724
Copy that.

225
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,460
Let's eat, everyone.

226
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,496
Okay, we'll eat and give it one more push.

227
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,033
<i>And so, the latest issue hit the stands.</i>

228
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,934
SENGOKU WEEKLY

229
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,007
FRAMED FUGITIVE: FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT
OF THE NIGHTMARISH TRUTH

230
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,417
Hello.

231
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,886
-Good morning.
-Man.

232
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,122
What a reaction.

233
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,224
The phones won't stop ringing.

234
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,792
It's making the rounds online.

235
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,227
Okay, great!

236
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,931
Stay vigilant. Let's get to work
on the follow-up.

237
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:32,932
Yes, sir.

238
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,602
Mr. Kitahama, breaking news!

239
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:48,580
<i>That day, Seiya Aoshiro and</i>
<i>Atsuhiro Imamura were arrested.</i>

240
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,720
You met both of them in person,
didn't you?

241
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,257
I'm glad nothing happened to you!

242
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,359
Both arrested for murder.

243
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,128
I'm so curious about what happened!

244
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,333
We'll be covering the motives
in our next issue.

245
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,400
That's amazing.

246
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,902
I have to know.

247
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,303
Tell me!

248
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,107
Well, basically what happened is,

249
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,677
Aoshiro and Imamura
both had people to kill.

250
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:22,481
But they knew they'd be the first ones
to be suspected.

251
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,585
So they made a deal to kill
each other's targets and secure alibis.

252
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,488
In other words, a murder swap!

253
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,159
Yes, the serial mysterious deaths case
all began

254
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:43,002
when Aoshiro's relationship broke down
with the second victim, Yuko Kizaki.

255
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:48,774
Aoshiro expanded his business after
receiving funds from the rich Ms. Kizaki.

256
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,977
They were also in a sexual relationship.

257
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,981
To Aoshiro, Ms. Kizaki was just
a convenient means.

258
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,052
He ended things when he no longer
needed funding,

259
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,688
but she couldn't accept it.

260
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:08,327
She became a nuisance when
she started pressuring him for marriage.

261
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:14,533
Around that time, he met Imamura
at an industry party.

262
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,438
Imamura's aunt, Ms. Komiyama,
stopped giving him work,

263
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,607
and his company was in danger.

264
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,610
He resented her for it.

265
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,346
Learning of this,

266
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,149
Aoshiro proposed a murder swap

267
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,917
and Imamura agreed.

268
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,986
That was the first murder.

269
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,223
Next, Aoshiro went overseas
to create an alibi,

270
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,360
and Imamura went to kill Ms. Kizaki.

271
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,729
That was the second murder.

272
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,199
The third victim, Makiko Tanioka,

273
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:52,337
knew Imamura and Ms. Komiyama and
found Ms. Komiyama's death suspicious.

274
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:57,876
That's when she happened to take
a picture of Imamura and Aoshiro meeting.

275
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,978
She used that to blackmail Aoshiro.

276
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,816
Then, Aoshiro instructed Imamura
to kill Ms. Tanioka

277
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,784
and make it look like an accident.

278
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,220
That was the third murder.

279
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,458
Those are the bullet points
for the serial mysterious deaths story.

280
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,030
Ms. Shinoda.

281
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,132
You really worked hard!

282
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,266
Good job!

283
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,235
No need to applaud me for it!

284
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,403
It's not a big deal.

285
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,371
I'm still a rookie.

286
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,706
A baby reporter.

287
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,342
Maybe not even a baby.

288
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,211
That'd make you an egg!

289
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,848
I'm trying to incubate something too.

290
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,583
So actually,

291
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,486
I'm being transferred this spring.

292
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,723
To the editorial department
of a sports magazine.

293
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,125
-What?
-For real?

294
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,827
I'm so worried!

295
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,629
My heart's about to burst.

296
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,798
Help me!

297
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,502
-What do I do?
-Asuka, don't worry!

298
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,636
You poor thing!

299
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,113
<i>People are still buying</i>
<i>the </i>Sengoku Weekly<i>.</i>

300
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,916
SENGOKU WEEKLY

00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,760
<i>Are my eyes still clear?</i>

302
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,967
This is Shinoda from the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i>.

303
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,803
Thank you!

304
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,372
I'll head right over!

305
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,007
Got it. Goodbye.

306
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,411
Okay!

307
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,357
