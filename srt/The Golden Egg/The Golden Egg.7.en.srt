1
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:06,873
It's not a coincidence!

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,743
How did I not notice until now?

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:10,844
MYSTERIOUS DEATHS

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,945
KOTA KUBOZUKA

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,886
Mr. Aoshiro is connected
to the serial mysterious deaths.

6
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,258
SPECIAL RECEPTION ROOM

7
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,161
Okay, here we go.

8
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,233
Thank you.

9
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,134
Thank you.

10
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,002
My clothes were okay.

11
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,504
Sorry for the commotion.

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,906
I took a few pics up front.

13
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:40,840
Okay.

14
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,243
Please don't be so nervous.

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,521
Once again, thank you for coming in today.

16
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,289
It's my pleasure.

17
00:00:56,856 --> 00:01:01,528
First, I wanted to get your thoughts on
common labor issues from the perspective

18
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,229
of a young businessman.

19
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,665
Let's see.

20
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:12,172
Regarding labor issues,
we have to address older and younger…

21
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,009
RECORDING

22
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,277
QUESTION SHEET

23
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,980
It's no use, none of this
is entering my brain.

24
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,849
What do I do?

25
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,786
He's not the culprit
of any incidents, is he?

26
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:45,972
I thought I was talking to an empty shell
when the interview started.

27
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,307
I'm terribly sorry.

28
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,543
But then you got over it
and finally relaxed.

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,946
You really grabbed my interest.

30
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,280
Thank you.

31
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,851
-Okay, I can see myself out from here.
-Sure.

32
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,086
Let me know when it will be published.

33
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:00,987
I will.

34
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,288
Have a good day.

35
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,824
Thank you.

36
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:13,233
It would be even more amazing if you
could exchange personal numbers with him.

37
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,276
What do I do?

38
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:28,882
If he really is involved in these deaths,
giving him my contact is dangerous.

39
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:35,922
But if he is involved, I know it's best
if I can create a personal connection.

40
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,692
What do I do?

41
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,118
Wait, excuse me!

42
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,490
If you would like to meet up again
sometime, this is my private information.

43
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:16,462
I could tell you about what goes on behind
the scenes at a tabloid.

44
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,465
I would be interested in that.

45
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,100
You'd tell me?

46
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,869
Yes, off the record.

47
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:24,938
Sounds interesting.

48
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,875
Later then.

49
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,476
Thank you for your time.

50
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,896
You can head down.

51
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,099
Could you confirm one thing for me?

52
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,100
What's that?

53
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,704
I'm sure you know about Kota Kubozuka,

54
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,240
the fugitive for the serial
mysterious deaths.

55
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:04,644
Is it just a coincidence that Kubozuka
and Aoshiro are from Niigata?

56
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,752
Did Murai tell you something?

57
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:18,057
Even if you happen to notice or
realize something in the middle of it,

58
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,293
try to keep your poker face.

59
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,397
But they're not the same age,
so they're not connected, right?

60
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,403
They both went to the same elementary
and middle schools.

61
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,405
Do they know each other?

62
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,442
Kubozuka frequently got in trouble
since he was young,

63
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,545
and was sentenced with probation
while in high school.

64
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,081
You knew that, right?

65
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:42,982
Yes.

66
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:47,854
He came to Tokyo after that, and met up
with Aoshiro a number of times.

67
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,691
I can't believe they're connected.

68
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:57,530
One is a suspect in suspicious deaths,
the other a young fashion tycoon.

69
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,866
Do you know something else?

70
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,906
You weren't put on this job last minute

71
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,509
because they were worried about me, right?

72
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,589
It was my chance to see
Seiya Aoshiro up close.

73
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,325
Up until today

74
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,161
I only got him from afar.

75
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,862
What?

76
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,633
How long were you watching him?

77
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,369
You should hear the rest from Murai.

78
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,975
Does Mr. Aoshiro know where Kubozuka is?

79
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,677
I have no idea.

80
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,519
SEIYA AOSHIRO:
THIS IS AOSHIRO

81
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,156
It's from Mr. Aoshiro.

82
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,691
What should I do?

83
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,362
What?

84
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,403
Things are getting interesting!

85
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,244
Let's not waste any food.

86
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,601
Mr. Murai.

87
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,970
Welcome back.

88
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,838
I wanted to ask you something.

89
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,875
Is it true that Aoshiro and Kubozuka

90
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,713
are old acquaintances
from the same hometown?

91
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,117
Suzaki must have told you.

92
00:06:58,985 --> 00:06:59,819
Yes.

93
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,498
NATURAL GREEN TEA

94
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,905
Are you scared?

95
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,908
To be honest,

96
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:23,776
yes.

97
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,513
Will I have to interview him again?

98
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,883
That's up to you.

99
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,786
Someone else can do it if you're scared.

100
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,389
Nobody's forcing you.

101
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,161
I got a reply from Mr. Aoshiro.

102
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,199
-I managed to get his personal contact.
-Oh?

103
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,335
This is wonderful.

104
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,103
This is plenty already!

105
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,977
All you'd need to do is contact him,
and we'll do the rest.

106
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,781
You really did a great job.

107
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:03,950
Thank you.

108
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,460
But…

109
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:22,502
He gave me his personal number
because he trusted me, right?

110
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:32,044
If someone else showed up,
it would be like I betrayed him.

111
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,616
If he's really connected to Kubozuka,

112
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:41,020
I feel like I'd meet the real him
when I ask him that.

113
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,427
I want to hear it from him directly,
without any pretense or reservations.

114
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:49,795
So…

115
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,702
Would you allow me to do this?

116
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,574
Please!

117
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:10,883
Okay.

118
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,954
We might ask you to in due time.

119
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:21,827
I'm reassured knowing you're willing
to tackle this yourself.

120
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,797
Thank you.

121
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,734
Mr. Murai.

122
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,370
You had a call from that stylist, Iijima.

123
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,739
I told her you'll call her back.

124
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,241
Did she say anything?

125
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,810
She said to bring a young woman.

126
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,279
What's that about?

127
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,681
No idea.

128
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,116
-But it can't be you, apparently.
-Huh?

129
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,017
Why not?

130
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,821
Well, thanks.

131
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,497
Something's set in motion.

132
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,538
I feel like I'm getting dragged
into something again.

133
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,778
Or maybe I'm already involved in it.

134
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:19,518
Actually, it almost feels like
I dragged myself into it.

135
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,423
Excuse me, you called for me?

136
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,995
I should give you a proper explanation.

137
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,597
-Can you take notes?
-Yes.

138
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,706
The first incident.

139
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,409
The deceased is Harue Komiyama, age 39,

140
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,077
a beauty consultant.

141
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,515
Her cause of death was strangulation
from the straps of her bag.

142
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:53,085
They're exploring both routes of it
being an accident or murder.

143
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,087
The day before her death,

144
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,391
a witness had seen her with Kubozuka.

145
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:03,329
The second victim is Yuko Kizaki,
age 32, office worker.

146
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,166
Her cause of death was strangulation
by a thin rope.

147
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,068
It's declared a murder.

148
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,938
There was a crack in the case,
and the fingerprints at the scene

149
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,507
are identified as Kubozuka's.

150
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,441
What?

151
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,810
The building cameras also caught a figure.

152
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,579
And chances are high it's Kubozuka.

153
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,081
This case, too?

154
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:27,586
The third victim is Makiko Tanioka,
age 28, a jewelry shop worker.

155
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,489
Her cause of death was traumatic shock

156
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:34,427
from injuries she sustained
in a car accident.

157
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:38,531
But as they found sedatives
in her bloodwork,

158
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,834
it's being explored as a possible murder
as well.

159
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,470
When they checked her phone logs,

160
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,139
they found an exchange with Kubozuka.

161
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,744
They were supposed to meet that day.

162
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,280
Footprints from near the accident

163
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:58,050
matched with the footprints
from the second case.

164
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,689
In other words, the only thing
tying the victims together

165
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,626
is their contact with Kubozuka.

166
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,964
That's everything we know about
the serial accidental deaths.

167
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,771
Um, I've been thinking about something.

168
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,573
About Aoshiro?

169
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,508
Yes.

170
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:27,012
Kubozuka and Mr. Aoshiro were
in contact in Tokyo, right?

171
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,081
Is he connected to the crimes?

172
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,851
This hasn't been made public,

173
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:36,756
but we have information that Aoshiro
knew the second victim.

174
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,926
Yuko Kizaki.

175
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,698
From what we heard,
Aoshiro was quite shocked.

176
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,935
He refuses to believe Kubozuka
is involved.

177
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,839
Apparently, Aoshiro told Kubozuka
he wants him to turn himself in

178
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,374
and prove his innocence.

179
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,344
So Mr. Aoshiro isn't involved
with the case.

180
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,848
Yuko Kizaki's body was discovered
the day after her death.

181
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,285
Aoshiro was actually in Singapore
for business

182
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,455
over the entire week at the time
of her death.

183
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,357
So he has an alibi.

184
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,125
It appears he does.

185
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,795
I'm a little relieved.

186
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,202
Do you know her?

187
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,738
EMIKO IIJIMA

188
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,606
No, I don't.

189
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,709
She's a stylist I know called Iijima.

190
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,346
The reason we know all these details

191
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:38,684
is because Iijima picks up
all sorts of rumors.

192
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:44,924
What got you looking into these cases
in the first place?

193
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,461
When the first case was reported
on the news,

194
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,397
I got a call from Iijima.

195
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,466
Komiyama's my best friend!

196
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,669
She wouldn't kill herself there!

197
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:57,736
But still,

198
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:03,909
Sengoku Weekly needs some sort of proof
it could've been murder to take action.

199
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,580
Komiyama was attending modeling seminars.

200
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,915
Someone there might know something.

201
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,419
What's this picture?

202
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,287
A group photo of the attendees.

203
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,922
They're all aspiring models.

204
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,691
Komiyama's on the far right.

205
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:25,164
Actually, right before she died, she told
me she was going on a date with a guy.

206
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,600
But she didn't tell me who.

207
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:32,805
Iijima helped facilitate interviews
with those girls,

208
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,208
questioning each of them on our behalf.

209
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:42,147
Save for one of them, Madoka Hashimoto,
who she could never reach.

210
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,351
So you sent me to find her workplace.

211
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,721
You did great,
but we still don't know where she is.

212
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:54,193
You didn't know Kubozuka was involved in
Ms. Komiyama's death at the time, right?

213
00:14:55,961 --> 00:15:01,700
The unnatural death and the missing
school girl felt fishy, so I ran it down.

214
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:08,240
I had no idea it would be connected
to other murders.

215
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:14,313
After a second and third case
and the announcement of a wanted fugitive,

216
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,082
my job switched to tracking down Kubozuka.

217
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,086
And she was the catalyst.

218
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,255
Right, and this Ms. Iijima

219
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:27,826
found a friend of the third victim,
Makiko Tanioka.

220
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,697
-What?
-I want to get more details,

221
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,033
but she's demanding a young woman.

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,769
She'll explain why after we meet.

223
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:39,838
So you brought me in?

224
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:40,940
Okay.

225
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,174
Let's go.

226
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,810
Huh? Right now?

227
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:45,878
-Yup.
-What?

228
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,616
You said you wouldn't talk unless
I brought a young woman.

229
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,818
So I did what you asked.

230
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,920
Don't say it like that.

231
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:55,988
STYLIST
EMIKO IIJIMA

232
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,223
So what about Tanioka's friend?

233
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,458
She coming here?

234
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,163
Tanioka's best friend.

235
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,431
NIKO-CHAN

236
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,432
Niko-chan?

237
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,834
My best friend told me about her,

238
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,170
but neither she or I have met her.

239
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,239
No picture, no real name,
won't answer the phone,

240
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,808
meaning she's extra careful.

241
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,077
Have you exchanged messages?

242
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,044
Yes.

243
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:23,349
Ms. Tanioka asked Niko-chan
to hold onto something for her

244
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,217
shortly before her death.

245
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,686
But she won't tell me what.

246
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,991
If she knows something about the case,

247
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,127
I told her she should tell the cops.

248
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,396
But she said she hates cops,
so she refused.

249
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,933
So the police don't know either.

250
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,038
And when I asked to meet her in person,
she asked for my address.

251
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,042
That's when I got a party invite.

252
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,245
Party invite?

253
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,547
A mixer held by a marriage agency.

254
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,386
Niko-chan's going to be there
this coming Sunday.

255
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,521
She told me to meet her there.

256
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,423
Whose invite is this?

257
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:10,329
Ms. Tanioka said she didn't need to go
to the mixer because she found a good man

258
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,830
and gave it to Niko-chan.

259
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,766
Which she sent to me.

260
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,067
So that means…

261
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,171
We have to attend this mixer
to meet Niko-chan.

262
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,043
Only a woman in her 20s can enter
the party with this ticket.

263
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,478
Which is why I asked for a young woman.

264
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,280
I see.

265
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,017
I've never been to a marriage mixer.

266
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,619
Could be a good experience then.

267
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,222
We need to confirm things first.

268
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,724
Right.

269
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,827
What should I wear--

270
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,828
No, not that.

271
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,800
Even if we got in with this ticket,

272
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,501
how do we meet Niko-chan?

273
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,404
That's what we need to confirm.

274
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,839
Oh, like that?

275
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,740
Nice.

276
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,309
By the way, you should avoid black.

277
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,045
I appreciate the advice.

278
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,781
You own a different bag, right?

279
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,983
Let me see you without your glasses.

280
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,118
Okay.

281
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,686
Leave them on.

282
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,756
-What?
-It's better with them on.

283
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,670
I've never dressed like this before.

284
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,505
Is this okay?

285
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,875
What if I end up with a boyfriend?

286
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,443
Wait, no.

287
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,846
I'm undercover today.

288
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,348
I have to blend in without standing out.

289
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,517
Your posture is important.

290
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,386
First, straighten up your back.

291
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,789
Take small, dainty steps.

292
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,759
And smile naturally.

293
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:50,963
Then you're set!

294
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,631
Nothing to worry about!

295
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,179
You're Makiko Tanioka?

296
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,648
Yes.

297
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,885
Thank you for coming today.

298
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,864
Ms. Tanioka? Ms. Makiko Tanioka?

299
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,468
You left your bag.

300
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,702
I'm so sorry!

301
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,855
TO BE CONTINUED

302
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,224
An undercover investigation?!

303
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,459
What are you doing? Stop it!

304
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,929
What was their relationship
to the late Ms. Tanioka?

305
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,965
You suck! You think tabloids
can do whatever they want?

306
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:04,870
My job is to see the truth about the world
with my own eyes and tell the readers!

307
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:05,837
