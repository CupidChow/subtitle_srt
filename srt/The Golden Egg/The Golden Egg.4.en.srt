1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,241
How did this happen?

2
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:09,976
I'm scared.

3
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:11,878
This is way too scary.

4
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:20,520
This is Shoichi Kojima, age 54,
who was arrested last month.

5
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,123
The police treated it as
a simple embezzlement,

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,826
but the money is still missing
and Kojima's not saying a word.

7
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:30,563
His wife and daughter insist
he would never do it.

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,999
However, we discovered

9
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,468
what we believe
is his social media account.

10
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,770
41 POSTS, 66 FOLLOWERS

11
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,405
The first post is a year and a half ago

12
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:41,941
when he met a woman in her 30's,
and had a flower-viewing date in Kyoto.

13
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:45,278
They started dating, and lived
a life of luxury in a fancy apartment.

14
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,280
With the embezzled money.

15
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:53,787
The Sengoku Weekly thinks
he was tricked by this Saori Shinomiya

16
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:58,825
into spending the entire embezzled amount
on their relationship.

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,627
Saori Shinomiya.

18
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:05,131
She spent her childhood starved
of parental affection,

19
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,501
and feels indebted to her grandmother
who took her in.

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,905
She always brings flowers
to her grave every year.

21
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,812
So we found a post on the date
of the death anniversary from last year.

22
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,514
We used the photo to trace the location.

23
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,820
Akutsu's been staking it out
for a few days.

24
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,223
Today's the death anniversary,
so stay sharp until tomorrow.

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,324
Good luck.

26
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:38,798
You haven't slept?

27
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,101
Nope.

28
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,004
You look kind of tired, too.

29
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,674
I was on a stakeout
since yesterday morning.

30
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,376
What's with all the stakeouts?

31
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,612
So, is this okay?

32
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,347
What do you mean?

33
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,316
I mean, staking out a cemetery.

34
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,886
Well, it gets a bit chilly at night.

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,388
That's not what I meant.

36
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,957
Have you been cursed?

37
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,759
I mean, I guess I can't tell yet.

38
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,363
If something horrible happens to me
later on,

39
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,966
I guess I'll attribute it to this.

40
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,135
You seem fine.

41
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,072
What's that?

42
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,007
A protection charm.

43
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:23,776
This way.

44
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,012
Is it just the one path?

45
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,181
I think so.

46
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,316
You haven't missed anything?

47
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,552
Hold on, wait here.

48
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,686
I'll go check.

49
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:37,991
We're good.

50
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,860
It would've snapped if someone
came through.

51
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,629
So nobody's been here.

52
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,532
Just who are you?

53
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,535
I learned this from Yamabuki.

54
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,403
Yamabuki, I see.

55
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,306
Okay, let's go.

56
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,542
What, really?

57
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:56,809
Of course!

58
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,212
Was there a grave for a Shinomiya?

59
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,480
No, there wasn't.

60
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,449
Probably a fake name.

61
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,986
Although, when I saw a woman walk by,

62
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,557
I asked about Shoichi Kojima,
and she bolted.

63
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,758
You think it was her?

64
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,060
Yes.

65
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:15,962
So,

66
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,665
when I followed after her,
she tripped up ahead

67
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,034
and spilled the contents of her bag.

68
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,737
So, that's when I picked up this key.

69
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,208
-A cherry blossom?
-Yes.

70
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:33,246
Kojima's account mentions that the key
is on a cherry blossom key chain

71
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,583
to commemorate their trip to Kyoto.

72
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,086
Proof to tie Kojima to Shinomiya?

73
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,487
Yes.

74
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,924
Which is why I think Saori Shinomiya

75
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,794
will return here to get that back.

76
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,099
I'll pop over to the office.

77
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:54,968
Already?

78
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,336
I'll be back at 11:00 p.m.

79
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,137
You could nap here.

80
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,240
I want to take a shower, too.

81
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,645
The cemetery gate is closed from 6:00 p.m.
to 8:00 a.m.

82
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,782
So if Shinomiya is showing up,
it'll more likely be tomorrow morning.

83
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,451
Okay.

84
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,853
But if she does show up,

85
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,024
you have to use that key to ask her
her connection to Kojima.

86
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:23,096
I'll share this message
I received from Kitahama.

87
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,866
"Show no mercy,
make her admit everything."

88
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,368
That's the word.

89
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,335
Okay.

90
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,503
Good luck then.

91
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,193
Ghosts don't exist.

92
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,764
Ghosts are a lie.

93
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,300
They're just―

94
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,340
MOM

95
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,943
Hello, what's up?

96
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,579
Hinako, you doing good?

97
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,648
Yeah, I'm fine.

98
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,217
Sorry I haven't been able to answer.

99
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,887
It's fine if you've been busy.

100
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,388
You at the office?

101
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,357
No, I'm on a stakeout.

102
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,458
Stakeout?

103
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,795
Why would a PR magazine
need to do a stakeout?

104
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,697
So actually,

105
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,833
I got transferred to the Sengoku Weekly.

106
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,035
That Sengoku Weekly?

107
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,403
Yeah.

108
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,239
So it's part of that job.

109
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,274
A stakeout?

110
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,578
Why do you have to do something
like a detective for?

111
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,781
I felt relieved when you joined
a proper company,

112
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,583
but a stakeout?

113
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,853
I mean, our company publishes
the Sengoku Weekly.

114
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,192
They should send someone
with more experience, like you see on TV.

115
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,594
Someone with a streak of silver.

116
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,597
I'm not really getting the metaphor.

117
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,233
Don't you see? You're a young woman.

118
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,903
You should turn down stakeouts
before something happens!

119
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,973
If you want to quit,
I'll come resign for you.

120
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,776
Wait, that would be weird.

121
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,178
Like a resignation agent's agent.

122
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,749
But I'd be too scared,
I'll get your dad to do it.

123
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:27,186
But that would be a resignation agent's
agent's agent!

124
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,891
Hello?

125
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,559
I'm listening.

126
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,696
Not sure what you're saying though.

127
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,099
Anyway, don't do anything reckless.

128
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,968
Yeah, got it.

129
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:43,936
I'll call you again.

130
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,538
Bye.

131
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,573
Bye.

132
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,458
That was close.

133
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,697
It's me, Tsubaki.

134
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,667
When did you get here, Daisuke?

135
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:15,868
You were asleep.

136
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,473
I waved from outside,
but you didn't react, so I got in.

137
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,042
Wake me up then.

138
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,380
But Yamabuki said you probably
haven't been sleeping lately.

139
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,215
I let you sleep out of kindness.

140
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,954
Nobody came while you were asleep.

141
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,957
I was about to mess up again.

142
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:42,995
I brought you food.

143
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,164
Kitahama told me to.

144
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,867
Thank you.

145
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,074
You remember Madoka Hashimoto?

146
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,610
What? The missing high school girl?

147
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,411
Yeah.

148
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,682
Of course I do, I went to find
her old workplace after all.

149
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,752
We got a tip that someone
spotted her in Fukuoka.

150
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,688
Huh? Was she found?

151
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,256
No, it was fake.

152
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,292
I went to Fukuoka with Yamabuki,

153
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,529
and asked around the bars,

154
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:21,167
but I guess I had an attitude,

155
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,935
and pissed off some goons.

156
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:27,773
I gave them my card
and said I was a reporter,

157
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,745
but the second they saw Sengoku Weekly,
they dragged me outside by the collar.

158
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,147
What happened?

159
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,383
Yamabuki came in the nick of time.

160
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,951
I'm so sorry!

161
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,555
I apologize for my colleague's rudeness.

162
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,457
He did?

163
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:45,958
Yeah.

164
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,160
Then he kept going at me.

165
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,163
Don't screw me over.

166
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,467
I told you to watch your mouth.

167
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,169
You're useless.

168
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,573
Just quit then!

169
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,541
Yeah?

170
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,850
Please let him off the hook with that.

171
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:13,586
Let's go.

172
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,391
Did he do it on purpose?

173
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,294
Yamabuki went on to explain it.

174
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,530
I was so scared.

175
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,631
You okay?

176
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,667
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,936
I couldn't do anything against them.

178
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,471
Don't worry about it.

179
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,408
Because you seemed so helpless,

180
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,777
someone got worried and came to tell me.

181
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,948
If you acted brave instead,
it would've been worse.

182
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:45,918
Here.

183
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:53,693
Yamabuki knows how to bluff
because he's worked tabloids for years.

184
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,530
If a rookie tries to act tough,
you get exposed.

185
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,566
It's something to watch out for.

186
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,304
Anyway, I thought you should know.

187
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:07,740
Thank you.

188
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,376
-Well, I'm off.
-What?

189
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,816
Don't sleep.

190
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:17,984
I won't sleep.

191
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,550
Did Shinomiya show up?

192
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,352
No.

193
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,487
I see.

194
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,324
Daisuke got these for us.

195
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,693
You can have the rest.

196
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,561
I'll get sleepy if I eat.

197
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:03,663
Really?

198
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,865
I get sleepy if I don't eat.

199
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,233
Oh, nice! Rice balls!

200
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,669
It's 2:00 a.m.

201
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,705
Yeah.

202
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:15,708
Only 4:00 a.m.

203
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:17,576
Huh?

204
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,179
What is it?

205
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,349
Huh? Gone already?

206
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,383
What is?

207
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,985
-The food.
-Excuse me?

208
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,388
-I'll go run to the store.
-What?

209
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,790
Keep watch, okay?

210
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,626
Thanks!

211
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,761
Thank you!

212
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:46,839
Akutsu?

213
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,042
It's not him!

214
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,712
Why now?

215
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,624
There's no mistake.

216
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,493
It's Shinomiya herself.

217
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,865
I can't mess up this time.

218
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,412
This lady is an evil woman

219
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:30,449
who tricked a man to spend
embezzled company money.

220
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,486
In exchange for this key,

221
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,522
I'll get her to admit her connection
to Kojima.

222
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,530
What, are you kidding me?

223
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,932
She's climbing over it? Seriously?

224
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,335
Hold on. I didn't agree to this.

225
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,836
Do I have to climb over it, too?

226
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:51,971
Will I get arrested?

227
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,845
She did it.

228
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,081
Wait, what do I do?

229
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:05,551
But…

230
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,288
I have to go!

231
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,259
How did this happen?

232
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,627
I'm scared.

233
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,295
This is way too scary.

234
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,464
When I scaled the gate,

235
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,433
I think my shirt got caught and ripped.

236
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,435
But I can't worry about that.

237
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,212
She's looking for the key.

238
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,116
If I go up to her now,

239
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,985
she'll think I'm a ghost for sure.

240
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,354
I can't startle her.

241
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,958
I can't get answers if she's too agitated.

242
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,628
I should take it slow.

243
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:53,432
I'll approach her
after she leaves the cemetery.

244
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,136
FOUND SHINOMIYA
WAIT FOR ME IN FRONT OF THE GATE

245
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,477
She's not giving up.

246
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,913
How long will she be looking?

247
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,283
COPY THAT, I'LL BE BACK RIGHT AWAY

248
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:32,738
So cold.

249
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,874
I'm so cold.

250
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,177
It's so chilly where my shirt ripped.

251
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,880
It feels like a pretty big rip.

252
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,960
Ms. Shinomiya?

253
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,174
I'm sorry to jump on you like this.

254
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,310
Who are you?

255
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:16,015
I'm Shinoda, a writer
for the Sengoku Weekly.

256
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,149
A tabloid?

257
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,151
Not the police?

258
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,121
What are you doing here this late?

259
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:23,555
What about you?

260
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,126
Are you looking for your apartment key?

261
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,963
The one with the cherry blossom
keychain Shoichi Kojima gave you?

262
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,097
Give that back!

263
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,367
Answer my questions first.

264
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,469
What do you even want to know?

265
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:43,542
You tricked Mr. Kojima, making him
embezzle company money to spend on you.

266
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,379
I didn't do any of that.

267
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,785
I was just…

268
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,390
I was just modeling.

269
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,627
Modeling?

270
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,504
-Modeling?
-Yes.

271
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,740
-Give me some more details.
-Yes, sir.

272
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,811
Saori Shinomiya's maternal grandfather
is in a nursing home,

273
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,380
and she was having trouble paying for it.

274
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:26,251
Then a cousin put her in touch
with Kojima who was looking for a model.

275
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,887
After hearing about her situation,

276
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:32,091
he gave her a lump sum as a modeling fee.

277
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,559
And the embezzlement?

278
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,595
Shinomiya only learned about it
from the news,

279
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,765
but she already used the money
to pay the nursing home.

280
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,267
She thought she had to go on the run.

281
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,105
It wasn't what we imagined at all.

282
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,676
That's true…

283
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,149
LOVE PAID FOR BY BANKRUPTCY

284
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,051
A MAN'S DREAM

285
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,586
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

286
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,988
Is it still a scoop?

287
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,325
-Did you record it?
-Yes I did, this time.

288
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:14,500
Okay.

289
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,368
I got it from here.

290
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,037
Good work.

291
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,484
SENGOKU WEEKLY

292
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,055
So that became this.

293
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,925
Kojima's motive wasn't anything special.

294
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:44,129
He embezzled company money,
and as it grew,

295
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,900
he used it to become a different
version of himself.

296
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,537
To lead a completely different life,

297
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,907
he attempted to create
a perfect social media account.

298
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,745
To him, that meant uploading photo
sessions with Saori Shinomiya,

299
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,781
and stage a fabricated lifestyle.

300
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:09,521
Apparently he had 30 million yen
hidden in the kitchen.

301
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,324
Looking at all that money,

302
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,562
he hung his whole life
on being able to do anything.

303
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,064
He's 54 years old.

304
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,033
His life's purpose…

305
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,940
It wasn't what I was expecting.

306
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,575
You mean Shinomiya?

307
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,910
It was a fake name.

308
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:35,380
I just made up my mind
that she was some glitzy girl.

309
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,118
But she was actually super normal.

310
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,053
Normal?

311
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,455
I mean…

312
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,192
Not someone who should be wrapped up

313
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:51,163
in a financial scandal
or hounded by tabloids.

314
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,533
Doesn't that go for everyone?

315
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,871
So then I thought the opposite.

316
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,074
It could literally happen to anybody.

317
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:07,146
Just one slight misstep,
and that could've been me.

318
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,254
FUGITIVE: KOTA KUBOZUKA

319
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,457
Like it feels far and close
at the same time.

320
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:23,128
That something similar
could be happening around me.

321
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,797
With one misaligned gear,

322
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,133
it could be me on that side.

323
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:34,506
There's a chance of getting caught up
in something and pursued by tabloids.

324
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,110
I just kind of had that thought.

325
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,218
TO BE CONTINUED

326
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,254
Apparently he suddenly
pulled out of a play.

327
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,889
Aren't you embarrassed?

328
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,457
Buzzing around human misery.

329
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,761
What's waiting for me at the end
of this path I've been put on?

330
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,531
He made it into a national brand.
A young man's success story.
