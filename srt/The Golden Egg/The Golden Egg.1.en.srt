1
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,880
<i>The Sengoku Weekly.</i>

2
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,816
<i>One of Japan's top weekly tabloids.</i>

3
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:23,957
<i>But I'm not interested</i>
<i>in buying it at all.</i>

4
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:27,060
<i>Honestly, it's more vulgar</i>
<i>than talk shows,</i>

5
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:30,030
<i>and I feel like they add fake stories</i>
<i>to boost sales.</i>

6
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,099
<i>Do tabloids have no morals?</i>

7
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,201
<i>Does Sengokusha have no class?</i>

8
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:39,272
<i>I've never had a favorable opinion</i>
<i>of this rag.</i>

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,878
<i>If I worked at one of Sengokusha's</i>
<i>rival companies instead,</i>

10
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:49,049
<i>could I have worked with</i>
<i>Titi's Matomi Ishikawa?</i>

11
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,485
<i>A comforting smile, clear eyes,</i>

12
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,688
<i>I'm sure she has a pure soul.</i>

13
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,462
<i>Are my eyes</i>

14
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,964
<i>not tainted yet?</i>

15
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:09,936
<i>Hinako Shinoda.</i>

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,538
<i>Age 24.</i>

17
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:15,241
<i>I miraculously joined the major publisher</i>
<i>Sengokusha Inc. last year,</i>

18
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:19,679
<i>and was put on the editorial staff</i>
<i>in charge of a free monthly zine,</i>

19
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,582
<i>starting my lifelong dream in publishing.</i>

20
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,485
<i>And yet.</i>

21
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:30,423
<i>Life takes unexpected turns.</i>

22
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,925
SOLD OUT

23
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,695
<i>Currently,</i>

24
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,766
<i>I find myself on the Incident team</i>
<i>of Sengoku Weekly.</i>

25
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,668
<i>Something I wanted no part of.</i>

26
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,439
<i>I never thought</i>

27
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:51,544
<i>I would be spending my days</i>
<i>searching for gossip stories.</i>

28
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,347
<i>These last six months,</i>

29
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:58,585
<i>my required five or six ideas</i>
<i>have always been rejected.</i>

30
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,538
I'm terribly sorry!

31
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,839
<i>Like I said.</i>

32
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,342
<i>Let me talk to your supervisor.</i>

33
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,645
<i>We often get complaints</i>
<i>on the release date.</i>

34
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,082
<i>You're useless,</i>
<i>get me the editor-in-chief.</i>

35
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,118
The chief is out,
and I don't know when he'll return.

36
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,019
<i>Screw that.</i>

37
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,388
<i>Your article is going to end my business.</i>

38
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,990
<i>Put the writer on the line.</i>

39
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,159
I can't do that.

40
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,793
<i>Then give me his source.</i>

41
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,296
I can't do that either.

42
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:46,566
<i>I bet you just bought some random article</i>
<i>and published it.</i>

43
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,967
<i>Are you listening?</i>

44
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,336
I'm sorry, I dropped my script.

45
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,606
<i>What? You're dealing with me</i>
<i>using a script?</i>

46
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,308
No, of course not.

47
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,943
I'm terribly sorry!

48
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,680
<i>Why do you guys even exist?</i>

49
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,185
<i>Is it fun ruining other people's lives?</i>

50
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:09,889
<i>As long as you work there, you're just as</i>
<i>guilty as the writer who ruined my life.</i>

51
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,008
THE MEANING OF A TABLOID'S EXISTENCE

52
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,911
Was everything okay with that complaint?

53
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:32,879
Yeah.

54
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,582
Remember what I told you?

55
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,520
Um, to record the conversation, and…

56
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,189
Tell them you're calling the police.

57
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,793
Only report to Desk about
what you think isn't a prank.

58
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,495
Excuse me.

59
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,166
The content of this article
is true, right?

60
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,969
It's been verified.

61
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,205
We'd be crazy if we made everything up.

62
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,142
Although, that's what the world thinks.

63
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,378
<i>Tsukasa Yamabuki,</i>

64
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,547
<i>he's a journalist for Sengoku Weekly.</i>

65
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,383
<i>After I was assigned here,</i>

66
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,654
<i>I judged him for writing</i>
<i>such gossip articles,</i>

67
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,657
<i>but I learned he has</i>
<i>a surprisingly sensible side.</i>

68
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,098
Handling calls is hard.

69
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:28,401
I'm more scared of pitch meetings
than of handling complaints.

70
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,636
I get that.

71
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,738
Five or six ideas a week is impossible.

72
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,974
I always thought they outsourced more.

73
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,609
<i>Kengo Akutsu.</i>

74
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,044
<i>It's his first year here.</i>

75
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,947
<i>A baby-faced man</i>
<i>who reliably never loses his appetite</i>

76
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,649
<i>no matter what happens.</i>

77
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:43,650
Want some?

78
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:44,951
No thanks.

79
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:53,526
<i>The Incident Team also employs</i>
<i>contract employees.</i>

80
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,396
<i>The veteran writer, Mr. Murai.</i>

81
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,098
<i>The well-informed, Daisuke Tsubaki.</i>

82
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,434
<i>The in-house photographer, Mr. Suzaki.</i>

83
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,370
<i>And the one leading the six of us…</i>

84
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,006
- Good morning.
- Morning.

85
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,843
<i>…is Mr. Kitahama, our chief,</i>
<i>whom we call Desk.</i>

86
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,080
Okay, let's have Shinoda
start off with the pitches.

87
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,215
Yes, sir.

88
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,850
I have five in total.

89
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,789
The first one, there's a park
where expensive breeds of dogs gather.

90
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,190
- Next.
- I'm not finished.

91
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,391
Move on. Number two.

92
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:30,863
Number two, according to
a former yoga school student,

93
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,500
housewives are ruthlessly running
through young instructors.

94
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,902
Lacks punch. Next.

95
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,771
In Akasaka, there's a dentist
who's accused of sexual harassment.

96
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,908
We did that two years ago. Next.

97
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,411
There's a crying mannequin
at a long-standing clothing shop.

98
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,148
That's not because of some
leaky ceiling, right?

99
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,450
You knew already?

100
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,752
No, I just guessed. That's really it?

101
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,720
Yes.

102
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,423
But, you know, it really does look creepy.

103
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,959
Last one, give me something
that hits hard.

104
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,363
There's a rumor in Ota

105
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,166
that a man who feeds pigeons there

106
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,305
might actually be an extraterrestrial.

107
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,678
Akutsu, you're up.

108
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,779
Yes, sir.

109
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,181
I learned that the actor
playing a popular mascot

110
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,251
used to work as an actor
for a rival mascot.

111
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,819
Sorry, say that again.

112
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,695
This is the PR zine
my old department puts out.

113
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,232
I used to work on the preface
and other features,

114
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:43,169
but I haven't done anything
since coming to the Sengoku Weekly.

115
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,138
I get that.

116
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,372
It's tough.

117
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,274
You're way better off.

118
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,076
You got one pitch approved.

119
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,648
I want to find a story
that actually gets an article soon.

120
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,660
You've reached Sengoku Weekly.

121
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,463
<i>I have a scoop.</i>

122
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,566
What kind of scoop?

123
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,703
<i>Do you know the idol group Titi?</i>

124
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,106
Yes, the super popular group!

125
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,309
<i>It's about their member Matomi.</i>

126
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,912
Matomi Ishikawa, correct?

127
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:26,813
<i>Yes.</i>

128
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,115
<i>Good, I can get to the point then.</i>

129
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,983
What about Matomin?

130
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:32,985
<i>I have a picture.</i>

131
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,254
A picture?

132
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,790
What kind of picture?

133
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,659
<i>We used to date.</i>

134
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,661
<i>I have a compromising photo</i>
<i>from that time.</i>

135
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,099
<i>How much would Sengoku Weekly pay for it?</i>

136
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,837
<i>This has really escalated.</i>

137
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,440
<i>I need the script!</i>

138
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,811
<i>Wait, there's no script</i>
<i>for a guy exploiting a girl's past.</i>

139
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,712
<i>Hello?</i>

140
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:07,787
Would you be willing to send
one of the photos beforehand?

141
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:12,024
Would you like to text instead
to save the cost of the call?

142
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,861
I'll send you my card and ID photo.

143
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,664
Really? Sounds good.

144
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,335
Should I really take charge?

145
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,972
Kitahama gave you the green light.

146
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,609
But what if
it really is a scandalous photo?

147
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:34,113
The first thing you have to do
is determine if it's real or not.

148
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:38,184
In order to do that,
you have to approach the source

149
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,585
and get the photo.

150
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:45,291
Then you gather as much evidence
as you can to determine its validity.

151
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,662
Sorry won't cut it
if we print something that's fake.

152
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,366
What's wrong?

153
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,936
Just try to make your own moves for now.

154
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,838
You finally got an interesting lead.

155
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,407
I don't think it's interesting at all.

156
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,944
If the photo's real,

157
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,547
Matomi won't be able to
stay an idol anymore.

158
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:12,018
She'll lose trust, her sponsors,
and her roles on TV.

159
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,686
Are you okay with that?

160
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,295
Look,

161
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,232
try not to think too seriously about it.

162
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:34,874
Because deciding whether or not
to run the story is the chief's job.

163
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,047
But if you're not confident,

164
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,684
I can ask Desk to put someone else on it.

165
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,619
No, I'll do it!

166
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,357
Please let me do this.

167
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,163
Well then, good luck.

168
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:03,669
MATOMI ISHIKAWA

169
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,342
Okay!

170
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,415
I WOULD LIKE TO MEET YOU

171
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,717
<i>I've got a scoop.</i>

172
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,688
TOMORROW?

173
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:23,689
<i>I've got a scoop!</i>

174
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,492
<i>I've got a scoop!</i>

175
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,636
<i>The day has finally come for me to act.</i>

176
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,639
<i>I don't want to swing and miss.</i>

177
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,508
<i>I don't want this to be fake.</i>

178
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,877
<i>But</i>

179
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,848
<i>I also don't want to be the one</i>

180
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:53,019
<i>to ruin a 17 year old girl's life</i>
<i>by throwing her into the deep end.</i>

181
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,156
<i>Am I on the brink</i>

182
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:01,260
<i>of joining a heinous group of people</i>
<i>I once held such contempt for?</i>

183
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,261
CAFE CROWN

184
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,399
<i>No, I'll first listen to</i>
<i>what he has to say.</i>

185
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,846
Thank you for coming to meet me so soon.

186
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,385
Who is the one who called me?

187
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,357
So you dated Matomi?

188
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,828
We started going out in grade eight,
hanging out at our homes.

189
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,464
According to official sources,

190
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,601
Matomi first auditioned in the winter
of her eighth-grade year.

191
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,072
Which means you witnessed all that
first-hand.

192
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,441
She had my support.

193
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:51,777
What was she like while auditioning?

194
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,279
Did she tell you anything?

195
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,451
She said she wouldn't change.

196
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,788
You mean you two would continue
dating as boyfriend and girlfriend?

197
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,564
But that didn't happen, did it?

198
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,902
Did something happen?

199
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:21,807
One day she suddenly told me
to stop texting and calling her.

200
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,711
I got really bitter about it.

201
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,513
I wanted revenge.

202
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,852
That's why I've got the pictures.

203
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,794
Could you show me
the photos in question then?

204
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,019
The last picture is really bad.

205
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,056
It's a little blurry.

206
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,609
You can tell it's the same place, right?

207
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,911
Oh, right.

208
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,016
Are you okay?

209
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,185
Yes, sorry. Um…

210
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,322
Could I borrow this picture?

211
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,898
Then please bring
that crucial third picture again tomorrow.

212
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,401
At least let me borrow these two.

213
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:59,471
I'll need them to convince my chief,
or things will take more time.

214
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,041
Do we get our fee tomorrow then?

215
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,645
I didn't bring it with me today.

216
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:11,984
I will give it to you tomorrow
in exchange for the third picture.

217
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,089
While it isn't much…

218
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,797
For transportation.

219
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,640
Nice.

220
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,674
It's Matomin.

221
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,076
The real deal.

222
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,912
Did anything feel off?

223
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,315
I tried asking them lots of questions.

224
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,317
Like…

225
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,790
I asked what class they were in.

226
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,461
They said that they were in class two
in eighth grade

227
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,197
while Matomin was in class one.

228
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,566
I also asked about their homes.

229
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,903
Matomin lived in a large,
white apartment building.

230
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:08,140
They didn't remember the name
or the floor she lived on.

231
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,875
But towards the upper level.

232
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,878
He went over there once or twice,

233
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,315
but she mostly came to his home.

234
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,885
That's about all I was able to ask.

235
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,090
The answers are pretty vague.

236
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,861
Yes, but there wasn't much I could say
to prove otherwise.

237
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,330
I'll check the validity then.

238
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,532
I know a writer who knows idols.

239
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,769
- I'll ask him about Matomin.
- You will?

240
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,671
Thank you!

241
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,473
We'll also need to check
if the photos are real.

242
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,374
Yeah.

243
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,545
Wait, do you mean they're likely fake?

244
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,347
It's always possible.

245
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:55,988
I can't imagine Matomi Ishikawa
smoking cigarettes.

246
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,990
Her voice is so beautiful.

247
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,391
Plus, she's a minor.

248
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,761
What are you doing?

249
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:08,033
If Matomin really smokes,
her teeth should be yellow.

250
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,337
Those photos have definitely
been touched up.

251
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,371
True.

252
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,874
Then maybe a personal photo
could show them!

253
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,344
It'd be nice if this weren't fake.

254
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,180
There aren't many pictures
with her teeth showing.

255
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,117
She's cute when she's sexy, too!

256
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,291
Huh?

257
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,360
Wait.

258
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,261
Hold on a second!

259
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,563
What? Hold on!

260
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,697
Hold on!

261
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,468
What is it?

262
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,447
Yes… Okay.

263
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,082
Got it.

264
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,717
Thanks.

265
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:04,390
Matomin used to live on the first floor
of a low-rise apartment building.

266
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,760
So it's definitely fake then.

267
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:08,727
Shinoda.

268
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:13,665
You gotta be fed up
with people trying to trick you.

269
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:14,733
Yes, sir.

270
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,570
If we write a story
based on a stupid fake tip,

271
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,339
we could get sued,

272
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,609
and worst case scenario,
the editor-in-chief gets sacked.

273
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,379
Don't let your guard down next time!

274
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,280
Yes, sir.

275
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,249
But you did well to get evidence.

276
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,218
It's thanks to Mr. Yamabuki's advice.

277
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,924
You mean to gather as much evidence
as you can?

278
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,429
But I wasn't able to figure out
they were lying at first.

279
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,565
Even if your interviewing needs work,

280
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,435
you made trustworthy people take action,

281
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,504
presenting the information
they found openly,

282
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,275
giving us what we need to determine
whether or not to publish.

283
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,845
You learned something at least.

284
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,082
Here. Keep this on your desk.

285
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,684
Chin up.

286
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,052
Night, everyone.

287
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,754
- Good night.
- Good night.

288
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:13,392
TITI'S MATOMI ISHIKAWA
A MINOR WHO'S SMOKING?

289
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,798
THE MEANING OF A TABLOID'S EXISTENCE

290
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,109
Ms. Shinoda?

291
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,212
Been a while.

292
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,446
Last time was the reunion.

293
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,380
MASAKI KUWABARA

294
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,482
Yeah.

295
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,218
Rumors of you even reached
the art department.

296
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,156
They scammed 10,000 yen out of me!

297
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,625
It's not too bad
if that's all you've paid.

298
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,594
Tough break.

299
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,661
Thanks.

300
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,868
How're you feeling?

301
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,738
Better since my transfer.

302
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,141
That's good.

303
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,276
I'm in charge of a novel right now.

304
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,180
A social awareness mystery novel
sounding the alarm for Japan's future.

305
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,017
It's a different exhaustion from tabloids.

306
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,387
Why do tabloids even exist?

307
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,095
What's the purpose of tabloids?

308
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,302
Hello, Sengoku Weekly.

309
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,738
<i>I have a scoop.</i>

310
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,807
What kind of scoop?

311
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,978
I saw a cat holding a human hand
in its mouth.

312
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,113
A human hand?

313
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:46,885
<i>I thought a tabloid might take action</i>
<i>on something like this.</i>

314
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,922
TO BE CONTINUED

315
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,157
Stupid Sengokusha!

316
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,626
<i>Somehow, she's gone missing.</i>

317
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,361
Kota Kubozuka, age 27.

318
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,363
<i>I want you to go to Niigata tomorrow.</i>

319
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,800
<i>I didn't join a publisher</i>
<i>to do stuff like this.</i>

320
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,035
Listen!

321
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,403
Your fit is on point today.

322
