1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,805
RISE UP
SEIYA AOSHIRO

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,340
Mr. Seiya Aoshiro.

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:12,545
Am I really allowed to pick such
a handsome businessman for an interview?

4
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:19,652
My publication is more home to
articles like that.

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,254
INCONSISTENT POLITICIAN'S
CONSTANT FLIP-FLOPPING

6
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:26,426
Although I imagine he has flaws
since he's only human.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,829
But what would dragging that out lead to?

8
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:31,831
No.

9
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:37,337
If this feature gets greenlit,
I could take charge of my own work.

10
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,773
My chance is finally here.

11
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:49,082
His family's apparel business
was in the red during the recession.

12
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,286
He started helping out the business
while he was a student

13
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,856
and began working there in earnest
after graduation, started reorganizing,

14
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,725
causing sales to grow steadily.

15
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,227
The rise of a young executive.

16
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,396
Come in.

17
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,904
How's it going?

18
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,340
I've read a few articles.

19
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,341
What'd you think?

20
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,112
He's exactly how I imagined.

21
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,481
He's not a typical nepo baby.

22
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,783
He actually worked hard.

23
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,820
That's true.

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,355
He cares about the employees,

25
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,826
he has good character,
and a strong sense of responsibility.

26
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:38,865
He just seems perfect in every single way.

27
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:43,403
So where can I find an interesting
and unexpected angle?

28
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,805
I don't have a clue.

29
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,509
What list of questions could I send?

30
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,780
I can give you one helpful tip
you may find useful.

31
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,220
The guy's way greedier than he looks.

32
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,489
And full of himself.

33
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,793
Write a letter that caters to
someone like that.

34
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,796
Well, then.

35
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,898
Good luck.

36
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,878
-Shinoda.
-Yes?

37
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,880
Are you free to help me right now?

38
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,150
I was going to tell you at the meeting,

39
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:33,586
but I'm working on an interview
after talking to Mr. Murai.

40
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,555
-That right?
-Yes.

41
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,190
-Never mind then.
-What?

42
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,093
Good luck with landing the interview.

43
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:42,929
What?

44
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,207
What was that smile?

45
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,241
Good luck.

46
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,810
Mr. Murai did the same.

47
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:58,811
Good luck.

48
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,849
Kitahama Desk and Mr. Murai.

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,954
Hold on.

50
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,291
What's wrong?

51
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,464
I might be in trouble.

52
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,612
-What is it?
-Don't you want it?

53
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,080
I do!

54
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,516
You're scaring me.

55
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:41,120
The interview with Aoshiro I was
quietly working on at Mr. Murai's request.

56
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,121
Okay.

57
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,190
Apparently, Kitahama Desk knew.

58
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,996
In other words, Mr. Murai and Desk
have their eyes on it.

59
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,133
This is a big deal.

60
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,037
There must be some big secret
about Mr. Aoshiro.

61
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,040
I'm guessing they already
have a few leads.

62
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,410
They're trying to get me
to meet him directly.

63
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,180
But for what?

64
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,549
Any ideas?

65
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:16,322
Desk asked me the other day if I knew
anyone who's close to Seiya Aoshiro.

66
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,391
Hold on. That's all he did.

67
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,226
Something's definitely up.

68
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,731
-It smells like a big story.
-Right?

69
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,568
Mr. Murai and Kitahama Desk
both had these big smiles,

70
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,503
and wished me luck.

71
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,338
-Huh?
-Right?

72
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,143
Those two only smile
if they're up to something.

73
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,353
Hey… Can I eat this now?

74
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:50,957
Hello?

75
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,037
It's starting to get interesting.

76
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:13,112
I actually got to say the phrase
I've been wanting to.

77
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,651
Screw you!

78
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,220
Do you have it out for him?

79
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,523
Your shouting is disrupting our work.

80
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,359
This isn't what we talked about!

81
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,561
I understand your point.

82
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:32,298
I want you and your supervisor
at our office!

83
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:35,702
Got it?

84
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,281
Are you okay, Mr. Yamabuki?

85
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,717
What happened?

86
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:55,722
Kitahama Desk rewrote my article.

87
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,123
What?

88
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,227
You're working on an interview?

89
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,963
You know that, too?

90
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,232
Not the details.

91
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,869
I'll tell you, because it might help you.

92
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,338
Did you read the editorial?

93
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:13,873
Um…

94
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,275
The politician Katsuya Sadamatsu, right?

95
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,176
Correct.

96
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,178
That man is his aide.

97
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:25,385
I interviewed him and his aide over dinner
about his political work.

98
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,022
To my surprise, Sadamatsu
turned out to be clean and a good guy.

99
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,327
But Desk got ahold of my draft
and changed it,

100
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,529
turning it into a nasty piece.

101
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,400
Why would he do that?

102
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,236
You know puff pieces?

103
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:49,075
An article to help elevate the subject
and give them an advantage.

104
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:49,976
That's right.

105
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,879
Desk told me this.

106
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,384
Why?

107
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,455
We don't publish puff pieces.

108
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,893
If we published that without hinting
that he's after voters,

109
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,431
and the government used it for PR,
a lot of parties would start gloating.

110
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,966
You get it?

111
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,339
The Sengoku Weekly was about to get used.

112
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,154
Desk avoided a fiasco.

113
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,124
In the end, he saved me.

114
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,227
He was a good guy in person.

115
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,896
I truly wanted to root for him.

116
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,836
I got to learn just how blind I was.

117
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,277
So the lesson is,
we can't easily trust anyone.

118
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,781
It's better to go in skeptical.

119
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,952
Well, you have to be critical either way.

120
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,355
Don't make any assumptions.

121
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,160
Always remain neutral.

122
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,331
It's hard to do, though.

123
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,534
That's all.

124
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,281
Always remain neutral.

125
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:42,455
DEAR MR. SEIYA AOSHIRO
FORGIVE ME FOR…

126
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,995
This is the Sengoku Weekly.

127
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,330
Is Hinako Shinoda in?

128
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,533
That's me.

129
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,236
I'm Miyamoto, Seiya Aoshiro's assistant.

130
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,439
I'm sorry for the sudden letter.

131
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:05,044
Mr. Aoshiro appreciated
the thoughtful handwritten letter.

132
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,613
He would love to do the interview.

133
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,981
Thank you!

134
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:17,323
I will create a proposal including
compensation and contact you again.

135
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,892
Give my greetings to President Aoshiro.

136
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,295
I will, look forward to hearing from you.

137
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,563
Goodbye.

138
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,002
He gave the okay!

139
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,671
Nice one.

140
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,606
-That's great.
-Not bad.

141
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,275
Check and make sure
he's okay with photographs.

142
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,209
Yes, sir.

143
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,949
Seiya Aoshiro?

144
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,617
That's amazing.

145
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,254
He might like it if you wore
his brand for the day.

146
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,388
That's a good idea!

147
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,223
-And pay for it yourself.
-Yes!

148
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,391
I totally would.

149
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,260
You're so pumped up.

150
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,463
I'm worried things are going too well.

151
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,833
Maybe that handwritten letter
really worked.

152
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,072
Slow down a bit.

153
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,140
Another one, please!

154
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,509
Don't get sloppy drunk again!

155
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,144
When did I ever get sloppy?

156
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,313
When you got back from Niigata.

157
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,315
Stupid Sengokusha!

158
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,751
That's not my fault.

159
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,520
My phone died,

160
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,690
then I got lost in the rain,
and rang a doorbell.

161
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,125
I know, you told me.

162
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,762
Then I almost got eaten by a bear
in the sticks.

163
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,564
The bear's a lie.

164
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,632
Busted.

165
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,203
Another one, please!

166
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,975
A bear-repelling bell?

167
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,010
Hina.

168
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,514
I get you're happy to finally work
on your own project,

169
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,316
but don't get carried away.

170
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,051
Good point.

171
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,687
Remember your favorite horror novel.

172
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,722
Horror novel?

173
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,925
The ones who screw around
get cursed first.

174
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,394
Same thing here.

175
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,163
Don't jinx me!

176
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,333
Be careful when things seem
too good to be true.

177
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,534
Seiya Aoshiro, right?

178
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,539
Pretty roses have thorns.

179
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,174
Hold on!

180
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,076
What's lurking below the surface?

181
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,912
Can you be a little more reassuring?

182
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,714
Good medicine tastes bitter.

183
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,718
The schemer is undone by his own schemes.
Too much of a good thing.

184
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,586
That's all negative, Asuka!

185
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:28,421
Bathroom!

186
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,391
Sorry!

187
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,860
How are you drunk already?

188
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,562
Sorry. Thank you.

189
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,465
The PR zine.

190
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,801
You're still involved?

191
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,136
No, but why does that matter?

192
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,042
You're carrying around
your former department's work?

193
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,446
Why are you being so harsh to me today?

194
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,781
Sorry, I'm kidding.

195
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,217
Anyway, do your best.

196
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,685
I'm rooting for you.

197
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,522
Thank you. I'll do my best.

198
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,992
What about the bathroom?

199
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,461
Bathroom?

200
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,242
Good morning.

201
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,745
-Good morning…
-Wow.

202
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,046
Nice.

203
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,280
Looks good on you.

204
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,015
It's Mr. Aoshiro's brand.

205
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,217
That's great.

206
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:32,952
If you please.

207
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,290
Is the interview ready?

208
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:42,728
Yes, I had Kitahama Desk
look over the questions yesterday.

209
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,464
It's just…

210
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,201
You want to ask me something.

211
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:58,277
You seem to have some thoughts
on Seiya Aoshiro, don't you?

212
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,047
It's not that I don't.

213
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:06,519
But I don't have enough evidence
to merit telling you now.

214
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,189
Some bad rumors about him, right?

215
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,557
Yes.

216
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,027
I did some research online,

217
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,996
but didn't find anything.

218
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,467
The facts are that he did
revitalize the company.

219
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,671
He may have a talent for business.

220
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,208
And as you can see,
he's charismatic and attractive.

221
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,781
Is it better if I don't know
the true objective of today's interview?

222
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,021
Sorry for not being forthcoming.

223
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,392
But all you have to do
is conduct a smooth interview.

224
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,860
I swear.

225
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,030
Just creating a connection with him
would be big.

226
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:53,599
I see.

227
00:13:54,433 --> 00:14:01,006
It would be even more amazing if you
could exchange personal numbers with him.

228
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,576
Me?

229
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,378
With this hot guy?

230
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,113
Provided it’s possible.

231
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,316
If the opportunity presents itself.

232
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:17,156
Have a snack ready and try to
make him lower his guard beforehand.

233
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,427
Suzaki is already upstairs,
getting set up.

234
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,195
You can ask him for advice.

235
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,564
Okay.

236
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,767
You going?

237
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,671
I'll get the room ready
and wait for him outside early.

238
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,907
I'm off then.

239
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,714
Almost forgot.

240
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:48,287
Even if you happen to notice or
realize something in the middle of it,

241
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,256
try to keep your poker face.

242
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:52,858
Okay.

243
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,694
All right, good luck then.

244
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:56,729
Thank you!

245
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,971
Good morning, I'm Shinoda.

246
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,640
I apologize for the inconvenience.

247
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,909
Not at all, I look forward to today.

248
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,313
You really did come alone.

249
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,714
Yes.

250
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,650
I do things alone when I can.

251
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,252
I even took the subway.

252
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,255
I didn't even miss my transfer.

253
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,890
YOUNG BUSINESSMAN
SEIYA AOSHIRO

254
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,061
-Let me lead the way.
-Sure.

255
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,243
Ms. Shinoda.

256
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:20,646
Drinks.

257
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,182
Is coffee okay?

258
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,083
Thank you.

259
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,657
Do you two know each other?

260
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,760
Yes, we often work together
on the Incident Team.

261
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,894
Incident Team?

262
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,931
Well, to be exact, I'm a freelancer.

263
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,767
But I do most of Sengoku Weekly's shoots.

264
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:47,172
Usually a cameraman from the Photo
Department gets sent to interviews,

265
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,642
but Mr. Suzaki was swapped in
last minute for this.

266
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,610
Ms. Shinoda.

267
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,481
Check if he needs milk or sugar.

268
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,317
I'll take it black.

269
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,218
Okay.

270
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,988
-You two help yourselves as well.
-Thank you.

271
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,692
I'm fine, why don't you have a cup?

272
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,626
Sure.

273
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,065
So you mostly take scandal photos.

274
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,968
No, I take all sorts of photos.

275
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:21,106
Our chief sent me here
since Shinoda's still a newbie.

276
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,343
I figured that was the case.

277
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,878
They're worried about you.

278
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,913
Eyes forward.

279
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,816
Sorry.

280
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,185
-Please be careful, it's hot.
-Thank you.

281
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,893
You're kind, Ms. Shinoda,
just like in you were in your letter.

282
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,797
I'm curious to know
where your warm character comes from.

283
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:45,964
Oh, no…

284
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,233
Maybe I'll interview you instead.

285
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,803
Where are you from?

286
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,438
Rural Chiba.

287
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,442
Were you running around
in the fields as a kid?

288
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,011
I wasn't that much of a tomboy.

289
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,548
You're from Niigata, right?

290
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,883
What were you like?

291
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,389
I loved sports.

292
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,392
There were many big parks around.

293
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,463
Have you been to Niigata before?

294
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:18,964
I have!

295
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,333
To ski or snowboard?

296
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,935
No, for work.

297
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,938
A month ago, but it was a short visit.

298
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,140
Kota Kubozuka.

299
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,943
In his teenage years,
he caused an assault case.

300
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,745
I want you to check
their Niigata residence.

301
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,715
Your work was crucial.

302
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:41,253
Even if you happen to notice or
realize something in the middle of it,

303
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,422
try to keep your poker face.

304
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:46,925
You okay?

305
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,828
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,097
Did it get on your clothes?

307
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,634
I'll go use the restroom.

308
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,146
Is Mr. Aoshiro involved in the serial
accidental deaths?

309
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,348
Is it a coincidence?

310
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,318
No, hold on.

311
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,454
Mr. Aoshiro?

312
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,656
You should request an interview.

313
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:21,226
Mr. Suzaki was swapped in
last minute for this.

314
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,630
So you mostly take scandal photos.

315
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,199
It's not a coincidence!

316
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,902
How did I not notice until now?

317
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,004
I'm so stupid!

318
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,739
How can I be so slow?

319
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,175
Pretty roses have thorns.

320
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,578
The guy's way greedier than he looks.

321
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:49,288
Mr. Aoshiro is connected
to the serial mysterious deaths.

322
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,324
Something's set in motion.

323
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,594
I feel like I'm getting dragged
into something again.

324
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,263
Things are getting interesting!

325
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,099
No picture, no real name,
won't answer the phone.

326
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,502
What if I end up with a boyfriend?

327
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,904
