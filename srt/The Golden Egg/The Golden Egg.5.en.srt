1
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,981
I talked to my mom
for the first time in a while.

2
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:19,119
I finally told her I got moved
to Sengoku Weekly's Incident Team.

3
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,554
So then, she told me to quit.

4
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,258
But you wouldn't quit, right?

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,364
I had a hard time keeping up
with all the work I was tasked to do,

6
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,999
so I briefly considered it.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,635
That's how it is at first.

8
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,472
What do I need to do
to get to do my own work?

9
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:44,044
That reminds me,
when you were at your old department,

10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,946
weren't you excited
when you got an interview in?

11
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,283
It was the first feature I got to lead.

12
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,320
Why don't you set up an interview
for the Sengoku Weekly?

13
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,690
I never considered that.

14
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,827
You're right…

15
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,132
An interview for the Sengoku Weekly.

16
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,004
Sounds good.

17
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,006
Maybe write up a few general questions.

18
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,276
Sometimes a big name will accept
for some reason.

19
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,144
I will!

20
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,447
I have experience
with interview questions.

21
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,049
But it can't be just anyone.

22
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,053
I mean, you'll have to use
your own judgment,

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,022
even if someone agrees to it,

24
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,325
it'll get scrapped if the Desk
isn't interested.

25
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,626
Then you're screwed.

26
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,594
Why?

27
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:38,164
You won't hear the end of it
at the pitch meeting.

28
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,100
He'll call it tiny or tepid.

29
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,668
-Or "It's bland."
-Or "Rejected!"

30
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,871
-Or "You think this is good?"
-"Worth less than toilet paper."

31
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,973
I'll try to find someone good then.

32
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,709
WRITE SOME QUESTIONS

33
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:52,912
Sorry.

34
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:54,848
Good luck.

35
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,683
Yes?

36
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,254
This might be pretty tough.

37
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,335
HIMAWARI MINATO
DAIGO IWAKURA

38
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,075
The only people I actually want to meet
tend to be decent people.

39
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:29,749
But I know that makes for a weak
interview for the Sengoku Weekly.

40
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,485
Come in.

41
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,487
You wanted to see me?

42
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,190
Oh, it smells good.

43
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,424
Have you had lunch?

44
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,392
Not yet.

45
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,294
You can have all this.

46
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,029
Really?

47
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,169
Is this an experiment?

48
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,103
Not at all.

49
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,639
I have a favor to ask you.

50
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,040
Help me while you eat?

51
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:05,952
I see.

52
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:07,987
That is a tough one.

53
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,791
I managed to come up with five people.

54
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,226
Let me run through them.

55
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,194
Okay.

56
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:21,167
A second-generation councilperson
who is not meshing with her supporters.

57
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,637
It's a little too niche to be interesting.

58
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,406
Next please.

59
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,778
A department store manager
being accused of harassment.

60
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,415
I don't need an interview
to get the picture.

61
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,349
Next.

62
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,121
An insider from a movie
with a suddenly replaced lead actor.

63
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,656
That's a common occurrence.

64
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,726
In this case, you'd need to
interview more than one person.

65
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,561
And the actor in question is important.

66
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:57,036
An amateur manga writer
caught evading taxes.

67
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,774
Being an amateur author instead of
a vetaran could be a good angle,

68
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,643
but I doubt it would work.

69
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,584
An idol singer whose younger sister
became more popular.

70
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,687
That will just sound like
some sibling quarrel.

71
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,592
Is that all?

72
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,064
I don't know.

73
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:31,404
You should first research
what Kitahama Desk is interested in,

74
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,239
and base your pick on that.

75
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,309
Taking a shot in the dark
is just a waste of time.

76
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,411
If you're tired of playing support,

77
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,748
you need to fundamentally
change the way you think.

78
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:42,715
Wait a second.

79
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,418
That's way too harsh.

80
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,922
I just channeled Kitahama Desk in my head.

81
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,792
Maybe wipe the mayo off your face first.

82
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,362
Other side.

83
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:01,200
Also, could you not eat
while you criticize me?

84
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,269
You said I could eat while we do it.

85
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,807
Come in.

86
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,176
There you are.

87
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,477
-Good work.
-Hey.

88
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:12,278
It stinks.

89
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,348
-Is now a good time?
-Sure.

90
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,151
You did an interview feature
at your old post,

91
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,919
with the actor Kosuke Suenaga.

92
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,255
Yes, I did. About him leaving his troupe.

93
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,158
Apparently he suddenly
pulled out of a play.

94
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,160
Huh?

95
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:33,299
There were rumors of various forms
of harassment and mental instability,

96
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,536
he must have caused another scandal
to get forced out.

97
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,338
Can you find out what happened?

98
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,040
His reason for leaving the play?

99
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,546
Yes, understood.

100
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,281
Looking forward to it.

101
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,182
Goodbye.

102
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,551
ONE YEAR AGO
AT THE PR ZINE DEPARTMENT

103
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,587
Perfect. Thank you.

104
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,623
Sorry, Nayumi,
Mr. Suenaga is running late.

105
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,425
Do you mind waiting?

106
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,094
-Okay.
-My apologies.

107
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,562
-Actually.
-Yes?

108
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:07,500
I heard Mr. Suenaga was mentally unstable.

109
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,702
They're just rumors.

110
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,738
That he takes medication for it.

111
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,006
We don't know if that's true or not.

112
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,608
It'll be fine.

113
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,148
I'll go get Mr. Suenaga.

114
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,899
Ms. Shinoda.

115
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,268
We found Suenaga's usual hair salon.

116
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,637
His stylist is named Miyoshi. Can you go?

117
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,172
Okay.

118
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,340
It'll be compensated.

119
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,844
Huh? Wait, do you mean
I should get my hair cut?

120
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,918
We're having trouble getting info.

121
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:02,321
We go to rehearsals, but no one
involved with the play will talk.

122
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,857
He won't even respond
if we do a house visit.

123
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,327
We go to his favorite pub Tokichiro,
and it's always packed.

124
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,597
The hair salon should be easier
in that regard. Good luck.

125
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,099
We're ready for you now.

126
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,033
Okay.

127
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,109
SENGOKU WEEKLY

128
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,522
Sorry for the wait.

129
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,461
Thank you for requesting me,
how do you want it cut?

130
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,997
I'd like to thin it out a bit.

131
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,299
Understood.

132
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,767
We'll start with a wash.

133
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,204
Excuse me.

134
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,111
It's still so hot these days.

135
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,252
Um.

136
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,556
Does Kosuke Suenaga come here often?

137
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,770
We've had several people like you come in.

138
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,415
A tabloid, huh?

139
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,755
Aren't you embarrassed?

140
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:48,094
Buzzing around human misery.
Only ever exposing their bad side.

141
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,531
Digging up just the surface,

142
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,867
spreading it to entertain the masses.

143
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,905
You don't even consider
who you might hurt.

144
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:03,843
What if it were you?

145
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,847
What if it was your family?

146
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,951
Maybe think about that?

147
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,088
What you're doing

148
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,458
is stomping on people's lives
and feelings.

149
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,427
Please leave.

150
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,488
Hello?

151
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,057
How'd it go?

152
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,727
The salon was a bust.

153
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:56,829
I see.

154
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,764
Don't sweat it.

155
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:08,174
His favorite pub
is called Tokichiro, right?

156
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,277
But that place is tricky.

157
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,945
It's probably full by now.

158
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,915
I doubt you could question people anyway.

159
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,857
TOKICHIRO

160
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,470
Um, excuse me.

161
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,008
May I talk to you?

162
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,211
AKARI

163
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,787
Mr. Suenaga hasn't been visiting
for a while now.

164
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,889
When did he stop coming?

165
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,526
I can't talk about our patrons.

166
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,194
That's understandable.

167
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,498
But he was causing lots of problems.

168
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,735
Even when it was super crowded
he'd talk to me when I served him.

169
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,905
I ignored him once, and he got super sad.

170
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,840
Was that the last time he came?

171
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,543
No, it wasn't.

172
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,412
With the same girl as usual.

173
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,850
-You want to know who the girl was, right?
-Sure.

174
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,988
But I won't tell you because
I want to protect her.

175
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,357
So it's a celebrity, right?

176
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,927
-I'm not telling you.
-It's okay.

177
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:40,900
Could you tell me any interesting
stories about Mr. Suenaga then?

178
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,836
Huh? That's all you want?

179
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:44,837
Of course.

180
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,639
You can just share what you can.

181
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,241
Interesting stories?

182
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,080
There was nothing interesting
about Mr. Suenaga.

183
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,683
It was around last year.

184
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,186
He apparently stopped drinking,

185
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,988
and only ordered alcohol-free beer.

186
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:08,294
But he'd always ask for a chaser
even though it's non-alcoholic.

187
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,162
And we'd all laugh at the joke.

188
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,132
Does that mean, water?

189
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,233
Yeah.

190
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,603
The girl cracked a joke about him
getting water with his alcohol-free beer.

191
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,238
They seemed happy.

192
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:28,514
We got a text chain from someone
who's calling herself "Mistress Three."

193
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,518
It's really great, just take a look!

194
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,019
You love this stuff!

195
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,055
Nothing scarier than a mistress story.

196
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,023
Kitahama loves mistresses.

197
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,392
Plus, they keep talking dirty.

198
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,395
When was the most recent message?

199
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,064
Six months ago.

200
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,633
"Let's end this. I'm sorry."

201
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,035
That's scary.

202
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,003
Right?

203
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,305
He promised to marry Mistress Three,

204
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,074
but then he dumps her.

205
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,276
He won't even answer his phone.

206
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,646
So she left a terrifying message
on his voice mail.

207
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,317
"I'll send all our texts to a tabloid."

208
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,120
So, he stepped down
before this came to light.

209
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,856
Exactly! Now, turn it into an article.

210
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,458
Give it a big headline!

211
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,259
Okay.

212
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,127
Could I say something?

213
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,365
Something's been on my mind.

214
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,670
I read the latest Sengoku Weekly.

215
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:29,275
Only a small number of his fans
would defend Suenaga's scandal.

216
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,843
THE TRUTH BEHIND
KOSUKE SUENAGA'S DEPARTURE

217
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,514
There are a lot of online comments saying
he stepped down because of this story.

218
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,119
Everybody loves juicy
entertainment industry gossip.

219
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,621
It's also a popular subject for novels.

220
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:47,026
Which is why when authors
write about the entertainment industry,

221
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,562
they do as much research as a tabloid,

222
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,297
and even wear themselves down.

223
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,034
It's hard everywhere.

224
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,004
I definitely believe that.

225
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,310
You can't send that.

226
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,212
The theater folks are objecting.

227
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,649
It's not 90 percent of theater company
reps dating their lead actresses.

228
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:11,884
It's 80 percent.

229
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,455
For the follow-up,
we'll go with Mistress Three's identity.

230
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,392
Mr. Kitahama, our articles from this week
are doing well online.

231
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,128
Really nice!

232
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:27,132
So Mistress Three's picture,
should we go with modest or sexy?

233
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,301
-Sexy!
-Which is the right call?

234
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,736
-Mr. Kitahama.
-What?

235
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,540
[BREAKING] STAGE ACTOR
KOSUKE SUENAGA PASSED AWAY

236
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,647
According to an insider,

237
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:47,086
Suenaga hoped to finish his last play
while battling terminal cancer,

238
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,788
but he stepped down
after his condition got worse.

239
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,131
Honestly, it's not surprising
we got backlash.

240
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,501
But it's less than I expected.

241
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,304
All thanks to you.

242
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,611
Something's been on my mind.

243
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,688
It was during this interview,

244
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,292
I saw him taking some kind of medication.

245
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,695
I heard he was mentally unstable,

246
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,331
so I assumed it was a mood stabilizer.

247
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:36,302
But maybe it was a different medication.

248
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,739
Mr. Suenaga stopped drinking
alcohol last year.

249
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,477
So you think the medication
is for a disease?

250
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,148
With everyone involved in the play
not talking about it,

251
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:52,484
it could be a pretty serious disease.

252
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,721
It's purely conjecture, though.

253
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,790
We need more than a hunch.

254
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,495
Could you check out the surrounding
hospitals just in case?

255
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,498
I know it'll be hard to get
any personal information, though.

256
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:13,973
Daisuke, let's add that story
from the pub to help build credibility.

257
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,008
And to close the article…

258
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:21,113
He had been seen taking medication
last year,

259
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,717
and learning he quit his favorite vices,
alcohol and cigarettes,

260
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,553
if the reason he stepped down
is related to his health,

261
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,121
we pray for his recovery.

262
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,858
If we only pushed the scandal,

263
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,927
we would've gotten grilled.

264
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,830
Anyway, it's all thanks to you.

265
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,264
Please, that's too much.

266
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:45,104
But I'm surprised that waitress
shared that he quit alcohol.

267
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:50,309
You might have a knack for
bringing down people's defenses.

268
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,177
For sure.

269
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:57,116
That's why Murai had you investigating
his multiple mysterious deaths case.

270
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,485
Multiple mysterious deaths?

271
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,789
What, he didn't tell you?

272
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,391
No.

273
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,827
MULTIPLE SUSPICIOUS DEATHS

274
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,996
What? What?!

275
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:14,500
I went and verified
Madoka Hashimoto's job.

276
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,936
And checked the home
of Kubozuka's guardian Mr. Watanabe.

277
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,372
Your work was crucial.

278
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,176
I'm sure he'll explain more next time.

279
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:25,577
Bye then.

280
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,820
Multiple mysterious deaths.

281
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:40,559
I never imagined I would be involved
in something like this.

282
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,364
Where am I heading?

283
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:50,135
What's waiting for me at the end
of this path I've been put on?

284
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,405
Wait.

285
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,241
This is no time to be poetic.

286
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:00,946
I have to switch gears and work hard
on this interview feature.

287
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,688
So that's the situation.

288
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,889
What do you think?

289
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,959
The name's not ringing any bells.

290
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,728
You don't know Serendy Shogo?

291
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,564
Never heard of him.

292
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,798
He's a magician.

293
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,902
He has lovers all over Japan,

294
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:27,439
and he meets with them in hotels
when he visits other cities,

295
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,542
according to posts from other fans.

296
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,544
So his audience knows.

297
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:37,349
I guess his misdirection only worked
on his magic tricks.

298
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:46,091
Anyway, I thought Kitahama Desk might be
interested since he likes love scandals.

299
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,761
Did you already send questions?

300
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:50,696
Not yet.

301
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,664
Then, before you do,

302
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,367
I have a request too.

303
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,905
Mr. Aoshiro?

304
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,806
You know him?

305
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,243
Yes, I've seen him on TV
and in newspapers.

306
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,211
He's known for his looks.

307
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,446
Right.

308
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:12,451
He inherited a small apparel company
in Niigata from his parents,

309
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,621
and made it into a national brand
within a few years.

310
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:16,955
A young man's success story.

311
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,124
He's really impressive.

312
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,793
It's good you've already heard of him.

313
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,896
-You should request an interview.
-What?!

314
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,031
With Mr. Aoshiro? Oh crap!

315
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:26,965
Nosebleed?

316
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,267
No, just snot.

317
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,568
You surprised me.

318
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,203
Sorry.

319
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,539
It'd be cool if it happens.

320
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:36,909
So?

321
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,547
An interview with Seiya Aoshiro.

322
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,854
TO BE CONTINUED

323
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,890
This isn't what we talked about!

324
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,192
I might be in trouble.

325
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,994
Those two only smile
if they're up to something.

326
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:59,498
It's not a coincidence.
How did I not notice until now?

327
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,534
It's starting to get interesting.

328
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,836
