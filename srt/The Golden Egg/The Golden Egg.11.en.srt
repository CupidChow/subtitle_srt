1
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:13,513
SERIAL MYSTERIOUS DEATHS

2
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,390
The year is almost over.

3
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,826
Time has flown by
since I was transferred in April.

4
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,197
You must hate me because it's my fault

5
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,801
that you had to transfer.

6
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,770
What? Why?

7
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,038
I don't hate you.

8
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,807
People get transferred all the time.

9
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,911
But I never imagined
I'd be placed on the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i>,

10
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:49,516
working on such a big story
like the mysterious deaths case.

11
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,024
I have to go to a meeting now.

12
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,828
Good luck editing the novel!

13
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,434
Huh?

14
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,103
Ms. Shinoda.

15
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,644
Mr. Aoshiro?

16
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,912
Why are you here?

17
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,250
Do you think that I did this?

18
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,820
No, I'm not sure yet.

19
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,623
I was overseas
when the second death occurred.

20
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,392
I have an alibi.

21
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:39,432
Besides, why would someone
who's all clean have to kill anyone?

22
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:43,670
But you did some questionable things
behind the scenes back in the day.

23
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,242
You mean this?

24
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,713
<i>Just between us,</i>

25
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,851
<i>everyone who got in his way</i>
<i>met a tragic fate.</i>

26
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,552
Give that back! It belongs to--

27
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,753
Tell me, Ms. Shinoda.

28
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,090
You'll trust me,

29
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,428
won't you?

30
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,731
Mr. Aoshiro.

31
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,403
Hey, you.

32
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,674
Kubozuka?

33
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,811
Are you the one saying that I did this?

34
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,713
No, I'm not!

35
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:29,616
The police put you on a wanted list!

36
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:33,786
But in your hometown of Niigata,
people said you were a good guy.

37
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,223
I'm just trying to find out the truth!

38
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,426
Which is the real you?

39
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,365
Please say something!

40
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,668
Then let me ask you.

41
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,744
I haven't seen you since the mixer.

42
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,781
So you're Harue Komiyama's nephew.

43
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,383
Atsuhiro Imamura.

44
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,523
You're saying I'm guilty?

45
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,728
There's testimony that Ms. Komiyama
met with Kubozuka before her death.

46
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:22,135
But was the person you met
really Harue Komiyama?

47
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:24,637
What are you saying?

48
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,808
I heard you had a shady hobby.

49
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,679
Could it be crossdressing?

50
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,718
If so, then perhaps you were the one
Kubozuka met at the cave bar,

51
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,954
after which you killed Ms. Komiyama

52
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,123
and framed it on Kubozuka?

53
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,728
You're just a tabloid reporter,
not the police. What are you doing?

54
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,374
How about you drop out
of this investigation already?

55
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,545
Is this job worth risking your life for?

56
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,881
Stay out of it.

57
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,517
Just leave it to the police.

58
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,729
No!

59
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,031
There's a role for tabloids to play!

60
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,849
I've decided to bring the missing
Madoka Hashimoto

61
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,652
back to this bear and her mother.

62
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,254
Where is Madoka now?

63
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:50,857
Stay away!

64
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:54,560
Huh?

65
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,145
It opened?

66
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,148
Help me!

67
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,551
Is anyone here?

68
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,761
DANGER! BEWARE OF BEARS

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,968
The <i>Truth Weekly</i>?

70
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:43,910
What?

71
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:48,448
<i>SENGOKU WEEKLY</i> INCIDENT TEAM ATTACKED!

72
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,123
A GRUDGE AGAINST TABLOIDS!

73
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,231
Mr. Kitahama?

74
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,400
Are you okay?

75
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,236
It's all over for tabloids!

76
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,840
It's not worth risking your life for.

77
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:21,280
<i>Sengoku Weekly</i> is hereby discontinued!

78
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,884
It's what the world wants.

79
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,819
What about the case?

80
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,589
Leave it to the police!

81
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:33,192
What about the hidden truth
the police can't act on?

82
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,795
Are we just going to ignore it?

83
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,096
We have novels!

84
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,100
We can make our mark through stories.

85
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,169
It's much slower than tabloids.

86
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,103
In that case.

87
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,240
There's social media!

88
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,944
People with a strong sense of justice
will expose the world's darkness.

89
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:55,081
What if they make those posts
without investigating?

90
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,383
-Everyone would believe them!
-Then!

91
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,153
You decide as the lone survivor.

92
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,690
Think hard about what you're going to do.

93
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,159
Listen.

94
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,829
There are three important things.

95
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,534
Mr. Kitahama?

96
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,636
Mr. Kitahama!

97
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,703
Mr. Kitahama!

98
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,439
You can't do that!

99
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,908
At least tell me one of them!

100
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,243
What should I do?

101
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,778
Mr. Kitahama!

102
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,381
Mr. Kitahama!

103
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,284
Mr. Kitahama!

104
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,592
ATSUHIRO IMAMURA

105
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,429
Mr. Kitahama?

106
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,736
-Hi everyone.
-We're back.

107
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,072
Good news, you two.

108
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:53,973
How'd it go?

109
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,076
Jackpot.

110
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,545
We found the crossdressers' bar
Imamura went to.

111
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,013
Here he is, dressed as a woman.

112
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:39,285
<i>There's a possibility that</i>
<i>the wanted fugitive Kota Kubozuka</i>

113
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,455
was framed
for the serial mysterious deaths.

114
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,424
But there's no definitive proof yet.

115
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,861
We have to find some evidence
by Tuesday night

116
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,563
to make it for the next issue.

117
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:55,935
Or else the <i>Truth Weekly</i> will run
their story on Aoshiro and beat us.

118
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,637
Three more days.

119
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,109
I have a call.

120
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,911
-You can answer.
-Sorry.

121
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,680
Hello?

122
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,983
<i>Hello, Hinako Shinoda?</i>

123
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,186
<i>It's Yanagishita from Niigata.</i>

124
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:15,988
Niigata?

125
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,428
Ms. Yanagishita!

126
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,197
It's good to hear from you.

127
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,099
How are you?

128
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,872
Remember how you left us money
and a polite hand-written letter?

129
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,341
<i>You didn't need to do that.</i>

130
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,144
Please, you did so much for me.

131
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,847
Are you still working for that tabloid?

132
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,349
I am!

133
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,987
<i>Then I have a favor to ask.</i>

134
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,657
<i>You came to visit</i>
<i>Mr. Watanabe's home, right?</i>

135
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,259
Yes.

136
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:57,997
When I told Mr. Watanabe about you,
he was surprised at first,

137
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,266
but then I just got a call.

138
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,236
<i>He said he wanted to talk</i>
<i>to a </i>Sengoku Weekly<i> reporter.</i>

139
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,444
<i>He said he wants to</i>
<i>meet with you directly.</i>

140
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,349
So would you mind giving him a call
if I give you his number?

141
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,820
I'm sorry, could you hold for one second?

142
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,124
It's the woman I met in Niigata.

143
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:30,196
Apparently, Kubozuka's guardian,
Mr. Watanabe wants to talk.

144
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,531
Is it okay to get his number?

145
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,200
-Do it!
-Of course!

146
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,237
Thank you for waiting.

147
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,940
I'd love to talk to him.

148
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,577
<i>Really? That's great!</i>

149
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,847
<i>I'll let Mr. Watanabe know.</i>

150
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:48,814
Okay.

151
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,317
<i>Do you have something to write with?</i>

152
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,218
One second.

153
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,464
Go ahead.

154
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,885
I'm the guardian who took Kota Kubozuka in

155
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,555
after he was put on house arrest
for assault.

156
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,824
Yes, we are aware.

157
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,628
First, I'd like to know

158
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:42,034
if the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i> would immediately
let the police in on it

159
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,104
if they're contacted by a fugitive?

160
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:47,973
Huh?

161
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,844
Normally, you would, right?
To inform them.

162
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,479
Most people would think that.

163
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:59,552
But would the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i> prioritize
the story over helping the police?

164
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,324
-Um--
-We do.

165
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,161
We have our priorities.

166
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,162
Mr. Kitahama!

167
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,534
We would prioritize the story
over reporting anything to the police.

168
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,239
I see.

169
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,113
If you promise not to report it
right away,

170
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,380
I have a proposal.

171
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,182
You have my word.

172
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:31,617
What is it?

173
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,157
Kota Kubozuka says he's been framed.

174
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,598
But he's a wanted fugitive.

175
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:49,769
He thinks if he's caught by the police
now, they'll surely pin it on him.

176
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,505
I know him well.

177
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,874
He's a good guy.

178
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,976
He might lose his temper and get violent,

179
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,178
but he's not the type of guy
to kill someone.

180
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,248
So you're in contact with Mr. Kubozuka.

181
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,416
Yes. Just over the phone.

182
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:09,655
He was surprised when I told him
a tabloid came looking for me.

183
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,527
Maybe he remembered that,
because I got a call yesterday.

184
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:15,661
What did he say?

185
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:21,433
He asked if the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i>
would listen to his side of the story.

186
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:29,809
Of course.

187
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,444
We'd be honored to handle it.

188
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,015
All the more if he's innocent.

189
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,651
Really?

190
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,587
You won't be arrested for it?

191
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,758
You won't back out for sales?

192
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:47,993
It's okay, right?

193
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,496
Don't worry.

194
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,600
Please leave it to us!

195
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,577
What time and place?

196
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,345
We're flexible.

197
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:10,749
If he wants somewhere private,
we have a reception room at the office.

198
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,685
We could use that.

199
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,221
I'll send in Kubozuka alone.

200
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,121
Okay.

201
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,556
We'll pick him up by car.

202
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,826
Thank you very much.

203
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,529
-Thank you.
-Of course.

204
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,899
Thank you.

205
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,467
Of course!

206
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,173
We got a big one!

207
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,841
-Nice work.
-Thank you both, too.

208
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,943
You sure about dropping Aoshiro's tail?

209
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,979
We got a bigger tip.

210
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,549
You okay, Shinoda?

211
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,919
I'm all out of gas after this.

212
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,021
You were really fired up.

213
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,523
-We're back.
-Okay.

214
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,325
-Good work.
-Good work.

215
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,361
How how did it go with the guardian?

216
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,630
Okay, we're all here.

217
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:58,631
Listen up.

218
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,299
Don't be shocked.

219
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,669
The <i>Sengoku Weekly</i>'s story for next issue

220
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,740
is an exclusive interview
with a wanted fugitive!

221
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,075
-Wow!
-For real?

222
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,010
Great job.

223
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,612
How about you?

224
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:19,485
We talked to a witness who saw someone
resembling Kubozuka.

225
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,422
He said the man was shopping at
a convenience store with a young girl.

226
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:24,890
A young girl?

227
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,860
MADOKA HASHIMOTO

228
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,729
I had the same thought.

229
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,033
I asked the clerk to call me
if they see them again.

230
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,269
That means Madoka Hashimoto
is alive, right?

231
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,370
I hope so.

232
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,974
Okay, okay!

233
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,008
In any case,

234
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,177
let's eat!

235
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,847
Shinoda, Akutsu, could you go
on a food run and get some meals?

236
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,215
-Really?
-Okay.

237
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,017
Thank you, sir!

238
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,087
One more?

239
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:57,923
Thank you!

240
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,591
-We'll be back!
-Later!

241
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,527
-How much?
-Just 15,000 yen!

242
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,362
Seems like too much.

243
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,371
You went to meet Madoka's mother, right?

244
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,974
-Yeah.
-You know what I think?

245
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:19,311
That visit gave her a reason
to call her daughter.

246
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,815
Kubozuka is claiming to be innocent,

247
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,051
and Madoka is staying with him
because she believes him.

248
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,787
I think her mother knew about it.

249
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:34,860
I don't know what happened between mom
and daughter, but I guess they'd call.

250
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,763
But he's a wanted fugitive.

251
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:43,168
She's worried something bad would happen
if she reported them.

252
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,871
She probably didn't know what to do.

253
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,642
And just at that point,
a tabloid reporter showed up.

254
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:56,582
She probably never considered that anyone
would choose not to report it.

255
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,685
Mr. Watanabe said the same.

256
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,654
This is going to sound conceited, but…

257
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,291
a tabloid like us made a breakthrough.

258
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:13,866
It made me feel like we did something
useful for the first time.

259
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:19,972
I was having serious second thoughts
when we were staking out the cemetery.

260
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,508
You too?

261
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,675
I felt the same.

262
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,344
Yeah? I mean, you would right?

263
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,345
Totally.

264
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,814
Like the Philippines?

265
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:30,783
Okay, go with that.

266
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:31,884
We're back.

267
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,685
-Nice.
-We got it.

268
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:34,586
Thanks.

269
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,954
What are you doing?

270
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,859
The <i>Sengoku Weekly</i> will be
launching a camouflage tactic.

271
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:42,928
What's that?

272
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,964
We're setting up a dummy trail
so the <i>Truth Weekly</i>

273
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,534
doesn't find out about our interview
with Kubozuka.

274
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,435
A dummy?

275
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:53,972
If they sense us backing off of Aoshiro,
they'll suspect we have something bigger.

276
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,209
So we thought it's better to mislead them.

277
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,380
Like "Kota Kubozuka Escapes Overseas"
or something.

278
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,383
We're coordinating with locals
to make them believe

279
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,285
Kubozuka has fled overseas.

280
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,387
That's great teamwork.

281
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,957
The question is, who do we say
went overseas?

282
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,526
Someone will have to come
to work in disguise.

283
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,862
Who's good at lying low?

284
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,807
Go have some fun overseas!

285
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,109
You leave tomorrow!

286
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,743
You mean, I'm just pretending, right?

287
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,479
-But be in disguise.
-Really?

288
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,281
-Don't get caught by the <i>Truth</i>.
-I'll try not to.

289
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,950
Your disguise will be comped.

290
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:39,985
Seriously?

291
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,121
-They sell curly wigs at Donki.
-Stop making fun of me.

292
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,155
Is this revenge?

293
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,990
Come on, let's eat!

294
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,458
-Yes, let's!
-Hold on.

295
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,593
Is this decided?

296
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,295
Is it decided?

297
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,031
I don't want to!

298
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,672
<i>The big interview would already come</i>
<i>the following day.</i>

299
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,907

<i>Next thing I knew,</i>
<i>I was a wanted fugitive.</i>

302

<i>If that's what you decided,</i>
<i>you have my support.</i>

304
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,486

305
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,421
Okay!
