1
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,560
Master, you are here.

2
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,280
-Master--
-Is she

3
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,520
the temptress
who lured you to elope with her?

4
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,920
I--

5
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,600
Bear with it!

6
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,120
For the sake of Master and Weining.

7
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,920
I thought it was because
she's exceptionally pretty.

8
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,040
She turns out to be ordinary.

9
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,080
Master, Gu Xiang is not a temptress.

10
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,520
Although she comes
from the Ghost Valley, she--

11
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,920
she is innocent and kind.

12
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,320
She has gone through a lot
together with us in Mount Qingfeng.

13
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,760
Master, you don't know because
you didn't spend time with her.

14
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,000
-But Master Fan does.
-Shut up!

15
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,280
Temptress, you're something.

16
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,200
You can even delude my disciple.

17
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,800
Huaikong knew I would come

18
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,760
and he put in so many good words for you.

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,280
Cao Weining, think twice.

20
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,200
Do you really want to fall
into the evil ways just for this girl?

21
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,120
Master, I've made up my mind.

22
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,480
I once made a vow

23
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,320
that in my whole life,
from now until death,

24
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,800
including every second,

25
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,560
I will never fail Gu Xiang.

26
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,720
Master, you told me
since I was little that we must

27
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,320
honor a promise in good faith.

28
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,200
I can't break
the promise I've made with a girl.

29
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,560
Enough!

30
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,640
You--

31
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,920
you're not willing to fail the girl,

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,160
but you can stand that the sect is turning
into a joke of the martial arts world.

33
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,160
Great.

34
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,960
I've made so much effort to bring you up.

35
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,440
But this is how you repay me!

36
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,880
I know my sins.

37
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,160
I'm unfilial and disloyal!

38
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Master!

39
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
I will uphold justice
with my wife in the future

40
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,720
to mend our ways!

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,760
Master, please show some mercy

42
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,040
and agree to our marriage!

43
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,080
Master.

44
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,360
Master.

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,040
All right.

46
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,240
Do it!

47
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,760
Weining.

48
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,920
Look.

49
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,600
Hasn't this become…

50
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,640
a festive bereavement?

51
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,360
Kill them!

52
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,560
-Go!
-Go!

53
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,280
Why are they hitting the drum again?

54
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,000
I want to buy you a meal.

55
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,520
May I ask

56
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,760
what your name is, miss?

57
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,400
After telling my master,

58
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,960
I'll prepare the dowry

59
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,240
and a proper marriage.

60
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,440
In this life,

61
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,320
if I can't be with you,

62
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,680
I won't be happy anyway.

63
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,960
Don't worry because I won't leave you.

64
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,600
Let's leave the martial arts world.

65
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,000
We can open a dessert shop
or a cosmetics shop.

66
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,800
We can raise cows and a farm.
We can do anything.

67
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
What do you say?

68
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,000
Gu Xiang!

69
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,800
Go and find Prince Qi!

70
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,320
Yu Qiufeng, are you insane?

71
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,680
Have you really

72
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,720
forgotten about me?

73
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,240
Qianqiao!

74
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,400
All of them are fighting
for the Glazed Armor

75
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,440
at the cost of their lives.

76
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,640
But none of them knows

77
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,360
that I've got all the pieces
of the Glazed Armor,

78
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,720
including the key.

79
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,000
Father.

80
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,280
Why are you staring at me?

81
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,880
Don't you believe me?

82
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,280
Since Wen Kexing didn't die,

83
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,840
the body falling from White Deer Cliff

84
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,000
must be fake.

85
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
The key found with the body

86
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,600
must also be fake.

87
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,880
The real key

88
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,600
was given to me by Wen Kexing
in exchange for my cooperation.

89
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,000
All are here.

90
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
This is

91
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
the Glazed Armor that you gave me.

92
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,280
This used

93
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,480
to belong to the Window of Heaven.

94
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,320
Now, Mo Huaiyang
has practically fallen into my hands.

95
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,360
So he'll give me the remaining
three pieces of the Glazed Armor soon.

96
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,520
Father.

97
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,080
The things you've desired
for more than 20 years

98
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,360
fall into my hands…

99
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,880
in just a flash.

100
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,560
There is something

101
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,880
in my heart

102
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,040
and it's called ambition.

103
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,520
While in others' hearts,

104
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,600
it's called illusion.

105
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,880
When it comes to you,

106
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,000
it's called--

107
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
I almost forgot.

108
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,440
You have no heart.

109
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,200
Stop!

110
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,960
Wen Kexing.

111
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,200
One more move

112
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,320
and she's dead!

113
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,880
If you want to save her,

114
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,280
hand over the Glazed Armor
and the key to the armory.

115
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,880
I can give anything to you
as long as you let her go!

116
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,360
She is just a little girl!

117
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,600
"A little girl"?

118
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,240
This temptress is so excellent
in deceiving others

119
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,920
that both my disciple and my junior
have been bewitched by her!

120
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,880
I have no choice but to cleanse my sect!

121
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
You killed them?

122
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,400
Shut up!

123
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,760
This is the true

124
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,440
last war.

125
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,120
Coveting gains ahead

126
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,680
without being aware
of the danger behind it.

127
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,280
But none of them knows

128
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
that I am

129
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,960
the real hunter.

130
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,360
Run!

131
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,320
Where are those things?

132
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,240
Hand them over!

133
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,000
Fine, I'll give them to you.

134
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,200
What's that sound?

135
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,600
What tricks are you playing with me?

136
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,000
Drug Men army?

137
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,000
It's the Drug Men army!

138
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,440
Retreat! Quickly!

139
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,160
Retreat! The Drug Men army is here.

140
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,320
Gu Xiang!

141
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,160
Retreat! Quickly!

142
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,600
Gu Xiang!

143
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,560
I'm going to kill him.

144
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,240
I'm going to kill him!

145
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,360
Gu Xiang.

146
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,080
Master!

147
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,480
I'm going to kill him!

148
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,640
I'm not your master.

149
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,160
I'm your elder brother.

150
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,000
Kexing.

151
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,840
Kill him for me.

152
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,960
I've never begged you for anything.

153
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,640
Kill him for me!

154
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,160
I'll kill him for you.

155
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,080
I'll kill him for you!

156
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,080
Thank--

157
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,160
thank you, Kexing.

158
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,200
Please take good care of yourself.

159
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,160
From now on,

160
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,120
I can't take care of you anymore.

161
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,280
I'm going

162
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,480
to meet Weining, that fool.

163
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,600
Gu Xiang.

164
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,600
Gu Xiang.

165
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,240
Gu Xiang!

166
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,120
Master.

167
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,040
Master!

168
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,240
Master, how are you?

169
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,800
Are you still feeling dizzy or hungry?
Shall I cook for you?

170
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,760
My good master.

171
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,480
I'll be fine after some rest.

172
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,960
Master, you're a bastard.

173
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,960
See? This unruly servant
is bullying her master.

174
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,680
Master,

175
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,720
are you leaving me?

176
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,960
Scorpion King.

177
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,200
How can we be set up by Scorpion King?

178
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,040
Chief Mo, I was entrusted

179
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,200
to see you off!

180
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,240
Damn brat.

181
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,760
I'm sorry, Gu Xiang,

182
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,080
I let him die an easy death.

183
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
Wait for me.

184
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,040
I'm coming to you.

185
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,840
Chief of the Ghost Valley,
it has been a while.

186
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,320
My ally.

187
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,400
You were high-spirited when we last met,

188
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,440
but now,

189
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,440
how did you end up like this?

190
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,880
I'm taking Mo Huaiyang's three pieces

191
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,120
of the Glazed Armor

192
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,760
if you don't mind.

193
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,160
Just take them and get lost.

194
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,880
Don't disturb me
while I'm enjoying the sun.

195
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,400
Your Majesty,

196
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,920
I've admired Chief Wen for a long time.

197
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,440
May I see him off?

198
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,440
For a great figure
such as the chief of the Ghost Valley,

199
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,520
I should do it myself.

200
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,000
Any help from others

201
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,680
would be insulting.

202
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,640
How dare you hurt
someone from the Four Seasons Manor?

203
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,160
Chief Zhou,

204
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,240
you have made

205
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,080
so much progress in your martial arts.

206
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,080
Idiot.

207
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,200
Why are you here?

208
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,680
To die with a lunatic like you.

209
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,000
Chief Zhou. Chief Wen.

210
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,840
Why bother?

211
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,840
Today, no one can walk
out of the Ghost Valley alive.

212
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,960
My children

213
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,160
are everywhere in this valley.

214
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,200
Today, even if I have to die here,

215
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,960
I will drag you down with me.

216
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,480
You two can die together.

217
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,560
Why bother taking me with you?

218
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,520
The netherworld is so boring.

219
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,800
We are both clever men.

220
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,680
Isn't there a second choice?

221
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,480
All right.

222
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,560
You can have the Glazed Armor,

223
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,440
but I'm taking him with me.

224
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,760
Just go then.

225
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,640
How boring.

226
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,120
How boring.

227
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,640
Wen Kexing!

228
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,080
On your body…

229
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,640
there is light.

230
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,120
I want to take a look at it.

231
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,000
Chief.

232
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,800
We've found all the bodies
of the Ten Devils.

233
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,160
None of them were missing.

234
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,480
The three traitors were detained
in the cold pool's jail.

235
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,840
I've killed them.

236
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,000
Tragicomic Ghost, Ghoul, and Beauty Ghost
have all died in the fight.

237
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,200
Beauty Ghost, Liu Qianqiao?

238
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,480
Yes.

239
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,760
-Scorpion King, is there any problem?
-No.

240
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
It's nothing.

241
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,200
Chief, we're still keeping records
of the bodies of those sect leaders,

242
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,080
but we haven't found the bodies
of Mo Huaiyang,

243
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,760
Fan Huaikong, and Mo Weixu
of the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

244
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,600
I've gotten rid of Mo Huaiyang.

245
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,080
His body is outside the valley.

246
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,560
Fan Huaikong was killed by Mo Huaiyang

247
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,960
and Mo Weixu is still missing.

248
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,360
Don't bother with them.

249
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,800
Didn't you hear what Scorpion King said?

250
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,320
Go.

251
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Yes.

252
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,520
I'm so surprised that the Drug Men army

253
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,360
showed such tremendous power
on the first try.

254
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,360
With these amazing troops,

255
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,840
His Highness will find no difficulty
in forging ahead.

256
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,120
Opening the armory
is no doubt a first-class merit,

257
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,400
but the attack on Mount Qingya

258
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,960
has brought great damage
to the martial arts world.

259
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,480
So many people have died.

260
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,240
It'll take 20 to 30 years to recover.

261
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,240
It's great merit too.

262
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,400
Scorpion King.

263
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,560
You and I are perfect partners!

264
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,960
Ever since Evil Bodhisattva
introduced us to each other,

265
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,640
I've enjoyed rapid advances in my career.

266
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,800
How strange.

267
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,720
Many people have died
in the Central Plain.

268
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,040
Why does it matter to you?

269
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,120
Mr. Duan.

270
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,320
You harm others
without benefiting anything from it.

271
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,400
You're happy for nothing.

272
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,360
My lady,

273
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,800
you're still inexperienced.

274
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,520
Since ancient times,
martial artists tend to violate bans.

275
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,800
They always hunger for fame and credit.

276
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,760
His Highness is coming
for this piece of land.

277
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,000
Sooner or later,
these bandits will be taken care of.

278
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,080
This fight is an act of killing two birds
with one stone, isn't it?

279
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,200
Bullshit. Then why did you cooperate
with Zhao Jing before?

280
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,880
Nothing is too deceitful in war.

281
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,880
I don't believe it.

282
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,520
You old men are always up to no good.

283
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,560
All you do are plotting, cheating,
and setting up traps for others.

284
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,960
Aren't you tired?

285
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,480
Master.

286
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,400
It's me, Gu Xiang.

287
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,920
I met Mother and Father.

288
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,600
They would like to thank you.

289
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,200
They want to talk to you.

290
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,680
I'm not feeling well now.

291
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
Maybe another day.

292
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,560
Have a cup of tea then.

293
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,680
I'm so tired.

294
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,040
Get out.

295
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,080
All right.

296
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm leaving then.

297
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,120
Kexing.

298
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,160
Please.

299
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,120
Take good care of yourself.

300
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,680
Gu Xiang!

301
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,280
Gu Xiang!

302
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,720
Gu Xiang!

303
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,560
Prince Qi.

304
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,440
Great Shaman.

305
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,760
Zishu.

306
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,960
Thank you for your help

307
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,600
in getting them out.

308
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
You're so thoughtful.

309
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,560
It's beautiful here.

310
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,240
Master, Prince Qi asked me just now

311
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,280
what to write
on Weining and Gu Xiang's tombstones.

312
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,680
Yes.

313
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,800
Since they haven't held
the wedding ceremony,

314
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,040
Ms. Gu Xiang is still a girl.

315
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,960
I don't know whether we should write

316
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,680
her name or Lady Cao on it.

317
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,280
It should be Lady Cao.

318
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,840
Gu Xiang would like that.

319
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,400
Master, is Master Wen still unconscious?

320
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,320
I used the Drunk Like a Dream on him.

321
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,920
I don't know how to face him.

322
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,920
Chengling.

323
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,040
I hope you

324
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,800
take good care of Master Wen.

325
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
Can you do that?

326
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,280
Master, where are you going?

327
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,600
I thought I could settle down,

328
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,480
but maybe roaming all over the world

329
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,320
is my destiny.

330
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,600
Lord Zhou.

331
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,120
You've pulled out
all those nails in your body?

332
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,400
Zishu.

333
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,960
How could you do that to yourself?

334
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,080
You--

335
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,480
When did you do it?

336
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,240
Before the Heroes Conference,

337
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,280
I have to recover all my power

338
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,040
to avenge him.

339
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,120
I must do one last thing.

340
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,720
I have to stop Prince Jin
from opening the armory.

341
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,200
I don't have much time.

342
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,320
What do you mean?

343
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,800
Master, it can't be--

344
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,240
Wu Xi, is there any other way?

345
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,920
Look at Zishu.

346
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,400
He is still in high spirits!

347
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,880
Will any treatment work for him now?

348
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,800
Mr. Wen--

349
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,640
For Mr. Wen's injury,
we can find Master Ye.

350
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,880
He is a peerless master.

351
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,520
With the help of his martial arts skills

352
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,560
-and Wu Xi's medical treatment--
-It's too late.

353
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,680
I've taken the elixir from Nanjiang.

354
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,240
We can refine another one.

355
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,000
I'll give my all to find
the rare and valuable ingredients.

356
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,000
Zishu.

357
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,960
There must be a way.

358
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,480
Beiyuan.

359
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,360
It's too late.

360
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
Even if the chief
of the Healer Valley is alive…

361
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,520
we've done everything we could.

362
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,120
Now that my days are numbered,

363
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,120
don't bother getting anything
beyond our reach.

364
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,440
The Healer Valley.

365
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,560
And the Yin Yang Book.

366
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,440
Master, there must be a way!

367
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,320
It's life for a life, right?

368
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,520
I can exchange my life for you!

369
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,880
Master, let's look
for the Yin Yang Book now!

370
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,080
Idiot.

371
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,440
With your thoughts for me,

372
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,960
I'm already content.

373
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,080
Be good.
