00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,680
FOUR SEASONS MANOR

2
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,880
Our manor

3
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,360
has splendid views all year round.

4
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,680
Each season has its own characteristics.

5
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,240
In spring,
there's a sea of Indian azaleas.

6
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,000
In summer, royal Poinciana blossoms.

7
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,479
In autumn, sweet Osmanthus
spreads a pleasant aroma.

8
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,520
In winter, plum blossoms
bloom in the snow.

9
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,280
Four Seasons Manor is full
of exotic flowers and plants.

10
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,280
What a pleasant view!

11
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,040
A rabbit!

12
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,520
Call me "Nice Mr. Wen" three times

13
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,400
and I'll catch it for you.

14
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,120
How about calling you "Nice Master Wen"?

15
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,120
You two, stop being naughty.

16
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,320
The rabbits in this mountain

17
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,360
are probably the offspring of the brood

18
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,880
your grand master's wife kept.

19
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,560
Spare their sons and grandsons

20
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,920
for her sake.

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,720
She had the same hobby as my mother.

22
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,080
They both liked raising animals.

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,840
Yes.

24
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,200
Your grand master's wife
and Mrs. Bi were the kindest.

25
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,440
Whenever there are wounded animals
on the mountain,

26
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,760
they will heal them
and raise them on the mountain.

27
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,720
If anyone dares to hunt them down to eat

28
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,000
was discovered by Grand Master's wife,
he would be in trouble.

29
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,840
Master and Mr. Zhang had a bet once.

30
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,400
They caught a deer to go with wine.

31
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,640
I couldn't bear to see that,
so I told her.

32
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,800
She chased your grand master

33
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,440
all over the mountain to beat him.

34
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
So was my father.

35
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,840
He was an imposing figure in public.

36
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,000
But in private, he was often chased
and beaten by my mother as well.

37
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,800
-We're almost there. Let's go.
-Let's go.

38
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,360
Look.

39
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,960
That cliff inscription…

40
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,480
LINGERING

41
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,080
…was engraved by my master

42
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,520
on my junior Qin Jiuxiao's
one-month-old dinner party.

43
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,000
LINGERING

44
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,480
FOUR SEASONS MANOR

45
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,960
Master.

46
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,600
I'm back.

47
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,560
FOUR SEASONS MANOR

48
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,160
FOUR SEASONS MANOR

49
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,400
GENTLE WINDS AND LIGHT CLOUDS

50
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,680
GENTLE WINDS AND LIGHT CLOUDS

51
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,960
It wasn't like this before.

52
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,320
It must be because this yard
has been empty for a long time.

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's why it's desolate.

54
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,120
It's all right.

55
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,920
It'll be fine after we tidy it up.

56
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,760
Yes, clean it up and it'll be fine.

57
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,480
If no one lives here,
it'll be desolate for sure.

58
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,840
We are back here now.

59
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,760
Right?

60
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,800
What can a dumb disciple
like you can do? Speak!

61
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,480
Master, don't worry.

62
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,640
I'm here. I'll do the cleaning.

63
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,200
Mr. Wen and I

64
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
will make this place nice and tidy.

65
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,640
You're good at dragging others
into your errand.

66
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,360
It's all right.

67
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,800
I'll show you around first.

68
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,800
We should buy some groceries
down the mountain

69
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,920
before cleaning properly.

70
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,240
All right.

71
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,760
Chengling, look.

72
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,920
GENTLE WINDS AND LIGHT CLOUDS

73
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,200
Chengling,

74
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,480
don't underestimate every single one
of the stones or the trees.

75
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,920
They were arranged intentionally.

76
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,840
Outside the yard,
there is a 28-constellation array.

77
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,720
If our enemies intrude,

78
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,760
we can keep them outside by staying here.

79
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,440
These were designed by Master Long.

80
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
Don't touch it!

81
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,880
These mechanisms haven't been
maintained for years.

82
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,920
They're probably rusty.

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,440
I'll show you once they're repaired.

84
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,560
This is the conference room.

85
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,080
When I was a kid,

86
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,360
Master always sat there
and checked our homework.

87
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
During festivals,

88
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,720
everyone would gather around the stove

89
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,320
and stay up all night.

90
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,120
"Spring is constant in all four seasons,

91
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,800
knowing everything in the world."

92
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,040
Master,

93
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,840
was this drawn by Grand Master too?

94
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,560
Ah Xu.

95
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,120
Yes.

96
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,320
There are 81 plum blossoms here,

97
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,640
representing 81

98
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Four Seasons Manor members
of our generation.

99
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,600
In the end,

100
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,440
they were all ruined by my hands.

101
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,560
Ah Xiang, are you hungry?

102
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,520
Should we stop and get something to eat?

103
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,040
I have no appetite.

104
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,880
No appetite?

105
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,600
Then I'll make you
some sour and spicy dishes

106
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,600
to stimulate your appetite.

107
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,560
All you know is eating.

108
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,760
You're so annoying!

109
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,880
Ah Xiang, where are you going?

110
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,360
To find somewhere quiet.

111
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,280
What about me?

112
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,040
They all say

113
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,520
girls like boys to be honest
about their feelings.

114
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,400
But why has she stopped treating me nicely

115
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,400
ever since I confessed to her?

116
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,440
Did I say it too abruptly?

117
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,520
Idiot Cao.

118
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,560
It's good to be an idiot
who knows nothing.

119
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,680
Stop!

120
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,640
-He is so ruthless.
-Yes.

121
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,880
Zhu Yaozhi,

122
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,640
I know you've been blinded by Gao Chong.

123
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,840
Given your loyalty and faithfulness,
I won't give you a hard time.

124
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,240
But if you're still so obsessed
with protecting your demon master,

125
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,720
I'll regard you as a traitor.

126
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,520
My master is not a demon!

127
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,880
He was framed by others.

128
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,000
How could he collude
with the Ghost Valley?

129
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,480
There is solid proof.
How dare you quibble?

130
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,040
Someone saw the chief
of the Ghost Valley, Wen Kexing,

131
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,920
helping Gao Chong defend the enemy
in public at the Heroes Conference

132
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,520
and took away
the orphan of the Zhang family.

133
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,520
Nonsense!

134
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,280
Mr. Wen is Chengling's life savior.

135
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,920
He saved Chengling

136
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,040
and escorted him to Tai Lake.

137
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,760
He's less than 30 years old.

138
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
How can he be
the chief of the Ghost Valley?

139
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,520
That demon knows all types of evil magic,

140
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,040
he sure knows how to stay young.

141
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,520
What's so strange about that?

142
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,400
The Mirror Lake Sword Sect was destroyed
by Wen Kexing and his minions.

143
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,120
Then he pretended to be a savior
and joined the Five Lakes Alliance.

144
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,360
How arrogant!

145
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,200
Gao Chong and Demon Wen

146
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,760
colluded together.

147
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,000
They could fool people just for some time,

148
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,360
but not forever!

149
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,160
Chief Zhao has given an order to paint

150
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,320
the appearances
of all Ten Devils of Wen Kexing

151
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,000
to show the martial arts world.

152
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,840
Was Master's identity exposed?

153
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,720
Zhu Yaozhi, you're young and ignorant.

154
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,680
If you can say Gao Chong was a big demon
who fooled the world for fame,

155
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,800
you can still be a good friend
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

156
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,680
If you still defend that demon,

157
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,360
Chief Zhao won't blame me

158
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,760
even if I kill you.

159
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,920
No way!

160
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,400
Repeat what I say.

161
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,920
"Gao Chong was a demon
who fooled the world for fame.

162
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,160
He will never live another life!

163
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,800
He will rot in hell forever and ever!"

164
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,240
If you insult my master again,

165
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,360
I will fight you with my life!

166
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,080
I'll kill you, little demon brat!

167
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,160
Stop!

168
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,760
Hero Shen.

169
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,000
Master Shen.

170
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,040
Master Shen.

171
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Who dares to hurt Yaozhi?

172
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,360
My goodness!

173
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,280
This fool is finally useful for once.

174
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,960
HONESTY AND WEALTH

175
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
This is good.

176
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,600
Ah Xiang, you're back.

177
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,880
Why are you still standing here?

178
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm waiting for you.

179
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,040
I'm worried that
if you don't see me when you're back,

180
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,280
you'll be worried.

181
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,400
Let's go.

182
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,840
Don't waste any time in this town.

183
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,960
We're not eating anything first?

184
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,800
Can't we continue our trip first?

185
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,720
I'll cook when we're back
in the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

186
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,280
-You can eat as much as you can.
-All right.

187
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,080
PAWN SHOP

188
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,560
Cao Weining,

189
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,800
are you really going to marry me?

190
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,160
Absolutely!

191
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,320
Ah Xiang, why are you still
asking me this question?

192
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,160
I've already sworn to Mr. Wen.

193
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,160
What if your master doesn't like me?

194
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,320
That won't happen.
He will surely like you.

195
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,520
You're such a nice girl.

196
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,480
If he dislikes me

197
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,960
because I'm a wild orphan,

198
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,080
what should I do?

199
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,880
That won't happen.
Master Fan has the softest heart.

200
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,280
If Master Mo doesn't agree,

201
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
I will beg Master Fan.

202
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,320
That's not what I'm talking about.

203
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,280
Cao Weining,

204
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,640
what would you do
if neither of them allows you to marry me?

205
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,280
Then kidnap me. We'll elope.

206
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,840
Who will kidnap you?

207
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,960
I won't do it even if you beg me.

208
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,080
I said it wrong.
I'll abduct and traffic you.

209
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,560
-Why is he holding her hand?
-Yes.

210
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,160
-Did she agree to it?
-Yes.

211
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,520
-What is this?
-What is their relationship?

212
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,880
Whatever you say,

213
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,120
I'll stay with you.

214
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,400
Ah Xiang, in this life,

215
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,880
if I can't be with you,

216
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,800
I won't be happy anyway.

217
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,600
Nothing could stop me.

218
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,160
Moreover, they won't stop me at all.

219
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,400
I'm sure Master Fan will like you.

220
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,360
Let's go.

221
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,760
It won't work.
The truth will reveal itself eventually.

222
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,800
One day, you'll know who I am.

223
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,840
But…

224
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,800
But…

225
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,960
There is no time

226
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,000
more important than
time spent with our loved ones.

227
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,840
One day of staying together means a lot.

228
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,400
One more day of that is your fortune.

229
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,320
As for other things,

230
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
you will just ignore them.

231
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,560
Mr. Wen, what's in the package?

232
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,880
Why is it so heavy?

233
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,400
It's wine for your master.

234
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,320
-Give it to me.
-It's all right, Mr. Wen.

235
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,680
I'll take it as practice.

236
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,000
LINGERING

237
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,760
Mr. Wen, Master said that

238
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,520
in the end, Four Seasons Manor

239
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,800
was all ruined by his hands.

240
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,800
He told you to stop asking about this.

241
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,280
That's why I'm asking you.

242
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,200
Mr. Wen, please tell me.

243
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,840
I feel bad to see Master so sad.

244
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,360
Whatever had happened

245
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,800
is his privacy

246
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,800
or his deepest pain.

247
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,120
He's either not ready to tell us,

248
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,240
or he doesn't want to mention it.

249
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,320
I hope you don't push him.

250
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,160
I understand.

251
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,720
Mr. Wen, you and Master
are very much in sync.

252
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,240
He told me the same thing before.

253
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,280
He said that a gentleman doesn't pry
into other people's weaknesses.

254
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,320
He told me never…

255
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,880
Never to ask about Hero Wen and his wife,

256
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,040
your parents.

257
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,160
I didn't mean to.

258
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,080
Master Wen, please forgive me.

259
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,280
What did you call me?

260
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,160
I am supposed to call you that.

261
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,720
Why do we have to solve riddles
instead of clearing things up?

262
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,480
Master said this a long time ago.

263
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,920
No matter what you think,
he treats you as his junior.

264
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,280
But he also instructed me

265
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,960
not to call you that

266
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,960
before you're willing to return
to the sect

267
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,680
without any pressure.

268
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,640
See, you two have a tacit understanding.

269
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,440
Why are you beating around the bush?

270
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,000
Master Wen.

271
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,800
LINGERING

272
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,680
FOUR SEASONS MANOR

273
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,520
Chief, Wen Ruyu bit his own tongue
and committed suicide.

274
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
We lost the trace of the key again.

275
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Father.

276
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,600
Mother.

277
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,840
Kill him!

278
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,080
Kill me. I don't want to live anymore.

279
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,560
Just kill me!

280
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,960
Why don't you kill me?

281
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,840
Just tell me,

282
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,720
did you see your parents

283
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,520
with a key?

284
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,680
I don't want to live.

285
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,080
Just kill me.

286
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,000
I will turn into the fiercest ghost

287
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,440
and hunt all of you down!

288
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,920
Chief,

289
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,760
this kid has such a weird personality

290
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,720
at such a young age.

291
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,080
He was born to be a little ghost.

292
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,400
What about giving him what he wants?

293
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,440
Sure. Let's grant his wish.

294
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,960
Kid,

295
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,280
now that you're here in the Ghost Valley,

296
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,200
you have to admit your fate.

297
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,760
Your father was a good doctor.

298
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,480
It's such a pity

299
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,080
that I failed to save him.

300
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,880
Luckily, I saved you.

301
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Drink this

302
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,560
and you'll forget everything.

303
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,600
I can't forget.

304
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
My junior.

305
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,720
Sit straight.

306
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,720
That's enough, Lao Wen.

307
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,680
Don't move.

308
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,600
That's enough, Lao Wen.

309
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,240
I've survived tonight.

310
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,560
Don't consume your internal force.

311
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,120
You've survived tonight.

312
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,680
What about tomorrow night?

313
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,960
We'll discuss it then.

314
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,040
With these seven nails in me,

315
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,520
they give me a hard time every night.

316
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,120
It's just that
sometimes the pain is fierce,

317
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,080
while sometimes it's mild.

318
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,160
What's wrong with Ye Baiyi?

319
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,400
He's so slow like a 1,000-year-old turtle,

320
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,600
which crawls so slowly.

321
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,240
Why is there still no news?

322
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Philanthropist Wen.

323
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,120
He is so kind to help us,

324
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,560
but you curse him behind his back.

325
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,120
I'll say the same in front of him.

326
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,200
This Old Monster is so unreliable.

327
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,880
You're the one without conscience.

328
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,720
It's said that those with thin lips
are heartless and ungrateful.

329
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
I think it's pretty accurate.

330
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,600
They say

331
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,400
I am the soberest person
with the least feeling in this world.

332
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,240
Ah Xu,

333
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,040
you kept calling your junior

334
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,520
in your dream.

335
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,840
What did you dream about?

336
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,600
If you don't want to tell me,
just forget it.

337
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
Lao Wen,

338
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,400
there's nothing between us

339
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,920
that we can't discuss.

340
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,560
My lord,

341
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,240
if you want me to fight for justice

342
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,800
or the Four Seasons Manor,

343
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,160
I will follow your orders immediately.

344
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,960
But if you want me to harm
the loyal and the good,

345
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,880
I can't do that.

346
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,440
Zishu, Officer Jiang has resigned
and returned to his hometown.

347
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,240
Why doesn't the king just let him go?

348
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,400
He's such a nice man.

349
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,560
Zishu, for the sake of Xiaoxue,

350
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,760
please plead with the king!

351
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,720
You're the one who adores
Xiaoxue the most, right?

352
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,520
Jiuxiao.

353
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,360
For imperial court matters,

354
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,680
it can't be simply judged
by a person's virtue.

355
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,760
If the king wants him to die,

356
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,080
he must die.

357
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,080
No reason is needed.

358
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,360
The three of us
owe Officer Jiang a big favor.

359
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
We don't know anything
about the imperial court.

360
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,840
We are not capable of that.

361
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,840
But people in the martial arts world

362
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,400
know how to be grateful.

363
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,760
After we say goodbye to you,

364
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,280
we will catch up with Officer Jiang

365
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,920
and escort him out of the Northwest.

366
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,760
If Duan Pengju still wants
to kill Officer Jiang,

367
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,760
he has to do that over our dead bodies.

368
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,760
You are overestimating yourself.

369
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,360
Even if it's impossible,

370
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,640
we will do it!

371
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,920
I, Luo Hao, would rather die
to repay my gratitude

372
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,240
than live as a lowlife!

373
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,800
Zishu.

374
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,240
All right,

375
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,880
I'll go with you.

376
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,840
Get up, all of you.

377
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,840
Let's finish this wine

378
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,160
and go for Officer Jiang together.

379
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,120
All right.

380
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,560
My lord, you're back at last!

381
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,800
He was going to save Officer Jiang
by risking his life,

382
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,080
so I let him drink

383
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
the wine mixed with Drunk Like a Dream.

384
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,360
He was asleep for five days and nights.

385
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,200
When he woke up,

386
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,520
there was nothing he could do.

387
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,960
He hated me so much

388
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,320
that he left without saying goodbye.

389
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,800
The last time I met him,

390
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,240
he was already in his coffin.

391
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,040
He mistakenly thought that
I was trapped in a town alone,

392
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,320
so he risked his life to save me.

393
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,120
Eventually, he fought to his death
in that town.

394
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,480
His loved one went through
all kinds of difficulties

395
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,360
to deliver his body to me.

396
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,240
I didn't know the relationship
between that girl

397
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,800
and Jiuxiao.

398
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,920
When I finally found out,

399
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,040
I had already forced that girl

400
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,720
to take the poison
which would kill her immediately.

401
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,920
If another world exists,

402
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,960
I'm sure they must be gathering together

403
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,920
cursing me, the evil senior.

404
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,120
They won't curse you.

405
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,320
They…

406
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,560
They understand you.

407
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,000
You're wrong.

408
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,320
The reason why they died tragically

409
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,000
is that they didn't know me at all.

410
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,440
Jiuxiao admired me

411
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,720
ever since childhood.

412
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Master also

413
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,880
treated me like his own son.

414
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,520
Everyone in the Manor, old or young,

415
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,360
regarded me as their family and senior.

416
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,560
They respected me and loved me.

417
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,920
That's what blinded them.

418
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,840
They didn't know that the real Zhou Zishu

419
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,040
is actually a coward and a deserter.

420
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,240
Ah Xu.

421
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,120
Please sit down.

422
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,200
Master passed away
due to an acute disease.

423
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,960
Before he passed away,

424
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,200
he entrusted the Four Seasons Manor to me.

425
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,280
I, a young lord,

426
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,760
wasn't strong enough.

427
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,320
Both good and evil people

428
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,160
kept making trouble for us.

429
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,360
I struggled for two years

430
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,200
and saw one senior after another

431
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,600
die to protect the Four Seasons Manor.

432
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,160
I couldn't do it anymore.

433
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,160
So I ran away.

434
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,960
Stop blaming yourself like this.

435
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,280
What happened next?

436
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,520
I did run away.

437
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,600
No.

438
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,800
You must have your reasons.

439
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,440
Reasons…

440
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,120
Reasons are no more than excuses
in a nice disguise.

441
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,720
My father

442
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,480
was the former Prince Jin's
capable assistant.

443
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,640
The current Prince Jin at that time

444
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,840
was my cousin.

445
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,240
He was worried that
there was no one he could trust,

446
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,360
so he wrote me a letter
to ask me to help him.

447
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,240
Your Highness.

448
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,880
What's that about? Call me cousin.

449
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,440
My cousin, what's wrong with you?

450
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,960
You look bad.

451
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,480
Is His Majesty in good health?

452
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,000
It's our teacher.

453
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,520
He's gone.

454
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,200
Our teacher was in his prime time.
How could this happen?

455
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,360
My father listened to slanderous talks

456
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,760
and threw our teacher in jail
and tortured him.

457
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,840
Our teacher wouldn't surrender

458
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,640
to things he didn't do.

459
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,400
So he committed suicide in jail.

460
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,760
Do you know

461
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,880
what our teacher did
before he killed himself?

462
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,400
He wrote poems all over the walls
and floors in desperation.

463
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,320
Rivers flow ceaselessly

464
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,120
The window leads to the netherworld

465
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,880
Rumors endanger justice

466
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,400
Clouds hide the sun

467
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,720
I looked at the bloody letters
all over the walls and the floors.

468
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,920
What world is this?

469
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,800
Our teacher served his country
and the people well for his whole life.

470
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,240
My cousin, don't be too upset.

471
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,720
In the future, we will--

472
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
My father…

473
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,680
He was so angry.

474
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,680
He even dumped our teacher's body
in the wild

475
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,160
and sent guards so that no one
could collect and bury him properly.

476
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,680
He just let stray dogs
consume our teacher's body!

477
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,440
I'm useless.

478
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,080
I'm useless!

479
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,240
It's me!

480
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,760
I couldn't even let our teacher
rest in peace.

481
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,280
My cousin, please rest assured.

482
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,680
I will take our teacher's body back
in secret

483
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,880
and bury him properly.

484
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,320
Good.

485
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,120
Zishu,

486
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,280
when can you come here and help me?

487
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,720
So I led all of our brothers

488
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,520
of the Four Seasons Manor

489
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,920
to be Prince Jin's ally.

490
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,480
I didn't expect

491
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,320
that I was just fooling myself.

492
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,200
Once we got stuck
in the mud of power and desire,

493
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,520
there was no easy way out.

494
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,960
I watched my brothers

495
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,160
die in front of me one by one.

496
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,280
In the end,

497
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,840
even Jiuxiao died.

498
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,080
After Jiuxiao's death,

499
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,000
there was nothing for me to live for.

500
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,920
Then,

501
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,200
guess what,

502
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,960
I ran away again.

503
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,640
In the end,

504
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,160
all I have left are these seven nails.

505
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,840
The ones I wanted to protect

506
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,840
and the business I wanted to establish

507
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,160
were all gone no matter how hard I tried,

508
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,640
just like sand

509
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,280
in the hand.

510
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,360
Luckily,

511
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,040
God was merciful.

512
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,160
He offered me a chance to start over.

513
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,800
The succession is not over yet.

514
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,840
I just don't know

515
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,960
if I can watch this child

516
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,080
grow up to be a capable man.

517
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,760
Why can't you?

518
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,320
Ye Baiyi has promised me.

519
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,800
That Old Monster has
a broad range of knowledge.

520
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,239
If he says you can be cured, you can.

521
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:19,639
Nothing will happen for sure
in this world.

522
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,040
I don't care.

523
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,080
This must happen.

524
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,639
No matter how this ends,

525
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,600
I want to tell you

526
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,719
I'm really happy

527
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,719
that you can come back with me.

528
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,760
My junior.

529
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,880
It's almost dawn.

530
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,639
You should rest.

531
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,040
I'm going out for some fresh air.

532
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,639
Lao Wen,

533
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,200
you and my master

534
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,680
are master-and-disciple in name only.

535
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,120
If you don't want to acknowledge
the Four Seasons Manor as your school,

536
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,920
I'm in no place to force you.

537
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,160
The son of the Wen couple

538
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,320
is back at the Four Seasons Manor again.

539
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,080
If Master knows this in the netherworld,

540
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,520
he will be beyond happy.

541
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,640
FOUR SEASONS MANOR

542
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,640
Master, you're awake?

543
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,840
Did I wake you because of me sweeping?

544
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,240
It doesn't matter.

545
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,920
What time is it?

546
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,080
How could I have such a sound sleep?

547
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
It's almost noon.

548
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
Mr. Wen said that
you didn't sleep well last night.

549
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,040
He told me not to wake you up
so you can sleep longer.

550
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,720
Where is he?

551
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,880
Master Wen.

552
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,600
Ah Xu, you're awake.

553
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,600
I've examined it closely.

554
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,640
This painting is not severely damaged.

555
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,240
It only needs re-mounting.

556
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,920
I'm almost done repairing it.

557
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,440
I just need to repaint the colors.

558
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,680
After re-mounting,

559
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,680
the paint won't be damaged from rolling.

560
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,680
I'll find an expert in painting
down the mountain

561
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,200
and ask him to fill the color
according to your master's style.

562
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,360
It will be the same as the original.

563
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,920
PING'AN SILVER MANOR

564
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,840
Master, take care.

565
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,000
When will my letter reach Kun?

566
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,040
Master, rest assured.

567
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,120
You're an honorable guest with the token.
No one dares to delay your business.

568
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
Our carrier pigeons are well-trained.

569
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,200
They will deliver your letter to Kun
within two days.

570
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,440
-Good. You may go.
-All right, take care.

571
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,720
This demon Wen Kexing

572
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,360
looks about the same age as us.

573
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,520
How could he become
the chief of the Ghost Valley?

574
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
You have no idea.

575
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,680
There are so many magic tricks
in the Ghost Valley to stay young.

576
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,920
Though Wen Kexing looks young
in the painting,

577
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,800
he may be 70 years old!

578
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,360
-Yes.
-He relies on magic tricks

579
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,840
to keep his young appearance!

580
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,400
What's the name
of the chief of the Ghost Valley

581
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,760
that you were talking about?

582
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,160
Who are you? Can't you speak properly?

583
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,920
You came and asked questions.

584
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,800
-Do you have any manners?
-Where are you from?

585
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,920
What's your relationship with Demon Wen?

586
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,960
Who allowed you to spread rumors?

587
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,760
We're not spreading rumors.

588
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,040
The Five Lakes Alliance
has already sent every sect

589
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,080
pictures of important figures
from the Ghost Valley.

590
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
-That's right.
-If you don't believe me,

591
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,160
see it for yourself.
