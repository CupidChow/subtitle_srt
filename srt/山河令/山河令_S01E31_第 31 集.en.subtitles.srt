1
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,920
Your Majesty.

2
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,320
The two ghosts have waited
for a long time outside.

3
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,360
Should I bring them in?

4
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,440
Your Majesty.

5
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,720
How many casualties are there?

6
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,040
Forty-seven died this time.

7
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,920
-The wounded are three--
-Enough!

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,960
Although our plans failed

9
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,840
and we didn't achieve anything,

10
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,880
we had put in our efforts.

11
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,920
Qianqiao.

12
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,640
Grant them this month's antidotes.

13
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,440
Yes, sir.

14
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,320
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

15
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

16
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,200
Master.

17
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
Hurry up!

18
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,640
Hurry up!

19
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,000
Your Majesty, look who I've brought you.

20
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,760
Antidote!

21
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,480
Where's mine?

22
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,440
Gu Xiang!

23
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,600
Gu Xiang!

24
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
Xiang'er!

25
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,880
Your Majesty.

26
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,160
Gu Xiang is just a small servant
in the Ghost Valley.

27
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,160
Why are you doing this?

28
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,160
Your Majesty.

29
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,960
This girl is the only person
whom the Lunatic Wen trusts.

30
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,080
We can definitely find out

31
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,680
Lunatic Wen's whereabouts from her.

32
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,880
We're in no hurry.

33
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,440
Qianqiao.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
-Yes.
-Untie Ms. Amethyst Fiend.

35
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,400
I shall have a good talk with her.

36
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,560
Chief Mo.

37
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,200
Do you still remember

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,800
the motto of the Gentle Wind Sword Sect?

39
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,880
"A man lives when his sword is intact.

40
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,960
A man dies when his sword breaks.

41
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,880
Be righteous

42
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,000
and demolish demons."

43
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,040
You still remember.

44
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,160
Then do you remember
one of the rules of our sect?

45
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,680
"A disciple of the Gentle Wind Sect
shall not be associated with demons."

46
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,000
Today, you have to explain yourself
in front of the portrait of our master.

47
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,160
Why did you do that today?

48
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,840
I allied with the chief
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

49
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,200
He is not a demon.

50
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,640
He chose to work with the enemy

51
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,040
by using the Scorpion Sect

52
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,640
and taming the evil ghosts
of the Ghost Valley.

53
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
I can't control what they do.

54
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,520
Chief Mo.

55
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,280
Do you want me to explain

56
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280
to our disciples using these excuses?

57
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,440
Chief Gao's death is a mystery.

58
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,560
It's very suspicious.

59
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,280
It must be Zhao Jing!

60
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,480
Chief Gao

61
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,120
handed you the Glazed Armor,
which he cherished more than his life.

62
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,080
But you--

63
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,520
Firstly,

64
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,880
I didn't hand the Glazed Armor to anyone.

65
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,920
Secondly,

66
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,760
in such a dangerous situation today,

67
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,120
could you resolve it

68
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,240
without my association with Zhao Jing?

69
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,520
As a leader,

70
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,400
my priority is

71
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,000
to maintain the legacy of our sect.

72
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,040
I'm not guilty of anything.

73
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,200
Even if one day,
we are forced into a corner

74
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
and that's the only way
to rescue the whole sect,

75
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,080
I don't mind

76
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,600
losing my reputation.

77
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,560
I would rather die
than act against the principles.

78
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Back then,

79
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,600
everyone accused Chief Gao
of associating with the Ghost Valley

80
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,960
and killing his brothers.

81
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,680
Looking at it now,

82
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,760
Zhao Jing is the one
who's working with Ghost Valley!

83
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,720
Enough!

84
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,800
Do you think I'm too stupid or too cruel?

85
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,840
I'm acting along with Zhao Jing.

86
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,720
I have my own plans.

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,360
Huaiyang, what are you planning to do?

88
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,120
Only if I become the supreme leader
of the martial arts world

89
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,520
in the upcoming Heroes Conference

90
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,760
and lead all heroes
to exterminate the Ghost Valley,

91
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,480
will I have the right
to take control then.

92
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,360
Mr. Gao died tragically.

93
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,800
I must carry his burden.

94
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,880
But what can these pieces of glass do?

95
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,400
If you trust me,

96
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,280
follow my lead.

97
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,120
I trust you, Huaiyang.

98
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,880
I--

99
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,440
I know you didn't do it.

100
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,400
Previously,

101
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,960
I misunderstood you.

102
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,400
Open the door.

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,960
Forgive me.

104
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,480
My lord, we're late.

105
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,240
Xingming?

106
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,400
Be careful! Protect our lord!

107
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,320
As the chief of the Window of Heaven,

108
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,080
you were once powerful
and ruled over people's lives.

109
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,440
But in the end,
you're saved by some juniors

110
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,960
and have to flee for your life.

111
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,360
Without the prince's support,

112
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,800
who do you think you are?

113
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,440
You!

114
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,560
What's your name again?

115
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,200
You're a disciple of Old Bi. Am I right?

116
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm Bi Xingming.

117
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
Old Bi is stupid enough.

118
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,160
I didn't expect that his disciple

119
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,320
would be more stupid.

120
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,240
Do you think you can steal away

121
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,200
such an important criminal
out of the heavily guarded prison?

122
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,120
Absolutely idiotic!

123
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,520
You're the disciples
of the old Window of Heaven.

124
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,800
Each of you is being monitored
by a few spies.

125
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,120
I knew from the start that you planned
to break into jail for him.

126
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,880
But you sensed nothing.

127
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,000
Did your dead masters

128
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,520
know how stupid you are?

129
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,240
-But I must thank you.
-You--

130
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,400
You brought Lord Zhou out.

131
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,160
Anything could happen in combat.

132
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,320
When I was chasing after the fugitive,

133
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,800
I killed him by accident.

134
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,680
This is not violating
the prince's command, right?

135
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,320
I'm not stupid!

136
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
My lord.

137
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,040
I, the disciple of Cheng Xiu, Cheng Zichen

138
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,200
am willing to sacrifice myself
today to protect you!

139
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,320
I shall make your wish come true then.

140
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,520
What are you waiting for?

141
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,120
Leave with them.

142
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,400
Retreat with the brothers first.

143
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,320
Yes.

144
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,840
My brothers! Let's go!

145
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,560
Who are you, sir?

146
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,160
I'm Wen.

147
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,360
Wen Kexing.

148
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,720
The chief of the Ghost Valley?

149
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,880
This was supposed to be a secret.

150
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,080
You're putting me in an awkward situation
by saying it out loud.

151
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,760
Chief Wen, you're here at the right time.

152
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,560
Even if you didn't come,

153
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,520
I intend to visit the Ghost Valley

154
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,520
to ask you for one thing.

155
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,720
Did I mishear you?

156
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,000
I didn't kill you,

157
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,920
yet you dare to ask things from me?

158
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,600
Chief Wen, stop pretending.

159
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,080
You've been too self-centered
for too long,

160
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,920
not knowing any better about this world.

161
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,440
How dare you snatch
this criminal from Jin all by yourself!

162
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,320
You've underestimated
the Window of Heaven!

163
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,120
You've revealed yourself.

164
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,080
My army will be here in no time.

165
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,120
Even if you're excellent at martial arts,

166
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,560
you're all alone.

167
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,640
Who said that he's alone?

168
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Where is Chengling?

169
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
I've escorted him to a safe place.
Don't worry.

170
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,200
In this case,

171
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,320
we brothers

172
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,320
can give it a go.

173
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,080
Wen Kexing! What are you trying to do?

174
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,040
You've called me Chief.

175
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,760
As the chief of 3,000 ghosts,

176
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,560
would I come here alone

177
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,080
to save him?

178
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,600
Kill them!

179
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,880
-Retreat!
-Hurry up! Retreat!

180
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,800
Retreat!

181
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,160
-Chief!
-Chief!

182
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,600
Greetings, my lord. I'm Bi Xingming.

183
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,880
Greetings, my lord. I'm Cheng Zichen.

184
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,800
-Greetings, my lord.
-Greetings, my lord.

185
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,760
Zishu.

186
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,960
Before Han Ying died,

187
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,080
he trusted me with these children.

188
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,600
I accepted them without asking you.

189
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,280
It was Han Ying's lifelong wish

190
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,800
to accept them
into the Four Seasons Manor.

191
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,040
That's my wish as well.

192
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,680
I'm the unworthy second disciple of
the Four Seasons Manor, Wen Kexing.

193
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,880
Greetings, my lord.

194
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,440
SAIJUN MANSION

195
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,960
Gu Xiang, they are back!

196
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,240
Master!

197
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,760
We're here.

198
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,160
SAIJUN MANSION

199
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,800
Master!

200
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,880
Sick Man! This is great!

201
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,880
Master, are you injured?

202
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,280
Who can hurt me?

203
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,080
Why are you here?

204
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,800
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

205
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,160
Sick Man.

206
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,280
Why did the goddamn prince
hurt you so badly?

207
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,760
You just wait.
My master and I will avenge you later!

208
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,760
With your martial arts skills?

209
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,000
Beiyuan?

210
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,120
Zishu.

211
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,600
It has been many years. How have you been?

212
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,840
Mr. Wen, please calm down.

213
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,040
Though the Nails of Seven Torments
is hard to deal with,

214
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,680
it's not hopeless.

215
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,480
Zishu has overcome many difficulties.

216
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,600
He will overcome this one too.

217
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,720
Prince Qi,

218
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,120
as long as you can heal
Zhou Xu's injury, I will--

219
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,080
I'll try my best to repay you.

220
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,240
You don't have to say this.

221
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,120
Zishu and I
have known each other since young.

222
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,280
It's just that he became colder
as he grew up.

223
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,880
LIVING IN SECLUSION FOR ONE'S AMBITIONS

224
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,360
He never asks for help
even if he needs it.

225
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,000
He never treats me as his friend.

226
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,120
Prince Qi,
you knew Zhou Xu a long time ago?

227
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,600
Yes.

228
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,520
Looking at it now,

229
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,480
it has been so long
as if it was from my past life.

230
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,360
Mr. Wen!

231
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,240
The brothers are here.

232
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,240
Mr. Wen.

233
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,000
Prince Qi.

234
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,480
These children

235
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,480
are disciples of the Four Seasons Manor.

236
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,960
Before the manor is rebuilt,

237
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,120
I might need to keep them at your place.

238
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Mr. Wen.

239
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,680
Wu Xi and I can be who we are today

240
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,000
thanks to Zishu.

241
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,880
I'll be offended

242
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,520
if you keep regarding me as an outsider.

243
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,000
Greetings from Bi Xingming, Prince Qi.

244
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,280
What's your relationship
with Bi Changfeng?

245
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,000
He was my master.

246
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,920
I was fortunate to inherit
my master's surname.

247
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,040
Very good.

248
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,120
Right.

249
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,360
While we're on this topic,

250
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,600
I received a piece of news
from my warrior, Ah Qinlai.

251
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,840
He escorted Chengling to Chief Shen Shen

252
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,240
of Mount Dagu Sect safely.

253
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,600
Since Zishu has been rescued,

254
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,040
should we bring him back?

255
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,960
Great Shaman, how was it?
Can you save him?

256
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,480
Please allow me.
I'm used to serving my master.

257
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,680
It's fine. I'll do it.

258
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
Let me do it instead.

259
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,560
This kid. Why is he so obedient?

260
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,320
Right, my lord.

261
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,600
I forgot to inform you.

262
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,480
It was all thanks to Mr. Wen.

263
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,840
He contacted me
with the mark left by Mr. Han.

264
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,680
He made a good plan and led us.

265
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,120
What did you call me?

266
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,440
You should call us
"Master" and "Master Wen."

267
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,760
Greetings.

268
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,920
There's no rush.

269
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,680
You can acknowledge us formally

270
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,960
along with your senior.

271
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,440
Wen Kexing.

272
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,360
I have 19 young men in my sect now.

273
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,160
Aren't you going
to share some of my burdens?

274
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,800
No problem, Lord Zhou.

275
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
You may leave first.

276
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,000
All right. Yes.

277
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,040
Let's go.

278
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,520
Zhou Xu.

279
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,200
Why weren't you shocked

280
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,520
when you saw me outside the jail?

281
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I was looking forward
to seeing your expression.

282
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,560
What's so surprising?

283
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,120
I didn't know when

284
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,240
or how you would come.

285
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,400
But I knew

286
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,880
you would definitely come.

287
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,920
No wonder.

288
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,240
So you were about to run away
with your lover?

289
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,600
Yes.

290
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,320
Little girl.

291
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,760
Why are you feeling proud about this?

292
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,800
Of course.

293
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,960
If Weining is willing
to come along with me,

294
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,800
it means that I'm more important to him,

295
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,360
compared to all the stupid rules
in the martial arts world.

296
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,800
Of course I'm happy!

297
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,200
You're right. Ms. Gu Xiang, you are bold.

298
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,000
You are like the girls of Nanjiang.

299
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,560
Yes. She's like the people from Nanjiang,

300
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,520
who's good at carrying off
children from decent families by fraud.

301
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,560
Right. Ms. Gu Xiang.

302
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,080
Tell me how you two manage to elope.

303
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,760
It's a wonderful story.

304
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,000
Gu Xiang!

305
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,960
Gu Xiang!

306
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,840
Why didn't you light up your room?

307
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
I forgot.

308
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,680
How was it? What's happening?

309
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,560
I still don't get it now.

310
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,240
I feel like I have had a nightmare.

311
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,440
Master has allied
with the Five Lakes Alliance.

312
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,040
No.

313
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,440
What's with the Drug Men then?

314
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,640
If they were allies,

315
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,120
why did the Drug Men
surround Mount Qingfeng?

316
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,280
Did you see the man in the black robe?

317
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,600
He's the Black Grim Reaper.

318
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,520
Why was a subordinate
of the Ghost Valley there?

319
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,920
Chief Zhao has convinced the seven sects.

320
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,760
They will hold
the Heroes Conference again.

321
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,000
Those devils

322
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,640
have already surrendered to Chief Zhao.

323
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,480
That's impossible.

324
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,120
It's not strange that Black Grim Reaper
would turn his back.

325
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,040
But Qianqiao would
never betray her master.

326
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,320
You don't know.

327
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,120
Qianqiao is the Beauty Ghost.

328
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,160
Don't listen to Zhao Jing's nonsense.

329
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,760
-He's not a decent man.
-Gu Xiang.

330
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,600
Master Fan told me this.

331
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,560
I could only listen to him.

332
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,160
Gu Xiang,

333
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,760
I don't understand.

334
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,920
I don't want to look into it either.

335
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,040
I was told that my master
was planning to pursue more.

336
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,680
He asked me not to look into it.

337
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,760
But--

338
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,200
but I understand even if I don't ask.

339
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,240
This is not right.

340
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,200
It's not right.

341
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,560
Weining, what's wrong?

342
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
I'm just

343
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,800
Gu Xiang.

344
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,720
We promised each other.

345
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,840
If Master Mo and Master Fan
don't agree to our marriage,

346
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,400
we will elope.

347
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,400
Are you being serious?

348
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,520
Let's run away.

349
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,120
I don't care about being a righteous man
and you're not evil.

350
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,120
We shall leave.

351
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,400
I don't understand and I don't want to.

352
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,280
Let's leave the martial arts world.

353
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
We can open a dessert shop
or a cosmetics shop.

354
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,720
We can raise cows and a farm.
We can do anything.

355
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,720
What do you say?

356
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,480
Yes.

357
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,720
That's all. So we ran away.

358
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,680
Isn't it great?

359
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,400
Indeed.

360
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,920
Mr. Cao can distinguish right from wrong.

361
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,640
He's a real man.

362
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,480
You are marrying the right man.

363
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,960
Wait a minute.

364
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,080
I still don't get it.

365
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,880
Zhao Jing has allied with Mo Huaiyang
of the Gentle Wind Sect

366
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,160
since the beginning?

367
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,200
Yes. But he hid it.

368
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,080
He didn't tell his son, Scorpion King.

369
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,040
Scorpion King fought for nothing.

370
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,600
He must be extremely angry.

371
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,680
This is not right, Gu Xiang.

372
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,800
Since you've decided to run away,

373
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
how did you meet the people
from the Ghost Valley?

374
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,480
And how did you find us?

375
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
What's wrong?

376
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,800
I'm sorry, Prince Qi.

377
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,040
Mr. Wen doesn't allow Gu Xiang
to talk about this part.

378
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,560
He will cut her tongue off if she does.

379
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,280
All right, then.

380
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,840
It's fine. You don't have to.

381
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,480
Luckily, you found Mr. Wen in time.

382
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,680
Otherwise, we would have
to throw our lives into it.

383
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Gu Xiang.

384
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,280
Does Mr. Wen have to return
to the Ghost Valley?

385
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,200
He was finally reunited with Mr. Zhou.

386
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,840
He will come back
after stepping down as chief

387
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,680
and helping Madam Luo
and her men settle down.

388
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,120
But the Exorcism Assembly
is starting soon.

389
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,760
All heroes will go to Mount Qingya.

390
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,520
They can do whatever they want.

391
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,680
I only care about my sisters
from the Department of the Unfaithful.

392
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,240
There's nothing good
about the Ghost Valley.

393
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,240
Who cares if they die?

394
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,480
All right.
Hopefully, everything goes well.

395
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,600
How does the silly girl
usually fold the clothes?

396
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,680
You're here in time.

397
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,640
What's wrong?

398
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,240
Why do you look so glum?

399
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,360
Master, I'm still worried.

400
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,640
Can you not return to the Ghost Valley?

401
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,680
We just have to take care of the sisters
in the Department of the Unfaithful.

402
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,240
Let the other ghosts find their way home.

403
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,480
They're all traitors anyway.
Who cares if they die?

404
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,600
That's childish.

405
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,920
Don't worry.

406
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,440
I'll come back right away.

407
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,240
You only need to take care
of Zhou Xu for me.

408
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,120
Master, you can't hide it from me.

409
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,120
I'm not stupid.

410
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,480
I brought Scorpion King to you

411
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,880
because I thought
you could make him surrender.

412
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,400
But if you get hurt from this, I--

413
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,000
I will never forgive myself.

414
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,520
And I saw it myself.

415
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,280
Those silly ghosts were controlled
by Scorpion King's secret medicine.

416
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,080
They listened to him like pugs.

417
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,360
Why did they come back and serve you

418
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,640
after your secret talk with Scorpion King?

419
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,560
Although Scorpion King hates Zhao Jing,

420
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,840
that is not enough of a reason
for him to help his enemy.

421
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,000
You even know that he's helping his enemy?

422
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,800
Seems like you've gotten smarter
since being with Weining.

423
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,200
Master, don't change the topic!

424
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,000
Weining has said this--

425
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,400
You're asking a tiger--

426
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,760
asking a tiger for what?

427
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,720
Asking a tiger for its skin!

428
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,800
I know that you were desperate

429
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,480
to save Zhou Xu back then.

430
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,440
But Master,

431
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,160
please tell me what you have promised him.

432
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,160
I've told you previously.

433
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,600
Never mention my plot

434
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,800
with Scorpion King to anyone else,

435
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,040
especially Zhou Xu.

436
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,840
I didn't.

437
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,000
I just think
I should also know what the plot is.

438
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,960
Master, I'm so worried about you.

439
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,520
Silly girl.

440
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,240
Scorpion King acts along with me

441
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,840
because it benefits him too.

442
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,320
I'll explain this to you some other time.

443
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,840
The priority now

444
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,440
is for Zhou Xu to heal
as soon as possible.

445
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,080
Don't worry.

446
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,320
Great Shaman has said

447
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,600
that once Zhou Xu's condition
improves to his best,

448
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,520
we need another master to be here

449
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,400
to remove the nails.

450
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,120
I'll come back before that.

451
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,880
Now that you have said so,

452
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,800
I won't keep you.

453
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,000
Right. You may leave me behind
a hundred times,

454
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,960
but not even once
when it comes to that Sick Man.

455
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,000
You're jealous of a man?

456
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,160
No.

457
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,880
Why are you jealous because of me?

458
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,880
Why aren't you jealous because of Weining?

459
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,400
He won't make me jealous.

460
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,080
Master,

461
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,920
you must come back safely.

462
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Have confidence in me, all right?

463
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,640
Even if I am asking a tiger for its skin,

464
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
do you think I can't outwit
and defeat Scorpion King?

465
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,040
Who's the tiger?

466
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,200
Who's the hunter?

467
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,680
We don't know yet.

468
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,320
-Chief is back!
-Chief is back!

469
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,240
-All evils retreat!
-All evils retreat!

470
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,160
-All ghosts return!
-All ghosts return!

471
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,440
Welcome back, Chief.

472
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,520
My apologies.

473
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,520
But there's only one chair

474
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,760
in your hall.

475
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,680
If you like it,

476
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,160
I can let you be
the chief of the Ghost Valley.

477
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,200
How about that?

478
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,360
That won't be necessary.

479
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,000
I don't think

480
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,920
I can handle a critical downfall.

481
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,560
You'd better keep

482
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,200
the position to yourself, Chief Wen.

483
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,520
Chengling.

484
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,120
Enough!

485
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,400
Stop practicing!

486
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,720
Chengling!

487
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,360
You can't master martial arts overnight.

488
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,720
I know you're upset,
but you can't push yourself too hard.

489
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,520
Training days and nights

490
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,120
might not benefit you.

491
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,480
Chengling.

492
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,840
Mr. Shen.

493
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,160
Can you talk some sense into Chengling?

494
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,160
Mr. Shen.

495
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,440
TO SHEN SHEN

496
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,040
"Demolish the ghosts
and cleanse the world."

497
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,520
The Exorcism Assembly is confirmed?

498
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,480
We finally have the chance to carry out

499
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,920
what Gao Chong couldn't.

500
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,560
"White Deer Town"?

501
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,120
This name sounds familiar.

502
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,080
White Deer Town

503
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,080
is right outside Mount Qingya.

504
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,800
The first chief of the Ghost Valley,
Magic Craftsman Rong Changqing,

505
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,160
was buried in White Deer Town.

506
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,760
The Exorcism Assembly is held here

507
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840
so that we can exterminate
the Ghost Valley in one go

508
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,200
with this opportunity.

509
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,680
Mr. Shen,
are you going to the assembly too?

510
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,200
I want to ask you two about it.

511
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,000
If I were the one to make the call,
I wouldn't bother to go there.

512
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,760
I just want to fulfill the wishes
of your fathers,

513
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,640
watching you grow up
and form your own families.

514
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,920
But Chengling,

515
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,720
although I don't know

516
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,800
how Zhou Zishu is involved in this,

517
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,600
Wen Kexing will definitely return
to the Ghost Valley.

518
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,880
What do you think?

519
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,040
Chief, I deserve to die.

520
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,200
Who did you offend?

521
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,840
Why are you here to serve me
as the scapegoat?

522
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,840
Yes. Serving--

523
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,480
being able to serve Chief

524
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,640
is my honor, is--

525
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,760
Enough. Get out.

526
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,240
Yes.

527
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,160
What are you afraid of?

528
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,120
No matter how fierce a ghost is,

529
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,160
as long as it finds
the path to the human world,

530
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,400
it will choose to become human again.

531
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,560
Madam Luo.

532
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,360
Why?

533
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,440
Shouldn't you be serving your new master?

534
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,720
Kexing.

535
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,200
Why are you back again?

536
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,880
Why don't you leave?

537
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,440
Madam Luo.

538
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,160
It has been eight years
since you last called me this.

539
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,080
I'm sorry, Chief.

540
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,320
It was a slip of the tongue.

541
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,640
I know. I'm not qualified
to call you this way.

542
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,760
Scorpion King

543
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,320
has used the Drunk Like a Dream

544
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,640
to neutralize the effect
of the Soup of Oblivion.

545
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,440
Now,

546
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,880
I remember everything.

547
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,880
Back then, in the Healer Valley,

548
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,600
your parents took care of me

549
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,520
and consoled me.

550
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,760
They not only cured me,

551
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,120
but also offered me help when I needed it.

552
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,720
But I--

553
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,720
I hate myself
for not being able to save them.

554
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,360
Luckily--

555
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,400
luckily, I saved you.

556
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,160
But I didn't take good care of you.

557
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,640
Madam Luo.

558
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,520
Madam Luo.

559
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,040
I have always remembered your kindness.

560
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,720
I really don't understand.

561
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,960
Why are you back in this doomed place?

562
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,120
Madam Luo.

563
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,960
I've recalled everything.

564
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,720
I thought I succeeded in resisting
the effect of the Soup of Oblivion

565
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,240
and remembered all the murderers
who killed my parents.

566
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,280
All these years,

567
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,560
you saw me killing them one by one.

568
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,760
You must know it clearly.

569
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,680
But I was wrong.

570
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,720
The moment I drank the Soup of Oblivion,

571
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,440
my obsession was

572
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,320
that I led the enemy in.

573
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,560
I indirectly killed my parents.

574
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,640
Everything could have ended differently.

575
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,320
But it's another story now.

576
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,760
I've been the chief of the Ghost Valley
for eight years.

577
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,200
Every day, I have to stay alert
in case anyone tries to kill me.

578
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,680
I have to come up with plans
to kill others too.

579
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,520
Even after killing all the murderers,

580
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,960
I didn't feel happy
that I had finally taken my revenge,

581
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,040
but I felt anxious and tortured instead.

582
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,720
I thought that was also hatred

583
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,240
as I didn't take revenge on all the people
who pushed my parents down the cliff.

584
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,960
Hence, I put in so much effort
to set a trap.

585
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,320
An interlocking murder game.

586
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,840
Madam Luo.

587
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,480
Do you know my initial plan?

588
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,240
Hanged Ghost didn't steal my Glazed Armor.

589
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,720
I don't have the Glazed Armor either.

590
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,880
I killed him secretly long ago.

591
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,760
That was just an excuse.

592
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,360
Chief!

593
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,840
My plan was to reenact
the Battle of Mount Qingya.

594
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,760
No.

595
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,600
I wanted to light a bigger fire

596
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,920
to burn up all the filthiness
in this world!

597
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,880
Those so-called decent sects
in the martial arts world

598
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,840
are simply greedy ghosts covered
with human skin!

599
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,560
They should die together
with the monsters of Mount Qingya!

600
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,120
I let you out to the martial arts world

601
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,960
and released the news of the Glazed Armor

602
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,240
all for this plan.

603
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,240
Once you enter the Ghost Valley,
you're isolated from the human world.

604
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,720
Whoever comes to Mount Qingya

605
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,280
for their desire of the Glazed Armor

606
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,920
will die here.

607
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,120
Kexing, what do you mean?

608
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,080
Are you--

609
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,880
are you planning to die with them?

610
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,280
Since I set up such an evil trap,

611
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,520
I didn't consider other things.

612
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,640
I didn't consider

613
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,200
how many innocent people
would die from this

614
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,080
because at that time, I thought

615
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,920
the world had turned its back on me,

616
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,480
so I wouldn't mind
killing everyone in the world.

617
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,400
Until later,

618
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,200
a man taught me something.

619
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,720
Hatred is the same as greediness.

620
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
It cages people and makes them suffer.

621
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,720
My parents

622
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,680
and even you, Madam Luo.

623
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,160
The reason
why you tried so hard to save me,

624
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,440
is not for me to bury myself in the past.

625
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,600
Madam Luo.

626
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,960
I've made a deal with Scorpion King.
We'll get what we need.

627
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,760
Tomorrow onward,

628
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,280
I'll ask him to remove

629
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,160
the poison in you and Qianqiao.

630
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,360
Take the girls from the Department
of the Unfaithful out of this valley.

631
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,440
As long as we let go of our hatred,

632
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,520
we are in the human world.

633
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,440
Why should we cage ourselves up?

634
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,840
Since you've decided to let go,

635
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,320
I'll give you my blessings.

636
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,080
You have your own decision.

637
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,280
I have made mine as well.

638
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,040
I'm willing

639
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,000
to suffer in this Ghost Valley forever.
