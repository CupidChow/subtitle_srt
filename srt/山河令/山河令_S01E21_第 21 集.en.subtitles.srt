1
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,320
Greetings, Scorpion King.

2
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,360
Here we are, my ghost friends.

3
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,480
Why are you angry?

4
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,760
Get away!

5
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,800
My ghost brother,

6
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,120
why are you so sissy and angry?

7
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,520
Do you think I'll be scared?

8
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,720
Enough.

9
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,040
Scorpion King,

10
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,480
the reason we follow Chief Zhao

11
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,920
is that we are tired
of fighting and killing.

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,120
We want to quit.

13
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,040
The Xianxia Sect has nothing to do
with our Ghost Valley.

14
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,400
So

15
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,840
don't count us in.

16
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,960
What a coincidence.

17
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,520
What Chief Zhao likes

18
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,120
is your killing skills.

19
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,800
If devils don't kill,
then what do they do?

20
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,240
Farming and collecting rent?

21
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,840
Even Chief Zhao wouldn't dare
to talk to our leader this way.

22
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,520
You brat!

23
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,480
"You brat"?

24
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,960
Here is some powder for deodorization.

25
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,920
You wicked woman, how dare you poison him?

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,160
Give me the antidote!

27
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
How dare you?

28
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,880
In my presence,

29
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,720
how could you be rude to our allies?

30
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,440
Give him the antidote.

31
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,800
Yes.

32
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,160
Chief Zhao asked everyone here
to wipe out the Xianxia Sect.

33
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,640
He has his reason for that.

34
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,440
If you are not willing to do it,

35
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,920
we could just go separate ways

36
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,680
in a peaceful manner.

37
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,440
However, in the future,

38
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,440
we could be either friends or foes.

39
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,080
Changing Ghost.

40
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,519
Am I right?

41
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,240
Scorpion King,

42
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,000
things are not that bad.

43
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,720
If Chief Zhao wants to wipe out

44
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,520
the puny Xianxia Sect,

45
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,320
I will just follow his order.

46
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
That's very good then.

47
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,680
By the way,

48
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,960
I will send Pretty Arhat to go with you,

49
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,680
just in case.

50
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,640
My brothers!

51
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,240
Let's go.

52
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,040
Evil Bodhisattva,

53
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,080
tell Pretty Arhat

54
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
to leave some survivors

55
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,600
to spread the news.

56
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,080
Spread the news?

57
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,320
To whom?

58
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,640
To the entire martial arts world.

59
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,240
The century-long established Xianxia Sect

60
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,560
was decimated by the Ghost Valley.

61
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,960
I want to see
who can stay aloof hearing that.

62
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,080
Changing Ghost,

63
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,880
you rank first in the Ten Devils.

64
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,200
Yet you gave up the privileges

65
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,320
and served those bastards?

66
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,680
How delightful.

67
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,960
That is really delightful!

68
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
Although that Lunatic Wen is crazy,

69
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,280
for better or worse,
he is in the same boat as us.

70
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,720
If we sink,

71
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,440
he won't survive.

72
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,360
Since we've already joined
the Ghost Valley,

73
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,600
is going back

74
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,000
a choice?

75
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,000
Do you think we can live
if we don't go back?

76
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,560
Let's not talk about Wen Kexing first.
That crazy guy is mentally unstable.

77
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,200
It's crazy
that those ghosts leaving the valley

78
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,920
are enough to turn
the entire world against us

79
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,800
like they're afraid that
this world wouldn't hate us more.

80
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,160
If only Gao Chong survived that incident

81
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
and brought back his allies
for another war on Mount Qingya--

82
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,960
Nonsense!

83
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,640
How is Zhao Jing different
from that Lunatic Wen?

84
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,960
What Zhao Jing wants is no more than a war

85
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,880
between the Ghost Valley
and those righteous clans.

86
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,160
He wants to kill us and them.

87
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,000
Changing Ghost.

88
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,880
If you serve Zhao Jing as his lackey,

89
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,800
you may earn yourself some fame
and have a good ending.

90
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,960
But Happy Ghost and I will not.

91
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Our bloody hands

92
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,440
cannot be cleansed.

93
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,440
If we both serve Zhao Jing as his blade,

94
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,000
what benefits could we expect in the end?

95
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,280
Lustful Ghost,

96
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,480
what's the point
of saying these things now?

97
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,200
We have betrayed that Lunatic Wen
and we can't go back.

98
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,200
Under Zhao Jing's wings,

99
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,560
at least, we have one way out.

100
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,080
If you can't accept it,

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,920
you could just go back to the Ghost Valley

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,120
and beg Lunatic Wen

103
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,160
for his mercy.

104
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,200
You haven't been

105
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,240
in the Ghost Valley for long.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,600
I'm afraid you don't know

107
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,120
how Lunatic Wen took over
the Ghost Valley.

108
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,200
It's said that

109
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,080
when he ascended to power,
in everyone's presence,

110
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,960
he ate the former chief
of the Ghost Valley alive,

111
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,840
piece by piece,

112
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,240
which totally frightened everyone.

113
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,600
That's fake.

114
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,600
In front of everyone,

115
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,760
he peeled off the skin
of the former chief alive.

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,480
Chief!

117
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,480
From today on,

118
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,640
I'm the supreme!

119
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,520
So Mr. Wen met you when he was a kid,

120
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,720
but why didn't Grand Master take him back?

121
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,920
Your grand master was occupied
with some important affairs

122
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,840
and couldn't go with those
who were heavily wounded.

123
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
So he promised them that in three months,

124
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,600
he would take them back
to the Four Seasons Manor.

125
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,400
But who would have thought

126
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,720
that when he went back to that village,

127
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,600
it had been leveled off?

128
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,960
That incident then

129
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,280
became a scar that
your grand master secretly bore.

130
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,880
When my junior disciple, Qin Jiuxiao,
became an adult

131
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,560
and went through
the ceremony of joining the sect,

132
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,720
your grand master said he ranked third.

133
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,880
I knew then

134
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,960
that he regretted it to such an extent.

135
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,360
They have already been saved,

136
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,240
yet you were somehow separated.

137
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,360
What a pity.

138
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,840
It was so close.

139
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,320
Master Wen could have grown up with you.

140
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,760
Then he must have recognized you
before you did.

141
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,840
But

142
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,240
why didn't he admit that he is Zhen Yan?

143
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,080
Zhen Ruyu was the adopted son
of Old Zhen of the Healer Valley.

144
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,760
Maybe his family name was "Wen,"

145
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,440
so he might not want to hear "Zhen" again.

146
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,880
But why not?

147
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,640
The former chief expelled them
from the sect.

148
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,120
What happened to
Hero Zhen's family after that?

149
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,200
-Master.
-Enough, kid.

150
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,920
Don't touch a raw nerve.

151
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,840
Look at Wen Kexing.

152
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,880
Does he seem like he has been
disciplined by his parents?

153
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,800
Master Ye!

154
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,040
Are you saying thatâ€¦

155
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,920
Could it be that Hero Zhenâ€¦

156
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,880
Maybe the Zhen couple

157
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,480
died long ago.

158
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,920
This must be something
he doesn't want to talk about.

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,520
If he doesn't mention it,

160
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,160
don't bring it up first. Do you hear me?

161
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,960
Good kid.

162
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,280
It doesn't matter
if he doesn't accept me as his senior.

163
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,200
I will always consider him as my junior.

164
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,760
I am just sad that

165
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,960
a good person such as Hero Zhen

166
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,440
didn't get a good ending.

167
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,440
Master.

168
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,320
Why do good people end up
in the worst way?

169
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,320
Father,

170
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,240
Master Long,

171
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,160
and the Zhen family.

172
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,920
Even Mr. Rong Xuan

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,360
didn't do anything evil.

174
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,960
Destiny is hard to predict.

175
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,800
Life is unexpected.

176
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,400
All people with emotions suffer.

177
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,960
Not just good guys.

178
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,280
Ah Xu, I think your good deeds
kind of paid off.

179
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,160
-You almost--
-Mr. Wen!

180
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,640
No, it's Master Wen.

181
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,160
Can I call you that?

182
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,800
Old Monster, why are you still here?

183
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,040
You can be here, so why can't I?

184
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,720
We're going to the Four Seasons Manor.

185
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,960
Why are you coming with us?

186
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,680
You take your way and I will take mine.
It's none of your business!

187
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,600
I dare go places with extreme danger,

188
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,640
let alone a manor.

189
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Fine.

190
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,520
The lord of the manor is here.

191
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,040
If he accepts your visit,
I will not say otherwise.

192
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,240
If Master Ye is willing
to visit our manor,

193
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,720
we'll be pleased to welcome you.

194
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,600
I've long heard the great name
of divine husband-wife physicians.

195
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,120
They were both elites of the elites.
What a divine couple they were.

196
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,800
Why did they give birth
to such an annoying kid?

197
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,120
What a pity.

198
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,880
But no matter what,

199
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,640
you will always be their child.

200
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,280
My rascal disciple owed a lot
to your parents.

201
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,120
This debtâ€¦

202
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,240
I'll pay them back as his master.

203
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,240
Little brat.

204
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,760
Tell me your wish.

205
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,840
Listen.

206
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,640
The dead can't come back to life.

207
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,040
That is the only thing I can't do.

208
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,240
I'm afraid there aren't many things
beyond my capability.

209
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,360
Do you have a wish? Just tell me.

210
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,120
I will surely help you realize it.

211
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,880
Listen.

212
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,280
I'm not helping you.

213
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,560
This is what you deserve.

214
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,720
Wen Kexing.

215
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,560
Please tell me your wish.

216
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,240
Otherwise,

217
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,160
I'm afraid

218
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,480
I won't die in peace.

219
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,280
I only have one wish.

220
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,480
Cure Ah Xu.

221
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,080
If you manage to do so,
all our previous debts are clear.

222
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,280
But make sure his life span
is not shortened

223
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,760
and his martial arts remain the same.

224
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,600
You brat!

225
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,240
Do you think
that will be difficult for me?

226
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,960
Though I don't have the solution,

227
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,680
I know who does.

228
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,680
You guys just stay
in the Four Seasons Manor

229
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,000
and wait for my return.

230
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,240
Master Ye.

231
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,920
Who are you looking for?

232
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,480
How long shall we wait for you?

233
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,600
If even he can't save you,

234
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
I willâ€¦

235
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,960
Hey, Old Monster!

236
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,080
Ye Baiyi!

237
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,880
He's not like a 100-year-old man at all,

238
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,200
but a child when he's in a rush.

239
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,400
What Old Monster meant

240
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,320
is your wound is curable, right?

241
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,240
He likes to brag a lot.

242
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,000
How do I know whether he was about to say,

243
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,960
"I will repay you by cutting off my head"
or "I will host your funeral"?

244
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,720
Did you hear that?

245
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,400
Your master's wound can be cured!

246
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,240
What great news.

247
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,600
Master Ye is very capable.

248
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,480
He meant what he said.

249
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,120
We can go home now!

250
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,960
Let's go home!

251
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,880
STOP AT THE BEST TO HAVE DIRECTION,
DIRECTION MAKES THE HEART STILL

252
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,480
Godfather,

253
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,440
your calligraphy is getting
more vigorous and integrated.

254
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,600
I like it so much.

255
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,720
Could you stamp it and give it to me?

256
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,280
You little barbarian.

257
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,720
You're so good at flattery.

258
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,000
Everything I have

259
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,000
is yours.

260
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,240
Here you are.

261
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,280
Zhao Jing.

262
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,840
It's me, Qiufeng.

263
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,320
Why won't you see me?

264
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,160
Please let Chief Yu in.

265
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,920
Zhao Jing.

266
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,720
I miss you so much.

267
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,440
Zhao Jing.

268
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,040
It has been a while since we met.

269
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,960
You look better than ever.

270
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,400
How have you been, Qiufeng?

271
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,000
Nowadays, the Yueyang Sect is in order

272
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,360
and strictly guarded.

273
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,120
Compared to the late Gaoâ€¦

274
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,240
It's so different from when
the late Gao Chong was in charge.

275
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,040
The tea is still as good as it was.

276
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,320
Qiufeng,

277
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,280
I haven't heard from you for a long time.

278
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,160
You didn't even show up
at the Heroes Conference.

279
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,520
Could you maybe

280
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,640
get caught up with something?

281
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,319
Zhao Jing.

282
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,040
On the day the Heroes Conference was held,

283
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,599
there were so many incidents.

284
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,839
Zhao Jing, I heard after you took charge
of the Five Lakes Alliance,

285
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,560
you've had lots of things done
in a short time.

286
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,760
But why leave
this issue remained untouched?

287
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,520
Your alliance endured a lot of hardships
to arrest Tragicomic Ghost.

288
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,080
Then she was taken away for no reason.

289
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,480
Why did you as the chief

290
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,000
pay no attention to it?

291
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,120
What do you mean?

292
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,480
Nothing really.

293
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,240
I just heard some rumors,

294
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
saying that the Tragicomic Ghost
is called Luo Fumeng,

295
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,120
your ex-fiancÃ©e.

296
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,240
You broke the engagement
on your wedding day

297
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,480
and eloped with the daughter
of a wealthy observer in West Zhejiang.

298
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,840
This bride-to-be was greatly humiliated.

299
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,200
She was so angry that she became insane.

300
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Ever since then,

301
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,320
the fair lady has disappeared,

302
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,160
but a demon who only kills
unfaithful men has emerged.

303
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,200
Zhao Jing.

304
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,160
I don't think that's true.

305
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,640
You're always honest and upright

306
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,880
and are deeply in love
with your late wife.

307
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,800
Wellâ€¦

308
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,840
How is it possible for you
to do such absurd things?

309
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,520
Have some tea.

310
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,200
I've had the slanderer severely beaten

311
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,400
and hurried here to warn you.

312
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,000
Upon taking charge of the alliance,

313
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,920
your great ambitions are to be realized.

314
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You must take precautions
against those slanderers out there

315
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,560
who are trying to tarnish your reputation.

316
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,080
The tea is good. Enjoy it.

317
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,000
It's good.

318
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,640
Where did Yu Qiufeng find out

319
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,920
about something that happened so long ago?

320
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,120
The henchmen I sent
to transfer the Tragicomic Ghost

321
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,280
did succeed at first,

322
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
but in the end, all died in Yueyang Sect.

323
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,960
Is Fumeng being kept by this guy?

324
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,120
That rat dare to make up
such rumors about you!

325
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,520
I will wipe out his Mount Hua Sect!

326
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,360
Godfather, please don't be angry.

327
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,800
Anger harms your body.

328
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,560
What would I be angry for?

329
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,400
Yu Qiufeng is merely a clown.

330
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,800
If a dog bites you,

331
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,960
does it make sense to bite it back?

332
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,200
For a mad dog, just beat it to death.

333
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,640
Yes, Godfather.

334
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,320
I'm going to pull out
the mad dog's tongue.

335
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,320
Hold on!

336
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,680
Xie'er.

337
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,320
How many times have I told you?

338
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,080
You're always so imprudent and rash.

339
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,240
Mount Hua Sect
is a noble and established school.

340
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,440
If the chief dies
right after he visits us,

341
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,600
that will just invite gossip.

342
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,960
Forget it.

343
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,880
The less trouble, the better.

344
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,840
Let's wait until they leave Yueyang.

345
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,840
But Godfather,
that guy slandered you like that.

346
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,320
I can't take it for one more second.

347
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,680
If the rumor spreadsâ€¦

348
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,240
Why should I be scared?

349
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,560
An upright person is not afraid of gossip.

350
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,400
Besides, taking his life is easy.

351
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Enough.

352
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,120
Qingcheng Sect is waiting for me

353
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,000
to plan an attack on the Ghost Valley.

354
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,720
You may leave now.

355
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,120
Yes.

356
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,640
If Fumeng is really kept by Yu Qiufengâ€¦

357
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,960
Wuyang!

358
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,680
Godfather, what is your order?

359
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,920
Help me send the ghosts a letter.

360
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,600
Godfather, most people of the Ghost Valley

361
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,200
have set off to take care
of the Xianxia Sect.

362
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,240
Only Lustful Ghost
is holding the fort now.

363
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,440
He'll be enough.

364
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,200
Yes.

365
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,880
WINE

366
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,080
Ah Xu,

367
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,760
you two go ahead and look for inns.

368
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,600
I'm running out of alcohol.
I'm going to buy some.

369
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,000
Remember to fill up my wine bag.

370
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,880
Hey! Why should I do that for you?

371
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,960
Am I your family's servant?

372
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,360
By the way, fill up my flask as well.

373
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,760
So you want Zhuyeqing or Nu'erhong?

374
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,160
Whichever.

375
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,080
Mr. Wen.

376
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,920
WINE

377
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,360
-Fill up with Kaoliang liquor.
-Yes, sir.

378
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,120
CORNELIAN CHERRY WINE, CINNAMON WINE

379
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,520
CHINESE BAIJIU, ABSINTHE, CORNELIAN
CHERRY WINE, CINNAMON WINE

380
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,720
The girls from the Department
of the Unfaithful were here.

381
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,120
Did Ah Xiang guide them here?

382
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,800
CORNELIAN CHERRY WINE, CINNAMON WINE

383
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,400
At first, Ghoul took us into hiding
for a few days.

384
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,400
Later on, except for Ms. Gu Xiang,

385
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
no one else came to look for us.

386
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,000
When he's upset, Ghoul lost control again,

387
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,200
cried for human flesh every day,

388
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,640
and looked at us with hungry eyes.

389
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,840
It was intimidating.

390
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,200
So we got him drunk

391
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,640
and quietly ran away from him.

392
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,080
Later, Beauty Ghost sent a message to us,

393
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,000
saying she saved Master

394
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,320
and was accompanying her
during her recovery.

395
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,120
She warned us not to be rash.

396
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,960
So since then,

397
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,200
you have never met anyone else
from the Ghost Valley?

398
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,760
Yes,

399
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840
except for Ms. Gu Xiang and Beauty Ghost.

400
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,840
The girls in our group
are weak in martial arts.

401
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,880
Without your protection,
Chief, and Master's,

402
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,040
I am afraid we would be everyone's prey.

403
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,480
We've been hiding for quite some time.

404
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,880
The storm is gradually subsiding.

405
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,720
Ms. Gu Xiang said you were in Shu.

406
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,880
We've searched around for your trace.

407
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,000
Thank goodness,
we were lucky enough to encounter you.

408
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,200
Chief,

409
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,280
there are dozens of girls
in the Department of the Unfaithful.

410
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,680
Where should we go?

411
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,240
Please give us your instructions.

412
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,480
What do you think?

413
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,400
Weâ€¦

414
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,920
Weâ€¦

415
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,520
We will all listen to you, Chief.

416
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,920
I mean, where do you want to go?

417
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,160
Well, if you don't have
any other instructions,

418
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,760
we will go back to Mount Qingya

419
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,520
and wait for you and our master
to come back.

420
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,440
The world is so big
and you can go anywhere.

421
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,000
Is that damned place your only choice?

422
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,480
Chief.

423
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,640
We are all ill-fated girls
who were once forced into a corner.

424
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,640
Every one of us was saved by our master.

425
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,760
We are all willing to serve
and work for her in return.

426
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,600
The world is so big,

427
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,200
but the only place that can be called home

428
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,080
is the Ghost Valley.

429
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,840
Now that we've joined the Ghost Valley,

430
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,600
we will either hunt

431
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,320
or be hunted.

432
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,440
You can't even protect yourselves.

433
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,520
What's the point of going back there?

434
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,960
From now on, I don't care where you go,

435
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
but don't ever step into
Mount Qingya again.

436
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,720
Whoever disobeys me will die.

437
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,000
-Yes, Chief.
-Yes, Chief.

438
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,760
WANGCHEN INN

439
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,480
Where did you go?

440
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,280
What happened?

441
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,000
Discipline my disciple for me.

442
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,320
He's so unruly!

443
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,360
Beat him or scold him as you please.

444
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,720
He's your disciple,

445
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,240
but you want me to teach him?

446
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,840
It's almost eleven o'clock,
I need to adjust my vital energy.

447
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,520
Little brat, what did you do?

448
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,000
I begged my master for a bedtime story,

449
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,800
but he was really bad at it.

450
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
That story he told

451
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,800
was even more boring
than an old teacher's lecture.

452
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,000
You were so nice before.

453
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,680
Why are you so insatiable,

454
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,080
making such unreasonable demands?

455
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,360
Kids really can't be spoiled.

456
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,480
Mr. Wen, tell me one more story, please.

457
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,400
Your story must be more amusing
than my master's.

458
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,880
Gu Xiang once told me

459
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,920
you know a lot of rare and weird stories

460
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,960
such as Hong Hai'er split a mountain
to save the White Snake,

461
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,600
Jiang Ziya who fought
with the White-Bones Demon,

462
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,760
-andâ€¦
-Stop.

463
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,920
Why does this girl tell you everything?

464
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,760
Master Wen, I beg you.

465
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,840
Tell me one story.

466
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,720
I will never make Master angry again.

467
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,360
Master Wen.

468
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,520
You're so hard to deal with.

469
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
All right, I'll tell you one.

470
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,880
Once upon a time,

471
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,080
there was a man walking in a desert.

472
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,840
Unfortunately, he encountered
a pack of wolves

473
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,560
-and he was cornered.
-Kill him!

474
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Suddenly, he found a well in front of him.

475
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,160
Having no other choice,

476
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,600
he could only crawl down
the dry well with a rope.

477
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,200
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

478
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,200
-Halfway down the well,
-Kill him!

479
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,600
-he unexpectedly found
-No.

480
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,720
a den of snakes at the bottom,

481
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,440
hissing with their split tongues.

482
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,920
He was in such a dilemma,

483
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,960
with no way to go
while being chased from behind.

484
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,240
At that very moment,

485
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,920
he found a honeycomb
on the wall of the well.

486
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,880
Those bees, buzzing and flying around,

487
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,560
were about to attack him.

488
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,720
He was stung
and fell into unspeakable misery.

489
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,760
What's worse,

490
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,800
the rope that he held onto

491
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,480
couldn't withstand his weight

492
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,120
and he was slowly falling.

493
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,400
Suddenly,

494
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,160
he noticed that honey was oozing
from the honeycomb

495
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,400
in the well.

496
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,000
He put out his finger,

497
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,840
taking some of the honey,

498
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,920
put it in his mouth,

499
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,160
-and wholeheartedly sucked it.
-Let me!

500
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,720
Life is like a dream

501
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,840
and a floating bubble.

502
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,160
What people desperately pursue is nothing,

503
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,480
but a pleasure like that honey.

504
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,200
Beauty Ghost,

505
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,280
you helped an outsider stop me?

506
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,720
Cut the nonsense!

507
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,960
After so many years,

508
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,120
this is my first time
seeing your true face.

509
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,280
Get lost!

510
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,280
You won't fail me

511
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,320
and I won't fail you.

512
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,040
You won't fail meâ€¦

513
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,560
Master, run!

514
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,520
The crazy woman has gone mad again.

515
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,520
Beauty Ghost, what were you thinking?

516
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,960
You would rather hide here
and stay with that old dog, Yu Qiufeng,

517
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,480
than turn to me for help.

518
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,400
Not bad.

519
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,600
It's not as bad as I thought.

520
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,360
If you dare to touch me,

521
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,080
Chief will definitely cut you into pieces.

522
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,240
You are

523
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,400
really silly and stupid.

524
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,360
Ah Jing.

525
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Ah Jing.

526
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,920
Ah Jing.

527
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,160
Ah Jing.

528
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,880
Scorpion King?

529
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,880
Scorpion King, what are you doing here?

530
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,960
Who are you to ask me that?

531
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,960
-Ah Jing.
-Where is Yu Qiufeng?

532
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,800
Ah Jing.

533
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,320
Who are these two women?

534
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,400
Well, sheâ€¦

535
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,480
She's the famous Beauty Ghost.

536
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,880
Her lover, the chief, abandoned her

537
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
and ran away alone.

538
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,560
Beauty Ghost?

539
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,600
Tragicomic Ghost's henchman

540
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,080
and ranks last among the Ten Devils.

541
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,360
That Beauty Ghost?

542
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,520
My goodness.

543
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,760
So you are the Beauty Ghost.

544
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,760
I'm confident with my unequal beauty.

545
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,040
It's said Beauty Ghost is known
in the martial arts world for her beauty,

546
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,680
but regrettably blind and slow.

547
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,600
I've been looking forward to seeing you.

548
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,400
Lady Green Siren,

549
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,120
you are much more beautiful
than what they described.

550
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,160
Look at this face.

551
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,040
It makes my heart restless

552
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,920
and my throat feels prickly.

553
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,720
With such a face,
why would people call her a beauty?

554
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,400
Do you think everyone is born
as beautiful as me?

555
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,080
She found herself a master.

556
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,240
Such a little scar doesn't matter at all.

557
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,120
Even wearing the same makeup
as the moon goddess, Chang'e,

558
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,200
works for her.

559
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,760
-Ah Jing.
-And that woman is her master.

560
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,240
Master of the Unfaithful List,
Tragicomic Ghost.

561
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,920
But what a pity! She has gone mad.

562
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,240
She can do nothing now.

563
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,760
Ah Jing.

564
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,720
Ah Jing, where are you?

565
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,080
Ah Jing.

566
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,200
Ah Jing.

567
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,320
Ah Jing!

568
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,080
-Ah Jing, where are you?
-What did you say?

569
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,360
Ah Jing.

570
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,200
Ah Jing.

571
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,120
I never thought that you,
at such a young age,

572
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,440
-Ah Jing.
-to have such a weird taste.

573
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,360
A madwoman like her

574
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,640
could seduce you?

575
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,000
-What?
-Ah Jing.

576
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,160
Are you scared?

577
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,280
Ah Jing.

578
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,040
Scorpion King,
Lustful Ghost deserved to die.

579
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,680
It was him who offended you.

580
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,080
We are sent here by Zhao Jing, the chief.

581
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,320
Ah Jing.

582
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,320
Ah Jing, you are here.

583
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,680
Ah Jing!

584
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,120
Ah Jing, where are you?

585
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,120
Where are you?

586
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,040
Ah Jing.

587
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,000
Where are you?

588
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
-Master.
-Ah Jing!

589
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,800
Ah Jing, where are you?

590
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,040
I beg you.

591
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,720
Please leave her alone.

592
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,160
-She has gone mad.
-Ah Jing.

593
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,320
Please show mercy and let her go.

594
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,440
Beg me one more time.

595
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,480
I beg you!

596
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,600
I beg you!

597
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,760
Let her go.

598
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,920
Stop!

599
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,240
Stop!

600
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,360
This loser himself is back.

601
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,720
Let her go.

602
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,480
Why should I?

603
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,800
I have a piece of the Glazed Armor.

604
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,080
Let her go first!

605
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,920
I'll take you to it.

606
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,280
Qianqiao.

607
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,200
Qianqiao.

608
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,639
Qianqiao.

609
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,920
Qianqiao, I'm sorry.

610
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,199
I, Yu Qiufeng,
am a coward and despicable man.

611
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,560
I fled when faced with imminent disaster.

612
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,120
Qianqiao.

613
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,800
I'm back.

614
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,719
I won't leave anymore.

615
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,880
Enough. Enough with the sweet talk.

616
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,719
No matter how sweet your words are,

617
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,880
you still can't wipe out

618
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,520
your evil reputation
as the first liar in the world.

619
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,800
What do you mean by that?

620
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,320
Scorpion King, you may not know this.

621
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,840
This lady was given
the nickname "Green Siren."

622
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,360
She's well known for her beauty
in the martial arts world.

623
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,240
But unfortunately, she was blind.

624
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,400
She fell for Yu Qiufeng's sweet talk.

625
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,320
Who would expect

626
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,120
that Yu Qiufeng's wife

627
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,600
is known for her jealousy?

628
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,120
She caught this lady,

629
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,600
stripped off her clothes,
and forced her to parade naked

630
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,280
all the way from Mount Hua to Chang'an.

631
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,160
This anecdote

632
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,280
was known by everyone back then.

633
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,200
The funny thing is,

634
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,920
right from the beginning to the end,

635
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,960
this lady's lover

636
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,040
didn't dare to say a word.

637
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,560
So she couldn't stay
in the martial arts world anymore.

638
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,520
It is said that
she joined the Ghost Valley.

639
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,440
People said Yu Qiufeng

640
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,360
found a new mistress,
but can you believe this?

641
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,880
It's still her!

642
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,840
My dear.

643
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,160
I don't think it's just your face,

644
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,920
but even your brain is wounded.

645
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,920
It was me who had bad intentions.

646
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,520
His Glazed Armor is fake.

647
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,320
I just wanted to take advantage of him
to save my master.

648
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,760
But who knew?

649
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,560
Being entangled with him
for half of my life is worth it.

650
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,400
Qiufeng.

651
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,000
Only you are allowed to lie to me,

652
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,200
but I'm not allowed to lie to you?

653
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,600
I beg you to let my master go.

654
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,200
I'm willing to serve you.

655
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,040
I will be at your command.

656
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,520
How did a demon
that once rode the whirlwind

657
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,000
become an idiot now?

658
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,120
She's suffering from soul-dissociation
after drinking the Soup of Oblivion.

659
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,720
With a clouded mind and blurred memory,

660
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,560
she's wasting away.

661
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,480
The Soup of Oblivion?

662
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,400
That's what everyone who wishes

663
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,200
to join the Ghost Valley has to drink.

664
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,640
It enables you to forget
your strongest obsession.

665
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,560
Evil Bodhisattva,

666
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,520
bring these two women
back to the Scorpion Sect.

667
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,440
You must play it by ear.
By all means, don't let anyone find out.

668
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,480
Whyâ€¦

669
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,720
You won't fail me

670
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,920
and I won't fail you.

671
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,480
TEA, WATER

672
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,960
Master, the food is ready.

673
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,920
Chengling,

674
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,600
you seem to have grown taller
than when you were at Tai Lake.

675
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,080
Thank you, Master.

676
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,680
For what?

677
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,960
Ever since we met,

678
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,760
you have been worried about me.

679
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,680
Don't feel sorry for him.

680
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,320
Your master is the embodiment
of the Bodhisattva

681
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,600
and is destined to help others.

682
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
Bustling around to help people in need
is common for him.

683
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,000
You are already drunk early in the day?

684
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,400
Waiter, come here.

685
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,600
-Coming!
-Bring my brothers some water.

686
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,520
Here you go, sir.

687
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,320
I will get some more.

688
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,320
WATER

689
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,880
As long as I am aliveâ€¦

690
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,920
Waiter.

691
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,960
I'm not done with you!

692
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,680
Who are those people?
Why are they all wounded?

693
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,200
Sir, they are from the Xianxia Sect.

694
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,440
Two days ago, their sect was set on fire.

695
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,000
It is said Hero Bai, their chief, is dead.

696
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,960
How cruel!

697
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,440
The Ghost Valley?

698
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,000
How scary.

699
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
What do you think, Bodhisattva Zhou?

700
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,200
Do you need to hurry to vanquish
the demons and monsters?

701
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,000
How disgusting!

702
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,440
The smell of burnt food.

703
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,800
These deserters of the Xianxia Sect

704
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,920
didn't even bury the bodies
of their brothers.

705
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,960
The Ghost Valley is too much.

706
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,240
They bully righteous sects
and they don't even have a leader.

707
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,560
Such a pity.

708
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,040
Chief Bai has been chivalric
for more than 30 years.

709
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,280
If we got there two days earlier,

710
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,080
-maybe--
-Maybe what?

711
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,760
Maybe we might die
at the hands of the Ghost Valley.

712
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,600
Though my martial arts are not that good,
both our sects are quite close.

713
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,280
I should not be afraid to die.

714
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,440
Ah Xiang, wait up.

715
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,320
Chengling, are you all right?

716
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,080
I'm fine, Master.

717
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm just not used to seeing dead bodies.

718
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,920
Bodhisattva Zhou,

719
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,760
weren't we going back
to the Four Seasons Manor?

720
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,760
Does the Xianxia Sect's bad luck
have anything to do with us?

721
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,400
Chengling.

722
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,280
Have some more water and calm yourself.

723
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,320
Lao Wen, follow me.

724
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,000
Ah Xu,

725
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,880
are you the God of Death?

726
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,680
Wherever you go, there is death.

727
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,880
You're the one with bad luck.

728
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,520
I dare not take the credit.

729
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,840
I heard that once there was an owl.

730
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,480
It knocked over the red water
in a villager's hands.

731
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,040
Then dozens of villagers died.

732
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,120
Ah Xu, I found your bad-mouthing

733
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,440
is as powerful as the owl.

734
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,840
Don't interrupt me.

735
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,440
Based on the bodies in the Xianxia Sect,

736
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,400
they were either cut in the throats

737
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,440
or died immediately.

738
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,000
Obviously, they were killed
by professional assassins.

739
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,200
So?

740
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,120
Suppose that someone

741
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,360
is killing the dissidents
in the name of the Ghost Valley

742
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,520
and then blame it on them.

743
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,000
What would their purpose be?

744
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,240
To benefit themselves, of course.

745
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,200
Before the Heroes Conference,

746
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,720
I thought Gao Chong was the guy
who set the whole thing up.

747
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,640
Given the current circumstances,

748
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,600
within the Five Lakes Alliance,
there's someone else behind the scenes.

749
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,120
Shen Shen and Zhao Jing
both pretended to be silly and weak.

750
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,480
I don't think they're innocent.

751
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,000
Gao Chong's death was caused
by his sworn brother.

752
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,840
No matter who set it up,
either Shen Shen or Zhao Jing,

753
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,000
this other guy has bad intentions.

754
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,640
Both of them are treacherous
and faithless villains.

755
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,800
No one is innocent
no matter who the prey is.

756
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,680
It doesn't matter
if it's either Shen Shen or Zhao Jing.

757
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,800
But in case one of them is evil
while the other is loyal,

758
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,280
what happened
to the innocent one is on us.

759
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,000
"Innocent"?

760
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,000
You're doing this again!

761
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,080
Who's the innocent one?

762
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,720
It doesn't matter.

763
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,040
Weren't we going
to the Four Seasons Manor?

764
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,120
Why do you mention this crap?

765
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,040
Let's go!

766
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,600
Master!
