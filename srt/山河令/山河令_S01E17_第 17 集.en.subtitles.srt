1
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,600
Ah Xiang!

2
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,280
Why are you up?

3
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,280
Ah Xiang.

4
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,960
Ah Xiang. Luckily, you're fine.

5
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,520
I dreamed that I didn't protect you well.

6
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,040
Why is it so painful?

7
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,360
Lie properly.

8
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,640
You were beaten up and were unconscious
for the past few days.

9
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,240
Who can you protect?

10
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,640
Ah Xiang,

11
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,640
I dreamed a lot and couldn't wake up.

12
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,560
I failed to protect you
in every one of them.

13
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,800
I was so anxious.

14
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,320
I even died in the last one.

15
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,320
I was happily waiting for you
by the Naihe Bridge.

16
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,520
I thought I'd have to wait
for 60 or 70 years

17
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,240
until you become an elderly woman
with white hair.

18
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,960
But not long after, you came.

19
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,440
I thought, "No way.

20
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,880
Aren't you too young to die?"

21
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
-I was panicking.
-Are you cursing me?

22
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,320
I'm not.

23
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,600
Knock on wood.

24
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,600
Ah Xiang.

25
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
You're so kind.

26
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,000
You will live a long life.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,840
Where's Xiaolian?

28
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,200
She was abducted by those two old demons.

29
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,520
We need to save her!

30
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,560
Forget it.

31
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,560
Lie down!

32
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,160
You're half dead. Who can you save?

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,600
Who saved me?

34
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,720
Was it my master?

35
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,000
Where are my masters?

36
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,160
Calm down, please.

37
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,640
Chief Yu of Mount Hua Sect saved you.

38
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,080
Rest here nicely. Don't move around.

39
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,480
I'll get some medicine for you.

40
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,480
Ms. Gu,

41
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,160
is Weining feeling better?

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,360
He's fine.

43
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,400
That's great.

44
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,720
Weining is a chivalrous man.

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,400
This is an adjacent residence
of Mount Hua Sect.

46
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,640
Let him rest here at ease.

47
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,240
Enough, Chief Yu.

48
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,360
I've told him.

49
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,080
Stop forcing yourself

50
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,480
to be "pretendious" in front
of a little siren like me.

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,680
Do whatever you like.

52
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,880
Gu Xiang, it's "pretentious."

53
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,120
All right.

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,240
You can chat here.

55
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,520
I won't disturb Weining.

56
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Qianqiao, couldn't you save my face

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,120
in front of an outsider?

58
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,920
Gu Xiang, you're still so uneducated.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,680
How can you be a good match
for a nobleman?

60
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,040
Who wants to be his match?

61
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,160
I can even be a good match for a prince.

62
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,640
That idiot…

63
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes.

64
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,440
Even the emperor doesn't deserve you.

65
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,080
Look. Even our Heartless Amethyst Fiend

66
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,920
would start to feel sad.

67
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Gu Xiang, listen to my advice.

68
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,880
It's urgent now,
we shall only think about the present.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,720
Young Hero Cao is injured.

70
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,600
You should stay here for now.

71
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,960
I'll help my master settle down first.

72
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,240
Qianqiao.

73
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,920
Why did the chief of the Mount Hua Sect

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,040
save Madam Luo with you?

75
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,200
How did you convince him?

76
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,920
You'd better tell me first
in case I got the story wrong.

77
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,280
His son was killed
by the Five Lakes Alliance.

78
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,280
I promised to help him with his revenge,

79
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,640
so he helped me save my master.

80
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,520
Is that all?

81
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,360
I think that man is quite cunning.

82
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,720
Qianqiao, you'd better be careful.

83
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,320
My good girl.

84
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,000
Stop worrying about me.

85
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,400
Just take care of Young Hero Cao.

86
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,600
All right.
I'm going to get him some medicine.

87
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,600
I'll leave first.

88
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,640
Little girl.

89
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,760
It's time to eat.

90
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,960
Are you deaf or dead?

91
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,640
Why? Are you trying
to starve yourself to death?

92
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,320
No way!

93
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,080
If you're dead,

94
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,960
all of my efforts will be wasted.

95
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,880
Open your mouth!

96
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,200
Open your mouth!

97
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,600
Eat! Eat it!

98
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,560
-Enough, Tao Hong.
-Eat--

99
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,360
Stop torturing this little girl.

100
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,840
Let me convince her.

101
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,000
How can you do that?

102
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,120
What exactly is that bastard, Huang He,

103
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,120
going to do?

104
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,120
Now that Gao Chong has settled his debt,

105
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,280
he can go after
Shen Shen and Zhao Jing directly.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,400
What's the point of capturing this girl?

107
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,880
This girl knows nothing.

108
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,520
We should either kill or release her.

109
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,680
Why bother imprisoning her?

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,360
Releasing her is not an option.

111
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,200
We went through a lot to abduct her.

112
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,640
There is no way to go back now.

113
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,600
Girl, tell us everything you know.

114
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,000
Your father is no longer here.

115
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,760
Why are you being stubborn?

116
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,040
You're the only one suffering here.

117
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,000
Neither of us will torture you.

118
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,720
But other people might!

119
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,720
Ah Xu, are you feeling hot?

120
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,640
Look, you're sweating.

121
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,600
Come, I'll fan you.

122
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
I wasn't feeling hot,

123
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,400
but once you spoke,

124
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,040
I began to feel annoyed.

125
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,520
Mr. Wen, my master is doing well.

126
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,400
You should take care of me instead.

127
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,440
You're being lazy again.

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,400
Practice for an hour more.

129
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,720
Master, I've practiced
the Swift Moving Steps

130
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,039
a few thousand times.

131
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,520
I'm already familiar with it
and can handle it well.

132
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,360
Can I stop practicing now?

133
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,919
How dare you talk back to me?

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,039
Two more hours!

135
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,880
Ah Xu, you're normally nice and gentle.

136
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,160
Why are you so strict with your disciple?

137
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,600
Things might go wrong if you rush it.

138
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
You have to teach with patience.

139
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
How?

140
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,120
Fine. I was too nosy.

141
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,000
You are teaching him
according to his aptitude.

142
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,880
A strict mentor makes a good disciple.

143
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
I won't take anyone's advice.

144
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Don't you know
"clumsy birds should start flying early"?

145
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,000
I can protect you now,

146
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,240
but can I protect you forever?

147
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,640
Master, I didn't say that I wouldn't fly.

148
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,320
But…

149
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,720
I can't do it now even if I want to.

150
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,680
He has to practice his martial arts,

151
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,440
but he can't if he has a heatstroke.

152
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
Chengling really can't take it anymore.

153
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,640
Why don't you allow him
to rest for a while in the carriage?

154
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,520
Go on with your training!

155
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,880
Is he your disciple or mine?

156
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,160
Are you teaching him instead?

157
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,280
All right, I'll shut up. You're right.

158
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,040
What's wrong with Lao Wen these days?

159
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,680
He acts like a wife who feels wronged.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,640
What is he planning?

161
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,880
Greetings, Master. Scorpion King.

162
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,840
Changing Ghost. Lustful Ghost.

163
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,400
This must be Happy Ghost.

164
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,880
Welcome!

165
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,640
Mr. Zhao. Scorpion King.

166
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,200
Mr. Zhao, your strategy
worked so well this time.

167
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,920
I truly respect you.

168
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
You're overpraising me.

169
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,400
The Heroes Conference at Mount Jun
was held smoothly

170
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,880
thanks to you

171
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,120
and the other ghosts' cooperation.

172
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,400
Greetings, Zhao Jing…

173
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,080
Chief Zhao.

174
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,000
Greetings, Scorpion King.

175
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
No wonder you are known
as the Happy Ghost.

176
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,160
You really make people happy.

177
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,800
Lustful Ghost.

178
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,400
Chief Zhao, you've finally succeeded.

179
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,360
Who else besides you
can be the supreme chief

180
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,960
of the martial arts world?

181
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,880
We are all brothers.
Please save the courtesy.

182
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,640
We still have a long way to go.

183
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,240
We now have no clue
of the whereabouts of the Glazed Armor.

184
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,040
I will need lots of support
from you in the future.

185
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,960
Mr. Zhao.

186
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,800
You mean the pieces of Glazed Armor
that were destroyed by Gao Chong

187
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,800
at the Heroes Conference were fake?

188
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,480
I don't think my brothers
should waste their effort

189
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,000
on nothing.

190
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,760
I know Gao Chong well.

191
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,560
He did that just to confuse others.

192
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,760
He planned to end the fight
over the Glazed Armor

193
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,200
by committing suicide.

194
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,720
He must have

195
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,000
kept the real Glazed Armor
in a safe place.

196
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,440
So you have to work hard to search for it.

197
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,200
Also, regarding the search
for Hanged Ghost,

198
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,920
you should put in more effort.

199
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,760
But as for the Five Lakes Alliance…

200
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

201
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,600
You don't have to worry about it.

202
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,480
Since you mentioned this,

203
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,040
I'm still confused about one thing.

204
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Wen Kexing said

205
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,280
that his Glazed Armor
was snatched by Hanged Ghost.

206
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,360
The Five Lake Alliance

207
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,080
has five pieces of Glazed Armor, right?

208
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,640
How many pieces do you have?

209
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,280
Changing Ghost.

210
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,560
I'll let you know
what you're supposed to know.

211
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,080
Why should you care about things

212
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,520
that you're not supposed to know?

213
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,640
Changing Ghost,
look at what you have done.

214
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,040
Working with the righteous clans,

215
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,800
we have to work hard, yet we get nothing.

216
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,120
What's good about that?

217
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,840
Moreover, I think Zhao Jing
and Scorpion King…

218
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,360
They are both mad.

219
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,560
Do you think I don't know that?

220
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,120
How could they come up with this plan
if they're not mad?

221
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,800
Without such a plan,

222
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,720
how can my dream come true?

223
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,840
What are you up to?

224
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,120
He wants to become
the chief of the Ghost Valley.

225
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,320
What's so nice about becoming the chief?

226
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,640
Every day, 3,000 evil ghosts look at you
with hopes of replacing you.

227
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,040
Who can keep an eye on his back forever?

228
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,400
Everyone will die.

229
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,840
You're right.

230
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,240
What's the point of becoming the chief?

231
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,560
Everything is still the same.

232
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,560
We can never see the sun.

233
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,320
Even a fierce king of the valley
like Wen Kexing

234
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,080
can't escape his fate.

235
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,360
What's your plan then?

236
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,640
Didn't you ever think

237
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,360
of returning to the human world?

238
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,160
We'll ride on the fastest horses,

239
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,600
drink the strongest wine,

240
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,480
play with the prettiest ladies…

241
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,560
That's good!

242
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,640
And kill

243
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,880
the cruelest enemies.

244
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,200
Yes!

245
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,240
I want that so badly!

246
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,360
Changing Ghost.

247
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,120
No one will recognize you
if you disguise yourself.

248
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,480
You're the head of the Ten Devils
of the Ghost Valley.

249
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,240
But my face…

250
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,720
When I get too excited,

251
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,680
I can't speak.

252
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Who can't recognize me because of that?

253
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,400
What if I tell you

254
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,280
there's a holy item of the Healer Valley

255
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,520
hidden in the armory,

256
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,040
which can revive a dead person,
cure any severe injuries,

257
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,320
and treat any illness in this world?

258
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
What do you think?

259
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,440
Lao Wen, accompany me to get some food.

260
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,280
You take a rest first. I'll go instead.

261
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,800
Good disciple,
go and get some food with me.

262
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,720
Mr. Wen.

263
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,320
Even my little finger can't move.

264
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,480
Chengling can't go.

265
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,080
He has to practice.

266
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,160
Master.

267
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,360
I taught you
the Emerging Phoenix yesterday.

268
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Practice it 500 times before your dinner.

269
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,920
Right.

270
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,520
Bring two fish back.
I want to drink fish soup tonight.

271
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,760
I want to drink old monster soup!

272
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,960
Why don't you boil yourself then?

273
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,880
You brat!

274
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,240
How dare you be so arrogant?

275
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,080
Ah Xu, give it a taste.

276
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,560
Young man.

277
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,880
Don't you know
about respecting the elderly?

278
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,080
It's fine. I'll get another bowl for you.

279
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,480
Ah Xu.

280
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,560
Thank you, Lao Wen.

281
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,839
Chengling.

282
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,000
Bring this soup to Young Chief Long.

283
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,800
Feed him if he wants to have it.

284
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,880
Ah Xu.

285
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,599
Why do you call that brat "young chief"?

286
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,520
Qin Huaizhang and Long Que
swore to live and die together.

287
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,000
Long Que met the little brat, Rong Xuan,

288
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,560
through Qin Huaizhang.

289
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,560
"Little brat"?

290
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,400
What's your relationship with Rong Xuan?

291
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
How do you know Rong Xuan's relationship
with these people?

292
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,280
Do you want to know?

293
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,960
Why do you act like an old lady?

294
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,080
You are so nosy.

295
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,960
Master Ye, our journey to Shu this time
is far and tough.

296
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,040
How do you know
that the answer is in Longyuan Cabinet?

297
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,400
Except for the one
who started the whole thing,

298
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,680
the only insider
who is still alive now is Long Que.

299
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,600
We can only meet him
if we want to find out.

300
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,680
Master Ye. Master.

301
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,400
Who exactly is Long Que?

302
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,080
The Longyuan Cabinet's
former leader Long Que

303
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
is a sworn friend of your grand master.

304
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240
The superficial knowledge
of mechanics passed down

305
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,360
in the Four Seasons Manor

306
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,280
is all from the Longyuan Cabinet.

307
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,680
When I first joined the clan,

308
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,600
Old Chief Long visited us frequently.

309
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,320
But I don't know

310
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,240
why he disappeared suddenly.

311
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,720
There was a misunderstanding
between my master and him,

312
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,440
so he didn't look for him.

313
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,600
Later,

314
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,680
my master received

315
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,480
a distress letter
from a Mechanical Sparrow.

316
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,120
Only then did he know something was wrong.

317
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,960
He came to Shu several times.

318
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,960
Master.

319
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,280
Did Grand Master find him?

320
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,400
No.

321
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,720
No one knows the actual position
of the Longyuan Cabinet.

322
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,320
People said that it was
a portable fortress in the mountains.

323
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,600
Back then, the Window of Heaven
was not as influential.

324
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,800
I dispatched some people
to search for it a few times.

325
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,440
Every time,
they would come back and tell me

326
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,680
that the address of the place was correct,

327
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,560
but nothing was found there.

328
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,040
They were just useless.

329
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,600
Even their leader was useless,

330
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,160
they would only be worse.

331
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,240
Useless disciple

332
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,200
and your useless friend.

333
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,560
But your soup is acceptable.

334
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
How did you survive all these years
without being strangled to death?

335
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,760
I'm good at martial arts.

336
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,080
Master Ye, this soup might be poisoned.

337
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,280
Aren't you drinking it too?

338
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,120
FIVE LAKES WORLD ALLIANCE

339
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Have a seat, my brothers. Be at ease.

340
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,160
Where are the leaders of Jujing Gang

341
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,760
and Purple Wave Cove?

342
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,440
These bastards!

343
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,240
They are turning against us.

344
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,200
They even swore to leave the alliance
and never come back!

345
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,240
Such a serious matter
has happened to our alliance.

346
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,120
It's unavoidable
that they lose trust in us.

347
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,320
It's normal.

348
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
Hero Zhao,

349
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,760
you're too generous.

350
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
But what these bastards did…

351
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,560
No, they are treating

352
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,720
the oath that we swore
when we entered this alliance

353
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,000
as sugarcane now!

354
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,160
They are spitting it out
after they taste its sweetness.

355
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,560
Isn't that taking advantage of us?

356
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,160
In the 100-year history
of the Five Lakes Alliance,

357
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,440
there wasn't a time

358
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,760
when a chief collaborated
with an evil clan

359
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,800
and killed his brother.

360
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,320
Seriously…

361
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,840
We still can't conclude
whether the former chief

362
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,000
has collaborated with the Ghost Valley.

363
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,200
The accusation of murdering
a brother is huge.

364
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,960
We can't stop outsiders from gossiping,

365
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,240
but how can we, the brothers,
be disturbed by such things?

366
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,920
Hero Zhao.

367
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,680
It has only been a few days,

368
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,960
but those who fought over Gao Chong's body

369
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
all died horribly.

370
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,280
Isn't this enough to explain

371
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,080
that the Ghost Valley
is avenging Gao Chong?

372
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,080
Am I right?

373
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,640
The elder of the Kongtong Sect
was killed by Happy Ghost.

374
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,600
Eagle Claw Clan's Sun Zhong died
in the middle of the street.

375
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Sixteen disciples
of the Iron Fist Gang died in an inn.

376
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,000
A letter was engraved
on each of their chests.

377
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,040
Together, they read,

378
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,520
"You kill a man of mine,
I'll exterminate your clan.

379
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,760
We, the ghosts of Mount Qingya,
seek revenge for the smallest grievance."

380
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,040
Now, everyone
in the martial arts world is anxious.

381
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,320
There are many complaints
about the Five Lakes Alliance too.

382
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,760
If we can't survive this,

383
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,600
the departure of Jujing Gang
and Golden Tiger Clans is just the start.

384
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,280
Although I'm not talented,

385
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,240
PROFOUND EXPECTATIONS

386
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,640
I truly know

387
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,120
that the more difficult it is,

388
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,280
the more united we have to be.

389
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,640
The Five Lakes Alliance
didn't rise to the top

390
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,880
in just one day.

391
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,040
We must forge ahead

392
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,360
to show the world our resolution.

393
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,560
We are faced with such a crisis.
It's indeed unfortunate.

394
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,440
However,

395
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,880
as long as you leaders trust me,

396
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,760
I'll try my best

397
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,000
to protect the reputation
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

398
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,360
I'll let the Five Lakes Alliance grow
for another 100 years!

399
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,960
-Well said!
-Well said!

400
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,120
You disrespectful old man.

401
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,480
You ill-mannered kid.

402
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,200
Stop taking advantage of me.

403
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,560
Who's your kid?

404
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,640
How old can you be?

405
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,280
How dare you act
like some talented senior?

406
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm not your senior.

407
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,520
I'm your forefather.

408
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,120
You old monster!

409
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,760
JUJING GANG

410
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,520
I'm so angry!

411
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,320
Chief, you should reconsider
quitting from the Five Lakes Alliance.

412
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,360
Reconsider?

413
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,800
Zhao Jing is unambitious and weak.

414
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,000
He's not a good leader.

415
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,240
If he's the chief,

416
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,360
the alliance will be doomed
sooner or later!

417
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,720
What's wrong?

418
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,280
We can draw a dragon or a tiger,
but not its bones.

419
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,720
We can recognize a man by his appearance,
but not his heart.

420
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,400
Chief Wang.

421
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,400
We have similar thoughts

422
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,760
and a strong friendship,

423
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,880
but you insult me behind my back.

424
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,960
As your brother, I'm so hurt.

425
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,520
Yes!

426
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,800
Wang Moxuan,
are you looking down on us now?

427
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,320
Why don't you kneel
and apologize to Chief?

428
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,000
Our chief is generous.

429
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,400
He might forgive you
for being muddleheaded once.

430
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,280
The Four Assassins?

431
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,320
The Scorpion Sect?

432
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Chief Zhao.

433
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,240
So the rumors are real.

434
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,400
You're indeed doing dirty deeds
with the Scorpion Sect.

435
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,000
Shut up!

436
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,040
Moxuan, you've misunderstood.

437
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,960
The Scorpion Sect now belongs
to the Five Lakes Alliance.

438
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,160
From now onwards, we are brothers.

439
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,000
We shall get along in harmony.

440
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,720
How can Jujing Gang

441
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,080
collaborate with the Scorpion Sect?

442
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,400
Guards! Escort the guests out!

443
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,640
Someone!

444
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,120
You…

445
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,560
What did you do to my brothers?

446
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,240
Moxuan, don't panic.

447
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,880
There are rumors in the martial arts world

448
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,000
that the Jujing Gang
is trying to split the alliance.

449
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,440
I don't think that's your intention.

450
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,240
Your subordinates must be the ones

451
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,520
who spread the rumors.

452
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,160
Am I right?

453
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,120
In your dreams!

454
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,720
We, the Jujing Gang,

455
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,200
are cutting ties
with the Five Lakes Alliance!

456
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,560
Kill me if you dare!

457
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,760
Chief!

458
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,240
-You…
-Chief!

459
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,360
Xie'er! Why did you kill him?

460
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,120
-Chief!
-Godfather, didn't you hear him?

461
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,480
He said we could kill him if we dared to.

462
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,560
-Chief!
-I think I do.

463
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,600
Nonsense!

464
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,360
I thought you had reformed yourself.

465
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,960
How can you kill a man like that?

466
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,840
Leave!

467
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,520
Yes.

468
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,720
WOLONG

469
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,960
Master Ye.

470
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,960
Do you want some nuts?
They are from Wolong's.

471
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,640
They are really nice and crispy.

472
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,840
You little brat.

473
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,760
-Are you being lazy again?
-No.

474
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,000
I've trained for half a day.

475
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,880
Mr. Wen asked me to have more nuts

476
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,240
as a supplement
that can enhance my martial arts skills.

477
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,560
You have so many excuses.

478
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,280
You can't take the whole bag away
even if they are tasty.

479
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,560
Leave me some.

480
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,480
Stop being lazy.
Continue with your practice.

481
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
WANGCHEN INN

482
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,200
WOLONG

483
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,080
Come.

484
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,520
WANGCHEN INN

485
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,400
Master, I didn't make a mistake.

486
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,720
You've practiced a few thousand times.

487
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,640
You should not make a mistake!

488
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,480
This skill is called
the "Swift Moving Steps,"

489
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,680
not "Dance Like A Bear"!

490
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,640
Your steps were worse than a spider's.

491
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,560
Again! Straighten your back!

492
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,000
Ah Xu.

493
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,160
Don't punish your disciple
with my Wolong nuts.

494
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,680
You're wasting a heavenly item.

495
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,440
I spent a long time queuing for it.

496
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,240
Master, it's too heavy.

497
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,600
I really can't straighten my back.

498
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,120
Can you decrease the weight?

499
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,640
Do you want me
to remove your legs instead?

500
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,800
Ah Xu.

501
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,520
After seeing how you teach your disciple,

502
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,440
I finally realized

503
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,080
how nice my master was.

504
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,520
Who's your master?

505
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,520
My biological father.

506
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,560
How could a father teach
his biological son?

507
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,040
No wonder you're bad at martial arts.

508
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,760
This is how a teacher
should teach a disciple.

509
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,160
Which legendary master is your disciple?

510
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,480
I didn't expect
that you're not only bad at martial arts,

511
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,640
but you also can't drink either.

512
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,360
Bottoms up.

513
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,280
Bottoms up.

514
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,200
Gather your true qi in your elixir field
to acquire strength.

515
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,440
Little idiot, it's easier to spread
than gather your qi now.

516
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,760
Spread your true qi
to your limbs and bones.

517
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,520
Move your body with the true qi.
You'll gain strength eventually.

518
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,240
Who asked you to listen to him?

519
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,880
Little idiot!

520
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,040
Breathe continuously. Gather your qi
at your Conception and Governor vessels,

521
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
like a hundred rivers
vanishing into the sea.

522
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,800
Listen to me!

523
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,640
Let your inner qi be tangible,
flowing, and free,

524
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,360
moving flexibly like a snake.

525
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,040
-Let him go!
-Ah Xu, stop it! Chengling is…

526
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,440
You two did a good job.

527
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,680
Both of you finally tortured
your disciple to death.

528
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,160
Are you satisfied now?

529
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,200
It's fine.

530
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,920
This is strange.

531
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,560
This kid was born
with much wider meridians than others.

532
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,640
Is he a genius?

533
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,600
You're right. I've realized it long ago.

534
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,920
Chengling's meridians are wide and smooth,

535
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,640
like a wide river.

536
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,800
Compared to a narrow creek,

537
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,040
we need more time to fill it up.

538
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,280
His skills were not improving
not because he wasn't trying hard.

539
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,160
Master, what's happening to me?

540
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,120
There's actually such a strange guy
in this world.

541
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,120
He's clumsy,
but he has marvelous sinews and bones.

542
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,520
Are the heavens favoring you or not?

543
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,760
Even if he has an excellent body,

544
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,800
he's a disciple of Ah Xu.

545
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,320
Don't have bad intentions
after realizing his potential.

546
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,600
I've seen better ones.

547
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,200
Are you still drinking?

548
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,840
Certainly.

549
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,680
-I'm not afraid of you. Come on!
-Stand up.

550
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,560
Ah Xu, you're my witness.

551
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,840
Today,

552
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,160
I'll keep drinking until this old monster
calls me his father!

553
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,240
Little brat, stop bluffing. Come!

554
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,240
Come!

555
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,400
Chengling, are you all right?

556
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,560
If you really can't stand it,

557
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
just train for one more hour.

558
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,960
He has strangely good sinews and bones.

559
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,560
You can push him hard.

560
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,680
He won't die soon.

561
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,440
Why are you so talkative? Drink more!

562
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,520
-Come!
-Cheers!

563
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,760
How did, Yu Qiufeng, that idiot

564
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,960
start working with Tragicomic Ghost?

565
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,440
Wuyang, how old did the girl
who helped him

566
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,160
with the abduction looked like?

567
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,040
Godfather.

568
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,560
I'm sorry. I can't tell.

569
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,400
Judging from her appearance,
she's slightly more than 20 at most,

570
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,240
but her skills were fierce.

571
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,320
They don't seem to be done
by a young girl.

572
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,480
I didn't go in person
and carry out your command.

573
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,600
Please punish me, Godfather.

574
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,520
I only asked you to order Scorpion Sect
to abduct Tragicomic Ghost,

575
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,280
not to stop those people
from abducting her.

576
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,240
Even those skillful assassins died.

577
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,400
You're still young.

578
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,880
How can you defeat
the chief of the Mount Hua Sect?

579
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,880
I wouldn't blame you.

580
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,640
Throughout these years,

581
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,360
you've earned the trust
of the chief of the Yueyang Sect

582
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,600
and helped me with many things.

583
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,280
Huairen and you are both good kids.

584
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,600
But…

585
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,000
Huairen couldn't make it to today.

586
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,680
Godfather!

587
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,240
Godfather, it's too rushed.

588
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,800
I can only set it up as how it was
at the Sanbai Manor.

589
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,320
But…

590
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,200
I still don't know which screen to choose.

591
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,720
Do you want one with clouds and mountains,

592
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,080
or one with birds?

593
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,360
Godfather,

594
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,920
who is this?

595
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,400
You may leave first.

596
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,320
Yes.

597
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,320
Xie'er, you may make your own decisions
on such a small matter.

598
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,160
You may stay there once you set it up.

599
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,200
I'll stay here.

600
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,280
That won't do.

601
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,400
Look how shabby this place is.

602
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,840
How can you stay here?

603
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,080
I'm a man
with great ambitions and expectations.

604
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,040
All these years,
I pretended to go after wealth

605
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,719
and indulge myself in enjoyment.

606
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,320
My goal

607
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,040
was to confuse those shortsighted people.

608
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,960
But now…

609
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,520
YIXIANG HALL

610
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,960
I've already become a strong power
in the martial arts world.

611
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,040
I don't have to pretend anymore.

612
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,880
Yes.

613
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,159
Godfather, you're right.

614
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,120
But I've set everything up.

615
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,920
Godfather.

616
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,960
I picked everything myself.

617
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,480
Xie'er.

618
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,560
A man shouldn't be distracted
by other things.

619
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,800
What I dislike the most are

620
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,720
your impetuous and distracting thoughts.

621
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,000
You have to focus.

622
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,280
You must put all your effort
into your main task.

623
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,560
Complete what I've ordered you
to do first.

624
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Yes.

625
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,880
Let me go first!

626
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,760
Drink more! Cheers! Bottoms up!

627
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,040
Why should I?

628
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,600
Your mouth is big.

629
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,080
I…

630
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,640
How is my mouth big?

631
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,600
Ah Xu!

632
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,240
Ah Xu!

633
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,280
Ah Xu!

634
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,160
This old monster said
that I have a big mouth.

635
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,600
My mouth is just the right size.

636
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,240
Ah Xu!

637
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,040
I found it!

638
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,960
You have some gray hair.

639
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,040
How dare you say I'm like an old lady?
It's you who looks like one.

640
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,240
What's wrong with having a few gray hairs?

641
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
You're being too dramatic.

642
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,040
You're right.

643
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,160
I don't even know how long you,
the old monster, have lived for.

644
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,000
What's wrong with having a few gray hairs?

645
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,440
But Mr. Ye.

646
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,600
How old exactly are you?

647
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,560
I can't remember.

648
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,560
Anyway, I could have died long ago.

649
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,000
Ah Xu!

650
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,280
Ah Xu!

651
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,840
I…

652
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,760
I…

653
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,640
Go to sleep.

654
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,200
It's fine. I'm not drunk.

655
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,600
I don't want to repeat myself.

656
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,040
Little brat.

657
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,480
You're still young.

658
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,880
Why don't you want to live?

659
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,080
Who told you that?

660
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,720
Your nails didn't give you
a hard time recently, right?

661
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,320
Aren't you too happy?

662
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,440
It's a countdown to death.

663
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,440
Your organs are weakening.

664
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,640
Your vitality can't stop
your internal injuries from worsening.

665
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,080
So it won't make you suffer.

666
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,400
I just don't understand.

667
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,680
Many people who deserve
to die in this world

668
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,880
are doing everything possible to survive.

669
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,600
Why don't you want to live?

670
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,200
I have only two choices in my life.

671
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,520
Live peacefully

672
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,240
or die peacefully.

673
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,960
No one can force me to take a third path.

674
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,520
Little Qin, your disciple is so silly.

675
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Are all the young men now so silly?

676
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
Changqing,

677
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,880
were we like this

678
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,520
when we were young?

679
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,440
I can't remember.

680
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,240
I've lived for too long.

681
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,360
I can't remember.

682
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,160
WANGCHEN INN

683
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,400
Ah Xu.

684
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,920
Come. Let's drink.

685
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,480
What are you looking at?

686
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,400
Does it hurt?

687
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,440
Why don't you give it a try?

688
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,520
Look.

689
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,120
It has been so many years,

690
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,440
I've only met you,
my only friend with similar ideas.

691
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,920
Can you not die?

692
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,440
I'll try my best.

693
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,720
Turn around. Look at me.

694
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,520
Say it again.

695
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,160
I don't want to look at you.

696
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,320
I can't stand your pretentious actions,

697
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,080
with a mask

698
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,120
and not being truthful at all.

699
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
I'm just…

700
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,720
I'm just scared…

701
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,560
You're scared of my illness

702
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,240
and that I'll die anytime soon,

703
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,040
so you acted along with me
and protected me purposely.

704
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,120
Lao Wen.

705
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,200
Are you pitying me

706
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,440
or humiliating me?

707
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Don't leave!

708
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
I'm not leaving.

709
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,280
When you're sober,

710
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,240
I'll punch you in the face.

711
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,840
You know that I'm dying soon,

712
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,000
but you still brush me off
with your fake actions.

713
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,160
They are not fake.

714
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,040
They're real.

715
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,480
You really deserve to be beaten up.

716
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,600
Hurry up and sleep!

717
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,520
I won't die too soon.

718
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,520
Life is short.

719
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,480
You should cherish it more.

720
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,600
Little brat.

721
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,280
I've said it.

722
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,280
I bet that I'm not wrong.

723
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,920
I bet that

724
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,560
you'll open up to me one day.

725
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,560
If I don't see my victory,

726
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,120
even God

727
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,400
can't take me away.

728
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,800
"Open up"?

729
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,080
Human hearts are evil.

730
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,240
What's so good about looking into mine?

731
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,160
I can only help you

732
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,680
after I see it.

733
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,000
Just sleep.

734
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,880
After looking into it,

735
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,320
you won't see me as your friend.
