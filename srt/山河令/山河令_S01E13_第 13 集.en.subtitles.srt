1
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,080
It's raining
and the girl is getting married.

2
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,160
The kid has grown up. We can't stop her.

3
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,360
Why should you hold her up?

4
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,280
I think Mr. Cao
looks like a responsible man.

5
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,200
And they suit each other in appearance.

6
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,680
Suit each other?

7
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,440
No way.

8
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,320
Bullshit.

9
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,040
You were the one
who asked Ah Xiang to get a husband.

10
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,160
But you're also the one who
can't stand her being with someone else.

11
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,320
Lao Wen.

12
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
Aren't you contradicting yourself?

13
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,120
You're the one who always finds ways
to hide from me.

14
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,760
But you're also the one who wants
to wander around the world with me.

15
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,920
Aren't you contradicting yourself?

16
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,960
Let me ask you.

17
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,760
When you were coaxing
Cao Weining just now,

18
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,280
which words of yours are true?

19
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,200
Which are not?

20
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,080
Some of them are true, some are not.

21
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Take a guess.

22
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,600
CHONGWU PALACE

23
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,160
A thousand feet deep
The Peach Blossom Lake may be

24
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,960
It could not compare
With Wang Lun's love for me

25
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,120
What is love supposed to be?

26
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,320
Why would lovers die for it?

27
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,720
What phrases are you mumbling?

28
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,240
Ah Xiang, I'm feeling emotional.

29
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,400
Life is too short,
so live it to the fullest.

30
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,440
Look, how lucky are Mr. Zhou and Mr. Wen

31
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,640
to become soul mates

32
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,600
and go through thin and thick together.

33
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,520
But too bad that the heavens
are playing with them.

34
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,960
Mr. Zhou is severely ill.

35
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,240
If he passes away one day,

36
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,800
Mr. Wen will lose his soul mate.

37
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,960
Why are you worrying about him?

38
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,240
He can't just stay
with a guy forever, right?

39
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,480
You're wrong.

40
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,280
Ah Xiang.

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,200
Let me tell you a story.

42
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,400
-I don't want to hear it.
-I want to tell you.

43
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,880
My Master Fan

44
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,600
is a handsome man,

45
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,960
but he has never married.

46
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,240
I was naive when I was little

47
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,160
and asked him why he didn't marry.

48
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,560
He told me,

49
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,960
"A man might have many encounters
throughout his life,

50
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,560
but there's only one person

51
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,720
who truly belongs to him and fits him.

52
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,920
If he can't find one,

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,200
he would just muddle along with his life.

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,720
It doesn't matter who he stays with.

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
He would be happy too.

56
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,880
But if you really find that one person…

57
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
It's like a sword

58
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,800
and its original scabbard.

59
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,240
Once they are on intimate terms…

60
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,920
If it loses its scabbard,

61
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,480
it will never find another one."

62
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,720
Isn't it just a scabbard?
It's not expensive.

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,400
You can just make another one.

64
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,280
A customized one. It will definitely fit.

65
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,080
You can do that with a sword,
but what about a man?

66
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,480
You mean my master and Sick…

67
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,280
Zhou Xu?

68
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,360
They do look good together.

69
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,880
I grew up with my master since young,

70
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,000
I've never seen him being so…

71
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,680
So lively.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,360
Did…

73
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,120
Did your master treat you well?

74
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,520
Of course.
There are not many men in our sect,

75
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,920
so we are as close as a family.

76
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,920
Our sect will come

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,920
to Yueyang Sect soon.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,520
I would like to invite you to meet them.

79
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
No.

80
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,120
I would like to show you to them.

81
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,760
What's so good about me?

82
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,320
-I'm ugly and fierce.
-Nonsense.

83
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,760
I like how you look.

84
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,280
How are you ugly?

85
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,360
When I was young,
I couldn't understand my master's story

86
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,240
about the sword and the scabbard.

87
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,920
But…

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,960
But I hope…

89
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,800
to show you to many of my relatives.

90
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,880
I hope to let them know

91
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
that I have finally

92
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,000
understood it.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,880
You want to show me as an example?

94
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,160
You shouldn't bring me then.

95
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,120
Ah Xiang, you're kind and good-looking.

96
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,760
There is certainly
the right man around you

97
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,080
who admires you secretly.

98
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,240
"A right man"?

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,040
Why can't I see one?

100
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,480
I can only see…

101
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,200
an idiot!

102
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,080
A right man?

103
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,280
I'm only here to take care of Chengling,

104
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,160
join in the fun,

105
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,680
and learn how to be a better human.

106
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,360
Sword and scabbard?

107
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,680
Idiot.

108
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,520
HANBI PAVILION

109
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,240
Long and long the white hair is,

110
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,320
everlasting my sorrow could be.

111
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,320
Master, we have sorted the medicine out.

112
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,480
Please remember to take them
on time every day.

113
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,320
Shall I find a girl

114
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,760
to remind you of it every day?

115
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,120
Stop nagging. Don't make any mistakes.

116
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,840
If the lunatic is crazy again,

117
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,160
I won't save you.

118
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,600
Don't worry. I'm prepared for it.

119
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,960
Master, please take care of yourself.

120
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,560
Qianqiao, come back right after
you're done with your task.

121
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,039
Remember. Never cause unnecessary trouble.

122
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,799
I understand.

123
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
I'll leave now.

124
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,880
Qianqiao.

125
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,440
Master, do you have any commands?

126
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,720
Remember to bring your rain gear.

127
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,120
There will be heavy rain tomorrow.

128
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,680
All right.

129
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,640
GREAT WISDOM

130
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,160
Elder Huang.

131
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,520
I'm sorry for coming this early

132
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,680
without prior notice.

133
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,480
Chief Yu, a nobleman should never come
to such an inferior place.

134
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,040
You're the chief of the Mount Hua Sect.

135
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,840
Why are you here

136
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,920
at the beggars' territory
so early in the morning?

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,680
I'm here today

138
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,000
to bring some gifts to the Beggar Gangs.

139
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,840
Really?

140
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,280
Your Mount Hua Sect and my Beggar Gangs

141
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,960
are not that close.

142
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,360
Chief Yu.

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,040
Do you know
that Gao Chong has turned against me?

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,920
Aren't you afraid that your master

145
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,080
will be mad at you
because of our interaction?

146
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,400
I was blinded
and treated my enemy as a friend.

147
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,800
I'll take the blame

148
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,160
if you look down on me.

149
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,040
But nothing can beat
the grief of losing my son.

150
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,800
Even if I'm good-for-nothing,

151
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
I will never let them get away from it.

152
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,840
Who had the guts to kill the son
of Mount Hua Sect's chief?

153
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,280
Is it Ghost Valley?

154
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,560
It's the Five Lakes Alliance!

155
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,360
This Soul Winding Spell is indeed useful.

156
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,640
Long-Tongued Ghost didn't lie to me.

157
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,240
How could you, the lowly Mount Hua Sect,

158
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,960
dare to touch the Glazed Armor?

159
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,680
You have no proof.

160
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,040
The witness had died.

161
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,120
And you lost your evidence.

162
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,840
Just by your words

163
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,040
and its connection
with the Soul Winding Spell…

164
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,280
Even if the Mount Tai Sect
makes an accusation,

165
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,240
it's still hard to overthrow

166
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,960
the chief of the Five Lakes Alliance.

167
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,520
Elder Huang, I know another big secret.

168
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,640
It's enough to ruin the reputation
of Gao Chong and the Five Lakes Alliance.

169
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,800
Say it.

170
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,960
Twenty years ago,

171
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,240
the Five Lakes Alliance
with heroes around the world

172
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,880
punished Rong Xuan,
who had become a demon.

173
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,800
After Rong Xuan died,
the alliance secretly split

174
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,600
the five pieces of the Armor
among themselves.

175
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,640
Each of them hid a piece.

176
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,400
Those heroes

177
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,800
didn't even know that their sacrifices

178
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,480
were a waste of effort
to fulfill the greed

179
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,520
of those people!

180
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,040
Elder Huang,

181
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,440
many died in the Beggar Gangs,

182
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,640
not because of us,
the Five Mount and Sword Sects.

183
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,120
Once this is exposed,

184
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,800
the Five Lakes Alliance
might not collapse right away,

185
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,880
but they will lose the right to rule

186
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,640
the rest of the Glazed Armor pieces.

187
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,560
In terms of morality and ability,

188
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,120
the Beggar Gangs are most suitable

189
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,640
to lead the martial arts world.

190
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,360
By then, we shall force the alliance
to hand over their Glazed Armor

191
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,240
and let the Beggar Gangs lead the heroes
to fight against the Ghost Valley.

192
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,040
Even a coward

193
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,040
is turning his back
on the Five Lakes Alliance now.

194
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,040
The trend has changed.

195
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,680
Gao Chong is coming to his end.

196
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,320
GOOD LUCK INN

197
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,680
Ah Xu.

198
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,760
What are you doing?

199
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,440
My goodness.

200
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,720
Why are you disguising yourself suddenly?

201
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Remove it.

202
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,800
Don't touch me.

203
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,720
Don't talk to me with this face,

204
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,160
but in Ah Xu's voice.

205
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,880
It's so horrifying. I'll have nightmares.

206
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,600
Look how manly I am.

207
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,200
How about…

208
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,200
-I disguise myself like back then?
-No.

209
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,480
This looks better.

210
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,040
I shall make myself handsome then.

211
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,640
You look the best as yourself.
Stop disguising yourself.

212
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,800
This is for you.

213
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,640
I don't need it.

214
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,040
My face

215
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,920
is the masterpiece of the heavens.

216
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You're ruining a treasure if you stain it.

217
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,840
You'll be punished by the heavens.

218
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,920
Jokes aside.

219
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,680
The Heroes Conference is being held soon.

220
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,800
Although Chengling has handed over
his Glazed Armor,

221
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,480
Gao Chong hasn't announced it publicly.

222
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,720
So many people might still

223
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,520
have their eyes on Zhang's orphan.

224
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,880
We were revealed.

225
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,200
The enemies are hiding, but we're exposed.

226
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,960
It's necessary to disguise ourselves.

227
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,520
Your face

228
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,360
is too outstanding.

229
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I don't need it.

230
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,480
Did I mishear you just now?

231
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,880
Ah Xu.

232
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,280
Finally,

233
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,640
you've admitted that I'm good-looking.

234
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,800
Don't worry.

235
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,440
I am a forefather of trouble.

236
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,200
All trouble will avoid me.

237
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,480
Don't worry.

238
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,720
So, you're not pretending
to be Philanthropist Wen,

239
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,160
but a forefather of trouble?

240
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,560
Since when was I pretending?

241
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,400
I am indeed a kindhearted man.

242
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,600
What is this for?

243
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,520
Do you apply this to your face?

244
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,320
This can change
the structure of a person's face.

245
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,360
For example,
a person's nose or cheekbones.

246
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,080
What about this?

247
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,320
Stop touching.

248
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,280
-I want to know.
-It's a hip pad.

249
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,480
What about this red one?

250
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,200
If you want to know everything,

251
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,440
why don't you kneel down

252
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,480
and show your respects now?

253
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,960
Call me Master

254
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,480
and I'll teach you everything.

255
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,240
It's just an insignificant skill,

256
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,920
why are you so cautious to pass it on?

257
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,600
So are you learning or not?

258
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,880
Let me ask you.

259
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,400
Can you really transform yourself

260
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,000
into anyone with this skill?

261
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,680
It's not hard to imitate

262
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,320
a person's appearance and voice.

263
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,080
But everyone has their own speaking habits

264
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,920
and unique posture.

265
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,800
Everyone is different.

266
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,400
So, you have to be either very familiar
with the one who you're imitating,

267
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,600
or others have to be unfamiliar

268
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,360
with the one who you're imitating.

269
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,560
Otherwise, you'll be exposed easily.

270
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,040
I guess that if I imitate you,

271
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,040
your silly disciple
will surely fall for it.

272
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,400
With your skills?

273
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,480
How dare you imitate
my incomparable elegance?

274
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,280
The sea turned into a plain land

275
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,720
The snow on the mountains

276
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,600
Disappeared among the clouds

277
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,800
In my eyes

278
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,960
Thousands of years fade like dust

279
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,160
Yet my heart

280
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,760
Is still as before

281
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,120
-Why?
-Make others do the dirty work.

282
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Let those righteous men
bite on each other.

283
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,720
Isn't that good?

284
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,360
I mean…

285
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,480
Why do you want me to do this?

286
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,320
Since you got out of the valley,

287
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,560
you often spied on this man.

288
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,720
Don't think that I don't know.

289
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Chief.

290
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,520
In this case,

291
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
you shall have a good look at him.

292
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,320
Die early and revive early.

293
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,360
I thought I had forgotten everything.

294
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,680
But I forgot nothing.

295
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,520
I remember

296
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,000
everything about you clearly

297
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
as if it was yesterday.

298
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,560
Qiufeng.

299
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,040
I've been through two lives.

300
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,480
Why can't I get rid of my yearning?

301
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,000
YUEYANG SECT

302
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,880
YUEYANG SECT

303
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,480
YE BAIYI
MOUNT CHANGMING SWORD IMMORTAL

304
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,280
I, Chief of the Five Lakes Alliance,
Gao Chong,

305
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
am here to welcome you, Sword Immortal.

306
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,400
-Greetings, Sword Immortal.
-Greetings, Sword Immortal.

307
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,440
Are you talking to me?

308
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,560
You brat.

309
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,520
How dare you?

310
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,200
Gao Chong is here to welcome
Mount Changming Sword Immortal.

311
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
How dare you simply accept
my big brother's greetings?

312
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,840
Gao Shan! Where's the Sword Immortal?

313
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,440
It's…

314
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,880
He's the young hero.

315
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,440
You're Gao Chong?

316
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,760
So you're Shen Shen then.

317
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,160
How dare a brat like you call
my big brother's name?

318
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,920
Young hero.

319
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,840
Are you here on behalf of
Mount Changming Sword Immortal?

320
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,760
Take your Token of Honor!

321
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
TOKEN OF HONOR

322
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,120
Young hero, may I know who you are?

323
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,400
Ye Baiyi.

324
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,160
Young Hero Ye, what are you doing now?

325
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,320
Mount Changming Sword Immortal

326
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,720
swore to the first-generation owner
of the Token of Honor

327
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,640
that once the Ghost Valley brings harm
to the martial arts world,

328
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,320
the person with the token

329
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,040
can invite the Sword Immortal
out of his mountain

330
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,280
to demolish the ghosts
and wipe out the Ghost Valley.

331
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,240
Am I not here?

332
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,200
Young hero,

333
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,120
the Heroes Conference is being held soon.

334
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,400
Righteous men from the martial arts world
have gathered here

335
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,080
to discuss ways
to demolish the Ghost Valley.

336
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,160
The Sword Immortal is a celestial master

337
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,800
and a famous senior.

338
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,680
It's good that you're here
on behalf of Sword Immortal.

339
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,680
-But--
-But no one promised to attend

340
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,080
the conference or anything.

341
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,640
The day we reunite with the Token of Honor

342
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,280
is the end of Mount Qingya.

343
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,400
When you're done with your nonsense,

344
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,800
the Sword Immortal will keep his promise
and help the person with the token

345
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,600
to wipe out the Ghost Valley
at Mount Qingya.

346
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,520
Stop troubling me with other matters.

347
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,640
This man is young,

348
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,720
but why does he have such great power?

349
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,040
He looks unordinary

350
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,560
and unshakable.

351
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,280
Men of the Sword Immortal
are indeed unfathomable.

352
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,760
Gu Xiang.

353
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,400
You are…

354
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,680
Who are you?

355
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,560
Master?

356
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,160
I missed you very much.

357
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,080
Let me have a look at you.

358
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,200
It has been just a few days,
but you look exhausted.

359
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,400
Did you not rest well?

360
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,360
I can't sleep every day.

361
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,120
The Heroes Conference
will be held in a few days.

362
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,840
I am anxious.

363
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,000
A kid shouldn't be worried about this.

364
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,760
By then, you just have to show up,

365
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,200
prove that the Mirror Lake Sect
has not been put to an end yet,

366
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,400
and demonstrate your devotion.

367
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,080
After that, I'll take you away.

368
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,000
It's not too late to start worrying
about the disputes

369
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,320
in this martial arts world
when you've grown up.

370
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,000
Master.

371
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,040
I don't know.

372
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,360
Mr. Gao came to me suddenly.

373
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,640
He was determined
to betroth Xiaolian to me

374
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,600
so that she can help me support
the Mirror Lake Sword Sect in the future.

375
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,440
During the Heroes Conference,
he will announce this news.

376
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,760
Two years later, when I'm older,

377
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,080
we will have our wedding.

378
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,360
Master.

379
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,400
I've handed them the Glazed Armor.

380
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,400
Why is Mr. Gao still treating me well?

381
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,320
Actually, Xiaolian treats me well too.

382
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,600
If Mr. Gao really announces this news,

383
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,320
won't they be in an awkward situation

384
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,600
after I leave with you?

385
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,160
I didn't dare to refuse either.

386
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,560
Chengling has handed over
the Glazed Armor.

387
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,560
So I came to ask you.

388
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,840
What's his worth to Gao Chong?

389
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,080
So I couldn't sleep the whole night.

390
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,520
Don't think too much for now.
We shall keep an eye on them.

391
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,600
No matter what, I'll protect you secretly.

392
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,520
Master Zhang,
are you done with your dinner?

393
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,040
Do you need anything else?

394
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,160
No. It's fine.

395
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,080
I'll go in and clean them up then.

396
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,240
I can clean them up by myself.

397
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,240
All right.

398
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,640
Gao Chong does not have a son.

399
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,120
Gao Xiaolian is his only daughter.

400
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,000
No matter what his reason
for keeping Chengling close,

401
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,040
he doesn't have to do this.

402
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,560
Is Gao Chong turning over a new leaf?

403
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,200
Does he want to make up
for the mistakes he made to Rong Xuan?

404
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,320
If I'm not mistaken,

405
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,120
Lao Wen is Rong Xuan's son.

406
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,960
I must find a chance

407
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,080
to resolve their grudges.

408
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,240
LUO MANSION

409
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,720
FROSTED DEW

410
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,520
It's so annoying.

411
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,240
They said that we are sisters forever,
but no one would go with me to the toilet.

412
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,360
-Kill them!
-Yes!

413
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,960
LUO MANSION

414
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,920
Master.

415
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,280
I've searched through them.

416
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,640
None of them are alive.

417
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,000
-Good.
-A total of 47 devils were killed.

418
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,680
That was nice!

419
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,440
We finally released our anger!

420
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,560
Very good.

421
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,240
Everyone in the martial arts world
says that

422
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,520
the Ghost Valley is like a scourge.

423
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,720
Now I see

424
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,720
that they are just a motley crowd.

425
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,320
How many casualties are there?

426
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,680
Unfortunately, four juniors died.

427
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,120
Five were severely injured
and four with minor injuries.

428
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,080
Gao Chong.

429
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,240
All casualties were caused
by this demonic woman.

430
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,160
The Master of the Unfaithful List
with white hair and a red dress.

431
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,320
Are you Tragicomic Ghost?

432
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Stop your rubbish.

433
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,520
Kill me if you have the capability!

434
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,720
How dare you?

435
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,560
Bring her back to the Five Lakes Alliance.

436
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,480
Watch her closely!

437
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,840
This demon's skull will be the sacrifice
of the Heroes Conference!

438
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,040
Yes.

439
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,920
Waiter.

440
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,920
Who is this man?

441
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,880
Sir, this guy is amazing.

442
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,280
He's so thin,

443
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,320
but he seems to have an abyss
in his stomach.

444
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,320
I wonder where all the food has gone.

445
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,280
He's really an incomparable glutton.

446
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,280
He has been eating for almost six hours.

447
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
-Yes.
-My legs are already numb.

448
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,040
-Sir, aren't you tired of chewing?
-How can he eat so much?

449
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,920
No.

450
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,760
This man's appetite

451
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,480
can beat ours.

452
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,280
This man looks young.

453
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,440
Why does he feel like
some peerless master?

454
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,120
Like a supreme master under the surface.

455
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,200
I'm done.

456
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,680
-Sir, you're finally done.
-He's done eating.

457
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,600
Well, can you pay now?

458
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,960
Who's treating me?

459
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,560
-What?
-What?

460
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,080
-What?
-This is ridiculous.

461
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,040
-He's unwilling to pay.
-Who does he think he is?

462
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,560
What did you say? Who's treating you?

463
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,760
I'll offer my help to whoever treats me.

464
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,680
-I'll treat you!
-All right.

465
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,960
-All right.
-Let's go.

466
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Let's go.

467
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
I'll treat you.

468
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,240
Good.

469
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,680
What's your name?

470
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,600
It's Wen. Wen Kexing.

471
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,800
Sir, how may I call you?

472
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,080
Call me Ye Baiyi. Thank you for the meal.

473
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,760
What?

474
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,960
Give me money.

475
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,920
Wait a minute.

476
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,160
Who's treating me to the meal?

477
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,440
You can treat me.

478
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,040
But not you.

479
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,560
Sir, I'm sorry for not knowing it,

480
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,560
but do we have to be qualified

481
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,440
to treat you?

482
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,680
Of course not.

483
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,560
But I can't help you.

484
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,760
I haven't said it yet.

485
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,960
You're indeed dying because of yourself.

486
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,960
But even a saint
would have five symptoms before his death.

487
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
It's miserable.

488
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,320
How can you, a dying person,

489
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,640
wander around here?

490
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,480
The young excel the old.

491
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,400
There are more interesting people
in the Central Plain's martial arts world.

492
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,280
How about this?

493
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,480
I'll go back and think about it.

494
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,120
Why don't you treat me
to some wine next time?

495
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,440
I might think of a solution.

496
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,480
SHIMEI PAVILION

497
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,920
I still didn't get any news about Tianjie.

498
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,360
Is it really hopeless?

499
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,240
Qiufeng, what are you upset about?

500
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,040
Are you going to harm me?

501
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,000
Qianqiao.

502
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,040
Qianqiao.

503
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,000
You didn't die?

504
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,600
Of course I'm dead.

505
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,640
Your wife was superb in martial arts.

506
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,600
She hit me twice and stabbed me once.

507
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,160
How could I not die?

508
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,160
But the injuries weren't fatal.

509
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,360
Then your wife stripped and disfigured me,

510
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,880
and forced me to parade for three days.

511
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,280
She let everyone
in the martial arts world know

512
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,960
that I, Liu Qianqiao the Green Siren,
was not only lewd and shameless

513
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,640
but also a disfigured ugly woman.

514
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,560
Which woman in this world

515
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,000
can endure such embarrassment

516
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,480
and live surreptitiously?

517
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,480
Qianqiao,

518
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,400
stop it.

519
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,080
I'm begging you. Can you stop?

520
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,440
Why?

521
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,880
I just mentioned it,

522
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,400
but you couldn't bear to hear it.

523
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,120
What about the pain
I've suffered personally then?

524
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,160
Qiufeng.

525
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,800
Although I'm a woman
who doesn't deserve pity,

526
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,320
why should I take all the blame

527
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,800
for both of our mistakes?

528
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,280
Qianqiao.

529
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,720
I know that you hate and resent me.

530
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,360
I have nothing to say.

531
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,720
Even if you kill me,

532
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,040
my sin can't be offset.

533
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,600
But I'm begging you.
Can you stop saying it?

534
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,480
These past years,

535
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,320
am I not suffering too?

536
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,000
I wanted to kill the evil woman
and take revenge for you.

537
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,840
But after all, she gave birth to Tianjie.

538
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,840
I wanted to commit suicide
and accompany you.

539
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,440
-Yes. You should have died.
-But I--

540
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,000
Didn't you promise to die together?

541
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,600
Look.

542
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,320
I'm already a ghost. What about you?

543
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,720
Qianqiao.

544
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,200
I still think that I don't deserve to die.

545
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,160
I have made you suffer so much.

546
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,280
I shall yearn for you every day.

547
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,440
I shall suffer every day.

548
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,560
Qianqiao.

549
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,520
Since I've seen you today,

550
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,760
I have no resentment

551
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,560
even if I die now.

552
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,360
The sea turned into a plain land

553
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,760
The snow on the mountains

554
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,360
Disappeared among the clouds

555
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,040
In my eyes
Thousands of years fade like dust

556
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,120
Yet my heart is still as before

557
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,480
A sinful fate.

558
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,120
Forget it, Qiufeng.

559
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,120
You can't harm me. I knew it.

560
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,560
You know it too.

561
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,840
Chief Yu.

562
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,360
There will be a disaster
if you see a ghost during the daytime.

563
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,120
I, the Beauty Ghost,
am here to give you sad news.

564
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,000
Chief Yu.

565
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,280
You can never see

566
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,680
your wife's only son again.

567
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,480
How did my son die?

568
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,040
Did you kill him?

569
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,040
I wanted to.

570
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,640
But I was too late.

571
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,600
The chief of the Ghost Valley
personally saw

572
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,000
that your son was killed
by the Soul Winding Spell.

573
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,199
Soul Winding Spell?

574
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,840
Do you mean Hanged Ghost's
Soul Winding Spell?

575
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,000
It's Ghost Valley?

576
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,159
Chief Yu,
there's something you don't know.

577
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,679
Mount Qingya's Ghost Valley is back
in the martial arts world now

578
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,960
to capture Hanged Ghost who defected.

579
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,639
Your son died of the Soul Winding Spell.

580
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,199
We have the same enemy.

581
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,360
That's why I'm here
to give you the sad news.

582
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,880
It's better than making you suffer
for the rest of your life.

583
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,120
Qianqiao.

584
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,520
I'm sorry.

585
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,159
I shouldn't have suspected you.

586
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,360
I know. No matter how the world changes,

587
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,600
even if everyone in this world
let me down,

588
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,640
you wouldn't harm me.

589
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,800
Qianqiao.

590
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,840
I, Yu Qiufeng, swear to God.

591
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,320
As long as you ask for it,

592
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,640
I'm willing to offer everything
in compensation.

593
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,480
Qianqiao.

594
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,400
Qianqiao!

595
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,760
Chief was right.

596
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,400
Die early and revive early.

597
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,200
I've died and cried,

598
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,560
but why can't I still let this man go?

599
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,240
If this is the case,

600
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,440
I should have drunk the Soup of Oblivion.

601
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,840
GOOD LUCK INN

602
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,040
-Four!
-Four!

603
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,040
-Five!
-Six!

604
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,120
Ah Xu, you lost again.

605
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,000
It seems like you've lied
about your Invincible Hand of Jin.

606
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,840
If I knew that you're so lousy,
I wouldn't agree to play Truth or Dare.

607
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,640
It seems like I'm bullying you.

608
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,600
Say it.

609
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,560
Truth or Dare?

610
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,760
Truth.

611
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,120
All right. I'll be serious then.

612
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,600
Let me ask you.

613
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,720
Today, the strange guy at the restaurant

614
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
said that you're dying
because of yourself.

615
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,280
Is he talking about your old injuries?

616
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,120
Is this your question?

617
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,560
Of course not.

618
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,480
I want to ask,

619
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,000
where did you get your injuries?

620
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
This is a command.

621
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,920
Don't be a sore loser.

622
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,520
What if I say it was karma?

623
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,840
-Will you believe me?
-No.

624
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,160
I believe that we shall act
on behalf of the heavens.

625
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,720
If Heaven won't punish those criminals,
I will do it personally.

626
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,200
I've been alive for so long.
I've caused too many troubles.

627
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,480
Most probably,
I'll go to hell after I die.

628
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,280
That's why

629
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,880
I shall atone for my sins
when I'm still alive.

630
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,480
I got my injuries because of my sins.

631
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,520
We must go through
the Cauldron of Boiling Oil.

632
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,280
Being fried for 80 years

633
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,840
is still better than being fried
for 100 years.

634
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,240
Am I not there with you
in the Cauldron of Boiling Oil?

635
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,080
We shall get twisted into a youtiao.

636
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,720
Won't that be nice and tasty?

637
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,800
Don't divert from the topic.

638
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,040
This is not the answer.

639
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,520
I'm the one who caused my injuries.

640
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,840
Why?

641
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,280
That's another question.

642
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,760
If you want to know,

643
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,400
you must win again.

644
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,760
All right. I'm not afraid. Here we go!

645
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,040
-Eight!
-Five!

646
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,080
-Six!
-Six!

647
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,120
-Three…
-Four!

648
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,520
Don't be a sore loser.

649
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,680
A sore loser?

650
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,880
I wouldn't even mind
paying you with my life.

651
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,960
I chose Truth. Just ask.

652
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,160
All right. I'll ask then.

653
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,920
You can't lie to me.

654
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,720
Since when did I lie to you?

655
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,040
Lao Wen.

656
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,280
Is your surname Rong?

657
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,240
You're Rong Xuan's son.

658
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,680
You blame the Five Lakes Alliance
and the whole martial arts world

659
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,920
for your father's death,

660
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,480
so you replicated many pieces
of the Glazed Armor.

661
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,120
You wanted them to be punished

662
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,000
because of their greed.

663
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,360
I understand your feelings.

664
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,840
Lao Wen. But--

665
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,040
Is this your question?

666
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,040
No wonder.

667
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,680
So you played and drank with me

668
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,120
just because of this question.

669
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,240
If you asked me directly,
would I not give you an answer?

670
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,720
My surname is not Rong.

671
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,440
I'm angry that I didn't get a chance
to see the guy with the surname, Rong.

672
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,720
Otherwise, I would kill him
whenever I see him.

673
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,720
Forget it. We're not chatting or drinking,

674
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,640
but provoking anger.

675
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,920
Was I wrong?

676
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,000
But Lao Wen's actions

677
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,680
and his hatred of the Five Lakes Alliance…

678
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,160
How could it make sense

679
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,640
if he's not Rong Xuan's son?

680
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,680
It's me. Ye Baiyi.

681
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,800
Follow me.

682
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,840
You've treated me to a meal,

683
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,240
so I have to do you a favor.

684
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,560
I found a way to heal your injuries.

685
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,160
But let's make it clear.

686
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,920
Don't blame me
if you die during the treatment.

687
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,920
Sir, since when did I ask for your help?

688
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,880
Who exactly are you?

689
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,680
Invincible and traceless.

690
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,720
You are the disciple of
the Four Seasons Manor's Qin Huaizhang?

691
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,040
You're right.

692
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,680
My master is Qin Huaizhang.

693
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,920
Most people in the martial arts world

694
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,680
would call him Chief respectfully.

695
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
Respectfully?

696
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,040
How dare an immature guy show off
his experience and skills in front of me?

697
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,800
Come. Show me more of your skills.

698
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,000
Let me have a look at how good

699
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,280
the disciple of that hothead,
Qin Huaizhang, is.

700
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,280
Even if you're highly skilled
in martial arts

701
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,520
and I can't defeat you,

702
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,880
I would never allow others

703
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,280
to insult my deceased master.

704
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,400
What? Qin Huaizhang died?

705
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,600
Right.

706
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,680
It has been so many years.

707
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,760
All of them had died.

708
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,400
The martial arts world belongs
to young men like you then.

709
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,520
You said that I was insulting him?

710
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,680
Let me tell you.

711
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,280
Even if Qin Huaizhang

712
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,680
is standing in front of me

713
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,160
and I scold him in his face,

714
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,960
he wouldn't dare to make a single sound.

715
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,400
Please show me your skills.

716
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,040
Your master passed you his sword?

717
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,680
Let me have a look.

718
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,200
Idiot.

719
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,000
Did you think that I would snatch it?

720
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,640
What a silly thought!

721
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,840
You're the same as
your good-for-nothing master.

722
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,280
Didn't I tell you?

723
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,280
I'm Ye Baiyi.

724
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,320
Ye Baiyi?

725
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,240
Baiyi?

726
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,640
Is the inscription
on the White Cloth Sword

727
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,400
this man's name?

728
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,400
But the White Cloth Sword was made
by the Magic Craftsman 100 years ago.

729
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,840
How old is he?

730
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,320
I gifted this sword to your master.

731
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,200
The sword should exist with its owner.

732
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,240
Now its owner is gone.

733
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,880
But the sword is still here.

734
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,000
I didn't recognize you and was being rude.

735
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,760
Please forgive me, Master.

736
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,000
Since you're the disciple
of that dumb brat,

737
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,400
I can't simply cause your death
when treating you.

738
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,360
Let me have a look at your injuries.

739
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,240
What do you want?
