1
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,520
-Master Ye.
-Immortal Ye.

2
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,520
Master Ye, you're just in time.

3
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,360
Please lead all of us
to wipe out the Ghost Valley.

4
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,480
That's right.

5
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,920
I will definitely destroy
the Ghost Valley.

6
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,920
All those from the Ghost Valley
are doomed to die.

7
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,920
Immortal Ye.

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,080
Though those evil ghosts
do endanger the martial arts world,

9
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,480
what Master Wen did was understandable.

10
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,800
"Understandable"?

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,360
It should be unforgivable!

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,600
Wen Kexing, when you took charge
of the Ghost Valley,

13
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,240
why did you break the rule,

14
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,520
"Once you join the Ghost Valley,
you'll be in hell forever

15
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,160
and unleashed the ghosts
that put the martial arts world in peril"?

16
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,240
My humble apology.

17
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,760
Good.

18
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,080
You should bear the punishment for it.

19
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,600
You must close the Ghost Valley forever

20
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,560
and restrain all the ghosts
from coming to the human world.

21
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,200
Will you do that?

22
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,240
Yes, Immortal Ye.

23
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,040
Good.

24
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,680
Then go.

25
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,520
Master Ye, what is the meaning of this?

26
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,320
What do you mean?

27
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,720
I've ordered Wen Kexing to close down
Mount Qingya forever from now on.

28
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,120
No one can enter nor leave,

29
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
in the hope that in a century,
everything is changed

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,920
and all evil ghosts will have
already started their new mortal lives.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,120
By then,
the Ghost Valley will no longer exist.

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,480
How terrific!

33
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,800
If the feud could end

34
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,960
in peace without bloodshed,

35
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,560
that would be of great merit indeed.

36
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,200
Good.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,920
The abbot of the Shaolin Sect
seems to be taking my side.

38
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,320
Then Little Nun, what's your opinion?

39
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,360
If Chief Wen

40
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,640
can really restrain the ghosts
from committing more crimes

41
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,760
and make sure that
they are in Mount Qingya,

42
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,080
that would be better
than endless acts of revenge

43
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,680
at the price of countless lives.

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,160
Is that clear, Wen Kexing?

45
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,760
Why are you still here then? Go.

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
Yes.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,240
Enough of this.

48
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,640
Enough of this.

49
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,680
That is all for the Heroes Conference.

50
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
Dismiss.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
-Amitãbha.
-Immortal Ye.

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,680
Let's go.

53
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
Let's go.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,960
Master!

55
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,200
You are so cruel.

56
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,120
Did you know I almost ran out
of tears these days?

57
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,200
Are you guilty or not?

58
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,440
I'm guilty.

59
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,400
Bottoms up!

60
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,120
Master, I am still not quite clear
about one thing.

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,360
That Sick Man said you--

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,280
I mean, Zhou Xu.

63
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,200
He claimed to have seen your body
in the Five Lakes Alliance.

64
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,880
That was someone else's body
I prepared in advance.

65
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,240
I changed his face so it resembled mine

66
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,680
and left it in the deep pool
under that waterfall.

67
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,120
If I didn't do that,

68
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,480
that old fox, Zhao Jing, wouldn't buy it.

69
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
How crafty you are!

70
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
One more!

71
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,720
No problem.

72
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,080
Gu Xiang.

73
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Handling evil with wit.

74
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
What's wrong with that?

75
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,640
Chief Shen.

76
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,200
Wasn't it you who wanted
to wipe out the Ghost Valley?

77
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,320
When did you communicate with each other?

78
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,520
Wen Kexing.

79
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,760
How dare you come here for Chengling?

80
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,920
Everyone knows your real identity now.

81
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,480
Are you the chief of the Ghost Valley?

82
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes,

83
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,680
I am.

84
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,680
I came here today

85
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,440
to tell you everything.

86
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,800
It's up to you
to judge the truth yourself.

87
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,600
So you two have conspired
to do this together a long time ago!

88
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,680
Master, you hid it from us!

89
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,800
One more!

90
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,760
Silly girl.

91
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,520
Faking my death was a risky move.

92
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,640
Without the help
of Chengling and Chief Shen,

93
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,400
how would I dare make this move?

94
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,240
Chief Shen's assistance from the inside

95
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,720
kept Zhao Jing and his gang
from approaching us

96
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,520
and suspect anything.

97
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,320
So that Sword Immortal
was covering you too?

98
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,800
Well, he--

99
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,000
he helped me a lot.

100
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,640
Without Master Ye's generous help,

101
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,280
even if I managed
to expose Zhao Jing's conspiracy,

102
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,680
but because of my identity,

103
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
could I have left the place
safe and sound?

104
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,520
I once said

105
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,320
that if I see you
in the martial arts world again,

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,720
-I will--
-I know.

107
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,280
Master Ye.

108
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,000
I was born stubborn.
I misled myself halfway.

109
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,920
I was obsessed with hatred
for half of my life.

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,720
All I cared about were conspiracies
and destroying the world.

111
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,720
I almost betrayed my parents' teachings.

112
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,720
But today,

113
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,200
I finally came to know
who my real enemy is.

114
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,680
All I want now is to charge at him
in a fair fight,

115
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,240
holding justice in the world.

116
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,760
I beg for your permission, Master Ye.

117
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,520
You are right indeed.

118
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,280
I used to be very worried

119
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,000
about what would happen to Kexing.

120
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,280
Then I gave it a thought

121
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,480
and realized that
I can't hesitate anymore.

122
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,320
As long as Gao Chong
can be proved innocent,

123
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,240
the biggest price will merely be
Kexing and I fighting to our last breath.

124
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,320
If so, my obligation
to the brotherhood can be fulfilled.

125
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,320
Master.

126
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,560
Anyway,

127
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,720
thanks to Master Ye, a true master,

128
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,880
this feud ended in peace

129
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,560
with satisfaction from all.

130
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,600
Let's toast to Master Ye together.

131
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,200
-To Master Ye!
-To Master Ye!

132
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,320
Master.

133
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,000
Mr. Wen,

134
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,120
I always consider myself
resourceful and decisive.

135
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,480
But today, I have to honestly
admit defeat to your strategy.

136
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,880
Zishu.

137
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
This junior of yours

138
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,440
is really a capable disciple
who excels his masters.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,800
Mr. Wen, I'd like to toast to you.

140
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
Mr. Wen,

141
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
I still have one question.

142
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,920
Since Zhao Jing is so evil,

143
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,080
why not take his life?

144
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,840
This is a deal
between Scorpion King and me.

145
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,480
Ms. Gao's senior disciple, Deng Kuan,
was being kept by Zhao Jing

146
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
and was made into an insensible Drug Man.

147
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,120
During the first conference,

148
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,560
it was Deng Kuan's accusing words

149
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,240
that left Chief Gao to be wronged.

150
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,560
Because of that,

151
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,880
to reveal Zhao Jing's conspiracy,

152
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,680
Deng Kuan's testimony is vital.

153
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,680
Scorpion King promised to restore
Deng Kuan's consciousness

154
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,880
at the price of sparing Zhao Jing's life.

155
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,640
What is the relationship
between the Scorpion King and Zhao Jing?

156
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,120
Was it not because
Scorpion King hated Zhao Jing

157
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,400
that he accepted your deal, Master?

158
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,600
Sick Man, did you know that
the Ten Devils were already under

159
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,840
the control of Scorpion King's
overpowering drug by then?

160
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,000
Master agreed to deal with him
to lend his army

161
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,160
-to the Window of Heaven in time--
-Gu Xiang.

162
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,560
Scorpion King went so far as to help you

163
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,800
only to take Zhao Jing's life?

164
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,800
Mr. Wen, what else did you promise him?

165
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,200
Nothing.

166
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,200
To put it simply,

167
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,200
only through a man's wit

168
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,720
can the Ghost Valley be destroyed.

169
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,680
Fate does like fooling people around.

170
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,600
My junior managed to take revenge

171
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,600
and can finally enjoy an easy life now.

172
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,800
However, the end of my life
is approaching.

173
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,400
You are all dismissed.

174
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,920
Father.

175
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,800
I told you

176
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,760
that you can't lie to me.

177
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,520
As long as you name it,

178
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
I will do anything for you.

179
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,240
You don't need to lie to me.

180
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,840
For so many years,

181
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,120
countless lives were sacrificed
because of your conspiracy,

182
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,840
including those
who loved you wholeheartedly.

183
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,400
I once hoped every day

184
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,840
that I would also die like them one day.

185
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,600
But I just can't wake a person
who pretends to be asleep.

186
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,120
It was just that I refused to think
and willingly fell for those lies

187
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,800
that made us look like
father and son living in harmony.

188
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,720
I have been hiding this from you.

189
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,320
I think your life goal is ridiculous.

190
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,440
Supreme leader of the martial arts world?

191
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,280
What's the big deal?

192
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,640
You kept saying

193
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,120
that studying Drug Men is an evil skill

194
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,000
and will not be accepted by others.

195
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,680
I respected you
as much as I could as a son, Father.

196
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,480
I am going to tell you today

197
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,920
what the real skill of an enemy
of 10,000 people is about.

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,680
The Window of Heaven
that you adored so much

199
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,520
has now become my ally.

200
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,320
Even Prince Jin
has to show his courtesy to me.

201
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,680
But you

202
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,240
looked down on me, contempt me,

203
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,120
and even intended to kill me

204
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,560
just for several nobodies
who aren't qualified to serve me!

205
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,080
For what?

206
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,160
Just because I honored and loved you?

207
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,840
Just because I could be taken for granted?
Just because I was worthless?

208
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,720
Do you really think the supreme leader
of the martial arts world

209
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,040
can take charge of the whole world?

210
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,720
I agreed to make a deal with Wen Kexing

211
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,600
because I wanted to stab you in the back

212
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
during your proudest moment,

213
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,640
just to prove to you

214
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,720
that I get to decide

215
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,200
whether to overthrow you or not

216
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,840
and how would I overthrow you!

217
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,600
Forget it.

218
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,400
You are still my foster father.

219
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,680
Though you are so disreputable,

220
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,480
in the end…

221
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,720
you are still my only family
in this world.

222
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,960
I just think that it's a pity.

223
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,200
I could have taken over this world

224
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,800
and given it to you
only for you to be happy.

225
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,360
But you--

226
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,000
you had to make the wrong choice.

227
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,280
I did give you a chance.

228
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,720
Many times, actually.

229
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,560
But you--

230
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,600
you failed me.

231
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,760
Father.

232
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,960
You're stuck in conspiracy and plots
for half of your life.

233
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,720
It must be dreary.

234
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,120
From now on,

235
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,720
please enjoy a life of happiness.

236
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,840
And allow me, your son,

237
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,600
to take good care of you.

238
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,200
Father.

239
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,200
I'll let you see

240
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,360
how I conquer a piece of land
and ascend to the throne.

241
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,440
By then, if I am in a good mood,

242
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,040
I will kill that Prince Jin

243
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,000
and announce myself as the new emperor.

244
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,760
And you, the emperor
who abdicated the throne.

245
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,720
This is the real cause.

246
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,360
Master, I would humbly request

247
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,080
to toast to you in the name of punishment.

248
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,840
You've known Master Wen's past
and difficulties that couldn't be told,

249
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,160
but why didn't you just tell me?

250
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,840
Don't you believe in me

251
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,880
or our relationship
as the master and the disciple?

252
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,760
I should also be held responsible.
I'll drink with him.

253
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,080
Come.

254
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,480
Zhou Xu, our Chengling is so promising

255
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,760
that in such a short time,

256
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,920
he has roughly grasped the secret
of the mechanics of Longyuan Cabinet.

257
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,120
Fortunately, he restructured

258
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,280
the Piercing Rain Needles
and has the knowledge

259
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,800
to greatly weaken its power.

260
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,880
That's how the fake death stunt worked.

261
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,400
So this stratagem of yours

262
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,480
is to ask my disciple
to "kill" you in my presence

263
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,000
with the self-defense weapon I gave him?

264
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,040
Why didn't you tell me?

265
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,840
Don't you trust me or--

266
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,160
Zishu.

267
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,040
Please allow me to explain for him.

268
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,960
He set this fake-death trap

269
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,160
to lower Zhao Jing's guard.

270
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,400
Only in this way,

271
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,200
can he give one last strike
at the conference

272
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,320
with all the witnesses
and evidence together.

273
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,640
That's how we revealed Zhao Jing's
conspiracy in front of everyone

274
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,160
and proved the innocence
of those he killed.

275
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,480
I'm also to blame.

276
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,000
I warned Mr. Wen

277
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,640
that your wound is so tricky
and a good rest is needed.

278
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,720
You can't get involved in another fight.

279
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,760
Did I ask you?

280
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,920
Please take a seat.

281
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,560
I'll only ask you.

282
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,320
Should you be punished?

283
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,560
Yes.

284
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,760
Zhou Xu, how would you punish me?

285
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,200
Drink three pots of liquor in a row!

286
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,960
Zhou Xu.

287
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,320
Zhou Xu, where are you?

288
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,040
Why is it so dark here?

289
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,400
Zhou Xu.

290
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,880
Zhou Xu.

291
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,440
Where are you?

292
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,520
Listen.

293
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,320
I got all of them drunk tonight.

294
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,560
I'm so happy!

295
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,080
-Why are you scratching for nothing?
-Zhou Xu.

296
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,640
I'm so happy tonight.

297
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,920
Let me tell you.

298
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,040
Last time, when we had dinner
with Old Monster,

299
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,040
I was quite sad.

300
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,480
I was worried that you--

301
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,360
I was worried that you might die soon.

302
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
I was worried

303
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,440
that you might not accept me.

304
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,880
I was worried that
I wasn't qualified to be your junior.

305
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,080
But now all my worries are gone.

306
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,040
Here. Drink with me. Cheers!

307
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,360
Come on.

308
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,720
Drink it, Zhou Xu.

309
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,480
I'm so happy now.

310
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,040
You don't know this,

311
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,120
but I actually planned

312
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,960
to ruin this world

313
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,480
and myself as well.

314
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,080
How fortunate that I met you.

315
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,360
I found that being a dignified
and imposing man

316
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,400
can be so joyful.

317
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,120
I have lived so many years,

318
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,760
but I've never felt so carefree

319
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,320
and delighted.

320
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,080
Now I just feel that

321
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,760
my parents and our master

322
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,760
wanted me to do this.

323
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,120
Right now,

324
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,200
once I close my eyes,

325
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,480
I seem to be able to see them
smiling at me.

326
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,800
Zhou Xu.

327
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,040
After Gu Xiang gets married,

328
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,880
I'd like to look for that farmhouse.

329
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,640
My parents were left dead outside
without being buried.

330
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,920
There wasn't even a simple tomb for them.

331
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,480
I am unfilial.

332
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,240
More than 20 years have passed.

333
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,200
I have never gone back once.

334
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,920
I didn't dare to.

335
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,560
But now you are with me.

336
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,520
Please escort me--

337
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,480
please escort me back
to have a look, all right?

338
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,560
All right.

339
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,880
I will go with you.

340
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,640
Great!

341
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,280
-Chief.
-Chief.

342
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,000
Greetings, Chief. Greetings, Master Zhou.

343
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,480
Back to work, everyone.

344
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,320
Don't delay Ms. Gu's wedding schedule.

345
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,480
-Yes, Chief.
-Yes, Chief.

346
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,800
"Master Zhou."

347
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,040
Did they mean me?

348
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,640
Master!

349
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,920
Master Zhou!

350
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,400
I think the nickname of "Master Zhou"

351
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,480
must be given by
that quick-witted little girl.

352
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,440
It wasn't me.

353
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
It was Weining.

354
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,320
Master ordered me not to call you
Sick Man and Zhou Xu.

355
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,880
What else can I do?

356
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,480
You are the chief's senior.

357
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,880
So calling you "master" is fine.

358
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,560
Why not "Zishu"?

359
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,760
Master Zhou? That name--

360
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,200
It sounded like
I'm someone with a face full of beards.

361
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,960
I told him that,
but he didn't listen to me!

362
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,680
When did I do that?

363
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,320
All right.

364
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,720
I will call you that then.

365
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,160
Zishu.

366
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,200
You little stinky girl.

367
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,400
You're still so naughty
on your wedding day.

368
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,080
Madam Luo has been so busy
with your dowry.

369
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,720
Why not give her a hand?

370
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,400
No bride is supposed to prepare

371
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,320
her own dowry!

372
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,280
What a shame!

373
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,160
What a surprise! I could never imagine

374
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,040
that you would feel ashamed one day.

375
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,240
What a coincidence. Me too.

376
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,960
I have never seen someone become

377
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,240
as obedient and timid as he is now.

378
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,040
Master. Master Wen.

379
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,720
Ms. Bride, why are you still
wandering around?

380
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Aren't couples not allowed to meet
before the end of the wedding ceremony?

381
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,400
That's none of your business!

382
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
How fierce! Weining.

383
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,960
Don't you control your wife?

384
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,560
I won't.

385
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,680
She is beyond my control.

386
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,480
I understand. Living under the same roof,
you have to take a step back.

387
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,520
Don't panic. After the wedding,
come to the Four Seasons Manor.

388
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,480
-I will back you up.
-I--

389
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,760
You brat!

390
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,880
You're getting bold recently, aren't you?

391
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,480
Well, excuse me then.

392
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,280
It's my first time
being in the Ghost Valley.

393
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,240
-I'd like to walk around here.
-I'll go with you.

394
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,040
We'll see you later, Zishu. Wait, Master!

395
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,560
Do I really have to go
to the Four Seasons Manor?

396
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,200
I want to be with you.

397
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,880
No married girl is supposed to stay
with her parents.

398
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,000
I won't get married then!

399
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,560
Go back to Kun yourself.

400
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,120
I'll stay with my master.

401
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,600
-Gu Xiang.
-Nonsense!

402
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,400
Weining sacrificed
all that he had for you.

403
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,080
Don't be spoiled. All right?

404
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,880
After your wedding ceremony,
I will close down the Ghost Valley.

405
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,960
Did you spoil me? Am I spoiled?

406
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Are you really going
to close down the Valley?

407
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,560
I promised Master Ye myself

408
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,120
that I will do all that I can

409
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,320
to keep these 3,000 ghosts
in Mount Qingya until they vanish.

410
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,800
I can't break my promise.

411
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,040
Nor do I want to.

412
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,320
God once treated me badly,

413
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,160
but he also granted me priceless gifts.

414
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,800
This is me reaching a settlement with God.

415
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,080
We both took a step back.

416
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,080
-Gu Xiang.
-Master!

417
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,080
Gu Xiang, what's wrong?

418
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,640
If you are sad--

419
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,920
What if I--

420
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,840
-I--
-Idiot.

421
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,680
I won't let you do anything
against your will.

422
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,880
It's just that

423
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,560
I feel happy for my master.

424
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,440
Master, I'm really happy for you.

425
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,160
Silly girl.

426
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,960
I am supposed to stay here
and keep an eye on those ghosts.

427
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
But it's not like
I have to stay here every day.

428
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,680
I can sneak out to see you.

429
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,440
Let's wait for several years
when the Ghost Valley is finally at peace.

430
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,960
Everything will be all right then.

431
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,800
Chengling.

432
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,560
Changing Ghost and his henchmen

433
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,400
have been locked in the jail
in the cold pool.

434
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,160
They are your last enemy.

435
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,080
How would you treat them?

436
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,560
Master Wen, what are your plans for them?

437
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,080
I--

438
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,800
I don't want to get my hands
stained with blood.

439
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,920
That's why I locked them up.

440
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,000
The jail in the cold pool?

441
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,760
That sounds very painful. Isn't it?

442
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,840
Then keep them there

443
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,360
and let them thoroughly reflect
on their sins.

444
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,360
That's it?

445
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,360
Killing these guys

446
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,000
won't change what has happened.

447
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,960
Master said

448
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,880
eyes are in the front of our heads,

449
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,320
so we are supposed to look ahead.

450
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,600
Besides, on Gu Xiang's wedding day,
we shouldn't cause any bloodshed.

451
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,520
No wonder Master used
to call Zishu "Sage Zhou."

452
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,640
Look at him!

453
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,880
He's like a little sage.
He's so good at lecturing!

454
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,440
Master Ye once said the original purpose
of building Ghost Valley

455
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,400
was to erect a bridge to salvation
over the river of endless miseries.

456
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,120
So that those fallen and lost spirits

457
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,680
could find a way to start over.

458
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,120
By the way,

459
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,240
Old Monster…

460
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,920
Where has Master Ye gone to?

461
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,760
Master Ye said that he wants to bring
the remnants of Master Rong Xuan

462
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,480
back to Mount Changming
and bury him beside his parents.

463
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,960
Tasty soup!

464
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,600
Waiter!

465
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,400
Sir, would you like to pay the bill

466
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,720
-or do you want one more bowl of noodles?
-Two more bowls.

467
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,200
Two bowls? All right, just a minute.

468
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,760
Even the immortal decay.

469
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,520
This day has finally come.

470
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,960
There's no such thing as immortality

471
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,560
but a living dead.

472
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,800
Nobody knows how many years he has lived.

473
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,640
Only those days of heading towards death

474
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,040
are more or less somewhat fun.

475
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,000
Here are your noodles.

476
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,160
Please enjoy.

477
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,000
These noodles are good.

478
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,600
Changqing, Xuan'er,

479
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,360
let me eat two more bowls on your behalf.

480
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,720
Ms. Gu Xiang is so pretty.

481
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,640
Your husband is so fortunate.

482
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,680
Do I really look pretty?

483
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,840
You're pretty, like a goddess.

484
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,440
I never thought that

485
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,560
we would have a wedding
in the Ghost Valley!

486
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,600
Looking at Ms. Gu Xiang today,

487
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,920
I also want to get married.

488
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,160
-So do I!
-So do I!

489
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,400
Don't make fun of me.

490
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,560
Ms. Gu Xiang.

491
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,200
Your true happiness is still on the way.

492
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,640
Let's go and have a look at the dowry
we've prepared for you.

493
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,560
Great.

494
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,920
Let's go.

495
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,320
HAPPINESS

496
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,800
This many?

497
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,680
Don't you remember what I said?

498
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,840
Your dowry will be enough
to array along three streets.

499
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,120
This is still far from it.

500
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,880
I will make it up for you later.

501
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,480
We were in a rush

502
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
to get your dowry ready.

503
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
I didn't know

504
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
that there is so much etiquette
for marriage,

505
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,920
such as the buckets
and the bowls in pairs,

506
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,400
trousseau, and home appliances.

507
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,400
Gu Xiang, thanks to you.

508
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,160
I've broadened my horizons today.

509
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,680
What do you know?

510
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,800
For a girl from a decent family,

511
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,520
her dowry is supposed to include

512
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,080
everything needed from birth to death.

513
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,920
If the dowry is well-prepared,

514
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,720
even shroud and coffin

515
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,600
should be ready.

516
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,840
However, Mr. Wen,

517
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,880
I don't know what's going on with you.

518
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
A girl only gets married once

519
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,400
in her lifetime.

520
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,960
I really can't understand

521
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,080
why you prepared
the wedding in such a rush?

522
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,480
Madam Luo, Qianqiao.

523
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,720
With you two here at my wedding,
I couldn't be happier!

524
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,840
What? You aren't happy when I'm here?

525
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,520
I'm happy!

526
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
How ungrateful.

527
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,720
Wait, I have one more gift for you.

528
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,960
Great!

529
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,240
Xiang'er.

530
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,480
After I've prepared your dowry,

531
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,200
I will go back to the mountains.

532
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,640
I will not attend your wedding.

533
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,160
Qianqiao will be in charge of everything.

534
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,200
I've prepared a dowry gift for you.

535
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,440
This pair of hairpins
was given by my master

536
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,040
when I got married.

537
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,200
Now, I'm giving it to you.

538
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,080
But rest assured,

539
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,800
it isn't stained with my bad luck.

540
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,840
I have never worn
this pair of hairpins before.

541
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,520
It belonged to my master.

542
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,320
My master has a family, where both
she and her husband lived in harmony

543
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,240
and gave birth to many descendants.

544
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,720
No.

545
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,280
I don't care about it.

546
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
Madam Luo.

547
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,800
I need you to escort me out.

548
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,040
It is not allowed by etiquette.

549
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,680
This concerns your marital happiness
which could influence you for a lifetime.

550
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,120
We should be prudent.
There's no such thing as too much.

551
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,040
Xiang'er.

552
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Be good.

553
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,960
After the Ghost Valley is closed down,

554
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,800
I really don't know

555
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,920
when I could see you again.

556
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,520
I don't care.

557
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,720
Madam Luo,

558
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,400
please put them on for me.

559
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,800
You have to watch me get married.

560
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,240
I can't.

561
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,440
Please be good.

562
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,000
Good girl, just do as you're told.

563
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,680
We're doing this for your own good.

564
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,720
It's your wedding day. Don't worry.

565
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,040
I will be here with Madam Luo.

566
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,880
I will stay with my master

567
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,600
forever.

568
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,280
Please do as we said.

569
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,680
You're so beautiful.

570
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,160
Qianqiao, are you staying
in the Ghost Valley as well?

571
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,960
So you're going to live alone
without Yu Qiufeng?

572
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,120
Who is Yu Qiufeng?

573
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,560
Gu Xiang!

574
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,360
Master.

575
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,000
This is a wedding gift
from the Great Shaman.

576
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,320
There is only one pair
of this red thread in this world.

577
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,560
It's a divine gift blessed by prayers.

578
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,040
It is said

579
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,960
if the lovers are tied with it,

580
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,640
they will meet in all their lifetimes.

581
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,920
Weining has worn the one given for him.

582
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,120
Here, let me help you put it on.

583
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,800
We'll meet each other in all lifetimes?

584
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,600
What if I'm fed up with him

585
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,880
in this lifetime

586
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,840
and want to marry another guy?

587
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,760
Who knows?

588
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,280
If you don't want to wear it,
I will just return it back.

589
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,960
No! I want it!

590
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,000
Put it on for me.

591
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,520
-Does it look good?
-Yes.

592
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,920
Look at how Weining behaves.

593
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,120
Chengling,

594
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,200
don't follow his steps when you grow up.

595
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,720
When the late Chief Gao was still alive,

596
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,160
he promised to marry Gao Xiaolian
to you, right?

597
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,880
Well, do you like her?

598
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,200
I will propose a marriage for you
as your master if you do.

599
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,160
Master, what are you talking about?

600
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,360
I only consider Xiaolian
as my elder sister.

601
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,840
Why are you trying so hard

602
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,760
to get rid of everyone?

603
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,160
Weining, how do you feel
about being a groom?

604
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,480
I'm nervous.

605
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
So what are you thinking about now?

606
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,440
I'm thinking--

607
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,720
I always thought that

608
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,720
on my wedding day,

609
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,920
my master and the chief
would be the hosts.

610
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,640
And my fellow disciples
will stand beside me.

611
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,200
I--

612
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,000
I never imagined even in my dreams

613
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,600
that I'd get married
in the Ghost Valley one day

614
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,120
and to someone close
to the chief of the Ghost Valley.

615
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,560
I forgot!

616
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,720
Chief Shen met your master

617
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,920
and told him that
you're going to get married.

618
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,640
He--

619
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,520
What did he say?

620
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,280
It's all my fault. I was too busy

621
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,960
to pass on his words to you.

622
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,120
Your master said,

623
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,400
"You unfilial little brat, do remember

624
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,120
what comes before right and wrong
is good and evil.

625
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,280
Since things have come to this,

626
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,960
I only hope that
you'll be good to your wife.

627
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,920
That way,
my teachings wouldn't go in vain.

628
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,960
I will slowly persuade the chief.

629
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,960
If you have a lively baby one day,

630
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,560
do come back to see me
with my grandchild."

631
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,320
Master, your generous kindness
is something

632
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,200
I may not be able to return
even with my death.

633
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,160
I am so unfilial and ungrateful.

634
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,840
Weining, please get up.

635
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,800
I wondered how Mo Huaiyang, that old fox,

636
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,760
nurtured such a good young man?

637
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,720
It turns out your master
is a reasonable man.

638
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,760
Weining, since the grudges between
evil and good have been settled,

639
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,200
they will be at peace with it one day.

640
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,640
Sir.

641
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,720
Yes?

642
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,440
There is a group of people
waiting outside,

643
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,600
saying they're your apprentices,
here for your wedding.

644
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,720
Do you want to take a look?

645
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,560
What?

646
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,400
Ms. Gu Xiang,
the blessed hour is approaching.

647
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,760
You two shouldn't see each other.

648
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,560
-Did you hear about it too?
-Yes.

649
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,240
Have they come round?

650
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,240
It's Master.

651
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,400
It must be because
he managed to persuade the chief.

652
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,400
He treated me so nicely.

653
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,560
He must know that
without their presence at my wedding,

654
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,120
I'll surely regret it my whole life.

655
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,320
Master.

656
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,120
Master!

657
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,040
Master.

658
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,480
Can I let them in and join the ceremony?

659
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,240
When I was at the Gentle Wind Sword Sect,
Master Fan treated me so well.

660
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,600
They spared me and even covered me.

661
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,600
They are really good people!

662
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,280
Master Zhou.

663
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,720
What did you call me?

664
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,200
Zishu.

665
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,960
It's a pity that I wasn't the chief,

666
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,280
I am not in charge.

667
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,080
Wen Kexing,

668
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,000
they've put their pride aside
to come here for the wedding.

669
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,960
Chengling has also passed on to us

670
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,920
Master Fan's message from Chief Shen.

671
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,240
He is amiable.

672
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,280
Why not let those two kids
do as they like?

673
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,400
Do as you please!

674
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,640
What are you waiting for?

675
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,640
Ms. Amethyst Fiend.

676
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,560
They claim to be
the groom's fellow apprentices.

677
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,880
-That right. Open the gate!
-Yes.

678
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,200
Open the gate and welcome the guests.

679
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,160
Please come in, Chief Mo.

680
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,880
Come, let me show you around.

681
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,880
-All right, thank you.
-This way, please.

682
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,000
-You are also here.
-Come.

683
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,560
-Weining, congratulations.
-Congratulations.

684
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,560
Thank you.

685
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,400
-Weining.
-Weining.

686
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,240
-Congratulations.
-Come in. Come on in.

687
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,160
Let's go!

688
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,960
-Weining, congratulations.
-Thank you.

689
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,640
Where is Master?

690
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,360
Weixu is also not here either?

691
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,640
Master, you're here.

692
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,760
-Master--
-Is she

693
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,080
the temptress
who lured you to elope with her?
