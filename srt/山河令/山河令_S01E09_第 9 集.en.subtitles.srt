1
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,320
It's Nine Clawed Fox, Fang Buzhi.

2
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,280
So this is the guy who stole
Lao Wen's Glazed Armor.

3
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
No wonder.

4
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,840
He died so quickly

5
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,720
after catching that hot potato.

6
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,040
It's nobody's fault but his own.

7
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,240
Plums that grow by the roadside
with nobody picking them

8
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,440
must be bitter.

9
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,360
Ah Xu, you're not the only one
who understands it.

10
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,640
WORSHIP OF MARTIAL SPIRIT

11
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,480
What a poisonous hidden weapon.

12
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,320
Who knew that such a small needle

13
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,880
could kill people instantly?

14
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,160
Who in the Ghost Valley

15
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,600
is good at using these hidden weapons?

16
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,320
Piercing Rain Needles?

17
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,360
Only the Window of Heaven has this weapon.

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,200
Han Ying moves fast indeed.

19
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,360
So Lao Wen's Glazed Armor
that was stolen by Fang Buzhi

20
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,560
must be with the Window of Heaven now.

21
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,120
Wen Kexing.

22
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,920
It looks like the Five Lakes Alliance
is busy today.

23
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,040
Let's not disturb them any longer.

24
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,000
-Sir--
-My friend is right.

25
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,440
Since the Five Lakes Alliance
is busy today,

26
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,120
we won't disturb you any longer.

27
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,040
We'll leave for now.

28
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,800
Zhao Jing, please walk them out.

29
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,920
No need.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,200
There are more important things at stake.

31
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,440
My apologies then.

32
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,840
The Heroes Conference
is just around the corner.

33
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,040
I hope to see both of you there.

34
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,800
Of course.

35
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,720
I will definitely come

36
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,240
to Chief Gao's Heroes Conference.

37
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,240
See you next time.

38
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,040
CALLIGRAPHY AND PAINTINGS

39
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,000
Cao Weining.

40
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,520
This one's good.

41
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,280
All right.

42
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,960
You should eat. Have some more.

43
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,560
Why aren't you eating?

44
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,200
What? Do you dislike the food I gave you?

45
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,520
Of course not!

46
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,360
I wouldn't dare. It's an honor.

47
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,960
I'll eat it right now.

48
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,080
INCOMPUTABLE TREASURES

49
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,280
Hey.

50
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
How old are you exactly?

51
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,960
You still have baby fat? That's so cute!

52
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,840
What?

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,240
I'm not flirting with you.

54
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,880
I'm giving you a warning.

55
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,360
Do you know

56
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,560
that there's Ghoul
in the Ten Devils of the Ghost Valley

57
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,240
that especially eats the faces
of handsome young boys like you?

58
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,400
Especially those with baby fat.

59
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,560
Be careful!

60
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,080
A human eating a human?

61
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,800
Is that something a person would do?

62
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,080
Of course not.

63
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,840
That's why they're called devils.

64
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,320
Those crazy devils!

65
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,120
We should kill all of them

66
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,720
so that I can live up to my sect's mission
of defeating evils and protecting justice.

67
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,000
But I heard

68
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,640
the devils are very strong.

69
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,520
Don't fail at killing them

70
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,800
and get yourself killed instead.

71
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,840
I won't.

72
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,880
This time,
the Five Lakes Alliance is hosting

73
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,640
and all the heroes in the world
are gathered here.

74
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,120
We will definitely destroy
the Ghost Valley.

75
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Really?

76
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,720
But I heard that the Ghost Valley

77
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,840
only came into Yueyang City
the day before yesterday

78
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,120
and left ten human heads in public
as a power move.

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,240
If the Five Lakes Alliance
is really that strong,

80
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
how would they dare

81
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,240
make trouble under their nose?

82
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,760
Ms. Gu, don't worry.

83
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,760
I will protect you.

84
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,960
As long as I'm here,
nothing will happen to you.

85
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,160
I'm not scared.

86
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,120
Thank you for letting me stay
with the Yueyang Sect.

87
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,120
I feel much safer.

88
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,680
Let's eat.

89
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,680
Ms. Gu.

90
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,560
You said that this Ghoul

91
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,200
especially eats the faces
of handsome young boys.

92
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,320
Ms. Gu.

93
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,680
Does that mean

94
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,160
that you think

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,040
I'm handsome?

96
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,480
What?

97
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,120
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,440
You said that I…

99
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,840
It's nothing. I…

100
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,840
By the way,

101
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,240
I have something to tell you.

102
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,680
They found Fang Buzhi,

103
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,400
but only his body and the stolen goods.

104
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,720
The Yueyang Sect already put up a notice
of the stolen goods.

105
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,040
Who would have expected that?

106
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,880
Isn't that the girl
who was performing last time?

107
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,920
I'm going to take a look.

108
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,080
Wait, Ms. Gu!

109
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,320
Xiang--

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,880
Miss, would you like to hear a song?

111
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,200
Someone is here with me,
so now is not a good time.

112
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,840
Ask around first.

113
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,680
When I ask you to sing,

114
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,040
that means I have finished my mission.

115
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,520
Tell me where to find Master after that.

116
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,960
-All right.
-All right.

117
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,440
Did I get the wrong person?

118
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,080
You're much prettier
than the girl last time.

119
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
You can continue.

120
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,960
I've got the wrong person.

121
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,360
GOOD LUCK INN

122
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,240
Why is the Window of Heaven
involved with the Glazed Armor?

123
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,000
Does Prince Jin want the armory too?

124
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,160
I wonder why Gao Chong

125
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,520
hid Chengling away.

126
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,440
Here, come in.

127
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Put it here.

128
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,280
Ah Xu, I ordered a lot of tasty dishes.

129
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,240
The chef at this inn is good at cooking.

130
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,800
I've started to lose my senses.

131
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,240
What are you staring at?

132
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,320
As the saying goes,

133
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,520
"As long as there's wine,
we will drink today."

134
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,400
Life is nothing but three meals and sleep.

135
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,679
As long as you can have a meal
with someone you like,

136
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,240
other matters

137
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,360
can wait.

138
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,280
You finally said something sensible.

139
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,280
Sit. Eat while it's hot.

140
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,720
Good wine!

141
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,920
Ah Xu, what are you thinking about?

142
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,360
All right.

143
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,280
What can't you tell me?

144
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,320
Are you still worried about Chengling?

145
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,080
I'm wondering whether it was a mistake

146
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,360
to bring Chengling
back to the Five Lakes Alliance.

147
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,160
Ah Xu, you're so terrible.

148
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
You have such a handsome face

149
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,680
and a kind and innocent heart.

150
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,760
The girls in the world

151
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,440
are all going to go crazy for you.

152
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,000
If I keep staying with you,

153
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,520
will anyone even like me anymore?

154
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,440
Do you really want

155
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,760
to save him all the way and accept him

156
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,920
as a disciple to protect him forever?

157
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,680
Nothing lasts forever.

158
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,480
When I was little,

159
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,240
I had a dog.

160
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,760
It was a gift from someone very important.

161
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,920
My mother didn't want me to raise it.

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,640
She said that dogs are only loyal
to one person for life.

163
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,840
If I wanted to keep it,

164
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,720
I would have to raise it
for the rest of my life.

165
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,040
How would an eight-year-old child

166
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,280
understand what a lifetime meant?

167
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,920
So of course, I agreed.

168
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,000
And then?

169
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,560
Then…

170
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,800
Then I betrayed it.

171
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,640
Not everything will go your way.

172
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,000
But you must not have regrets.

173
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,240
What? That hurts.

174
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,400
Speaking of the dog,

175
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,720
don't you think
that example is quite mean?

176
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,400
Here, drink.

177
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,800
Good wine.

178
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Eat up.

179
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,480
GOOD LUCK INN

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,920
Ah Xu.

181
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,720
Why are you still sleeping?

182
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,960
Get up!

183
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,680
Go to Yuefan Tower with me.

184
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,680
It's almost noon.

185
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,000
Time to get up.

186
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,360
They all say that Yuefan Tower
is the best place to view Yueyang City.

187
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,560
Get up.

188
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,880
-Get out.
-Let's go.

189
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,000
Let's go!

190
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,200
-Let's go.
-Don't touch me!

191
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,600
Let's go!

192
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,920
If you keep nagging,
I'm going to kill you!

193
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,280
Let's go!

194
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,320
You can spend your day sadly
or spend it happily.

195
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,720
If the flowers bloomed, then pluck them.
Why do this to yourself?

196
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,920
Get up.

197
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,880
No!

198
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,480
YUEFAN TOWER

199
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,800
The Four Sages of Anji.

200
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,840
Who are they?

201
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,920
They're a breath of fresh air
in the martial arts world.

202
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,920
The Four Sages of Anji

203
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,760
are all masters of music,

204
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,240
but they come from different backgrounds.

205
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,920
They became soul mates

206
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,160
of common interest

207
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,320
and left the martial arts world together

208
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,880
to quietly live
in a beautiful bamboo forest in Anji.

209
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,280
They haven't come out for over ten years.

210
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,840
No wonder they can produce
such heavenly music.

211
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,760
Of the Four Sages,
two of them are a couple

212
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,720
that used to be disciples
of the same clan.

213
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,080
Another one

214
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,160
is a scholar without any martial arts,

215
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,360
but he is good at playing the zither.

216
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,360
The last one

217
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,800
is Lonely Thief Master, He Yifan.

218
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,880
Although he was in the gutter,

219
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,560
he always looked up at the stars.

220
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,520
His three friends guided him

221
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,880
to give up evil for good

222
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,840
and live in the forest.

223
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
That's how they became soul mates
like Yu Boya and Zhong Ziqi

224
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,600
from the tale of
"High Mountains and Flowing Water."

225
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,000
"High Mountains and Flowing Water."

226
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
Soul mates like that are hard to find.

227
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,360
The world is not important.

228
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
What's important is finding a soul mate.

229
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,520
If it wasn't for the fact
that I don't have much time left,

230
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,000
wouldn't it be great

231
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,400
to find a soul mate
to roam the martial arts world

232
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,960
and spend the rest of my life with,

233
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,280
like the Four Sages of Anji?

234
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,800
Why am I being pessimistic?

235
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,760
Living like this for two or three years

236
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,880
is better than wasting an entire lifetime.

237
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,800
Can you do it or not?

238
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,720
I can.

239
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,640
He's already grown up, but he still
practices basic moves with us.

240
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,200
What's funny is that
he's not even as good as us!

241
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,440
Shut up.

242
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,200
The Mirror Lake Sword Sect

243
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,640
has its own style.

244
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,040
They don't care about the basics.

245
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,720
What do you guys know?

246
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,200
Isn't that right,

247
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,200
Young Master Zhang?

248
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,880
Why did you hit me?

249
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,600
I'm not hitting you.

250
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
I'm testing you.

251
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,040
They say that the Mirror Lake Sword Sect's
anti-gravity skill is unique.

252
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,560
I wanted to experience your skills,

253
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,320
but who knew?

254
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,960
Your Upwards Toad move is truly special.

255
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,520
Just leave.

256
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,920
How would Young Master Zhang
like our boring and basic moves?

257
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,640
Let's not make him late for lunch.

258
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,320
WORSHIP OF LITERATURE

259
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,600
CHONGWU PALACE

260
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,960
-Hi.
-I'm sorry.

261
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,440
Don't you watch where you're going?

262
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,120
Gu Xiang!

263
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,600
Are you happy to see me?

264
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,640
You're tall enough
for me to pat your head now!

265
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,400
Don't cry, Hero Gold Bean.

266
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,720
Why are you still crying?

267
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,000
Don't cry.

268
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,360
I thought I would never see you again.

269
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,920
I thought Master didn't want me anymore.

270
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
"Master"?

271
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,640
Mr. Zhou.

272
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,720
Zhou Xu?

273
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,240
All right.

274
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
He hasn't actually accepted me
as his disciple yet.

275
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,760
But Mr. Wen told me

276
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,360
that Mr. Zhou is softhearted
and he will accept me

277
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,000
if I keep pestering him
and calling him "Master."

278
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,080
Did he also say

279
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,800
"Even tough women
cannot resist clingy men"?

280
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,200
That's right. How did you know?

281
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,920
Seriously? He never teaches you
anything good.

282
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,640
Gu Xiang, since you're here,

283
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,960
does that mean
Master and Mr. Wen are here too?

284
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,920
Where are they?

285
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,280
They didn't come.

286
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,680
All right.

287
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,360
Yueyang Sect is heavily guarded
and not everyone can enter.

288
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,320
They especially sent me
to take care of you.

289
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,680
Gu Xiang, you all are so kind to me.

290
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,280
Then how did you get in?

291
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,480
This is the inner courtyard.

292
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,160
Gu Xiang, did you sneak in?

293
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,120
Of course not.

294
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,320
I was invited.

295
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,000
It's almost time
for the Heroes Conference.

296
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,640
More and more people
from various backgrounds

297
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
are in the city now.

298
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,200
Ah Xu.

299
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Those boys who dressed like virgins
visiting a brothel for the first time,

300
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,800
which sect are they from?

301
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,960
Mount Hua Sect.

302
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,840
They've always cared about
the neatness of their garments.

303
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,040
Messy clothes are against sect rules.

304
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,040
Now I see where Ah Xiang learned
all those mean words.

305
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,560
Ah Xu, then what about those two
who are glaring over there?

306
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,920
Iron Fist Clan.

307
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,840
The Iron Fist Clan rules over Jingxiang.

308
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,120
Two tigers can't rule the same mountain.

309
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,080
They don't get along
with the Yueyang Sect.

310
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
Ah Xu.

311
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,520
How do you know so much
about every sect and its rules?

312
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,200
Can you tell which sect I'm from?

313
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,720
Your martial arts are complex
and constantly changing.

314
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,160
Unless your master knows skills
from every sect,

315
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,760
you must have more than one master.

316
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,840
Lao Wen.

317
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,200
Can you change your habit
of making me guess?

318
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,280
Just tell me what you want to tell me.

319
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,720
Stop making me guess.

320
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,920
The Heroes Conference,

321
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,400
where heroes gather to praise heroes.

322
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,960
These people sure know
how to compliment themselves.

323
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,360
Do these plebs think they deserve
to be called heroes?

324
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,400
Ah Xu.

325
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,720
How many actual heroes

326
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,800
do you think there are
in the martial arts world?

327
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,360
Only inexperienced people

328
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,720
yearn to be heroes.

329
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,160
Then what about the experienced?

330
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,400
The experienced know

331
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,240
that each character

332
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,520
of the word "hero" is written in blood.

333
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,440
If it's not their own blood,

334
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,720
then it's others'.

335
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,800
I've passed the age
of wanting to be a hero.

336
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,000
Now, I'm just a wanderer in this world.

337
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,160
I can't say.

338
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,760
Lao Wen.

339
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,120
Do you want to be a hero

340
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,080
or a wanderer?

341
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,680
There are too many people
who want to be heroes.

342
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,640
I like watching the show,
but not being part of the show.

343
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,000
Let the heroes go and gather.

344
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,480
As a wanderer in this world,

345
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,720
all I need is you.

346
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,800
Ah Xu!

347
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,240
Where are you going?

348
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Why are you going this way?

349
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,120
Ah Xu.

350
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,840
I bought wine for you.

351
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,520
Again?

352
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Didn't you say
you couldn't fall asleep after 1 a.m.?

353
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,720
Since you can't fall asleep anyway,

354
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,680
why not go to the roof with me
to drink and appreciate the moon?

355
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,360
I'm telling you.

356
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,480
The moon looks beautiful tonight.

357
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,200
Appreciate the moon with great wine!

358
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,000
One should enjoy life
when things are going well.

359
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,840
Live up to the glorious moon and the wine.

360
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,120
CHENG LIQUOR STORE

361
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,840
You're here?

362
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,240
Ah Xu.

363
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,800
Do you know?

364
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,960
I'm really happy.

365
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,200
Why don't you ask me

366
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,440
why I'm happy?

367
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,520
You'll tell me why

368
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,880
when you want to.

369
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,440
If you don't want to,

370
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,600
then why would I ask?

371
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,080
Such a beautiful night

372
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,800
and there had to be a deathmatch.

373
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,160
What a way to ruin the mood!

374
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,640
This isn't the only deathmatch

375
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,760
in Yueyang City tonight.

376
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,920
XIANGMING HALL

377
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,520
The scent of flowers fills Yueyang.

378
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,440
The Glazed Armor
is everywhere in the city.

379
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,640
I'm happy

380
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,800
because the show

381
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,400
has finally begun.

382
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,560
Lao Wen,

383
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,680
what are you trying to say?

384
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,680
You can't describe a good show.

385
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,240
Come on. Let's go and see it.

386
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,000
YUETIAN HALL

387
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,920
No wonder it has gotten quiet.

388
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,320
They put on a "perish together" act.

389
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,400
Wonderful.

390
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,880
Cyclops Jiang Che.

391
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,240
Furious Blade Master Li Heng.

392
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,080
Both of them are somewhat famous.

393
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,200
Why did they die in such a funny way?

394
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,120
This is why

395
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,120
everyone in the world comes for profit

396
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,680
and everyone leaves also for profit.

397
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,680
When will these idiots understand

398
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,840
that they need to at least be alive

399
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,760
to take advantage of something?

400
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,240
This is the piece

401
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,600
Fang Buzhi stole from you.

402
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,200
It looks like it.

403
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,880
"It looks like it"?

404
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,240
Ah Xu, you're very smart.

405
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,680
Think about it.

406
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,880
Why do these two pieces of Glazed Armor

407
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,800
look exactly the same?

408
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,400
HARMONIOUS AND PROSPEROUS

409
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,160
Ah Xu,

410
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,040
don't you think this is all very funny?

411
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,960
Ah Xu!

412
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,600
Wait for me. What's wrong?

413
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,920
Lao Wen. You ask me what is wrong?

414
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,400
Don't you think it's wrong?

415
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,680
Why would it be wrong?

416
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,520
These people were all going
to get themselves killed anyway.

417
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,480
I just added fuel to the fire.

418
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,840
Lao Wen.

419
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,880
I used to think that you were pretending
to be crazy and dumb.

420
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,840
I didn't realize

421
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,240
that you're actually crazy.

422
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:51,360
REACHING THE CLOUDS PAVILION

423
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,520
HARMONIOUS AND PROSPEROUS

424
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,720
YUEYANG SECT

425
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,760
You.

426
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,440
Go away.

427
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,560
You're bringing misfortune
this early in the morning.

428
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,480
We're giving out porridge in two hours.

429
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,680
It's me.

430
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,280
Hurry up.

431
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,280
Hurry up and tell Master.

432
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,080
Deng Kuan?

433
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,600
I need to tell Master quickly.

434
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,600
Someone, help!

435
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,000
Deng Kuan!

436
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,560
Ah Xu, time to get up.

437
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,720
All right, don't be mad anymore.

438
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,800
It's not even a big deal.

439
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
Ah Xu.

440
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,200
Ah Xu?

441
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,720
Ah Xu?

442
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,880
Seriously?

443
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,000
This one is fake?

444
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,920
Yes.

445
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,320
Three pieces of the Glazed Armor
have appeared.

446
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,720
Last night, it changed hands

447
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,240
multiple times in one night.

448
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,920
There was a bloody fight every time.

449
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,280
That's right.

450
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,520
The Heroes Conference is about to begin,

451
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,440
but now that
the Glazed Armor is everywhere,

452
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,240
it's creating chaos.

453
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,360
This is extremely humiliating
for the Five Lakes Alliance.

454
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,160
Don't worry, Gao Chong.

455
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,200
We will kill anyone,
whether he's a human or a ghost,

456
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,080
who dares to make trouble
during the conference.

457
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,320
Isn't that right, Zhao Jing?

458
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,480
Yes.

459
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,440
Deng Kuan.

460
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,680
Please wake up soon, all right?

461
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,120
I'm really worried about you.

462
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
There are so many matters

463
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,480
to handle for the sect,

464
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,880
and you are my father's best assistant.

465
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,320
Without you here,

466
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,840
my father's hair has turned grayer.

467
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,480
Answer me, Deng Kuan.

468
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,800
YUE

469
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,120
-Unlock the door.
-Yes.

470
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,680
Eat.

471
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,320
Hurry up and eat.

472
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
Gao Shan, what are you doing?

473
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,600
-Stop it.
-Don't hold me back!

474
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,600
They're just two idiots
who won't feel pain!

475
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,360
Who cares? Beating them helps me vent!

476
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,280
We've tried everything,
but they wouldn't say anything.

477
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,080
-Beating them is useless.
-That's right, Gao Shan.

478
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,880
They look pitiful
and they must have been tricked.

479
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,360
Shit! Are you pitying them?

480
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,080
Why don't you pity Wei and Deng Kuan?

481
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,240
He's still in a coma!

482
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,240
-Gao Shan…
-Gao Shan!

483
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,680
Why didn't you go to Renyi Hall?

484
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,600
What happened?

485
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,560
Something's wrong.

486
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,680
We sent everyone that we could.

487
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,480
Masters and the others are there too.

488
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,000
RENYI HALL

489
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,160
UTMOST KINDNESS

490
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,800
Four Sages of Anji!

491
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,520
You haven't done anything terrible,

492
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,159
and we don't want to create trouble!

493
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,199
Hurry up and give us the Glazed Armor!

494
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,679
My dear, why don't we give
the Glazed Armor to them?

495
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,280
We must keep our word.

496
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,440
My dear!

497
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,080
Give…

498
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,880
Give it

499
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,199
to Hero Gao.

500
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,719
My dear!

501
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,400
My dear!

502
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,840
-My brother!
-My brother!

503
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,200
The Glazed Armor belongs to no one!

504
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,120
Why should we give it to the Beggar Gangs?

505
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,880
Don't you claim to be
the biggest gang in the world?

506
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,400
Are you trying

507
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,920
to forcefully steal this?

508
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,120
What a joke!

509
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,360
If we used force,

510
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,400
would you still be alive right now?

511
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,320
The World's Armory

512
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,160
has the secret arts
from all sects and clans,

513
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,080
including that of the Beggar Gangs.

514
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,960
It is completely reasonable
for us to take back the Glazed Armor.

515
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,200
Madam Pei,

516
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,240
this is for your own good.

517
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,120
Look at our other friends here.

518
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,800
They're not as reasonable
as the Beggar Gangs.

519
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,800
Elder Huang, what do you mean?

520
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,440
-What?
-The Four Sages of Anji are right.

521
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,760
The Glazed Armor belongs to no one.

522
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,000
The strong control it.

523
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,360
If the Beggar Gangs
have the right to fight for it,

524
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,280
does the Mount Hua Sect not?

525
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,000
What does this have to do with you?

526
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,600
Is it even your turn?

527
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,240
Stinky beggar.

528
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,840
Have you turned stupid
from kowtowing for food?

529
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,400
The Glazed Armor was last seen
with that old man, Ao Laizi.

530
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,640
Everyone knows that Ghost Valley

531
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,360
killed him.

532
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,040
Now, it's with the "Four Idiots of Anji."

533
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,760
That means
they're the Ghost Valley's dogs!

534
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,040
You damned midget!

535
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,760
This is no place for you to speak!

536
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,600
Yifan!

537
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,720
-Yifan!
-Yifan!

538
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,040
-Yifan!
-Yifan!

539
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,560
Feng Xiaofeng, you vicious bastard!

540
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,800
Give us the antidote!

541
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,520
Then give me the Glazed Armor!

542
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,400
Do you have any dignity?

543
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,800
It's all right for the Beggar Gangs,
Mount Hua Sect, and Kongtong Sects

544
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,040
to fight for the Glazed Armor.

545
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,120
After all, their secret records
are in the armory.

546
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,400
Which hole did you midget jump out of?

547
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,720
Twenty years ago, you weren't even
in the martial arts world.

548
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,080
Scram! Scram far away!

549
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,600
You disgust me!

550
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,840
Gao Shannu, beat her!

551
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,160
Enough!

552
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,640
Elder Huang.

553
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,520
The Beggar Gangs have always been on
good terms with the Five Lakes Alliance.

554
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,120
But you and your disciples
keep causing trouble

555
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,000
in the city!

556
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,680
Are you disregarding
the Five Lakes Alliance?

557
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,120
Chief Gao, I should be the one
asking you that!

558
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,880
The Five Lakes Alliance has become
arrogant and unbearable recently,

559
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,440
but I let it go for your sake.

560
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,600
Now you brought so many people
to attack us?

561
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,240
Is the Five Lakes Alliance
acting this overbearing

562
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,000
because you think you have no equal
in the martial arts world?

563
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,000
Elder Huang.

564
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,480
It's not your place to represent
the martial arts world, is it?

565
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,360
-Mount Hua Sect only follows
-You…

566
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,760
Chief Gao's lead!

567
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,360
-You…
-You ass-kisser!

568
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,680
The reputation
of the Five Mount and Sword Sects

569
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,000
is ruined because of you!

570
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,680
Elder Huang.

571
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,440
You are so close with Tao Hong and Lu Liu.

572
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,880
You are the one
that humiliated the Beggar Gangs!

573
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,840
It's better than the Five Lakes Alliance

574
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,160
that has no dignity, to begin with!

575
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,120
Madam Tao Hong.

576
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
Don't think you can gossip as you wish

577
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,920
just because you are a woman.

578
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,600
I can't cut off your tongue,

579
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,920
but I can cut off your neck!

580
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,480
How dare you!

581
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,840
What are you doing?

582
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,840
Shen Shen!

583
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
How dare you say that?

584
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,920
And you pride yourself as someone
from a proper and famous sect!

585
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,800
Killing devils and maintaining justice
is the duty of a proper sect!

586
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,760
Chief Gao, you are indeed bold!

587
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,640
How many worms did you spill

588
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,320
from this old clay pot?

589
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,360
This is disgusting.

590
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,960
I'm not fighting you all anymore!

591
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,320
Feng Xiaofeng! Don't you leave!

592
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,200
Leave the antidote!

593
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,080
Shen Shen, stop him!

594
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,800
Follow me!

595
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,040
Madam Pei,

596
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,560
this is Master Gao.

597
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,520
The Four Sages of Anji
are my honored guests.

598
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,960
I'll wait and see

599
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,440
who dares to trouble you!

600
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,480
UTMOST KINDNESS

601
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,080
Madam Pei!

602
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,000
The Glazed Armor!

603
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,120
Stop! Don't kill him!

604
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,320
UTMOST KINDNESS, RENYI HALL

605
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,480
We've lived in seclusion for 15 years
and forgotten all of our worries.

606
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Fifteen years of accompaniment

607
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,240
was destroyed in one instant

608
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,320
because of this thing!

609
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,720
Master Du, you…

610
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,800
Chief Gao.

611
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,760
The four of us retreated
from the world long ago

612
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,040
and only wanted to spend
the rest of our lives in the forest.

613
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,920
We only came out

614
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,120
to take part in the Heroes Conference

615
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
because of you.

616
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,040
But I never expected that

617
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,160
the loyal friendship between you and me

618
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,720
would cause us to die in Yueyang City.

619
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Gao Chong.

620
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,920
Master Pei stole the Glazed Armor for you.

621
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,360
Was it worth it?

622
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,880
Was it?

623
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,080
Master Du,

624
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
I apologize!

625
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,360
But Master Du, please rest assured.

626
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,640
I will definitely

627
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,120
avenge you and the others!

628
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,560
What is the point of keeping you

629
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,880
if I have no soul mates left?

630
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,520
Master Du!

631
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,080
No!

632
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,840
Chief Gao.

633
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,600
Every debt has a debtor.

634
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,960
The Four Sages of Anji either directly

635
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,040
or indirectly died
because of Feng Xiaofeng.

636
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,680
This is not related to the Beggar Gangs.

637
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,400
He was tricked and poisoned.

638
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:29,880
Tao Hong and Lu Liu
acted out of self-defense.

639
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,960
The Beggar Gangs
and the Five Lakes Alliance

640
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,640
don't need to ruin our relationship
over this small incident--

641
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,560
Elder Huang!

642
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,760
Don't you want the Glazed Armor?

643
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,560
Take it!

644
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,800
Is one piece enough?

645
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,360
I'll give you another!

646
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,160
Everyone!

647
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,640
On the 15th of the 7th month,

648
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,560
after the Heroes Conference,

649
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,080
I will clearly explain

650
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,960
everything about
the Glazed Armor to all of you!

651
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,840
Elder Huang.

652
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,520
The two of us

653
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,200
must settle our matters

654
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,800
after the conference!

655
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:25,120
RENYI HALL
