1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,480
Kind lady.

2
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,080
You look sweet,

3
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,760
but you're fierce.

4
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,240
I don't believe you!

5
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,200
Master?

6
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,480
Ah Xiang, stop being an embarrassment.

7
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,560
Your martial arts are poor,
now you have poor taste too?

8
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,200
I apologize for my servant's rudeness.

9
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,320
I don't deserve this.

10
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,880
I should apologize instead.

11
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,680
So you know martial arts too.

12
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,040
A friend in the martial arts world.

13
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,200
I'm sorry.

14
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,840
I was neglectful just now.

15
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,120
I am Zhang Chengling.

16
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,040
I belong to the Mirror Lake Sect
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

17
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,760
May I ask which clique
or sect are you from?

18
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,360
What's your name?

19
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,960
I don't deserve that.

20
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,400
My friend, are you injured or ill?

21
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm not talented.
I don't belong to any clique or sect.

22
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,840
Young Master, let's go.
Let's not bother about him.

23
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,720
Since you came to the area
of Yue's Mirror Lake Sect,

24
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,760
if you don't mind, you're our guest now.

25
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,240
It doesn't matter if you're injured, ill,
or facing a problem,

26
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,560
you may always bring my name card
to the Mirror Lake Manor for a stay.

27
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,440
Young Master,

28
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,840
even if you have a name card,

29
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,760
you can't randomly give it out
to people on the street.

30
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,800
Master has said that this name card…

31
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,880
This is what my father told me to do.

32
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,279
We rely on our parents at home,
but depend on our friends outside.

33
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,040
Righteous men should help each other.

34
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,200
Look, he's so ill.

35
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,360
Since I met him…

36
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,880
Young Master, how do you know
he's a righteous man？

37
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,480
Look at his attire.
What if he's a bad guy?

38
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,440
Young Master, we should leave.

39
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,720
We'll be late if we don't hurry up.

40
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,040
Thank you for your kindness, Master Zhang.

41
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,280
Are you busy?

42
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,520
I mustn't hold you up.

43
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,240
Yes, I almost forgot about it.

44
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm rushing
to buy my mother some pastries.

45
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,680
My friend, you're welcome.

46
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,000
Everything will stay as it is.

47
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,120
We will meet again.

48
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,040
MIRROR LAKE SECT, ZHANG CHENGLING

49
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,720
Forget it.

50
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
When Jiuxiao was young,

51
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
he was as silly as him too.

52
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,360
Master.

53
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,400
I was about to punish him.

54
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,960
Why didn't you let me punish
that sick man?

55
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,520
QINGYU TOWER

56
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,720
His steps were so tricky.

57
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
He was so annoying.

58
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,680
Can you even

59
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,600
fight against

60
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,760
the Swift Moving Steps?

61
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,280
"Swift Moving Steps"?

62
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,440
Which sect is that from?

63
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,600
Four Seasons Manor.

64
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,880
Four Seasons Manor?

65
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,080
What's "Four Seasons Manor"?

66
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,360
Why haven't I heard about it?

67
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,280
This man might be the variable.

68
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,480
I should go and meet him.

69
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,040
You chase me and I'll chase you

70
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,920
There's a legend in the martial arts world

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,400
The water from the Five Lakes

72
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,880
Gathers around the world

73
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,680
Who else deserves the supremacy
In the martial arts world?

74
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,600
It's this song again.

75
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,240
The martial arts world has only settled
for a few years,

76
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,440
but the Five Lakes World Alliance wants
to gain power again

77
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,320
and become the supreme chief
of the martial arts world unfairly.

78
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,160
They don't deserve it.

79
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,080
It will be a disaster.

80
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,520
Who are you?

81
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,160
You evil kid. What are you doing?

82
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,120
Couldn't you see that I was sleeping?

83
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,000
-Are you free to offer me a ride now?
-Yes.

84
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,600
I want to go to Mirror Lake Manor.

85
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,480
Three maces of silver for a ride.
Are you still going?

86
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,280
All right, let's go!

87
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
Silly kid.

88
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,440
You can get 20 round trips
with 3 maces of silver.

89
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
You stated your price
and I agreed with it.

90
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,080
It's already a deal.

91
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,160
It's none of your business
even if I'm silly.

92
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,720
Wait a minute.

93
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,480
Kid, are you crazy?

94
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,000
You look sick as if you're dying soon.

95
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,160
Do you have any bad intentions?

96
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,920
Are you planning to cheat on me?

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,920
Go away!

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,240
I'm not making a deal with you.

99
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,160
Go away!

100
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,800
A fated man would not be rejected.

101
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,920
Why are you forcing him
when you're not fated?

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,720
If you don't mind,

103
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,200
why don't you have a ride with me?

104
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,120
What are you doing?

105
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,160
You pretentious guy!
What are you planning to do?

106
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,800
Are you snatching my customer?

107
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Don't you know
that it's "first come, first served"?

108
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,800
Silly kid, let's go!

109
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,960
All right. I can go?

110
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,800
-Come.
-See you again.

111
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,080
Come! Hurry up.

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,520
Don't worry about your trip,

113
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,160
I'll eventually welcome you.

114
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,640
Master.

115
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,000
Who exactly is that sick man?

116
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
A variable.

117
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,920
MIRROR LAKE MANOR

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,920
This is the legendary Jiangnan,
with apricot blossoms and misty rain.

119
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,840
What are you doing?

120
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,760
It's worth it even if I die here.

121
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,480
Damn it.
Little jerk, don't you dare to leave!

122
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,760
You haven't paid yet!

123
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,800
You evil sick man.

124
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,760
Did you dress up like this
to cheat around?

125
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,520
Others dine and dash,
but you ride and dash?

126
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,240
You're overestimating yourself.

127
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,160
Why don't you take a look at yourself?

128
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,920
You don't have that overlord look at all!

129
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,240
Give me the money!

130
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,240
If you don't pay,

131
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,920
I'll break your bones
and boil them in my soup.

132
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,080
You said that I rode and dash?

133
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,040
Yes. I was talking about you, evil kid!

134
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,160
I shall ride and dash then!

135
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,240
Don't run!

136
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,720
Stop!

137
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,560
You evil kid!

138
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,840
Damn it, Old Jerk.

139
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,880
My apologies.

140
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,040
Take no offense, please.

141
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,680
Sir, your footwork is of godlike elegance.

142
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,320
I am so impressed.

143
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,120
So I purposely came here
to have a look at them again.

144
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,120
Elegant?

145
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,640
Damn it.

146
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,120
Sir, is there anything wrong
with your eyes?

147
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,200
No, my taste is perfectly fine.

148
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,440
Your steps were like the snow in the wind

149
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,240
and the moon hidden behind the clouds.

150
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
They were beautiful.

151
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,480
Who is this guy?

152
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,600
He knows about Four Seasons Manor's
Swift Moving Steps.

153
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,600
It seems to me that you also love wine.

154
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,320
The spring day is perfect.

155
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,000
Why don't we drink together on my boat?

156
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,840
As they say, "After having
a bottle of wine among the flowers,

157
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,440
you would no longer feel lonely."

158
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,600
You followed me here.

159
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,160
What's your purpose?
Why don't you make it clear?

160
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,280
I followed you?

161
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,880
Didn't you say,

162
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,760
"See you again"?

163
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,120
So I'm here to see you.

164
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,600
He's so good at flattery.

165
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,120
Are we seeing each other again?

166
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,200
MIRROR LAKE MANOR

167
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,760
My master is kind and generous.

168
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,120
First Young Master and Second Young Master

169
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,320
also like to associate
with talented and righteous men.

170
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,240
Although our manor is small,
there are quite a few martial artists.

171
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,160
Each of them is heroic
and good at martial arts.

172
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,560
I didn't expect that Little Young Master
would learn from them.

173
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,880
But his sense

174
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
is too different.

175
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,960
The water from the Five Lakes
Gathers around the world

176
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,520
Who else deserves the supremacy
In the martial arts world?

177
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,400
Mirror Lake Sect hasn't been involved
in worldly affairs for some time.

178
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,760
We shall wish those who want
to become the supreme chief

179
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,680
of the martial arts world good luck.

180
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,600
ZHANG YUSEN

181
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,960
But Father,

182
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,840
recently, the song has become worse.

183
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,880
There's another verse.

184
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,800
Its lyrics are creepy.
It's very suspicious.

185
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,360
The Iridescent Clouds are scattered

186
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,480
And the Glaze is shattered

187
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,800
Who will cry
With the Ghosts on Mount Qingya?

188
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,560
What?

189
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,960
Is this song hinting about the Glazed--

190
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,440
Chengfeng, watch your words.

191
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,520
Father.

192
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600
This year, Deng Kuan came to invite you

193
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,440
to the Mid-Autumn Festival gathering
of the Five Lakes Alliance again.

194
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,200
Why don't we visit Mr. Gao
in Yueyang City this year?

195
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,840
THE SUPREME KINDNESS

196
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,840
-That's Zhang Yusen, Master Zhang, right?
-It has been a long time

197
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,920
-since we last met Mr. Gao.
-They are Master and First Young Master.

198
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,760
Master, this way, please.

199
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,560
LIKE WATER

200
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,960
Who is that man?

201
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,600
That man?

202
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,480
He's a beggar
who has Chengling's name card

203
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,720
and is trying to seek money.

204
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,960
I don't know how they met.

205
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,320
I didn't want to spoil his mood,

206
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,920
so I asked the butler to offer him a room.

207
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,440
Chengfeng, you should take care
of both of your brothers.

208
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,240
From today onward, don't allow Chengluan
and Chengling to leave this island.

209
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,440
Yes, Father.

210
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,960
WOODSHED

211
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,880
Sir.

212
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,360
Sir, since you're a friend
of Little Young Master,

213
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,760
you're an important guest.

214
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,480
But we don't have enough rooms.

215
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,440
You might have to stay
in this woodshed for a few days.

216
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,720
Woodshed?

217
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,160
If you're offended…

218
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,320
A woodshed is good.

219
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,280
I have another request.

220
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,840
Sir, please go ahead.

221
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,560
This wine bottle is empty.

222
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,040
Its stomach is growling.

223
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,200
I understand.

224
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,320
I'll bring you wine and dishes later.

225
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,240
Thank you.

226
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,840
I'll leave then.

227
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,040
Everything is taken care of.

228
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,000
Only a few stubborn generals

229
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,360
tried to resist.

230
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,760
I've killed them all.

231
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,320
Hang their heads at the city gate

232
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,000
to serve as an example.

233
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,360
Yes.

234
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,080
Your Highness, we have news from the spy.

235
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,280
At Jiangnan, someone is spreading

236
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,560
a creepy song among the kids.

237
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,240
It seems to be hinting at
the whereabouts of the Glazed Armor.

238
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,880
Send people to investigate it right away.

239
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,640
There's one more piece of news.

240
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,520
The spy who followed Zhou Zishu

241
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,720
lost his trace not long after.

242
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,720
He has indeed prepared for it.
Continue searching for him.

243
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,480
MIRROR LAKE MANOR

244
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,320
It's midnight.

245
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,160
The Nails of Seven Torments
are hurrying my death again.

246
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,040
Help!

247
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,560
-Help! Please help us!
-Help!

248
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,920
Help!

249
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,640
I think I've read

250
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,560
about these ghost masks in some books.

251
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,520
The Ghost Valley from Mount Qingya?

252
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,480
Why is this group of devils
after the Mirror Lake Sect?

253
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
They are all servants.

254
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,000
None of the martial artists
is fighting back.

255
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,840
They seem to have lost their power.

256
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,200
Mirror Lake Sect is devastated
by Ghost Valley.

257
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,080
Little Young Master, follow me!

258
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
The Trapped Sparrow?

259
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,160
Why is a spy
from the Window of Heaven here?

260
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,440
Forget it. I need to save them first.

261
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,400
MIRROR LAKE MANOR

262
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,960
Hide quickly!

263
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,720
Are you all right?

264
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,360
MIRROR LAKE MANOR

265
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,520
-Sick Man?
-Old Jerk! Bring the kid away!

266
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,320
Let's go! Hurry up!

267
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,640
MIRROR LAKE MANOR

268
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,840
Zhang Yusen!

269
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,200
If you don't want to suffer,

270
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
hand in the Glazed Armor quickly!

271
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,560
No way!

272
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
All right. You're not afraid of dying.

273
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,240
But are you afraid of witnessing
the death of your two beloved sons?

274
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,840
Are you all right?

275
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,320
Sir.

276
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,680
Who exactly are you?

277
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,440
I rode and dashed,

278
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,200
but I saved your life.

279
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,200
We're even now.

280
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,720
Sick Man, you're wrong.

281
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,120
You rode on my boat two times.

282
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,800
I helped you this time too,

283
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,240
but you still didn't pay me.

284
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,560
Sick Man.

285
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,400
We still have to run.

286
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,360
We can't stay here for too long.

287
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,520
I'm sick. I can't run anymore.

288
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,400
Bring this kid away.

289
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
Don't care about me.

290
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,960
You…

291
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,160
No way. You saved me.

292
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,440
I can't leave you here.

293
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,240
If my father finds out

294
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,200
that I'm discourteous,

295
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,560
he'll break my legs.

296
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,360
Are you silly?

297
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,280
Your father could have already died.

298
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,720
No one will punish you anymore.

299
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,200
Hurry up and run away!

300
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,120
My father won't die.

301
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
My father is Autumn Moon Sword,
Hero of Mirror Lake.

302
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,880
Of course I know who your father is.

303
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,520
He saved my life.

304
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,840
I paddled a boat
in front of your house for three years

305
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,200
because I was looking for a chance

306
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,760
to return him my life.

307
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,720
Hurry up and run away!

308
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,640
Run towards Tai Lake
and look for Hero Sanbai.

309
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,320
Once you meet people
from the Five Lakes Alliance,

310
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,880
-tell them your identity.
-I'm not leaving!

311
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
I'm a martial artist!

312
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,120
Sirs, quickly heal your injuries.

313
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,120
I'll guard you!

314
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,200
Silly kid.

315
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,760
He's a good kid,

316
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,000
but he's silly.

317
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,160
Sick Man,

318
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,600
can you still stand up?

319
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,920
I need 15 minutes.

320
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,840
All right.

321
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,640
Hanged Ghost, one of the Ten Devils
from Mount Qingya is here!

322
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Hand in the Glazed Armor,

323
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,560
and I'll make you suffer less!

324
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,640
You foul ghost!

325
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,720
Go inside!

326
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,560
Mr. Li!

327
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Mr. Li!

328
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,760
I'll kill you!

329
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,520
I didn't expect that

330
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,640
Autumn Mood Sword
would have such a useless kid.

331
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,360
You arrogant ghost should be hanged!

332
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
How dare you do evil in front of me?

333
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,120
I'll turn you into a real ghost!

334
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,000
Hey, beggar. You're good at martial arts.

335
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,640
Nice sword.

336
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,880
Master!

337
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,720
Sir, we meet again.

338
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,880
Mr. Li.

339
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,920
Mr. Li.

340
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,680
Bastard.

341
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,240
I was almost brought away
by the Grim Reaper.

342
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,880
Master.

343
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,920
Hurry up and save him.

344
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,440
Why are you crying?

345
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,080
I'm not dead yet.

346
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,160
It's…

347
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,720
It's not too late to cry for me
after I take my last breath.

348
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,800
Sick Man.

349
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,120
Your martial arts

350
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,400
are good.

351
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,600
It's slightly better than yours.

352
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,720
I give up.

353
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,080
I don't owe anyone in my life.

354
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,840
Today,

355
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,440
I can finally repay my life.

356
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,400
I can rest in peace now.

357
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,440
You didn't pay

358
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,840
for your boat ride twice.

359
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,040
One trip costs three maces of silver,

360
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,440
including the interest.

361
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,160
If you're not a bastard,

362
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,080
you shall repay me.

363
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,000
What do you want me to do? Just say it.

364
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,720
I want you…

365
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,120
I want you to bring this kid

366
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,920
to Five Lakes Alliance's

367
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,080
Zhao Jing safely.

368
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,120
Mr. Li.

369
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,760
No, I'm not leaving!

370
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,320
Silly kid!

371
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,960
You're a good kid.

372
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,920
But your father has taught you

373
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,760
too well.

374
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,120
In the future…

375
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,520
In the future…

376
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,160
Sick Man,

377
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,160
what's your name?

378
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,760
I'm…

379
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,960
Zhou Xu.

380
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,800
Zhou Xu?

381
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,920
All right.

382
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,360
Silly kid, kowtow to him quickly.

383
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,720
In the future, you must listen to him.

384
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,040
Hurry up!

385
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,000
Mr. Zhou.

386
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,280
Good.

387
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,240
Zhou Xu,

388
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,880
he has paid his respects.

389
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,120
You must be loyal to him.

390
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,200
I'll…

391
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,600
I'll remember your name.

392
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,160
God will be watching you.

393
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,640
If you break your promise,

394
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,640
I'll curse 18 generations
of your ancestors

395
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,400
even if I'm in the netherworld!

396
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,600
Mr. Li.

397
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,960
Mr. Li!

398
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,760
Mr. Li!

399
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,679
Mr. Li!

400
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,840
Mr. Li.

401
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,480
Mr. Li.

402
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,120
I promise you.

403
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,400
Call the boatman here!

404
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,520
Yes!

405
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,400
YUE

406
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,960
What's wrong?

407
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
What are you waiting for?
Prepare the boats!

408
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,960
Deng Kuan, this boat has been gouged.

409
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,480
Deng Kuan, this one too.

410
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,880
Deng Kuan, this one too.

411
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,680
Deng Kuan.

412
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,440
The boatman is dead.
His whole family was killed.

413
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,440
Do you know his name?

414
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,880
I only know his surname, Li.

415
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,480
Mr. Li.

416
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,200
You have good sense.

417
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,560
You entrusted the kid to Mr. Zhou.

418
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,880
I can see that Mr. Zhou has such
a prominent and sharp bone structure.

419
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,120
He must be a man
who places much value in loyalty.

420
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,000
You may rest in peace.

421
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,960
Thank you…

422
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,880
My name is Wen. Wen Kexing.

423
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,360
You're Zhou Xu.

424
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,440
Which character of "Xu"?

425
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,080
The one for willow catkins.

426
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,400
What a good name.

427
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,400
A righteous and just man

428
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,560
with a body like flying catkins.

429
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,960
TOMB OF MR. LI

430
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,400
What's wrong?

431
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,400
Mr. Zhou, I'm fine.

432
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,560
I suddenly just felt dizzy.

433
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,720
Excuse me, sir.

434
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,920
Stop trying to be tough.

435
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,000
You're exhausted.

436
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,880
You need to rest.

437
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,960
No, Mr. Zhou. I can travel.

438
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,160
It's all right to rest for one night.

439
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,440
Ah Xiang.

440
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,560
Set up the fire and make some food.

441
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,000
You don't need to tell me.

442
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,920
They're all done. Come in!

443
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,440
Mr. Zhou. Master Zhang.

444
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,440
Please come in.

445
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,040
Master.

446
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,680
Master!

447
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,160
Sir.

448
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,560
Master, you shall eat first.

449
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,160
I will serve him, all right?

450
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,200
Hey.

451
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,600
Beggar.

452
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,000
Although you're good at martial arts,

453
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,960
you're timid.

454
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
What's wrong?

455
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,960
Are you afraid that I'll poison you?

456
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,880
Return it to me if you're not eating.
I'm still hungry--

457
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,120
Sir, if you don't trust her,
you can have this.

458
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,720
I'm not hungry.

459
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,920
This…

460
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,440
You're being very cautious with us,

461
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,800
but you were tricked by that guy

462
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,200
just for three maces of silver.

463
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,440
You promised to take care of him

464
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,720
without knowing who he is.

465
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,640
Little girl, what do you know?

466
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,280
"An ordinary traveler obeyed
his principle and kept his promise.

467
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,960
He traveled a long journey

468
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,760
without fear of death."

469
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,760
Zhou, your action

470
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,920
shows that you're a gentleman.

471
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,120
What do you mean?

472
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,720
Master, stop acting literate.

473
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,160
I have a headache whenever you do that.

474
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,560
This is written in Records
of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian.

475
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,720
It means,

476
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,320
even if he's an ordinary man,

477
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,040
once he made a promise,
he would fulfill it.

478
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,040
Because of that,
he would travel a long way

479
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,520
without worrying about his life.

480
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,720
That is called a ranger.

481
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,720
My father taught me this.

482
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,480
Mr. Zhou, I…

483
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,800
-Thank you.
-You don't have to thank me.

484
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,000
What's wrong?

485
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,360
You don't like that bread?

486
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,440
Here's a bun. Catch it.

487
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,200
I'm not eating your food.

488
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,880
Enough, Young Master.

489
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,160
I saved your life.

490
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,200
Why don't you die

491
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,920
and return me your life?

492
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,040
Little girl, that's enough.

493
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,200
Your words are hurtful.
Beware that you can't get married.

494
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,680
Indeed, people nowadays can't distinguish
between good and evil.

495
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,240
I just saved his life.

496
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,440
I only scolded him slightly,

497
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
but he glared at me.

498
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,040
Why didn't you fight your enemies instead?

499
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,600
Coward!

500
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,200
Ms. Gu, you're right.

501
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,200
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

502
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,840
Thank you for saving my life, miss.

503
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,040
I didn't ask you to kneel.

504
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,760
Enough, stand up.

505
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,560
Mr. Zhou.

506
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,640
Did you disguise yourself?

507
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
Young Master Zhang.

508
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,560
My name is Zhang Chengling.

509
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,160
Hero, you may call me Chengling.

510
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,880
Don't call me "Hero."

511
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,000
I hate to be associated with heroes.

512
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,360
Master.

513
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,560
Previously, this guy kept talking
about being righteous

514
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,480
and helping others,

515
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,400
as if he was telling stories.

516
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,400
I thought that he's capable of doing them.

517
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,160
It turns out that he was just bluffing.

518
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,120
When there's a fight,
he would only run away

519
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,280
and cry.

520
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,760
I think that you can only act out

521
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,720
the manner of a righteous man
in the theater.

522
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,720
You…

523
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,040
Me? What's wrong?

524
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,080
A man should never quarrel with others.

525
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,560
You're a man
who can't even hold a sword properly.

526
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,800
Ah Xiang.

527
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,200
I haven't thanked you, kind lady.

528
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,720
You have helped us at the crucial moment.

529
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,480
Stop calling me a kind lady.

530
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,360
You're giving me goosebumps.

531
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,640
My name is Gu Xiang.

532
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,480
We are indeed fated.

533
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,680
We met at the right time.

534
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,960
We met at the wrong time too.

535
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,920
Your fate is granted by God.

536
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,560
Aren't you and Little Young Master Zhang

537
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,600
fated too?

538
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,080
Young Master Zhang,

539
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,000
are you injured?

540
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,840
I'm fine.

541
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,320
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Wen.

542
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,080
You should be treated early
if you're injured.

543
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,600
I've learned some medical skills
from my family.

544
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,240
If you don't mind,

545
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,040
-I can--
-It's all right, I'm fine.

546
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,120
He said that he's fine.

547
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,880
Stop hiding his injury
and refusing my treatment, Mr. Zhou.

548
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,720
I won't be the one to blame

549
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,360
if he dies from the worsened injury,

550
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,040
but your ancestors
in the netherworld would…

551
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,080
Mr. Wen, if you have a bad intention,

552
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,680
why don't you make it clear?

553
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,520
You don't have to act.

554
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,840
If you're not our enemy, stop forcing him.

555
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,760
All right.
