1
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,720
Master.

2
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,080
Since Prince Jin is so evil,

3
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
why don't you kill him?

4
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,200
Chengling.

5
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,080
Personally,

6
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,560
there's too much entanglement
between Prince Jin and me.

7
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,040
For the sake of righteousness,

8
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,960
killing him is absolutely not a choice.

9
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,080
Prince Jin rules over the Northwest.

10
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,440
Even so, many people around him
are coveting his land.

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,240
If I kill him,

12
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,360
they will definitely rise in revolt.

13
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,840
All I can do is injure him,

14
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,560
keep him in his bed,

15
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,560
and prevent others from seizing power.

16
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,680
This is how balance is achieved.

17
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,360
I don't understand!

18
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,480
Chengling,

19
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,440
the rebel of Jin army
is an irreversible tide.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
If your master kills Prince Jin,

21
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,840
there will be someone else taking power.

22
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,560
The flames of war
will spread to other places.

23
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,360
There is no power balance.

24
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,520
Because Prince Jin and the others
are busy with the internal power struggle,

25
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,400
people across the country could enjoy
peace and happiness temporarily.

26
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,400
Prince Qi, don't try to explain it to me.

27
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,960
I'm stupid. I don't understand.

28
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,440
And I don't want to.

29
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,360
I only want to save my master!

30
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,160
How childish!

31
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,800
Chengling, you must understand.

32
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,360
Before righteousness and justice,

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,200
my life was insignificant.

34
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,360
It's my fault for raising up the Jin army.

35
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,520
Wars take away many lives.

36
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,960
By then, the regrets that will burden me

37
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,920
won't only be for the Four Seasons Manor,

38
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,840
but also the souls
that die on battlefields.

39
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,160
You're right.

40
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm sorry, Master.

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,400
Since Prince Jin
has obtained the Glazed Armor,

42
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,560
he will definitely go
for the Yin Yang Book.

43
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,480
Even though the book
can't necessarily cure him,

44
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,520
I can't take the risk.

45
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,840
What if he recovers?

46
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,480
If he does, all my effort will be in vain.

47
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,000
Chengling,

48
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,200
you wouldn't want me to die
while carrying such regret, right?

49
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,680
HEAVEN AND EARTH

50
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,040
Chengling.

51
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,320
Our master-disciple relationship
didn't last long.

52
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,160
I don't have much time to teach you.

53
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,040
But you'll only need
to remember this one sentence

54
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,440
and you'll be my good disciple.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,680
It's also what your grand master
often told me.

56
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,920
"A great chevalier
is the one who contributes

57
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,520
to the country and the people."

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,080
If this useless body
could do beneficial things,

59
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,080
it would be so great.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,440
It would be so great.

61
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,520
Don't be sad.

62
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,920
Wu Xi.

63
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,640
Prince Qi.

64
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,760
Chengling and Wen Kexing
are my beloved family.

65
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,080
Please take good care of them.

66
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Zishu, I know.

67
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,400
What the prince wants
is not the Yin Yang Book.

68
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,520
Looking back,

69
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,480
he and I are both descendants of Shatuo.

70
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,520
Our ancestors succeeded
in stopping a riot,

71
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
so they were granted the national surname

72
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,520
and were appointed as Jiedushi.

73
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
That's how we got what we have today.

74
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,720
Zishu, you know about this too.

75
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,400
If we go further back,

76
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,920
our clan from this branch was the
subordinate of Tuojie Imperial kinsmen.

77
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,440
There is an immemorial saying in the clan

78
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,360
that our ancestor had a treasure vault
when he gained achievements

79
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
from the wars in the Central Plain.

80
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,480
Inside it is the secret
for a long-lasting country.

81
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
If we could find the secret,

82
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,760
our clan could enjoy
a rich and peaceful life

83
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,720
instead of roaming about.

84
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,560
There are six keys in the hands

85
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,640
of the leaders of six clans
of different surnames.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,080
It was kept by six clan leaders
of different surnames?

87
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,280
Yes.

88
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,680
Doesn't it sound a lot like
the Glazed Armor

89
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,880
and the key?

90
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,520
In fact, there are a lot of stories

91
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,240
similar to this in our family.

92
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,920
Actually, they are just
enchanting fantasies.

93
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,080
You won't take them seriously
after hearing about them so often.

94
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,880
But I remember you once said

95
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,040
the former prince
had your father killed secretly.

96
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,040
It made me remember something
I was told when I was younger.

97
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,040
The former prince once told us

98
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,960
that he was going to find the secret
to the long-lasting country soon.

99
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,240
However, nothing happened after that.

100
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,160
It was around that time

101
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
that the former prince
became very distressed.

102
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,160
He always sighed
after getting drunk and said,

103
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,240
"Years of pursuing had again been in vain.

104
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,600
The turncoats had ruined my plan."

105
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,480
It was also around that time

106
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,320
that I heard your father was dead.

107
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,400
Master collected
the Glazed Armor and the key

108
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,040
when he was roaming about
in his earlier years.

109
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,400
Is the friend of Master--

110
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,520
my father?

111
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,040
When your master
and his friends traveled around,

112
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,600
they got the
Glazed Armor lock and its key.

113
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,000
Both of them were made with ingenuity.

114
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,720
They are said
to be the critical items for opening

115
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,360
the treasure vault of Songmo
or Tuojie Imperial kinsmen.

116
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,880
That's why these two pieces
look exactly the same

117
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,640
while the five pieces--

118
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,000
Your father was killed secretly

119
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,680
for treason

120
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,360
by the former prince of Jin.

121
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,600
It turns out

122
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,440
that fate has arranged it all.

123
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,120
Walking for 1,000 li to see off a friend
ends with departure eventually.

124
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's stop here.

125
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,000
Zishu.

126
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,680
We both are aware

127
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,600
that the secret
for the long-lasting country

128
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,600
is just a groundless rumor.

129
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,240
There is no such thing in this world.

130
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Why do you insist--

131
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,560
Beiyuan, don't try to persuade me.

132
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,360
If this legend is true,

133
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,920
I definitely have to go there.

134
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,920
Even if it's not true,

135
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,920
I still have to go.

136
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,160
Think about it.

137
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,680
Compared to the people in the world,

138
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,320
my life is insignificant.

139
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,280
If I succeed, I can die with no regret.

140
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
If not,
I would have sacrificed for justice.

141
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,000
Anyway, it's worth it.
What should I be afraid of?

142
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,320
All right.

143
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,080
You will travel there day and night.

144
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,760
In case you need anything,

145
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,760
just contact one of the Ping'an shops.

146
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,840
Zishu, don't worry about the things here.

147
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,040
With you here,

148
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,040
I can rest assured.

149
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,040
Chengling.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,840
Do you know what worries me the most?

151
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,280
Repeat

152
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,120
what I have told you.

153
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,680
You have been seriously wounded.

154
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,920
Prince Qi and the Great Shaman
have taken you overseas for treatment.

155
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,200
You asked Master Wen and me to come back
to rebuild the Four Seasons Manor

156
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,040
and wait for your return
with full recovery.

157
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,240
You brat!

158
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,040
You look so distressed!

159
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,640
How would Master Wen believe you?

160
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
You should have known

161
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,880
that if you mess up,

162
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,640
considering Master Wen's personality,
how would he react?

163
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,320
If you're not afraid that

164
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,880
I will be in pain and tortured
in the netherworld…

165
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,760
I can't do anything about it then.

166
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,840
I will practice!

167
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,680
The green mountains remain the same
while the gurgling water won't dry up.

168
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,080
The long journey will eventually

169
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,200
bring us together.

170
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,120
The secret for a long-lasting country.

171
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,240
The legend

172
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,960
turns out to be true.

173
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,320
The privilege of opening the armory

174
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
shall be yours.

175
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,800
Officer Duan.

176
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,240
Please.

177
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,000
Scorpion King, I really appreciate it.

178
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,480
Guards!

179
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,520
Yes, sir!

180
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,160
Break the ice wall!

181
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,760
Father.

182
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,560
Are you happy

183
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,160
to revisit the old place?

184
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,720
It won't open!

185
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,960
Is it fake?

186
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,600
That's strange.

187
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,040
It's not the right key.

188
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,560
That's impossible!

189
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
It's--

190
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,480
Is it fake?

191
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,360
Zhou Zishu!

192
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,800
Who else?

193
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,320
I spared you as promised,

194
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,280
but why did the chief
of the Ghost Valley fail me?

195
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,840
This key is fake!

196
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,200
Why are you so surprised?

197
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,280
Since there are fake Glazed Armors,

198
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,760
there should be fake keys too, right?

199
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,000
Where is the chief of the Ghost Valley?

200
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,520
Prince Jin is not here?

201
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,000
Zhou Zishu.

202
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,400
Even if you have supreme skills,

203
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,560
today,

204
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,200
-don't you dare to think of--
-It seems that he didn't come.

205
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,400
All right then.

206
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,480
Avalanche!

207
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,080
Hurry up, retreat!

208
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,040
Retreat! Quickly!

209
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,280
-Retreat!
-Retreat!

210
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,240
-Retreat!
-Retreat!

211
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,000
Go!

212
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,120
-Go!
-Go!

213
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,480
-Go!
-Hurry!

214
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,080
Why are you here?

215
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,400
How about your wound?

216
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,440
Bastard!

217
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,080
Do you really care about me?

218
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,120
What about our promise
to live and die together?

219
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,800
How did you find this place?

220
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,840
Ridiculous!

221
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,800
I will never find you
if I don't follow them.

222
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,480
I didn't know the location of the armory.

223
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,800
That hairpin--

224
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,680
Are you a fool?

225
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,160
Since I was going to fake my death,

226
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,400
how could I take the hairpin with me?

227
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,320
You're the only one who can have it.

228
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,920
It turns out that the key to the armory

229
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,200
was on my head.

230
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,440
Yes.

231
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,000
My parents knew how important it was.

232
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,480
That's why they disguised it.

233
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,280
Ridiculously enough,
those people from the Ghost Valley

234
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,720
searched every corner of my home,
but they couldn't find it.

235
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,080
They didn't know that it was on my head.

236
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,640
If I didn't bring the hairpin,

237
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,600
we could only stand
in front of the door and do nothing.

238
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,560
If you're here to die,
you will definitely take it with you.

239
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,120
Zhou Zishu, you evil brat.

240
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,600
If it weren't for Old Monster…

241
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,560
A bunch of idiots.

242
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,080
What have you done?

243
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,560
This is hopelessly stupid!

244
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,560
Master Ye, please don't--

245
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
-Zishu, he said--
-Cut the crap!

246
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
You're hurting him!

247
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,040
They swear to live and die together.

248
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,480
Once Mr. Wen knows
that Lord Zhou won't live long,

249
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,440
-he will--
-Shut up!

250
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,640
No one is going to die.

251
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,600
I'm still alive.

252
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,960
No one can die before me.

253
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,520
Have you ever thought about
how I would be after I know the truth?

254
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,880
What now?
You're not afraid to die, but I am?

255
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,760
Don't ignite it.

256
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,480
The oxygen is limited here.

257
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,440
Why not?

258
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,360
Since Rong Xuan and the others
practiced martial arts here,

259
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,040
there must be a specific air passage
in the underground palace.

260
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,080
Saint Zhou, I thought you don't flinch
when facing death.

261
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,360
What now? You don't want to die anymore?

262
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,960
If a man can live well,

263
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
he won't desire death.

264
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,880
Besides,

265
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,560
that was before I met you.

266
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,080
The Combined Six Cultivation Power
is more mysterious than the Yin Yang Book.

267
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,840
It does help to be enlightened.

268
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,880
As long as you're alive,

269
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,400
there is still hope.

270
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,240
If you die, there's nothing left.

271
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,640
It's a perfect place
for a bunch of floppy men.

272
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,520
I don't know how my mother
and my grand master bear with it.

273
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,760
This should be the place
for swordsmanship combat.

274
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,640
The library must be inside.

275
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,440
YIN YANG BOOK

276
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,160
YIN YANG BOOK

277
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,840
YIN YANG BOOK

278
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,480
Yin Yang Book?

279
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,560
I should find some treasure here.

280
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,600
Zhou Xu,

281
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,960
this book contains unique techniques
of the Healer Valley.

282
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,640
Come on, keep it for me.

283
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,800
Maybe it'll be useful to us
after we get out.

284
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,000
Putting aside whether
the Combined Six Cultivation Power

285
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,000
can cure me or not,

286
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,280
the snow has blocked
the entrance and the exit.

287
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,920
We can't get out
until the snow melts in summer.

288
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,400
We have no water nor food.

289
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,640
When I found out that you asked
the Ping'an Silver Manor

290
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,680
to purchase a lot of gunpowder,

291
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,120
I knew what you were going to do.

292
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,960
Stop looking at it.

293
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Go.

294
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,120
I can't wait to find out
the secret to a long-lasting country.

295
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,760
Maybe there is an artifact
that can summon an ancient demon god.

296
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,640
Then we'll be saved.

297
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,600
Let's go.

298
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
"Thirteen Changeable Moves
of Cloud and Fog."

299
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,680
That's the unique technique
of Mount Heng Sect.

300
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,600
ARTS FOR THE PEOPLE

301
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,480
"Arts for the People"?

302
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,560
What?

303
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,520
This is a book about farming and planting.

304
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,720
Is it possible that Master Rong Xuan

305
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,880
made a mistake
while stealing the martial arts books?

306
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,480
Could it just be a pick-up book?

307
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,800
It's so weird.

308
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,560
Why is this stone chamber

309
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,000
full of books about farming and planting?

310
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,400
I've found it.

311
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,240
Combined Six Cultivation Methods!

312
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,880
This is it!

313
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,480
COMBINED SIX CULTIVATION METHODS

314
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,960
These are all grains.

315
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,560
Wen Kexing.

316
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,520
Are you sure we've checked

317
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,560
every secret chamber?

318
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,960
Why are they all filled

319
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,480
with farming utensils and books?

320
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,040
There isn't even a copper coin at all.

321
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,840
These are all grains.

322
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,280
These were prepared
by Rong Xuan and others?

323
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,840
Check the seals.

324
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,480
All were written with Tuojie characters.

325
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,240
I thought we could live on these grains.

326
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,480
But this is not an option after all.

327
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,440
How long have these grains
been stored here?

328
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,480
Twenty years of storage
wouldn't make them decay to this extent.

329
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,000
I understand now.

330
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,160
I understand it all now.

331
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,160
These are the secrets
to ensure a long-lasting country.

332
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,080
What?

333
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,280
It's said that this secret

334
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,800
could help the people of Shatuo

335
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,560
enjoy a rich and peaceful life.

336
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,640
Look at these chambers.

337
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,840
They are filled
with farming tools and grains.

338
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,840
There are also farming books
translated into the Tuojie language.

339
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,520
This is the secret
that the Tuojie ancestors

340
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,640
left for their descendants.

341
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,520
I see!

342
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,760
As long as the nomadic people learn
how to reclaim wasteland and plants,

343
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,440
they can be self-sufficient by using
farming tools from the Central Plain.

344
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,200
The country can last long
and become stable.

345
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,600
Prince Jin has spent
so many years of effort

346
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,200
only to get a full house
of food and farm tools.

347
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,480
The secret to achieving
a long-lasting country

348
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,040
is to farm diligently!

349
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,040
It's so hilarious.

350
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
That's why Mr. Long said

351
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,360
Master tried all means
to collect the Glazed Armor,

352
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,000
but he gained nothing

353
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,440
after opening the armory.

354
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,040
He must be searching for my father

355
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,040
and my father tried to reveal the secret

356
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,400
because he was entrusted
by the former prince with the task.

357
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,040
When my father found nothing,
but a chamber full of grain,

358
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,280
the former prince of Jin was so furious

359
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,440
that he killed him.

360
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,080
No, that's not it.

361
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,160
My father knew
the former prince's personality.

362
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,080
He knew that
even if he told him the truth,

363
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,480
the former prince wouldn't buy it.

364
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,600
Not only he wouldn't be spared,

365
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
but Master would also be dragged into it.

366
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,760
Maybe your father didn't tell Master
about what this treasure vault meant.

367
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,160
Later on,

368
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,120
Master passed this place to Rong Xuan
and transformed it into an armory

369
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,240
because this place is nothing,
but an empty warehouse.

370
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,440
Now what I desire the most
is to watch Prince Jin's expression

371
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,760
when he knows the truth.

372
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,400
That would be perfectly amazing.

373
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,720
Stop it.

374
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,680
Now that the snow
has sealed off the mountain,

375
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,600
even if we can find an exit

376
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,520
and managed to get out…

377
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,960
Tell me.

378
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,480
How long can a man survive
with only ice and snow?

379
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,960
Guess how long Ye Baiyi has survived
having only ice and snow.

380
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,160
Aren't you curious

381
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,040
why that Old Monster
acted like a reincarnated ghost

382
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,040
who died from hunger
and ate food with vigor?

383
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,040
That's because

384
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,440
he hadn't enjoyed normal food

385
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,160
for more than 100 years.

386
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,600
Changing the destiny costs a lot.

387
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,160
If you succeed,
you can reshape all your meridians,

388
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,600
never growing old

389
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,480
and living on like a deity.

390
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,520
But there are disadvantages too.

391
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,160
Why did Ye Baiyi
stay in Mount Changming for so long?

392
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,480
Because as soon as you step
into the world of gods,

393
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,640
you must live in a place
of extreme coldness,

394
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,320
braving the wind and dew,
and eating ice and snow.

395
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,760
Once you eat secular food,

396
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,560
you'll start withering.

397
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,720
That's why

398
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,040
since the moment we saw Ye Baiyi,

399
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,880
we can see his hair grows
increasingly gray.

400
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,600
Old Monster is fed up
with being a living dead.

401
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,560
That's why he is enjoying food
as much as he can.

402
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,000
He'd rather give up immortality

403
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,760
than abandon the enjoyment of food.

404
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,360
In other words,

405
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,200
even if you leave this place alive,

406
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,320
you have to live
in an extremely cold place

407
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,040
and eat ice and snow.

408
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,400
That's a hell of a way to live.

409
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,040
To live like that

410
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,200
or to die like this.

411
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,800
I must think it through.

412
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,320
The Combined Six Cultivation Power
was established after the break.

413
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,160
Only after a period
of extremely painful torture

414
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,000
can you reshape your meridians

415
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,280
and achieve renascence.

416
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,520
However, different people
will go through various sufferings

417
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,360
because their physical conditions differ.

418
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,560
That's why it takes two people
to practice it at the same time.

419
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,880
They could help each other.

420
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,280
When one is close to a breakdown,

421
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,160
the other could use
pure vital energy to help him.

422
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,480
Isn't that taking advantage of you?

423
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,520
To be honest,

424
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,280
I'm losing my sense of taste, smell,
and touch gradually.

425
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,000
I can't feel pain.

426
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,200
I know.

427
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,000
That's why both Master Ye
and the Great Shaman have warned me.

428
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,080
During the meditation,

429
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,000
your vision and hearing
might both be gone.

430
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,600
In that situation,

431
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
don't panic.

432
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,120
Focus on your internal operations.

433
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,320
As long as you make it through
all the levels,

434
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,880
you'll recover your five senses.

435
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,760
However, for the next level,
you'll have to repeat the same circle.

436
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
All right.

437
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,040
Let's do this.

438
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,880
SECOND POWER INTENTION

439
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,400
Zhou Xu.

440
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,240
Zhou Xu.

441
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,880
If I confess to you now,

442
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,520
you can't say that I lied to you, right?

443
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,680
You're the chief of the Window of Heaven.

444
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,160
You should have been
more experienced and astute,

445
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,960
but why do you believe whatever I say?

446
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,560
Zhou Xu.

447
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,840
He's dying.

448
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,480
What's the matter with him?

449
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,040
I have a method that can save him.

450
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,920
However, it will be
at the cost of your life.

451
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,720
Are you willing to do that?

452
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,040
More than one could wish for.

453
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,640
Good answer.

454
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,280
Wen Kexing, I've promised you

455
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,680
to save Zhou Zishu.

456
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,920
I haven't failed anyone my whole life.

457
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,520
I will transfer
my Combined Six Cultivation Power to you.

458
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,280
I'm sorry.

459
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,960
You were planning to lie to me too.

460
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,120
I'm lying to you just this once.

461
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,280
It can't be counted as a big sin.

462
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,560
The one who survives

463
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,200
will suffer the most.

464
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,920
You're my senior.

465
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,040
Please allow me to do this.

466
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,800
Wait for me. What's wrong?

467
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,640
I used to think that you were pretending
to be crazy and dumb.

468
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,760
I didn't realize

469
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,960
that you're actually crazy.

470
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,120
Wen Kexing.

471
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,800
Are you happy now?

472
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,840
Are you satisfied?

473
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,880
Is this the result you wanted?

474
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,240
You have no right!

475
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,440
A bad guy can be forgiven
if he puts down the sword.

476
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,960
So why should a good guy be sent to hell
if he only did something bad once?

477
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,480
That doesn't make sense.

478
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,120
And take a gamble.

479
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,240
You are

480
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,800
the one that I know.

481
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,320
Wen Kexing.

482
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,840
Zhou Xu.

483
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Let's drink!

484
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,080
You can't eat if you don't clean them.

485
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,800
Instead of wasting my time
seeking medical treatment,

486
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
I would rather carry a jug of wine

487
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,000
to travel around the world

488
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,840
with my soul mate while I am still healthy

489
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,000
and do whatever I want to do

490
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,160
without regret.

491
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,640
The pure vital energy of the Combined Six
Cultivation Power is so fierce

492
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,960
that no common bodies can bear it.

493
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,480
There has to be someone
willing to serve as a furnace

494
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,160
that will transfer the refined

495
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,040
and pure vital energy to the practitioner.

496
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,280
The establishment can only be achieved
after the break.

497
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,200
The furnace helps
the practitioner escape death,

498
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,280
but his meridians will be fully destroyed

499
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,960
and his hair turned hoary overnight.

500
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,080
Someone once offered
to make a sacrifice like that.

501
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,040
That's why I have to endure

502
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,440
this curse of
the Integration of Man and Nature

503
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,000
and struggled all these years.

504
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,400
It turns out that it's all for today.

505
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,880
No one will always be young,

506
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,840
but someone will always be young.

507
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,280
After the avalanche,

508
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,080
Zhao Jing and Scorpion King were
forever buried in that snowy mountain.

509
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,200
Scorpion Sect suffered
from heavy casualties

510
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,960
and disappeared ever since.

511
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,720
Then Master--

512
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,560
What about the brothers
trapped in the armory?

513
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,400
-How about them?
-Did they die?

514
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,840
To achieve this unique technique,

515
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,840
someone must be willing

516
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,120
to be the furnace

517
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,360
to transfer the refined
and pure vital energy to the practitioner.

518
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,080
No matter how great you are
in martial arts,

519
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,840
even though you don't die
from the explosion,

520
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,240
you'll die from
all your meridians breaking.

521
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,600
So did they manage to master it?

522
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,720
Father!

523
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,000
EVERGREEN AND EVERLASTING

524
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,640
Nianxiang, good girl.

525
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,320
What were you talking about?

526
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,240
Master Gao,

527
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,960
Master is telling us the story
of the Combined Six Cultivation Power.

528
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,800
-Yes.
-Don't listen to him.

529
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,640
Chengling.

530
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,040
You keep talking nonsense.

531
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,800
These kids might be distracted

532
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,360
from the practice.

533
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,440
That's all for today. Let's have dinner.

534
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,680
-All right.
-Let's go!

535
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,320
-Let's have a meal.
-Let's go!
