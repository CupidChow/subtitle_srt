1
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,360
Let me have a look at your injuries.

2
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,920
What do you want?

3
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,040
You brat, where did you come from?

4
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,640
It's none of your business.

5
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,400
I just don't like you.

6
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,080
All right, stop fighting.

7
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,120
Darn it.

8
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,520
I experienced what women feel
when getting harassed for no reason.

9
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,680
Master Ye.

10
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,000
We just met and don't know anything
about each other.

11
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,160
I can't trouble you to treat my injuries.

12
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,080
Are you stupid?

13
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,520
Why are you being polite
with this pretty boy?

14
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,320
What did you call me?

15
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,360
"Pretty boy"?

16
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,720
Am I wrong?

17
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,240
Have a look at yourself in the mirror.

18
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,960
Qin Huaizhang's disciple.

19
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,400
If you don't want to trouble me,
how much longer can you live?

20
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,080
Please don't worry about me.

21
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,000
What does he mean?

22
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,160
Ah Xu, is he being serious?

23
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,760
Whether it's serious or not,
you'll know if you take off his clothes.

24
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,720
Shut up!

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,160
Ah Xu.

26
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,200
What do you want him to say?

27
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,480
That he's about to die?

28
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,280
Are you dumb?

29
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,840
Who doesn't want to stay alive?

30
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,520
Qin Huaizhang's disciple.

31
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,240
Your meridians are about to die,

32
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,840
just like how a tree dies
when its roots dry out.

33
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,000
Even if the chief of the Healer Valley
came back to life,

34
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,160
he still wouldn't be able to save
you dying brat.

35
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,640
Ah Xu.

36
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,560
Is he…

37
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,760
Right, you brat.

38
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
Who is your master?

39
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,960
What martial arts did you use just now?

40
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,600
My martial arts is called
"Beating My Son on a Rainy Day

41
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,800
Just Because I Can!"

42
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,040
You're dead.

43
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,800
Lao Wen and Master Ye. Stop fighting!

44
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,160
It's about to rain. Let's go back.

45
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,960
You conceited brat,

46
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,880
you've used up all your strength.

47
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,040
I can definitely kill you
within ten moves.

48
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,720
You foul-mouthed pretty boy,

49
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,160
you passed your peak.

50
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,840
I can definitely kill you
within the next ten years!

51
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,200
Your mouth is more powerful
than your fist.

52
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Likewise.

53
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,320
Let go of each other.

54
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,840
Master Ye, you are a skilled master.

55
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,160
You don't need to be ruthless
with a junior.

56
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,960
One of you doesn't respect seniors
and the other doesn't love juniors.

57
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,320
What is the point of this fight?

58
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,400
Life and death are up to fate.

59
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,560
-What a coincidence.
-I--

60
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,920
I love fighting against fate.

61
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,320
Take off your clothes and let me see.

62
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
Let me see what hurts you.

63
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,000
What do you mean?

64
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,360
You can really heal him?

65
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,720
Who are you?

66
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,200
If I guessed correctly,

67
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,600
you must be
Mount Changming Sword Immortal.

68
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,760
My master always thanked you
for gifting him his sword.

69
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,800
Don't think you know everything, brat.

70
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,280
Old ghost, I'm asking you a question!

71
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
Can you really treat his wounds?

72
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,080
Do you have the right to ask me questions?

73
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,520
I'm telling you,

74
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,960
I don't have much patience.
I'm going to ask you one last time.

75
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,560
Do you want to treat your wounds?

76
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Ah Xu, let me see.

77
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,640
Let go!

78
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,000
Are you done yet?

79
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,000
Two men are pulling
at my clothes at night.

80
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,680
What kind of a scene is this?

81
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,680
You both want to see it?

82
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,720
Nails?

83
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,360
I see.

84
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,280
No wonder your pulse is faint,

85
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,720
but you can still stay active.

86
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,000
These nails are keeping
your meridians in place

87
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,040
so they don't break
from the internal force.

88
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,360
Whose idea was this?

89
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,000
It's both clever and cruel.

90
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,000
It was my idea.

91
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,040
Yours?

92
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,320
You're really trying to kill yourself.

93
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
Fix your clothes and come with me.

94
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,200
I asked Qin Huaizhang's disciple
to come over.

95
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,160
Why are you here?

96
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,640
Master Ye, what do you think?

97
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,600
Give me your hand.

98
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,160
How is it? Can you treat it?

99
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,520
Of course I can.

100
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,040
Even if someone just died,

101
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,880
as long as his body is still warm,

102
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,760
I can still bring him back to life
for a short while.

103
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,440
What are you waiting for then?

104
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,160
What's your request to treat him?

105
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,200
Just tell us.

106
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,760
If my first request

107
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,200
is for you to kneel on the street

108
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,400
for three days and three nights,

109
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,360
and yell "I'm a blind idiot,"

110
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,840
-would you do it?
-Master Ye.

111
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,160
You have sharp instincts

112
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,320
and could immediately tell

113
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,520
that I'm indeed a blind idiot.

114
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,040
As long as you can treat him,

115
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,600
I'm willing to kneel for three months,
much less three days.

116
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,640
Fine.

117
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,600
Humiliating a thick-skinned guy like you

118
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,920
is not fun anyway.

119
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,880
Qin Huaizhang's disciple.

120
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,120
I can give you another ten years to live.

121
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,280
The rest is up to you.

122
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,240
Ten years?

123
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,880
That's enough.

124
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,400
More than enough.

125
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,080
All right.

126
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,080
First,

127
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,960
I'll abolish your martial arts skills
and dissipate your internal force.

128
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,200
No objections, right?

129
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,880
-What?
-It's all your fault.

130
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,440
You should only have
about a third of your power right now.

131
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,680
It's only hard to bear at night

132
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,040
when your internal force
is circulating about.

133
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,520
Once I remove the nails,

134
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,840
your internal force

135
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,680
will completely crush

136
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,280
all of your meridians.

137
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,880
If I don't abolish your martial arts,
you won't even pass the first step.

138
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,600
Is there another way

139
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,280
without losing his martial arts?

140
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,320
Yes, of course!

141
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,280
If the chief of the Healer Valley

142
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,720
hasn't been reborn,

143
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,360
you can go and try to find his soul.

144
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,280
But I think

145
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,120
that he won't have
any medical skills left in this life.

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,120
Life and death are up to fate.

147
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,440
Thank you for worrying about me,
Master Ye.

148
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,360
I won't trouble you anymore.

149
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,360
Qin Huaizhang's disciple.

150
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,520
You brat.

151
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,840
Why do you keep following him?

152
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,160
What's your relationship?

153
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,680
It's none of your business!

154
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,160
MINGCUI PAVILION

155
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,440
Qin Huaizhang's disciple!

156
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,080
This guy isn't good.

157
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,520
Be careful around him.

158
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,600
No one can stay young forever,

159
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,240
but youngsters will always come.

160
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,840
ZIYUN HALL

161
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,520
How much time

162
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,200
do you have left?

163
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,800
At least two years.

164
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,840
Ah Xu.

165
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,240
Lao Wen.

166
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,600
Others can say such stupid things,

167
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,440
but you can't.

168
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,880
Ah Xu.

169
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,640
Zhou Zishu!

170
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,520
Without my martial arts,

171
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,080
am I still me?

172
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,280
If I'm not, why should I live on?

173
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,960
But you have to stay alive!

174
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,520
If you're alive, the world is big enough

175
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,680
for me to find a way
to recover your martial arts!

176
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,920
I would rather live freely for ten days

177
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,160
than live against my own will
for ten years.

178
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,000
It's all right,
there is still enough time.

179
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,760
Enough time for us
to taste all of the wine in the world.

180
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,760
Let's go.

181
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,720
I understand!

182
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,280
I understand it more than anyone.

183
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,040
I just think

184
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,360
it's a bit funny.

185
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,680
When I was little,

186
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,760
I often disobeyed my parents
and didn't practice martial arts

187
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,040
to play instead.

188
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,720
My parents always said

189
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,360
that if I didn't work hard at that time,
I would regret it later.

190
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,000
Once I got older,

191
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,800
it would be too late
to learn martial arts.

192
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,360
I would argue back

193
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,080
that when I grew up,

194
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,120
it would also be too late

195
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,520
to play with bird eggs and marbles.

196
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,320
Who knew

197
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,560
that I would spend

198
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,480
my entire life

199
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,920
living in the wrong moment?

200
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,680
I couldn't play when I wanted to.

201
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,640
I didn't have anyone to teach me
when I wanted to learn martial arts.

202
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,520
I can't have what I want.

203
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,360
It's too late to save

204
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,480
who I want to save.

205
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,360
Fortunately…

206
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,320
Fortunately…

207
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,760
Wen Kexing.

208
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,720
Are you done yet?

209
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,760
I'm the one about to die.

210
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,400
I've wasted my entire life
and turned myself into a joke!

211
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,400
Whom are you acting sad for?

212
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,000
I gave everything I had
to win back my freedom.

213
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,400
If even you are telling me

214
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,640
to drag my death out for a few more years,

215
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,240
then knowing you was pointless.

216
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,320
ZIYUN HALL

217
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,040
ZIYUN HALL

218
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,960
Amethyst Fiend, why are you late?

219
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,280
I went to Madam Luo's manor
as soon as I heard the news.

220
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,720
I only saw the code on my way back.

221
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,400
What happened?

222
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,600
How would I know?

223
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,800
Asking you is pointless. Where's Qianqiao?

224
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,120
I don't know that either.

225
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,520
Yun Zai.

226
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,400
Where's Hong Lu?

227
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,520
Where's Zhu Zhu?

228
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,000
Where's Lan Xin and everyone else?

229
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,600
Why are you asking?

230
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,440
They're clearly gone.

231
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,240
That bastard Gao Chong

232
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,080
brought people
from the Five Lakes Alliance

233
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,680
to raid Crazy Woman's manor at night.

234
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,400
Only Crazy Woman and I were here.

235
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,280
We were caught off guard

236
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
and a few maids died.

237
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,560
My goodness. That's right.

238
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Crazy Woman said

239
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,960
that she would cut off a piece of my flesh
for each that died.

240
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,240
She wasn't being serious, right?

241
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,880
Hong Lu…

242
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,080
is dead?

243
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,000
She never killed anyone.

244
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,280
Why did they kill her?

245
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,240
I promised Master

246
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,000
that I would keep you all safe.

247
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,000
You're so noisy!

248
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,640
Is this the time to be mourning?

249
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,440
I mean, Amethyst Fiend.

250
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,600
Did you get too affected by the humans?

251
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,320
You seem dumber now.

252
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,840
Didn't we spend our days

253
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,400
fighting against humans in the past?

254
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,160
Who cares if a few maids die?

255
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
Shut up!

256
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,360
You don't have the right to scold me!

257
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,200
The Department of the Unfaithful
usually stays out of sight.

258
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,400
Why would it attract attention
from the righteous clans?

259
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,960
-Did you cause trouble and lead them here?
-Darn it!

260
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,840
Don't always put
the blame on me, all right?

261
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,440
What does this have to do with me?

262
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,840
Think about it.
Changing Ghost, Happy Ghost,

263
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,360
and Lustful Ghost were all nearby.

264
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,760
They didn't do anything!

265
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,440
If I hadn't helped out in time…

266
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,640
Maybe it was those bastards

267
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,560
who sold her out.

268
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,920
Master!

269
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,080
Master.

270
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,920
Master, what happened?

271
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,040
The wind is whistling and rain is pouring

272
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,120
The cock keeps crowing

273
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Yet how can I not feel pleased

274
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,120
Meeting the one I love?

275
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,360
Master, what happened?

276
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,800
Madam Luo's manor was raided

277
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,320
by the Five Lakes Alliance.

278
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,320
Many of our sisters died.

279
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,640
Hong Lu died too.

280
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,160
Madam Luo couldn't defeat them
and was captured.

281
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Master, wake up and tell me what to do!

282
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,760
Why are you crying?

283
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,360
I'm not even crying, so why are you?

284
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,480
Are you crying for me?

285
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,400
Master! Did you hear what I said?

286
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,080
Ah Xiang.

287
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,200
He's about to die.

288
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,200
He won't live for long.

289
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,760
I plotted my revenge for so long

290
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,360
and am this close to being successful,

291
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,520
but he's about to die.

292
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,200
If I knew that earlier,

293
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,560
why did I even follow him, to begin with?

294
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,080
Who is about to die?

295
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,960
Zhou Xu?

296
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,720
The cold rain falls in autumn

297
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,760
The Chinese parasol tree dies

298
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,000
The blanket is too thin for the cold night

299
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,240
As time slips by

300
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,400
I want to be with you
Through life and death

301
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,400
But what a pity

302
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,960
That we met so late

303
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,520
I am young, naive,

304
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,240
and don't understand
the ways of the world.

305
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,360
Mount Hua Sect is part
of the Five Mount and Sword Alliance,

306
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,880
but--

307
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,400
Fortunately, you are willing to support
our Mount Tai Sect.

308
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,040
Please get up.

309
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,280
You can't do this.

310
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,040
Qing Song.

311
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,640
Now that you are the chief

312
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,280
of the Mount Tai Sect,

313
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,120
how could I have you kneel down before me?

314
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,960
Defeating evil is the duty
of the Beggar Gangs.

315
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,040
There's no need to say thanks.

316
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
Master Ao Laizi was noble, righteous,

317
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,840
and respected by all
in the martial arts world.

318
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,440
The sudden death
of such a majestic person like him

319
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,960
is truly…

320
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,720
It's truly a pity.

321
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,920
All of us

322
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,520
are willing to die for our master.

323
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,400
As long as we can bring justice to him,

324
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,280
I will do whatever it takes!

325
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,400
Elder Huang, we will follow your orders.

326
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,160
The Beggar Gangs and the Mount Tai Sect
are on the same front.

327
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,360
If the Five Lakes Alliance

328
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,400
is truly lying to the world
and plotting such terrible acts,

329
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,320
then we must do

330
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,080
whatever it takes to defeat them.

331
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,840
Don't be scared.

332
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,200
The sky has cleared after the storm,

333
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,920
and it is time to bring justice to light.

334
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,160
Say what you need to say
and do what you need to do.

335
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,080
Don't worry.

336
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,800
The Beggar Gangs' thousands of disciples
and the spirit of the martial arts world

337
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,400
are with you.

338
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,680
Thank you, Elder.

339
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
I will leave now.

340
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,800
Goodbye.

341
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,440
Please.

342
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Huang He.

343
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,080
What are you planning now?

344
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,280
Since you found out such a big secret

345
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,800
about Gao Chong and Shen Shen,

346
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,520
why aren't you making a move now?

347
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,840
Why are you in a rush?

348
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,880
We've already waited all these years.

349
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,040
What's a little bit longer?

350
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,680
Torturing a person

351
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,520
is like roasting a chicken.

352
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,800
You can't rush.

353
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,240
It tastes best
when it has been roasted for long enough.

354
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,440
I will take care
of the next steps in public,

355
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
but there's one more thing

356
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,280
I need you two to cooperate with me on.

357
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,040
Master Zhao.

358
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,600
Open the door.

359
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,160
Master, please.

360
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,160
PRISON

361
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,160
Master Zhao,
this woman is really tight-lipped.

362
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,440
She won't say anything.

363
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,200
Master said

364
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,480
that as she is a woman,

365
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,200
we shouldn't torture her.

366
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,520
Who cares if a devil is male or female?

367
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,040
Master, do what you need to do.

368
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,480
I won't tell anyone.

369
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,880
She has to at least tell us

370
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,160
how Deng Kuan was hurt

371
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,800
and why he's still not awake.

372
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
You can go now.

373
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,280
Yes.

374
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,640
Let's go.

375
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,080
You bastard.

376
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,320
Whatever cruel methods you have,

377
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,800
use them all!

378
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,840
I'm not scared of anything.

379
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,960
You really don't recognize me?

380
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,680
I do.

381
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,160
You are that fake righteous dog!

382
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,280
What do you want?

383
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,640
Come at me with all you have!

384
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,840
I've always heard that
before a person enters the Ghost Valley,

385
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,720
he must drink the Soup of Oblivion
to forget their cares

386
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,600
and let go of their obsessions.

387
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,320
I used to think this was a rumor,

388
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,720
but who knew

389
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
that it's real?

390
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,400
I am the person you cared the most about.

391
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,800
But Fumeng,

392
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,080
why is it me?

393
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,760
How do you know my name?

394
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,400
Fumeng.

395
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,240
I betrayed you

396
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,440
and turned you from a noble girl

397
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,400
into a ghost.

398
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,240
You kill all the unfaithful people
in the world…

399
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,120
Don't touch me!

400
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,080
Don't touch me.

401
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,840
Forget it.

402
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,160
Forget it all.

403
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,280
Fumeng.

404
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,800
"Life is just like a dream."

405
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,640
Fumeng, I owe you

406
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,240
in this life.

407
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,400
If there is another life…

408
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,600
Let's not meet again.

409
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,840
Chief, I have finished the preparations.

410
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,640
Is there anything else you need?

411
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,040
The Department of the Unfaithful's manor

412
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,760
was attacked
by the Five Lakes Alliance yesterday.

413
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,520
Tragicomic Ghost was captured.

414
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
Captured?

415
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,280
What…

416
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,240
What should we do?

417
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,680
Chief.

418
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,840
You must rescue her quickly.

419
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,120
With her personality,

420
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,840
if she is captured
by the Five Lakes Alliance--

421
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,880
Stop talking nonsense.

422
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,120
It's not the right time to fight yet.

423
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,720
I want you to transform into Yu Qiufeng
and investigate.

424
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,280
If I guessed correctly,

425
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,240
Gao Chong won't kill her just yet.

426
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,960
He will execute her in public

427
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,160
during the Heroes Conference.

428
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,640
Yes.

429
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,240
I apologize for being rude.

430
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,320
Chief, do you want me
to break into the prison she's in?

431
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,400
Break into the prison?

432
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,160
Is that your job?

433
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,560
With your martial arts,

434
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,800
can you get out
of the Yueyang Sect in one piece?

435
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,800
I want you to confirm
that Tragicomic Ghost is still alive.

436
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,840
Don't alert the enemy.

437
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,480
But Chief, we need to rescue her quickly.

438
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,920
The closer we get
to the Heroes Conference,

439
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,440
-the more masters--
-Do I need you to teach me?

440
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,760
Don't worry. I have a plan.

441
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,840
During the Heroes Conference,

442
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,160
Iron Judge Gao Chong
will have his hands full.

443
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,000
Yes.

444
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,640
Of course you wouldn't leave
my master to die.

445
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,480
No one can anticipate
or predict your plans.

446
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,160
Leave.

447
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,560
Yes.

448
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,720
Those who understand me

449
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,280
know my worries.

450
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,400
Those who don't understand

451
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,040
think I have other intentions.

452
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,760
Weixu!

453
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,040
WORSHIP OF MARTIAL SPIRIT

454
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,880
Little monkey, be quiet.

455
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,320
We're not in the mountains anymore.

456
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,080
Mr. Zhu will laugh at us.

457
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,480
How would I dare laugh
at our Casanova Cao?

458
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,040
I'm just jealous.

459
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,560
Weixu, I'm telling you--

460
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,360
You geek, don't make up rumors.

461
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,040
Weining, don't be rude.

462
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,080
Don't worry.

463
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,080
The two of us
have gotten along really well lately.

464
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,560
But Young Hero Cao,

465
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
it's too late.

466
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,520
Your senior already knows
all about your amazing past.

467
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,040
I… You…

468
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
All right.

469
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,320
I'll stop.

470
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,520
I need to prepare
for the Heroes Conference.

471
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,280
You've traveled far.

472
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,000
Get some rest and come to the conference.

473
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,080
Young Hero Cao.

474
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,560
We will continue
the Casanova Adventures next time.

475
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,760
-I--
-Weining.

476
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,240
Weixu, don't listen to his nonsense.

477
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,440
I…

478
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,720
I just met a girl that I like.

479
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,960
Let's not talk about this.

480
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,680
Weining.

481
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,480
My father left to go back
to Mount Qingfeng last night.

482
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,480
Master Fan will represent
the Gentle Wind Sword Sect

483
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,640
at the Conference instead.

484
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,000
What? Why?

485
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,160
Right!

486
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,920
I almost forgot something.

487
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,520
I heard the juniors say earlier

488
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,960
that Ms. Ah Xiang is sick
and in the hospital.

489
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,280
What?

490
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
All right, don't worry.

491
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,400
Xiaolian is with her.

492
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,600
That's all.

493
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,800
Goodbye.

494
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
Ah Xiang is sick?

495
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,920
Look at you.

496
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,720
Losing your mind over one sentence.

497
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,600
The martial arts world is in chaos.

498
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,160
You're a man,

499
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,880
but you're not directing your energy
towards the right place.

500
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,800
You have no ambition.

501
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,600
Everyone has their own ambitions.

502
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,880
If I can't marry the girl that I love,

503
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,720
I'll just follow Master Fan
to be single for my entire life.

504
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,360
Even if I master martial arts skills
and become the best in the world,

505
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,200
-I--
-You dare to talk about Master Fan?

506
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,680
You are disrespecting your elders.

507
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,000
You're really stepping out of line now.

508
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,400
All right, go.

509
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,440
Really? Thank you, Weixu.
I'll be back soon!

510
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,240
Everyone, focus.

511
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,120
Over there.

512
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,400
And over there.

513
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,200
Clean it well.

514
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,920
Wipe this clean.

515
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,520
Everyone, focus.

516
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
Put it here.

517
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,920
Hurry up!

520
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,920
Master.

521
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,400
Why is the Five Lakes Monument so dirty?

522
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,840
-Why didn't you clean it in time?
-Master, please don't be angry.

523
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,320
I've been watching it the entire time.

524
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,480
It just rained.

525
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
You're giving me excuses?

526
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,560
The conference will start at noon.

527
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,920
If other heroes see

528
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,240
any dirt on the monument

529
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,240
and make fun of us,
I will hold you responsible!

530
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,320
Yes, Master.

531
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,640
Everyone, come here!

532
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,760
Wipe this.

533
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,400
And here.

534
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,240
Wipe it carefully.

535
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,360
Look.

536
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,280
Ghost Valley?

537
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,600
On guard!

538
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,520
THE FIVE CONTINENTS SHARE THE WORLD

539
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,320
-Hurry up and find Master!
-Yes!

540
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,800
Creating trouble in Yueyang?

541
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,760
You are seeking death!

542
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,800
Mount Tai Sect?

543
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Destroy it!

544
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,720
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

545
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,720
Stop!

546
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,840
Stop now!

547
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,040
-Stop!
-Everyone, stop!

548
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,360
Are you all crazy?

549
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,480
Stop!

00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,640
Chief Yu?

554
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,200
You're here? Good morning.

555
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,040
Good morning, young man.

556
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,640
I'm here to see Chief Shen.
Please let him know.

557
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,040
Unfortunately, Master Shen just left

558
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,760
to inspect the venue for the conference.

559
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,120
He won't be back for a while.

560
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,600
Why don't you come back later?

561
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,719
No worries, I'll wait for him inside.

562
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,560
May I ask for a cup of tea?

563
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,880
My senior!

564
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,440
Go to the conference venue now.
Ghost Valley is attacking.

565
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,880
Report to Master!

566
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,040
What? Let's go!

567
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,080
-Come with me.
-Let's go!

568
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,960
Why did Ghost Valley members

569
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,760
suddenly appear at the Heroes Conference?

570
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,199
Is this Chief's plan?

571
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,719
Most of the Yueyang Sect members

572
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,840
have left for the venue.

573
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,880
This is a good opportunity.

574
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,040
I need to rescue my master.

575
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Qiufeng.

576
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,920
Qianqiao?

577
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,320
Qianqiao. Why are you here?

578
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,600
Why did you transform into me?

579
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,920
What are you doing?

580
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,880
Qiufeng.

581
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,520
Why did you sneak
into the Yueyang Sect's backyard

582
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,240
while it's not heavily guarded?

583
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,320
Are you following in your son's steps

584
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,880
to look for the Glazed Armor?

585
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,000
If you wanted the Glazed Armor,

586
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,760
why didn't you ask me?

587
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,200
What? The Ghost Valley can't have

588
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,960
what the Five Lakes Alliance has?

589
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,480
Qianqiao, what do you mean?

590
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,960
I'll be straightforward.

591
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,760
My master, Tragicomic Ghost,

592
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,480
has been captured
by the Five Lakes Alliance

593
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,960
and is locked
in the Yueyang Sect's prison.

594
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,560
I can't rescue her alone.

595
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,320
If you're willing to help me
rescue my master,

596
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,720
I will give you this piece
of Glazed Armor.

597
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,600
You mean your master is
the Master of the Unfaithful List,

598
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,520
Tragicomic Ghost?

599
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,880
That's right.

600
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,040
It's easy for men to be unfaithful
yet difficult for women to live on.

601
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,480
Who do you think rescued me
and brought me into Ghost Valley?

602
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,880
What?

603
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,080
Are you unwilling to help, Chief Yu?

604
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,440
Put this away.

605
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,160
Qianqiao, I owe you so much.

606
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I told you.

607
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,280
As long as you ask,

608
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,680
I will do

609
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,400
whatever you say,

610
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,560
even if it means

611
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,720
losing my life and honor.

612
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,880
If you want to rescue her,
I will help you rescue her.

613
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,600
But as the chief of Mount Hua Sect,

614
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,600
I can't take action rashly.

615
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,520
Qianqiao. Take off your makeup first
and come with me.

616
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,640
I know where Yueyang Sect's prison is.

617
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,200
I'll kill whoever dares to continue
defiling the Five Lakes Monument!

618
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,680
-We're here to hit you!
-To hit you!

619
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,800
How dare you?

620
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,720
Shen Shen!

621
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,520
It's you.

622
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,200
You were the one who sent an assassin

623
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,360
to kill the chief
of Mount Tai Sect, Ao Laizi,

624
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,320
and steal the Glazed Armor.

625
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,000
Admit your crimes!

626
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,200
Ao Laizi was killed by the Ghost Valley.

627
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,920
-What does that have to do with me?
-You told them to!

628
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,720
That person said so himself.
He was following your orders!

629
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,960
-Master!
-Master!

630
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,280
-Master!
-Master!

631
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,880
-Master!
-Master!

632
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,200
-Master!
-Master!

633
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,160
Who are you?

634
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,240
I am here

635
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,000
on orders from the chief
of the Mount Dagu Sect

636
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,280
to kill all of you.

637
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,120
I'm going to kill you!

638
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,680
-I'm going to kill you!
-Qing Hua!

639
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,920
-Qing Hua!
-Qing Hua!

640
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,120
Luckily, I survived
and escaped back to Mount Tai.

641
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,400
I found out on the way

642
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,680
that my seniors died that night too.

643
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,800
The eyewitness is here.

644
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,240
Shen Shen, you criminal.
What else do you have to say?

645
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,400
I am being framed! I didn't do it!

646
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,760
Framed?

647
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,400
You attacked us on Mount Tai first,

648
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,560
forcing my master to escape overnight.

649
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,640
You chased him for miles,

650
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,560
all the way from Mount Tai to Tai Lake.

651
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,880
"Chased"?

652
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,160
Why would I chase him?

653
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,320
For my master's Glazed Armor!

654
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,960
What do you mean by
"your master's Glazed Armor"?

655
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,800
The Glazed Armor belongs
to my third brother, Lu Taichong!

656
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,960
Wait!

657
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,720
Did everyone hear that?

658
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,560
Shen Shen.

659
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,840
You've already pleaded guilty.

660
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,640
You indeed attacked Ao Laizi

661
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,800
-for the Glazed Armor.
-Wait, Elder Huang.

662
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Don't mix the two incidents together.

663
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,120
There is a misunderstanding
between the Five Lakes Alliance

664
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,480
and the Mount Tai Sect,

665
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,920
but why would Chief Shen
kill one of his own?

666
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,240
What misunderstanding?

667
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,680
The Danyang Sect belongs

668
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,120
to the Five Lakes Alliance.

669
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,280
Why did Ao Laizi get involved?

670
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,840
You killed my master
and you're still blaming him?

671
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,760
You have to explain today!

672
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
-Right, explain it to us!
-That's right!

673
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Everyone, please listen to me.

674
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,920
This young disciple's words
might be wrong.

675
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,200
Let me ask you.

676
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,080
Which assassin would tell you
which clan he comes from?

677
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,960
Let's wait for Chief Gao

678
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,760
and clear the air.

679
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,040
All right, then tell Chief Gao to come out

680
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,600
and give everyone an explanation!

681
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,680
Right, tell Gao Chong to come out!

682
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,120
-Tell him to come out!
-Tell him to come out!

683
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,280
-Give us an explanation!
-Tell him to come out!

684
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,720
-Tell him to come out!
-Come out!

685
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,040
-Come out!
-I am here!

686
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,280
-Come out!
-Come out!

687
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,800
Gao Chong!

688
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,640
The main character is finally here.

689
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,040
Dramatic scenes appear one by one.

690
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,080
It's so exciting.

691
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,200
LONE ARE THE TAIYUE AND DANYANG SECTS

692
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,840
The Five Lakes Alliance is responsible

693
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,160
for the death of Master Ao Laizi.

694
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,400
You!

695
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,360
Gao Chong, you admit it?

696
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,280
Of course I do.

697
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,840
After all,

698
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,920
Master Ao Laizi died

699
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,200
because of my third brother's request.

700
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,480
This is loyalty.

701
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,880
I respect him very much.

702
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,960
The Iridescent Clouds are scattered
And the Glaze is shattered

703
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,200
Who will cry
With the Ghosts on Mount Qingya?

704
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,160
Let me see what kind of show

705
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,560
all of you will put on.

706
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,920
Don't disappoint me.
