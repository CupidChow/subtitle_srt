00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,080
SAIJUN MANOR

2
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,200
Looking back,
I was drinking joyfully with my friends,

3
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,680
-but now everything has changed.
-Here, Gu Xiang.

4
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,680
The things in front of me
are still the same as before,

5
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,120
-but the ones looking at them
-Here.

6
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,480
-are different.
-Thank you.

7
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,800
Everything in the world changes,
so do the relationships between people.

8
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,520
Zishu, come on and have a drink.

9
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,640
-Good idea.
-Here you go.

10
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Ping'an, fill it up.

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,480
Sick Man, don't even think about it.

12
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,880
Master asked me
to take good care of you before he left.

13
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,960
Just one bowl. It's not a big deal, right?

14
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,920
No.

15
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
Not even a drop.

16
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,840
Wu Xi,

17
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,280
you're giving me a hard time.

18
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,400
You know, only wine can give me happiness.

19
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,600
Lord Zhou,

20
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,360
you're the one
who's giving me a hard time.

21
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,280
Your injuries are so rare and odd

22
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,360
that even if your body is regulated
to its best condition,

23
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
I'm not completely sure I can cure you.

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,120
What else is there to say?

25
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
You must not drink

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,240
or fool around

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,120
until you are healed.

28
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,200
Wu Xi.

29
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,520
You're cute when you talk seriously.

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,400
You don't have to be completely sure.

31
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,760
Only 50% is enough.

32
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,800
Men should drink more.

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,600
If you don't listen to us,
I'll tell Master when he's back.

34
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,080
Fine.

35
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,120
I will also tell him that

36
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,800
an unruly maid gave me a hard time.

37
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
Lord Zhou.

38
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,000
You have long lost
the sense of smell and taste.

39
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,520
Drinking or not
makes no difference to you.

40
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,400
-Drink the tea.
-You--

41
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,520
-But--
-Let's have a drink.

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,640
-Come on.
-Come on.

43
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,880
Cheers.

44
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,480
It's not the wine that I want to drink.

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,480
But the feeling that comes with it, right?

46
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,160
Zishu.

47
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,480
It looks like
we can't drink together again this time.

48
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,720
I remember we agreed once

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,520
that if we could still meet each other,
we'd drink until we are wasted.

50
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,160
All these years,
I have waited so long in Nanjiang,

51
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
but that person never showed up.

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,520
I remember that person asked me

53
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,880
to find him a girl with a great figure.

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,880
I found many of them,

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,360
but he--

56
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,360
Come. Let's toast again.

57
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,720
-Cheers.
-Come.

58
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,760
We'll make sure you have a good time!

59
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,520
Gu Xiang.

60
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
Prince Qi.

61
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Ah Qinlai.

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,200
Didn't I ask you to stay with Chengling?

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,520
Why did you come back?

64
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,520
Where is Chengling?

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,400
He's fine,
but he won't let me serve him anymore.

66
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,840
What's wrong?

67
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,640
I don't know either.

68
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,120
Chief Shen asked Chengling

69
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,840
if he knew that Mr. Wen Kexing

70
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,680
was the chief of the Ghost Valley.

71
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,320
He got extremely furious and cried a lot.

72
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,560
In the end, he asked me to go back.

73
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,720
Chengling has found out
about Wen Kexing's identity.

74
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,440
At this point,

75
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
I need to discuss this with Wen Kexing.

76
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,200
Lord Zhou.

77
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
This is the elixir I made
to sustain your life

78
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,080
with all the resources
I can get in Nanjiang.

79
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
It's all right.

80
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,520
I'm going to solve the misunderstanding
between Wen Kexing and Chengling.

81
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,640
Wen Kexing promised me that

82
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,960
he won't have anything to do
with the Ghost Valley anymore.

83
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,720
He went back to get something.

84
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,720
After that,
he'll live a cloistered life with me.

85
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,760
Just in case, please keep it.

86
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,680
No matter how badly injured one is,

87
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,600
this elixir can cure half of him.

88
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,040
What if Mr. Wen needs this?

89
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,200
Don't curse him.

90
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,320
Just take it.

91
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Go!

92
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,840
Go!

93
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,720
TEA, WATER

94
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Here's your dish, sir.

95
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,760
"Just let the white deer pasture
into the verdant cliffs.

96
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,120
I can always ride it
to appreciate noted mounts."

97
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,120
It's said that the Ghost Valley is gloomy.

98
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,000
But Mount Qingya

99
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,280
seems quite peaceful to me.

100
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,200
Go!

101
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,440
Go!

102
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,880
Why are you guys still here?

103
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,880
Hurry up or you will miss it!

104
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,640
Sir, what can't be missed?

105
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,680
Haven't you heard?

106
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,120
The chief of the Ghost Valley
was caught in a siege and chased

107
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,400
by the Alliance to the White Deer Cliff.
He will die soon.

108
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,360
When the leader dies,

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,160
the demons will disappear.

110
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,280
Come quickly if you want to witness it
or it will be filled with crowds.

111
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,400
I'll go ahead. Go!

112
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,880
-Let's go.
-Hurry!

113
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,240
Kexing.

114
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,440
Stop struggling.

115
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,240
Just surrender.

116
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,120
If you listen to my words,

117
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,120
I promise that you won't be torn apart!

118
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,160
What if I refuse?

119
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,400
How dare you?

120
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,800
Can you fight all of us here,

121
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,280
even if your martial arts skills
are excellent?

122
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
We don't need to follow
any rules with him!

123
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,040
Let's rush together to kill him!

124
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,120
-Yes, kill him!
-Yes, kill him!

125
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,320
-I said that
-Kill him!

126
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,200
-Kill him!
-I'll kill anyone who comes near me.

127
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,520
You're right, I can't kill all of you.

128
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,960
I'll see which of you wants to die first

129
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,520
and who wants to live.

130
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,720
Everyone.

131
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,880
Can you see this?

132
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,120
This is the key to the World's Armory
that you want so badly.

133
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,960
You can simply open the World's Armory

134
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,240
with this key

135
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,720
instead of using the Glazed Armor.

136
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,040
Do you want it?

137
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,120
Kill me

138
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,640
and it will be yours.

139
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,120
-Great. Kill him now!
-Great. Kill him now!

140
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,480
-Kill him!
-Don't be tricked by him.

141
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,280
We can kill the chief

142
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,760
and share the World's Armory.

143
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,720
Well, Scorpion King,

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,600
I've undergone
many ups and downs in this life,

145
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
but I never thought

146
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,440
I'd fall for your treacherous plan!

147
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,240
Chief Wen, all is fair in war.

148
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,960
You can trick others,

149
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,840
but you won't allow them to do
the same to you?

150
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Xie'er, don't waste
any more time with him.

151
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,040
Wen Kexing.

152
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,040
Did you hear that?

153
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,520
It's not me who wants to kill you,

154
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,240
but God!

155
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
I only regret that I was softhearted

156
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,000
and did not kill you to avenge my father!

157
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,280
Zhen Ruyu lived an honorable life!

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,360
But unfortunately,
he has a devilish son like you!

159
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,480
If they knew about this
in the netherworld,

160
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,160
they would be so ashamed of you!

161
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,400
As his sworn brother,

162
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,520
it's my duty to kill you
to maintain his reputation.

163
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,040
I will cleanse the family for Ruyu!

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,640
Chengling, I--

165
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,600
Shut up!

166
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,800
I'll never forgive you
for destroying my family!

167
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,000
Chengling!

168
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,320
Fine.

169
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,680
I--

170
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,520
I shouldn't have attacked
the Zhang family.

171
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,600
Zhang Yusen did nothing wrong
to my father.

172
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,800
Chengling.

173
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,640
Kill me to avenge your family.

174
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,240
I'm tired.

175
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,000
I won't fight back

176
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,400
if you kill me.

177
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
-Let me go!
-Chengling, stop!

178
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,720
Kid, you can't trust a devil's words.

179
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,520
He's going to die today no matter what.
I can't let you go!

180
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,320
I promise.

181
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,600
Chengling, kill me.

182
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,960
I won't fight back.

183
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,920
You liar!

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,240
All of your words are lies!

185
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,600
Wen Kexing.

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,520
You've lied to my master all this time!

187
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,400
I--

188
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,200
He didn't lie to me.

189
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,800
Chengling, do you believe me?

190
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,120
Zhou Zishu.

191
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,360
Stop confusing Chengling.

192
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,720
Huaizhang was a righteous man.

193
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,640
How could he have
such a wicked disciple as you?

194
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Zhou Zishu!

195
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,920
I tricked all of you.

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,640
Good and evil can never coexist!

197
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,520
As the chief of the Ghost Valley,
I swear to scourge this world!

198
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,600
Save your breath.

199
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,800
Lord Zhou, you belong to a famous sect.

200
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,320
Your master and I were old friends.

201
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,640
It's not too late for you

202
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,480
to stand on the right side.

203
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,720
Today,

204
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,480
Wen Kexing must die!

205
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,720
This bastard is so cunning,
even I was tricked by him!

206
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,360
Don't fall for his tricks!

207
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,360
Cut your nonsense.

208
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,040
Are you coming at us one by one

209
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,000
or together?

210
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,240
Shame on you!

211
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,960
Both of you are vicious demons!

212
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,000
Kill them both!

213
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,160
Kill them both!

214
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,720
-You scoundrel!
-Kill them both!

215
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,160
Wen Kexing, I've told you

216
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,640
that I will kill you if I see you again

217
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,040
in the martial arts world.

218
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,520
All right.

219
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,440
Do it if you can.

220
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,400
Who is this man in white?

221
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,240
He is Changming Sword Immortal,

222
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,720
Rong Xuan's master.

223
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,000
It is said that
he is the only one in the world

224
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,600
who has completely mastered
the Combined Six Cultivation Method

225
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,600
to a perfect level.

226
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,840
I didn't expect
the Combined Six Cultivation Method

227
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,400
can be this powerful.

228
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,480
Master Ye, watch out!

229
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,760
Let me help you!

230
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,760
Chengling!

231
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,680
Chengling!

232
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,920
It's dangerous!
Don't come any closer, Chengling!

233
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,560
Get out of here!

234
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,400
Wen Kexing!

235
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,640
Wen Kexing!

236
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,800
Why does it have to be like this?

237
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,560
Master!

238
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,560
Chengling!

239
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,520
Master!

240
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,640
-Great!
-Great!

241
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,240
Zhao Jing.

242
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,600
We should find the key now.

243
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,440
The key is on Wen Kexing's body!

244
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,760
-Come on.
-Come on. Let's find the key.

245
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,840
Sir, you're awake.

246
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,320
What is this place?

247
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,840
It's Ping'an Inn.

248
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,560
Ping'an Inn?

249
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,720
Was it a dream?

250
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,080
It turns out it was just a dream.

251
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,960
What can I do for you?

252
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,320
The person who sent you here

253
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,840
is our guest of honor.

254
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,360
He instructed us to put
all your expenses on his tab.

255
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,920
My goodness.
We have been oppressed by the Ghost Valley

256
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,560
for so long and suffered so much.

257
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,000
Now, we are finally free!

258
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,440
-How great. This is really great!
-Yes.

259
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,880
But that demon died so easily.

260
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,320
We were too easy on him!

261
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,680
That evil bastard died

262
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,360
with his whole body still intact!

263
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,360
It's unfair!

264
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,840
-Don't you guys think so?
-Yes!

265
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,280
-Yes!
-Chief Zhao should parade

266
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,920
this bastard's corpse as a warning!

267
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,400
-You're right!
-You're right!

268
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,880
-Come.
-Let's have a drink.

269
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,320
-Yes. Cheers.
-I'm sorry for this.

270
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
In the past half month,

271
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,200
many masters and heroes have come here.

272
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,000
Something big seems to have happened.
It was noisy all night out there.

273
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,160
Indeed.

274
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,720
I--

275
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,720
Sir?

276
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,680
Sir, are you all right?

277
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,920
Sir?

278
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,520
-I fill it for you.
-You deserve a lot of credit.

279
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,640
Immortal Ye, please enjoy it.

280
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,040
-Don't drink so much.
-Everyone.

281
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,040
-Little girl, pour me some wine.
-All right.

282
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,320
We were able to achieve such success today

283
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,080
thanks to Immortal Ye.

284
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,400
Right.

285
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,600
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

286
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,040
I wouldn't have known that

287
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,080
there were such skills in this world.

288
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,400
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

289
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,760
-Yes.
-Yes.

290
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,080
-Yes, absolutely.
-Yes.

291
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,320
I'm flattered.

292
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,800
-You're right.
-We should give credit

293
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,240
to this good young man,
the godchild of Chief Zhao.

294
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,480
If he hadn't lured
the Ghost Chief out first,

295
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,600
with the Ghost Valley's strong defense,

296
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,400
even if my skills had been more powerful,

297
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,400
I wouldn't have had the chance
to show them.

298
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Immortal Ye, you overpraised him.

299
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,080
He is just a child.

300
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,200
He only did what he should do.

301
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,400
You flattered him.

302
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,400
Son, what are you waiting for?

303
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,440
A toast to Immortal Ye.

304
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,960
Immortal Ye.

305
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,400
I don't like bustling places.

306
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,560
I hope you enjoy this celebration.

307
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,160
I'll take my leave first.

308
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Immortal Ye.

309
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,240
-It--
-It--

310
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,360
-It--
-Goodbye, Immortal Ye.

311
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,360
What a bummer.

312
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,080
Please continue, everyone.

313
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,840
Have another cup after this one.

314
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,120
We should drink
to our heart's content tonight.

315
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,720
-Come on, let's drink it.
-Let's keep drinking.

316
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,760
Come on, I pour you some wine.

317
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,480
Xie'er.

318
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,760
Come here.

319
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,800
Sit down.

320
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,720
Haven't you always wanted
to sit beside me?

321
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,160
I did promise you.

322
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,520
Chief, allow me to toast
to Young Master Zhao.

323
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,840
He suggested a brilliant idea

324
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,440
of capturing the chief first.

325
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,120
That's right.

326
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,840
Let me toast to him.

327
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,000
A toast to Young Master Zhao and Chief.

328
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,440
Like father, like son.

329
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,240
They're both heroes, right?

330
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,640
If it weren't for this,

331
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,320
I would never know that the famous chief

332
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,120
-of the Scorpion Sect--
-Enough.

333
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,480
I would like to take this opportunity

334
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,800
to formally introduce you

335
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,240
to this excellent young man beside me.

336
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,920
He's my beloved good son,

337
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,840
Zhao Xie'er.

338
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,160
-A toast to Young Master Zhao.
-A toast to Young Master Zhao.

339
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,960
-A toast to Young Master Zhao!
-Come on.

340
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,120
Cheers.

341
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
-Cheers.
-All right. Cheers.

342
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,920
-Thank you, Father.
-Cheers.

343
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,440
Chengling!

344
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,760
Chengling!

345
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,440
Chengling!

346
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,080
-Master.
-Shut up!

347
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,680
Amethyst Fiend, you wench!

348
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,360
Where did you take Cao Weining to?

349
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,000
Master, no.

350
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,160
You jerk.

351
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,680
Do you know who she is?

352
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,720
She is my fiancée.

353
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,840
Master, I'll never fight against you.

354
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,440
But if you want to hurt Gu Xiang,
kill me first!

355
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,160
All right.

356
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,640
I've brought you up in vain!

357
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
Master Fan.

358
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,840
Please tell me.

359
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,440
Is it true that my master, Wen Kexing,

360
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,240
is dead?

361
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,360
Liu Qianqiao?

362
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,840
Is Wen Kexing inside?

363
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
Spy! A spy from Ghost Valley broke in!

364
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,640
The spy of the Ghost Valley!

365
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,960
Have you seen him?

366
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,520
He seemed to be heading to the yard.

367
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,520
Let's go.

368
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Master Fan!

369
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,280
Master Fan, have you seen the assassin?

370
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,720
What does he look like?

371
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,840
He's carrying a sword
and has anti-gravity skills.

372
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,760
Zhou Xu.

373
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,920
This way.

374
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,280
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

375
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,680
-Master Fan.
-Zhou Xu.

376
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,000
-Master Fan.
-Let's go, you fool!

377
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,120
The spy is there! Give us a hand!

378
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,720
Gu Xiang, run!

379
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,440
Gu Xiang?

380
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,120
-Put out the fire! Quickly!
-Put out the fire!

381
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,720
-Put out the fire!
-Quick!

382
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,040
Sick Man, where is my master?

383
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,800
Stop playing tricks on me.

384
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,040
Didn't you save my master?

385
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,600
Didn't you?

386
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,840
No.

387
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,960
Zhou Xu.

388
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,120
Zhou Xu, where is my master?

389
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,000
You asked me to stay here

390
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,440
and said you would save him!

391
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,640
But where is him now?

392
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,920
-Tell me where my master is!
-Gu Xiang!

393
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,160
He is so powerful! He would never die!

394
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,120
Just tell me where my master is!

395
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,520
Mr. Zhou, what happened?

396
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
As soon as we arrived in White Deer Town,

397
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,080
we heard
the chief of the Ghost Valley was killed.

398
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,000
Is that true?

399
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,960
Were you there looking for him?

400
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,320
Please tell us where he is.

401
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,560
I failed to bring him out

402
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
so I set a fire

403
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,600
to let him--

404
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,840
I don't believe it.

405
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,720
You liar!

406
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,840
I'm going to find my master!

407
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,200
Gu Xiang!

408
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,960
Mr. Zhou.

409
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,360
Didn't Prince Qi and Great Shaman
come with you?

410
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,720
Gu Xiang couldn't wait,

411
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,560
so we came here first.

412
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,760
They are still on the way.

413
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
All right.

414
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,600
Weining,

415
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,640
take Gu Xiang with you
and go somewhere far.

416
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
If you can't find a place here
in the Central Plain,

417
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,960
go back to Nanjiang with Prince Qi.

418
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,880
Bring along
all of my 18 disciples with you.

419
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,640
Prince Qi will always keep you safe.

420
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,000
Mr. Zhou, what about you?

421
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,520
Mr. Zhou!

422
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,000
If you leave,

423
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,520
I'll be alone in this wilderness.

424
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,400
Who should I go to?

425
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,000
FLOWERS BLOSSOM IN ALL FOUR SEASONS
KNOWING EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD.

426
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,320
Why don't you ask me what I think of you?

427
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,480
You're my soul mate.

428
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,280
Wen Kexing.

429
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,200
Actually…

430
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,840
I always know what you want.

431
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,320
But I didn't say it.

432
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,800
I thought I could slowly change your mind.

433
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,800
Who knows

434
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,120
that I was the one who changed in the end?

435
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,440
I know.

436
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,680
You want to overthrow this world of chaos

437
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,400
together with the Ghost Valley.

438
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,520
You want these people

439
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,440
who seek fame and fortune like buffoons

440
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,840
to be consumed by their greed.

441
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,720
And you want to set fire
to burn all this mess

442
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,840
to avenge your parents.

443
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,520
I used to think

444
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,960
you were too radical

445
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,200
and you were blinded by hatred.

446
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,920
That was easy for me to say

447
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,080
until I'm living it now.

448
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,000
The trap has been set,

449
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,120
but where is the hunter?

450
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,440
You spent so much time plotting.

451
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,520
Don't you want to see the end?

452
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
The most difficult part

453
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,680
of your injuries is that once the nails
are pulled out of your body,

454
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,600
the surging internal force

455
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,840
will immediately rush through
and break your meridians.

456
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,000
This elixir can temporarily protect
your meridians and help you withstand

457
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,560
the circulation of the internal force.

458
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,120
The world is not important,

459
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,240
but my soul mate is.

460
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,520
Since my soul mate is gone,

461
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,520
what do I have to care about?

462
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,400
Tomorrow is the Awakening of Insects

463
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,920
and also the reopening
of the Heroes Conference.

464
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,680
My first toast

465
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,520
is to my dead brothers.

466
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,000
I hope their spirits in heaven

467
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,600
can bless our Five Lakes Alliance

468
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,920
so we'll succeed in electing
a highly respected chief

469
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,120
who could lead us

470
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,560
to wipe out the Ghost Valley.

471
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,360
Come on.

472
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,600
To the dead brothers.

473
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,160
Cheers.

474
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,040
My second toast

475
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,280
is to all of you here

476
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,040
to encourage you to fight.

477
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,800
Now,

478
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,240
all the heroes have gathered here.

479
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,120
Whether the Five Lakes Alliance
can erase the shame

480
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,560
and create glory again

481
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,160
depends on this critical battle.

482
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,000
They have dominated
the Ghost Valley for many years.

483
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,840
It boasts a geographical advantage,
which is difficult for us to attack.

484
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,600
It will be a difficult fight.

485
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,840
All I want

486
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,800
is for all of you to come back safely.

487
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,520
After that, we will drink for days again!

488
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,200
-All right! Cheers!
-Cheers!

489
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,120
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

490
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,520
Everyone, it's pretty late now.

491
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,680
Have one more cup

492
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,680
and let's all go to sleep.

493
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
Have a good rest

494
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,280
to recover our strength.

495
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,720
Chief, you are too cautious.

496
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,040
Everyone, in my opinion,

497
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,440
the chief of the Ghost Valley is dead.

498
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,160
His former subordinates, the Ten Devils,

499
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,360
are almost all in our camp.

500
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,120
So the Ghost Valley

501
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,880
means nothing now.

502
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,560
We don't need to be afraid at all!

503
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,720
The remaining ghosts

504
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,440
are simply struggling to survive.

505
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,360
Don't worry.

506
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,200
-Come on, everyone. Raise your cups.
-Come on.

507
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,160
-But we should never
-Drink!

508
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,600
-Drink.
-take it lightly.

509
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,400
Zhao Jing.

510
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,480
The third toast goes to you.

511
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,200
I hope you can get everything you want

512
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,600
and accomplish

513
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,040
Gao Chong's unfinished career.

514
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,880
Mr. Zhao.

515
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,520
I hope that you can get what you want.

516
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,320
And I wish my father,
Mr. Gao, and Mr. Lu's spirits

517
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,360
bless me for successfully avenging them.

518
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,640
Everyone,

519
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,240
let's toast to Chief Zhao together.

520
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,360
Father, I wish

521
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,320
you'll succeed in becoming the supreme
leader of the martial arts world.

522
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,040
Xie'er, we should plan for the long term.

523
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,680
What we want is to uphold justice

524
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,440
and eliminate the demons.

525
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,680
Actually, it's not that important for me

526
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,200
to become the supreme leader.

527
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,400
It doesn't matter.

528
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,880
Over the past 100 years,

529
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,680
Shaolin Sect, Wudang Sect, Five Mount
and Sword Sects, and Beggar Gangs

530
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,400
could do nothing
to suppress the Ghost Valley.

531
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,080
Thanks to Chief Zhao
and Young Master Zhao's brilliant idea,

532
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,760
we managed to hunt down the chief
of the Ghost Valley with one move.

533
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,280
With such great merit,
no one but our chief can be

534
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,120
the supreme leader
of the martial arts world.

535
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,240
-Isn't that right?
-Yes!

536
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,640
-That's right!
-Yes.

537
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,080
Everyone, under Chief Zhao's lead,

538
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,280
we can wipe out the ghosts

539
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,880
no matter how many of them are there!

540
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,440
Let's toast to Chief Zhao!

541
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,360
-To Chief Zhao, congratulations!
-To Chief Zhao, congratulations!

542
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,280
-Toast to Chief Zhao.
-Toast to Chief Zhao.

543
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,440
Thank you, everyone.

544
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,400
Cheers.

545
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,160
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

546
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,200
Changqing.

547
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,720
We've been in the mountains all the time,

548
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,640
accompanying each other every day.

549
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,040
Not knowing what's happening
in the outside world,

550
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,880
so we didn't feel that we were aging.

551
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,120
Only when I went down the mountain
and saw those young brats

552
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,120
that I realized

553
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,480
that we have become so old.

554
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,640
Changqing.

555
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,800
You self-centered idiot.

556
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,800
You established the Ghost Valley
and made the Soup of Oblivion.

557
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,680
You wanted to give all the evildoers

558
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,240
a chance to start over.

559
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,160
But who gave you a chance to live?

560
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,280
If it were not for this damn Ghost Valley,

561
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,600
you wouldn't have practiced
the Combined Six Cultivation Power.

562
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,560
You tried to make yourself
the most powerful man

563
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,280
to hold down the demons there forever.

564
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,200
CHANGQING, THE MAGIC CRAFTSMAN,
SWORD MADE FOR OWN USE

565
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,840
Did you think you were a Bodhisattva?

566
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,280
How ridiculous.

567
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,320
As a mortal,

568
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,640
why did you worry
about the matters of God?

569
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,680
Did they treat you well for what you did?

570
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,320
CHANGQING, THE MAGIC CRAFTSMAN,
SWORD MADE FOR OWN USE

571
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,200
I promised to clean this mess for you

572
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,520
and destroy the Ghost Valley.

573
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,360
I didn't tell you even when you were dying

574
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,840
that our child

575
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,720
died outside Mount Qingya.

576
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,440
There was another young man

577
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,000
who died for Rong Xuan.

578
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,320
But unexpectedly, this young man's son

579
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,920
became the chief of the Ghost Valley.

580
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,920
Fate makes fun of people.

581
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,840
Changqing.

582
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,480
If it was you who survived

583
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,720
and not me,

584
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,880
what would you do?

585
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,080
Officer Duan, please.

586
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
Officer Duan.

587
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,960
Is there any problem?

588
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,560
Chief Zhao.

589
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,520
I'm as blind as a bat.

590
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,080
I didn't expect you were using
both black and white ways.

591
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
You're not only
the chief of the Five Lakes Alliance,

592
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,720
but you're also
the chief of the Scorpion Sect.

593
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,400
I'm sorry for not knowing sooner.

594
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,440
Officer Duan, it's my fault.

595
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,080
But this is not the right time

596
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,760
to explain the details.

597
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,440
But if you want to know,

598
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,240
I won't lie to you, my ally.

599
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,920
"Ally"?

600
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,120
I don't dare to say that we,
the Window of Heaven, are your ally.

601
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,360
How many identities you have

602
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,040
has nothing to do with me.

603
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,840
But Scorpion Sect

604
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,760
commits so many evil deeds
and pillages everywhere.

605
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,000
They buy people to make Drug Men.

606
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,960
The world won't tolerate it.

607
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,200
If we blatantly support someone like you

608
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,960
to become the supreme leader
and eradicate the Ghost Valley,

609
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,560
once the matter is revealed,

610
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,120
I will be the first one

611
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,520
to be killed by His Highness.

612
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,680
Officer Duan!

613
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,280
I'm here today to inform you

614
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,880
that we're enemies, not friends anymore.

615
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,000
The next time we meet,

616
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,360
I will not show any mercy.

617
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,840
-I'll take my leave.
-Officer Duan, please wait!

618
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,160
There must be some misunderstanding.

619
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,440
I'm not the chief of the Scorpion Sect.

620
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,680
The Scorpion King is.

621
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,640
He is sort of my ally.

622
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,800
"Ally"?

623
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,960
Isn't he your godchild?

624
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,600
Yes, that's right.

625
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,280
But I didn't know that he had done

626
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,960
so many evil things behind my back.

627
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,960
Officer Duan, could you please tell me

628
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,440
what Drug Men are?

629
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,400
How's it going?

630
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,160
People's minds can't afford to be tested.

631
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,000
Zhao Jing said

632
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,280
he's about to recommence
the Heroes Conference

633
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,800
and fight the Ghost Valley to the end.

634
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,600
Using demons to destroy demons

635
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,360
is not against the will of God.

636
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,000
After the fierce fight,

637
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,240
he'll kill you himself

638
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,240
to take over the Scorpion Sect.
