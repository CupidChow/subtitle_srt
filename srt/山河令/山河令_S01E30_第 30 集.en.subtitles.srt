1
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,200
The tea tastes good.

2
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,200
Qianqiao,

3
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,240
these guards can leave.

4
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,240
Even if Mo Huaiyang is an idiot,

5
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,040
he wouldn't hide the Glazed Armor here.

6
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,840
These guards are just
pretending to work hard.

7
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,120
Yes.

8
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,840
Let's go.

9
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,320
Your Majesty,

10
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,360
how long should we wait?

11
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,200
How about

12
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,760
letting me set a fire

13
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,000
to force them out?

14
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,080
What's the rush?

15
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,280
Mo Huaiyang can't run away forever.

16
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,000
As long as his disciples are here,

17
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,040
he will come eventually.

18
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,640
But Your Majesty, accidents might happen.

19
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,960
We brought
so many Drug Men here this time.

20
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,320
If one of them

21
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
gets away,

22
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,080
things may go south.

23
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,000
What if

24
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,560
Mo Huaiyang brings help?

25
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,040
In that case,

26
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,480
we will kill

27
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,120
anyone who stands in the way.

28
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Have some food.

29
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,200
Idiot,

30
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,000
don't you have anything to ask?

31
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,000
I--

32
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,400
I--

33
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,120
I do.

34
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,840
Gu Xiang,

35
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,640
who are you exactly?

36
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,640
Why don't you ask me

37
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,280
in front of Master Fan and your senior?

38
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,480
If I did, then,

39
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,320
what should you do?

40
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,520
Do you care about me that much?

41
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,360
Of course!

42
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,960
I've already promised Mr. Wen.

43
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,680
That Wen Kexing.

44
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,480
How can he be the chief
of the Ghost Valley?

45
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,640
He--

46
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,240
he has a close relationship
with Mr. Zhou and Chengling.

47
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,320
Yes. He's Hero Zhen's descendant, right?

48
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,120
Gu Xiang,

49
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,040
are there any misunderstandings?

50
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,480
Mr. Wen was framed by others,

51
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,280
so he did that on purpose,

52
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,080
didn't he?

53
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,400
It doesn't matter

54
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,560
whether it's true or not.

55
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,160
If it's a misunderstanding,

56
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,600
I will prove your innocence,

57
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,560
even if it costs me my life.

58
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,120
What if it's true?

59
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,440
What if I'm a lone ghost
from Mount Qingya,

60
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,640
coming to the human world by accident,

61
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,880
then meeting you

62
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,840
and deceiving you?

63
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,800
Weining,

64
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,680
will you kill me?

65
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,920
In the place where I grew up,

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
there were people
always killing each other.

67
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,880
Even if there's only a 1% chance,

68
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,240
it's better to kill the wrong guy
instead of letting him go.

69
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,240
If I don't do that,

70
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,960
I wouldn't be able to be alive.

71
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,120
If--

72
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,840
if you were a spy sent by the Ghost Valley

73
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,280
and deceived me on purpose

74
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,840
to get into the Gentle Wind Sword Sect

75
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,480
and bring your allies here,

76
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,400
so that you could kill us

77
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,080
and destroy our sect,

78
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,920
I would kill you without a doubt.

79
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,760
All right then.

80
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
But Gu Xiang,

81
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,320
do you know?

82
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,280
I've sworn an oath.

83
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,120
I, Cao Weining, will never fail you

84
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,920
in my life, not for once.

85
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,280
But in this matter,

86
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,480
I'm not sure if that counts
as failing you.

87
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,920
But rest assured, Gu Xiang.

88
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,160
If I kill you,

89
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,720
I will kill myself right after that.

90
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,320
I will go with you to the netherworld.

91
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,800
Let's reincarnate together, hand in hand.

92
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,360
Gu Xiang,

93
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,360
please believe me.

94
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
In the next life,

95
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,280
I'll grow up with you

96
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,000
so you won't follow any bad examples
or go through any hardship.

97
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,560
But Gu Xiang, I don't think you are a spy.

98
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,720
I know you are a good girl.

99
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,000
So Gu Xiang, please tell me,

100
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,640
what's going on?

101
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,280
If I tell you,

102
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,520
will you believe me?

103
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,760
I will.

104
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,200
Gu Xiang.

105
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,680
Gu Xiang.

106
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,840
Gu Xiang, don't cry.

107
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,440
I believe you. I do.

108
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,680
As long as you tell me.

109
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,080
Gu Xiang, please don't cry.

110
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,760
I'll tell you.

111
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,000
All of it.

112
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,440
Come here.

113
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,840
Sit down. Let me tell you.

114
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,040
My master's name is Wen Kexing.

115
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,640
He is the chief of the Ghost Valley.

116
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,840
But he has decided to be a good person.

117
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
No, that's not right.

118
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,480
He is a good person.

119
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
He just wanted to seek revenge

120
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,800
and he didn't need the Glazed Armor.

121
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,840
He won't be the enemy of your sect either.

122
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,560
Gu Xiang, slow down. I can't follow you.

123
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,680
All right.
Then, I'll start from the beginning.

124
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,960
Before I grew up in the Ghost Valley.

125
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,880
Since--

126
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,160
Since I began to remember things,
I had been in the Ghost Valley.

127
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,560
Back then,

128
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,000
my master was only a teenager.

129
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,720
He was serving the old chief.

130
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,160
He said I was picked up from the waters,

131
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,680
so my name is Gu Xiang.

132
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,720
I believed it for years.

133
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
But later, I realized it was a lie.

134
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,280
The old chief kidnapped some children

135
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,960
to help him practice some evil skill.

136
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,440
All the other children had died,
except for me.

137
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,280
My master begged the old chief

138
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,280
to keep me as a living toy,

139
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,200
so I survived.

140
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,880
Children who grew up in the Ghost Valley

141
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,760
consider killing as natural as breathing.

142
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,520
Everybody thought

143
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,480
the law of this world is that
only the powerful can survive.

144
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,360
But my master told me
that was not the case.

145
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,320
There was a place called
the "human world."

146
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,440
I was just a little kid
who entered the Ghost Valley by mistake.

147
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,200
He said that
he would send me back one day.

148
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,120
Not until I grew up did I realize

149
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,560
that my master had protected me
so many times.

150
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,440
One day,

151
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,040
my master started a riot
in the Ghost Valley.

152
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,640
He killed the old chief
and took the throne.

153
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,240
In the following years,

154
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,840
-Master killed every one
-Chief!

155
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,240
of the former Ten Devils

156
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,560
and replaced them with new ones.

157
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
"Lunatic Wen" became his nickname.

158
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,600
Back then, I didn't take it seriously.

159
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,360
My master became the new chief.

160
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,720
I was thrilled
because I could do whatever I wanted.

161
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,600
Until one day,

162
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,600
my master said
he had finally completed his plan

163
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,440
and he would take me to the human world.

164
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,640
Order all 3,000 ghosts in Mount Qingya.

165
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,920
From now on,

166
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,840
I want everyone to go out

167
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,240
and kill the traitor.

168
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,640
Whoever can get

169
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,520
the Glazed Armor back for me

170
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,560
will be the head of Ten Devils!

171
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,880
So you went out

172
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,160
to kill Hanged Ghost
and get the Glazed Armor.

173
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,880
You idiot. I explained it for so long.

174
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,320
This is just an excuse.
Master only wanted to take revenge.

175
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,960
After the Zhen couple died,

176
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,560
Mr. Wen was kidnapped and
brought back to the Ghost Valley, right?

177
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,800
No wonder when he met Hero Shen Shen,

178
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,080
he looked so devastated.

179
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm sorry. You've been through a lot.

180
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,400
Wait.

181
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,000
The ghosts killed his parents,

182
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,800
yet kept him around.

183
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,680
Aren't they afraid
that he will take revenge on them later?

184
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,280
Whoever enters the Valley

185
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,160
has to drink a decoction
named the Soup of Oblivion.

186
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,640
After consuming it, they'll forget
the deep obsession of their life.

187
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,760
The old chief thought

188
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,880
my master had forgotten about his parents.

189
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,160
But he didn't.

190
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,560
He has a strong mind.

191
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,920
He buried his hatred deep in his heart.

192
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,040
Master Wen.

193
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,240
Master Wen!

194
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,400
Finally, you are awake.

195
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,600
As you were unconscious for several days,
I was scared to death.

196
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,280
Right.

197
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,320
Master Wen, this is--

198
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,600
Master Wen,

199
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,840
I'm Jing Beiyuan,
the seventh child of my generation.

200
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,760
This is Nanjiang's Great Shaman.

201
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,840
You are so kind to come all the way here

202
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,280
to help us out.

203
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,400
Please accept my bow.

204
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,680
Master Wen,

205
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,240
there's no need for that.

206
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,480
I owe Zishu my life.

207
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,160
Beiyuan, we can catch up later.

208
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,600
Master Wen has been unconscious for days.

209
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,880
We have lost our advantage.

210
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,080
Perhaps Lord Zhou
has been sent to Jin now.

211
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,120
Our priority is to save him.

212
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,680
But the Window of Heaven
is heavily guarded.

213
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,240
We may not be strong enough to make it.

214
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,120
Our team from Nanjiang

215
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,040
only brought a few bodyguards along.

216
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,800
It's too late to call for backup.

217
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,440
What happened to Zhou Xu?

218
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,560
WHITE CLOTH

219
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,760
WHITE CLOTH

220
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,160
Master Zhou, please.

221
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,320
I've already taken the Muscle Relaxants.

222
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,840
This is unnecessary.

223
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,160
Please forgive us.

224
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,560
Let's go.

225
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,280
WHITE CLOTH

226
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,800
WHITE CLOTH

227
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,840
PLEASANT VIRTUE

228
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,200
Your Highness.

229
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,880
All right.

230
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,760
Pengju, thank you.

231
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,800
Go and get some rest.

232
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,480
-Your Highness.
-You may go.

233
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,760
Yes, Your Highness.

234
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,840
Let's go.

235
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,720
Zishu,

236
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,680
why don't you come in?

237
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:34,680
PLEASANT VIRTUE

238
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,160
You are quite something.

239
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,360
I have to come to you, don't I?

240
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,640
Your Highness.

241
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,760
The homeland has been destroyed.

242
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,640
You don't have to keep me

243
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,760
or this sword.

244
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,520
It's so sharp.

245
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,120
It should go back to whom it belongs.

246
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,760
Follow me.

247
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
I've prepared you a jar of fine wine.

248
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,920
WHITE CLOTH

249
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,320
It's the wine in Qingluan's courtyard.

250
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,160
As the years have gone by,

251
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,520
there is not much left.

252
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,000
We made a promise back then, right?

253
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,560
Ten years later,

254
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,240
with the same people

255
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,840
in that same yard.

256
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,280
We will open it and drink it up.

257
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Same people?

258
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,920
They've all left.

259
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,920
Yunxing went far away to the borderland.

260
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,360
Qingluan committed suicide.

261
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,680
Prince Qi was poisoned by you.

262
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,520
Jiuxiao died in Lucheng in a battle.

263
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,920
Among those who were in that yard,

264
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,760
only you and I are here now.

265
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,520
Hundreds of times

266
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,520
when I fell into dreams at midnight,

267
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,800
I went back
to that flower-blooming courtyard.

268
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,920
Beiyuan was playing his guqin.

269
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,240
Jiuxiao was playing his xiao.

270
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,560
Yunxing was brandishing his sword
and Qingluan was composing songs.

271
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
As I turned back,

272
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,840
you were standing by my side.

273
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,480
You were right.

274
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,000
Zishu.

275
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,320
All our friends have left.

276
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,400
Now, there are only both of us.

277
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,760
The bond between us

278
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,720
is an entanglement of favor
and resentment.

279
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,880
I don't want
to hold on to the past anymore.

280
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,760
Come back and help me.

281
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,840
Let's forget whatever happened
in the past year

282
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,000
and start over.

283
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,720
What do you say?

284
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,960
PLEASANT VIRTUE

285
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,680
PLEASANT VIRTUE

286
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,280
Good wine.

287
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,400
Time is essential to wine

288
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,840
just as old friends are to people.

289
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,560
I used to think

290
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,480
it's better that you died.

291
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,640
If one wants to be a king,

292
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,920
he must suffer from loneliness.

293
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,840
But since I found out

294
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,600
that you appeared outside Yueyang City

295
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,040
safe and sound
with your martial arts remaining the same,

296
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,320
I was so happy then.

297
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,760
Come on.

298
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,080
Tell me.

299
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,040
What did you do
with the Nails of Seven Torments?

300
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,840
Even Pengju didn't discern your tricks.

301
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,320
I didn't get rid of

302
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,600
the Nails of Seven Torments,

303
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,960
but handled them in another way.

304
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,120
Pinning one nail into my body

305
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,640
every three months.

306
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,080
This way, gradually,

307
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,920
these nails would integrate
into my flesh and blood.

308
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,240
It allowed me to get used to

309
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,040
the pain of breaking tendons and veins

310
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,560
so that after the punishment,

311
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,000
I will still be alive

312
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
along with degraded martial arts.

313
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,240
For 18 months.

314
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,280
You have suffered terrible pain

315
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,800
for as long as 18 months.

316
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
Why?

317
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,840
If you wanted to turn your back on me,

318
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,400
you could just leave without a sound.

319
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,880
Why?

320
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,080
Why did you torture yourself?

321
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,200
I was the one who set this rule
of the Nails of Seven Torments.

322
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,880
Those who risked their lives with me
did the same.

323
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,640
If I made an exception,

324
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,360
I would be too ashamed to meet them
in the netherworld.

325
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,560
PLEASANT VIRTUE

326
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,960
Jiuxiao's death was an accident.

327
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,840
Do you think I'm not sorry for him?

328
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,200
What you did can't bring him back.

329
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,520
If Jiuxiao knew this, he would be
far more heartbroken than I am.

330
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,800
Jiuxiao's death was an accident?

331
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,160
Then how about my 79 brothers
of the Four Seasons Manor?

332
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,440
Did they also die in accidents?

333
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,520
A water-fetching jar would eventually
be broken against the well.

334
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,520
A general is doomed to die
in fights against the enemy.

335
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,960
Wars are cruel.

336
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,320
Life and death are destined by fate.

337
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,120
It's easy for you to shift the blame.

338
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,200
Zhou Zishu.

339
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
Don't you forget.

340
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,960
It was you who named it Window of Heaven.

341
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,800
You wanted to bring light
into this dark world,

342
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,840
happiness to people,

343
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,760
and peace to the later generations.

344
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,160
Don't you understand what they died for?

345
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,160
Now,

346
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,480
I'm about to destroy

347
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,880
this decaying world.

348
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,640
How could you not be here?

349
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,800
What about Han Ying?

350
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,560
Han Ying?

351
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,600
I'm talking to you
about all the people in this world

352
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,000
and the righteous path,

353
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,440
yet you bring him up?

354
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,800
Who the hell is he?

355
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,520
A cheap orphan slave.

356
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,240
How dare he show off before me?

357
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,720
Well,

358
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,920
thanks to this idiot
who walked straight into the trap,

359
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,240
I found you in no time.

360
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,680
But are you questioning me
all because of him?

361
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,080
How ridiculous.

362
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,360
He's also one of those people!

363
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,680
He was only 22 years old.

364
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,040
Zishu, you're so ridiculous.

365
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,720
Your joke is killing me.

366
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Over the past decade,

367
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,760
countless people have died
for your so-called righteousness,

368
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,080
including those who should die
and those who shouldn't.

369
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,760
Your Highness.

370
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,360
I'm no longer
a 16-year-old teenager anymore.

371
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,560
I know nothing about the peaceful world

372
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,680
that you told me about.

373
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,520
I just know that
many people died because of me.

374
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Every day and night,
I am tortured by their death.

375
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,000
A peaceful world is built upon sacrifice.

376
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,880
They died for a great cause!

377
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,320
Did they die for a great cause

378
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,440
or your ambition?

379
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,080
PLEASANT VIRTUE

380
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,200
It was such a well-aged wine,

381
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,400
but you ruined it.

382
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,640
Zishu,

383
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,320
calm down.

384
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,960
You've taken the Muscle Relaxants
for days.

385
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,640
You might die

386
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,600
if you get too mad.

387
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,120
You destroyed the Four Seasons Manor.

388
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,160
I destroyed it

389
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,480
to offer you a chance.

390
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,560
Jin was your actual homeland.

391
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,840
You couldn't make a decision,

392
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,880
so I made it for you.

393
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,520
I was thinking

394
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,480
if you would come back to me,

395
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,680
I would forgive all your misdeeds.

396
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,360
How ridiculous.

397
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,960
I always thought

398
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,880
you were my soul mate.

399
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,320
But it turns out

400
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,240
that you're no more
than an ordinary person.

401
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,840
My soul mate?

402
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,400
You are not qualified.

403
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,520
What did you say?

404
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Guards!

405
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,480
Your Highness. Zhou Zishu, you…

406
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,760
You traitor!

407
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
If you dare to hurt me just a little,

408
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,840
you will die in Jin!

409
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
Freeze, everyone!

410
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Your Highness.

411
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,360
I came here with no intention

412
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,520
of leaving here alive.

413
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,080
Did you tamper with the Muscle Relaxants?

414
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,960
Good.

415
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,520
You still have allies
in the Window of Heaven!

416
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,320
Your Highness.

417
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,760
You are wrong.

418
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,120
Hear my commands.

419
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,000
If I die here today,

420
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,720
everyone in the Window of Heaven

421
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,840
must die with me.

422
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

423
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,920
Your Highness.

424
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,920
So many years have passed,

425
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,440
yet you haven't changed a bit.

426
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,400
I gave Duan Pengju all the authority

427
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,560
so that he could take over everything.

428
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,160
If I still have allies
in the Window of Heaven,

429
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,920
how could I just sit by
and leave them here?

430
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,640
I told you.

431
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,160
I just handled the Nails of Seven Torments
in another way.

432
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,520
I slowed down the process,

433
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,160
but I can't change the result.

434
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,840
I have lost my sense of taste and smell.

435
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,360
No scent works on me.

436
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,640
Absurd!

437
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,560
You knew I wouldn't kill you.

438
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
You will.

439
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,840
But you would see me first.

440
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,320
If you are willing to see me,

441
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,000
as long as we are in the same room,

442
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,000
I have a thousand ways to kill you.

443
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Your Highness,

444
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,560
maybe you have forgotten

445
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,000
what our teacher once said.

446
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,960
The emperor's fury

447
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,400
results in a sea of blood.

448
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,840
Commoners' fury will only result
in the death of one person,

449
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,600
yet it can make the whole world mourn.

450
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
I--

451
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,360
I trusted you

452
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,360
even though you are a traitor's son.

453
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,200
You have been depressed
after Jiuxiao died,

454
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,040
then you left me.

455
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,440
Yet I forgave you.

456
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,400
Even--

457
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,520
even when you turned your back on me,

458
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,520
I still couldn't bear to take your life.

459
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,800
What about you?

460
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,480
You ungrateful bastard!

461
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,480
Your Highness.

462
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,200
All favors and resentment between us

463
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,640
are too deeply entangled.

464
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,840
You fooled me and tried to kill me.

465
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,040
I don't care anymore.

466
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,160
I have failed the Four Seasons Manor.

467
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,680
I can't fail the whole world anymore.

468
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,880
PLEASANT VIRTUE

469
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,120
How ridiculous.

470
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,000
I have never really understood you.

471
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,880
Zhou Zishu.

472
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,640
When did you become a Bodhisattva?

473
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,400
-You used to--
-Enough!

474
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,360
Kill me!

475
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,960
Kill me!

476
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,520
Others will inherit my ambition.

477
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,080
WHITE CLOTH

478
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,960
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

479
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,120
Your Highness.

480
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,920
No.

481
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,680
-Your Highness.
-No.

482
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,840
No.

483
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,760
Don't kill him.

484
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,200
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

485
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,440
What's that sound? Quick!

486
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,760
Weining.

487
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,160
Gu Xiang,

488
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
aren't you afraid?

489
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,640
What do I have to fear?

490
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,720
Don't get angry with me,

491
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,120
but actually,
when we were on our way up to escape,

492
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,400
I was quite happy about it.

493
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,120
If we die here together,

494
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,520
you will never find out.

495
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,800
Am I the only one who smells this?

496
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,560
Someone's roasting meat.

497
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,560
I think I smell it too.

498
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,880
The wind direction is not helping.

499
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,040
Guys,

500
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,760
bring some big fans here.

501
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,680
Spread the scent.

502
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,800
-Yes.
-Yes.

503
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,360
Little bastards.

504
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,720
Smell it.

505
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,800
You must be so hungry.

506
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,600
Your Majesty, I have bad news.

507
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,640
Mo Huaiyang is back.

508
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,600
He brought someone with him.

509
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,000
Is he bringing along with him
the Jade Emperor or your father?

510
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,920
Look at your frightened face!

511
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,880
You're useless.

512
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,280
Where are my disciples?

513
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,280
Father.

514
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,280
You vile creature!

515
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
You rascal!

516
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,520
Answer Chief Mo.

517
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,840
Are you all deaf?

518
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,800
Answer Chief Mo!

519
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,880
YUFENG CAVE

520
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Open up!

521
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,800
I'm back!

522
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,760
Mr. Zhao.

523
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,480
See for yourself.

524
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,480
See for yourself.

525
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,160
That person!

526
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,360
Your son is so powerful, isn't he?

527
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,400
He almost wiped out

528
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,280
our Gentle Wind Sword Sect

529
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,360
all by himself.

530
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,800
Mr. Mo,

531
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,400
I'll give you a satisfying explanation.

532
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,120
"You won't fail me,

533
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,840
and I won't fail you."

534
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,240
Today,

535
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,800
I finally understood what it means.

536
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,800
Master.

537
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,720
Please have mercy!

538
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,520
This is not the place
for you two to fight.

539
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,880
You can deal with your son later.

540
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,400
Can you ask him

541
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,160
to order those people out there to leave?

542
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,720
You heard him!

543
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,200
Make your disgusting monsters

544
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,040
disappear now.

545
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,600
We'll talk about this later.

546
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,520
You little barbarian!

547
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,480
Get lost!

548
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,720
Weining.

549
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,000
Come here.

550
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,880
Mr. Mo, please forgive me.

551
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,200
I can swear to the heavens

552
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,200
that I know nothing about it.

553
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,600
Also, I told my son

554
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,280
to leave you alone.

555
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,080
I'm sorry that I didn't tell him
we had become allies

556
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,080
because I didn't want
to cause any trouble.

557
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
But rest assured,

558
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
when things are done,

559
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,840
I'll give him severe punishment.

560
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,080
That's unnecessary.

561
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,760
Do you think some severe punishment

562
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,720
could bring my disciples back?

563
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,600
This is unacceptable.

564
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,760
You're right.

565
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,200
I've failed in teaching my son.

566
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,240
Shame on me.

567
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,920
I'm also risking my reputation

568
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,480
to take out
these three pieces of Glazed Armor.

569
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,680
I'll be honest with you.

570
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,880
If you indeed value our deal,

571
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,320
you know what to do.

572
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,200
I know what you mean.

573
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,400
But Mr. Mo,

574
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,320
my son means a lot to me.

575
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,080
I'm counting on him
to take care of many things.

576
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
How about this?

577
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,520
I always keep my promises.

578
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,720
I'll double the pay.

579
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,240
I will make you satisfied--

580
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,440
Today, because of your son,

581
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,400
everybody knows

582
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,160
I'm working with you, Scorpion King,

583
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,160
and the Ghost Valley.

584
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,920
How can I instruct my disciples
after this?

585
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
I got it.

586
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,280
When things are done,

587
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,840
I'll offer my son's head

588
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,280
as an apology.

589
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,080
Traitor, what did you do to the prince?

590
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,960
Zhou Zishu.

591
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,720
He treated you so well.

592
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,760
Even now, he didn't want to kill you.

593
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,800
But you didn't show any gratitude.

594
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,880
The internal injury he has

595
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
is caused by a unique skill of my sect,

596
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,280
which is Freezing Aroma Palm.

597
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,880
His heart meridians got hurt badly.

598
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,680
He has to lie in bed
for the rest of his life.

599
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,440
Only my sect's martial arts can fix him.

600
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,760
But there is only one man left

601
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,280
who knows how to do it.

602
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,280
Guess who he is?

603
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,400
Stop the nonsense!

604
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,680
What do you want in exchange
for saving the prince?

605
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,640
Spit it out!

606
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,040
Pengju.

607
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,360
Did you think

608
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,520
I only hit him with my palm

609
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,760
because I went easy on him?

610
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,120
I'm so sad

611
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
that you know nothing about me

612
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,840
even after working for me
for so many years.

613
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Zhou Zishu.

614
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,440
You can't threaten the prince this way.

615
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,200
If you do not cure him,

616
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,360
other highly-skilled doctors can.

617
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,400
I will risk my life

618
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,720
to beg him to put you to death

619
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,360
and cut you into pieces.

620
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,720
Pengju.

621
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,960
You are really scaring me.

622
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,160
Kill me.

623
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,120
Kill me.

624
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,000
Then he will die as well.

625
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,040
At worst,

626
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,200
I will die first

627
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,000
and wait for him in the netherworld.

628
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,000
You--

629
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,040
Shame on you!

630
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,600
You don't think

631
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,960
I ran the Window of Heaven

632
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,800
with my integrity, do you?

633
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,240
Great.

634
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,360
Great!

635
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,240
Lord Zhou, we'll see.

636
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,760
Let's see who can outlast the other.

637
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
All right.

638
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,800
Let's do that.

639
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,280
After all,

640
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,680
I can't live long.

641
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,600
I won't lose anything either way.
