1
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,400
Mr. Shen,

2
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,200
let me walk you out.

3
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,080
Well,

4
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,200
how is your injury?

5
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,280
I'm fine.

6
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,920
The things I owed the Wen family

7
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,280
are much more than that one palm.

8
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,720
Then,

9
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,520
where are you going?

10
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,800
I need to find Xiaolian first.

11
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,760
I'm worried about her so much
for her long disappearance.

12
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,440
Don't worry.

13
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,480
My master has said that

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,520
Mr. Gao destroyed the Glazed Armor
at the Heroes Conference

15
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,000
to protect you.

16
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,840
The people who kidnapped Xiaolian
wouldn't hurt her.

17
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,880
I hope so.

18
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,000
She's the only child of Gao Chong.

19
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,200
If I can't protect her…

20
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,000
Chengling,

21
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm glad that you can be a disciple

22
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,640
of the Four Seasons Manor.

23
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,040
My brothers and I have owed

24
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,160
the Wen family a lot.

25
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,920
You must be obedient

26
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,600
and loyal to your masters.

27
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,720
Make it up to them for us.

28
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,000
All right, Mr. Shen.

29
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,760
If I find Xiaolian,

30
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,480
I'll arrange for her
to join the Mount Dagu Sect.

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
It's just that…

32
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,720
If I die one day,

33
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,880
please take care of Xiaolian

34
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,760
whether you marry her or not.

35
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,560
If it's possible,

36
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,760
please shelter her
under the Four Seasons Manor.

37
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,640
She has no one to rely on.

38
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,240
All right?

39
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,920
Sure, I would have taken good care of her
even if you didn't ask me to.

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,200
Good boy.

41
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,440
I'm leaving.

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,160
Take care.

43
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,800
LI RESIDENCE

44
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,120
LI RESIDENCE

45
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,480
He hasn't woken up yet?

46
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,120
No.

47
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,560
Ah Xiang,

48
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,560
did Lao Wen vomit blood
and fall into a coma like this before?

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,280
No,

50
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,720
but when I was a child

51
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,120
Master was always in bed
because of an illness,

52
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,720
but not anymore when I grew up.

53
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,120
When did you begin to serve him?

54
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,360
I've been serving Master

55
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,720
as early as I can remember.

56
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,880
Then…

57
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,040
When did he get there?

58
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,360
Where?

59
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,320
It's nothing.

60
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,840
Get some rest, little girl.
I'll look after him.

61
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,640
No, I want to be with Master.

62
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,720
Are you ignoring Young Hero Cao

63
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
who doesn't eat or drink,
but stays here for you?

64
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,920
Why should I care about him?
My master is more important.

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,640
Good girl,

66
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
just get some rest.

67
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,960
I'm here.

68
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,720
All right.

69
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,200
If Master wakes up, tell me immediately.

70
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,400
It's my mistake.

71
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,160
Please give me a lesson again, Chief.

72
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,120
That's right.

73
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,200
You need to know
that this is the Ghost Valley.

74
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,840
It's not just any valley,

75
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,520
but one full of venomous worms.

76
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,920
Only the most vicious and powerful one
who can defeat them all

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,080
can survive.

78
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,360
In this very charnel place,

79
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,400
the only way to survive

80
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,040
is to kill.

81
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,440
All humans are afraid of pain,
yet you're not.

82
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,560
And you enjoy it.

83
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,280
Then you'll live and they'll die.

84
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,400
Ah Xing, you have stayed in the valley
since you were a child.

85
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,560
It's very difficult for you

86
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,520
to survive and become such a talent.

87
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,720
I'm willing to train you
because I have faith in you.

88
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,600
I'm grateful for this
and will never forget your kindness.

89
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,560
Good.

90
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,000
It's all up to your own luck

91
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,760
whether you can be the next king,

92
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,200
the head of evil.

93
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,720
Lao Wen, you're awake?

94
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,120
Ah Xu.

95
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,000
You've been in a coma for a day and night.

96
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,960
Try to use your internal breath.

97
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,520
I don't dare
to prescribe medicine randomly

98
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,120
as your pulse is normal.

99
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
It's not a big deal.

100
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,720
My internal breath might have gone awry.

101
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,040
Where is Shen Shen?

102
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,160
I have chased him away.

103
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,520
Why?

104
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,320
Although he is

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,400
muddleheaded and selfish,

106
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,160
he still doesn't deserve to die
for he was deceived by others.

107
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,760
He and his brothers

108
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,680
have been tortured
by their conscience all these years.

109
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,320
Conscience?

110
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,080
Zhou Zishu, do you really think
everyone has a conscience?

111
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,160
Since Shen Shen had the nerve
to ask me where my parents were,

112
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,440
I should've killed him
so he could meet them in the netherworld.

113
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,880
Lao Wen, the guilty one is Zhao Jing

114
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,720
who poisoned your parents.

115
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,039
The rest of them had their reasons.

116
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,400
You are telling me
that no one can avoid suffering.

117
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,080
Didn't my parents have theirs?

118
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,320
Can the bad be forgiven
for those so-called reasons,

119
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,040
while the good deserve to die?

120
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,880
If you want to be a saint, go ahead.

121
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,960
I'd rather be the head of evil
and be trapped in hell after death forever

122
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,520
than be bullied this way.

123
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,520
Lao Wen,

124
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,840
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,720
It's your personal grudge.

126
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,400
I shouldn't have made
the decisions for you.

127
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,920
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,280
I just don't want to see
more sins in your hands.

129
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,240
Forget it.

130
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,280
If I kill Shen Shen in person,

131
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,200
it may be a chance for him
to atone for his sins with his life.

132
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,480
That's too easy on him.

133
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,600
Just let him live

134
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,320
and watch those bastards
of the Five Lake Alliance…

135
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
When you're fully recovered,

136
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,680
I'll go with you
to seek revenge on Zhao Jing.

137
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,960
I'm fine,

138
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,400
just a little thirsty.

139
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,800
Hurry up and serve me.

140
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,400
Should I give you liquor instead?

141
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Even if we need to go,
we should wait until you're cured.

142
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,720
The people of the Five Lake Alliance
talk about virtue, morality, and all,

143
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,040
but in fact,
they're just a bunch of traitors.

144
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,720
However, the current chief of the alliance
is a ruthless ruffian.

145
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,480
It's not retribution.

146
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,080
Watching the dogfight
between these awful people,

147
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,880
I'm more delighted
than killing them by myself.

148
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,480
Master!

149
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,840
Master, you scared the hell out of me.

150
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,880
-You're so noisy.
-Master, how are you?

151
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,320
Are you still feeling dizzy or hungry?
Shall I cook for you?

152
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,280
I only think you're too noisy right now.

153
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll leave you two here.

154
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,160
I have to check whether
Chengling has finished cooking.

155
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,760
Master, you…

156
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,160
It's due to the Soup of Oblivion.

157
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,240
You won't fail me

158
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,800
and I won't fail you.

159
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,360
Ah Jing.

160
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,280
-Master.
-Ah Jing.

161
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,160
Master.

162
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,840
Ah Jing.

163
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,520
There are many people
called Zhao Jing in this world.

164
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,080
Maybe this woman doesn't mean him.

165
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,800
-Maybe it's just a coincidence.
-…I won't fail you.

166
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,080
But if it was indeed
just a misunderstanding,

167
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,240
why did Godfather rush
to send Lustful Ghost to kill them all?

168
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,920
Ah Jing.

169
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Ah Jing.

170
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,200
You won't fail me

171
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,480
and I won't fail you.

172
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,320
Ah Jing.

173
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,400
What are you going to do?

174
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,080
What can you do?

175
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,840
I just want to examine her pulse.

176
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,640
Move away.

177
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,160
Do you want me to kill you too?

178
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,840
Did she become like this

179
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,040
because of the Soup of Oblivion?

180
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,080
No.

181
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,120
The Soup can only let people forget
the things they're most obsessed with.

182
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,600
But it does no harm to the mind.

183
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,800
My master has an uncured illness.

184
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,640
It's possible that someone provoked her,
so the soul-dissociation has relapsed.

185
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,840
That's why.

186
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,680
"Forget the things
they're most obsessed with"?

187
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,640
-So the thing she wants to forget
-You won't fail me

188
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
-and I won't fail you.
-is the person who failed her.

189
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,160
How can we cure this?

190
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,080
You won't fail me

191
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,600
-and I won't fail you.
-Pardon me, Scorpion King.

192
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,240
I didn't drink the Soup of Oblivion.

193
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,800
I didn't volunteer
to join the Ghost Valley,

194
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,800
but I had no other options.

195
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,160
My master saved me
and took me back to Mount Qingya

196
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,080
when I wanted to kill myself.

197
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,080
So the valley's chief made an exception
for me mercifully.

198
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
You're the one
who should drink the Soup of Oblivion.

199
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,720
-What is the exception for?
-Because I thought

200
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,920
I wouldn't make the same mistake

201
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,080
if I remembered everything.

202
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,840
Since you remember it as you wish,

203
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,960
why did you go back to Yu Qiufeng again?

204
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,240
Have you ever seen
those always-losing gamblers?

205
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,720
The more they lose,

206
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,280
-…and I won't fail you.
-the more they want to gamble.

207
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,400
Giving all your love to another person

208
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,920
is the biggest bet.

209
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,080
I bet on the wrong person.

210
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,440
I thought I could lose
my life to him outright.

211
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,600
However, my master saved me.

212
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,600
I've lived a few more years
in a half-ghostly way.

213
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,720
Actually, the moment
when Lustful Ghost came to kill him,

214
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,920
I was thinking of dying for him

215
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,040
and just losing everything.

216
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,480
But who could expect that

217
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,200
God let me win this time?

218
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,600
Idiot.

219
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,600
How did the Ghost Valley

220
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,840
raise a person like you?

221
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,520
Department of the Unfaithful.

222
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,000
Why do you call it that?

223
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,400
Because my master said,

224
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,960
since ancient times, men are unfaithful
and women are ill-fated.

225
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,560
She wants to redress the scales
for all the women

226
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,040
who have been failed

227
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,920
and kill every unfaithful man.

228
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,320
Being unfaithful is human nature.

229
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,520
It's not about gender.

230
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,720
It's ridiculous.

231
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,280
Who doesn't fail anyone

232
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,560
and isn't failed by others?

233
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,640
Your life is too miserable.

234
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,240
I don't want it anymore.

235
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,160
Now,

236
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,400
I'll give you an opportunity.

237
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,840
If you're willing to pledge loyalty to me,

238
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,920
I'll give you whatever you want,

239
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,480
including Yu Qiufeng.

240
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,800
I don't care how you do it.

241
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,720
Find the recipe of the Soup of Oblivion
and hand it to me.

242
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,600
I'll set you free.

243
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,880
Master, you were only seven or eight
years old when you joined the Valley.

244
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,000
Why did you still drink
the Soup of Oblivion?

245
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,480
Some people didn't want me
to recall something.

246
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,320
It's a pity that I let them down.

247
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,760
But how could you still remember
after drinking it?

248
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,400
It's a blood feud that I can never forget.

249
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,800
It was only a bowl of Soup of Oblivion.

250
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,320
Even if I was broken into pieces
and burnt to ashes,

251
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,600
I would climb back from hell step by step

252
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,079
and take revenge on them.

253
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,680
When I was little,

254
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,079
I often had strong headaches,
vomited blood, and fell into comas.

255
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,240
It's the price of fighting against
the Soup of Oblivion with my mind.

256
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,599
I haven't had a relapse for a long time.

257
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,040
Recently, the past
has been mentioned frequently.

258
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,720
It might have influenced me a little.

259
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,240
One day,

260
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,160
I may be tortured to madness
by this headache.

261
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,920
But before that day comes,

262
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,680
all my enemies

263
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,800
will have to die ahead of me.

264
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,080
Don't be afraid.

265
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,800
Before the arrival of that day,

266
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,800
I'll make a proper arrangement for you.

267
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,880
What am I afraid of? I'm just angry.

268
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,880
Master, I was brought up by you.

269
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,880
Why didn't you tell me
that you have these things in your mind?

270
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,880
I would have tried my best to help you.

271
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,520
I don't need your help.

272
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,640
Let me ask you, Ah Xiang.

273
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,360
Do you really love Cao Weining?

274
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,720
Master, what are you talking about?

275
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm talking to you seriously.

276
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,400
-Don't divert--
-Answer me. If you say no,

277
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,920
I'll kill him.

278
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,400
Master…

279
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,040
It's a yes then.

280
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,760
If you love him,

281
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,360
return to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect
with him tomorrow.

282
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,480
Mo Huaiyang is skilled in martial arts

283
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,600
and he's a crafty old scoundrel.

284
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,720
He wouldn't let his sect
get involved in the turmoil.

285
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,760
You'll be safe there.

286
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,320
Master,

287
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,320
are you leaving me?

288
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,000
Silly girl,

289
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,240
the way I've chosen is a way to hell.

290
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,000
You were a lost soul
that entered the Ghost Valley mistakenly.

291
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,120
You have a chance to return
to the human world now.

292
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
Why are you still following me?

293
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,480
Speaking of Cao Weining,

294
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,480
although I don't like him in many ways,

295
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,680
fortunately, he can be manipulated easily.

296
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
Just go back to the human world with him.

297
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,480
Live a normal life.

298
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,920
I don't think he will make any big moves.

299
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,600
Master,

300
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,760
there's one thing I haven't told you yet.

301
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,080
I'm with Cao Weining

302
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,240
because he said

303
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,120
Gao Chong might have handed
the Glazed Armor

304
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,800
to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

305
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
I stayed with him

306
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,720
because I want to figure out

307
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,640
the location
of the Glazed Armor for you, Master.

308
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
But…

309
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,840
But I…

310
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,560
I don't know why…

311
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,920
I…

312
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,960
I developed a relationship with him.

313
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,240
Please, Master.

314
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,640
Could you please spare
the Gentle Wind Sword Sect?

315
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,840
I'm sorry, Master.

316
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,800
I know I shouldn't say this.

317
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,720
But…

318
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,480
But I don't want him to hate me.

319
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,680
He…

320
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,200
He has nothing to do with me.

321
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,240
But I…

322
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,080
I just don't want anything
to happen to him.

323
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,680
It's all right.

324
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,600
Such a trivial thing
doesn't deserve so many tears.

325
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
However, Master,

326
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,560
I'm afraid.

327
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,840
Everyone says

328
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,200
that ghosts and humans go separate ways.

329
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,760
I'm different from Weining.

330
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
All I know

331
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,920
is how to kill and hurt people,

332
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
and how to prevent others from hurting me.

333
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,200
I even approached him

334
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,320
with malicious intentions.

335
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,680
He's nice to me now

336
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,560
only because I'm hiding them well.

337
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,080
When he knows my true identity one day,

338
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,200
he will be considered merciful

339
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,320
if he doesn't kill me with a broadsword.

340
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,480
How dare him?

341
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,760
If he dares to fail you,

342
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,120
I'll kill his whole family.

343
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,320
Master.

344
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,080
I'm the one failing him,

345
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,720
not the other way around.

346
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,600
Master, I'm so afraid.

347
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,200
I think

348
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,400
the nicer he treats me,

349
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,760
the more imaginary I feel all things are.

350
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,200
It's like the snowman you made for me.

351
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,320
When the sun came out,

352
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,320
it melted.

353
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,960
Didn't I make a few more for you later?

354
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,400
Don't cry.

355
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,400
But I just like the first one.

356
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,440
No matter how big and nice
the snowmen you made later,

357
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,000
they still couldn't compare

358
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,160
with the one you made with me
the first time.

359
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,400
Master, think about it.

360
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,880
If one day,

361
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,400
Zhou Xu knows your identity,

362
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,320
will you kill him
and find another new friend?

363
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,680
That's enough, Gu Xiang.

364
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,880
Don't forget
you're the Heartless Amethyst Fiend.

365
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,320
You've only been with humans for a while.
How could you be so sentimental?

366
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,200
How could I forget about it?

367
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,280
An ugly daughter-in-law can still
meet her parents-in-law.

368
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,760
But the Heartless Amethyst Fiend
of the Ghost Valley

369
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,200
can't be exposed to light.

370
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,040
All right,

371
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,560
I've decided.

372
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Listen to me.

373
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,240
You grew up in the Ghost Valley

374
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
and have little experience
living in the martial arts world.

375
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,640
They won't find out your identity.
You can hide it from him forever.

376
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,840
I promise you

377
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,040
I won't do anything
to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

378
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,440
Don't get involved in any business

379
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,200
of the Ghost Valley.

380
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
If I don't contact you,

381
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,880
just stay in Mount Qingfeng.

382
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,960
Well, then…

383
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,680
You don't need the Glazed Armor anymore?

384
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,560
No, I don't.

385
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,080
The Glazed Armor

386
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,040
is just a cover.

387
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,400
Mr. Wen, you're awake?

388
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,520
Are you all right?

389
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,360
I'm fine.

390
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,000
Come with me.

391
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,080
I need to have a word with you.

392
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,680
Mr. Wen and Weining, don't leave.

393
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,200
I don't know how to cook.

394
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,600
Mr. Wen,

395
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,040
why did you call me out?

396
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,200
I…

397
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,880
When I was a kid myself,

398
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,440
I brought Ah Xiang back from the street.

399
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,800
The first time I fed her porridge,

400
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,680
I scalded her mouth.

401
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,840
Back then, we stayed

402
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,480
in a very inhuman place

403
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,840
where I couldn't even take care of myself.

404
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,000
I didn't want to bring
this encumbrance with me.

405
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,920
I thought about
throwing her away several times.

406
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,960
This little girl

407
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,720
could hardly say anything at that time.

408
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,240
But like a little creature
struggling to survive,

409
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,440
she followed me everywhere.

410
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,840
Even though her mouth was scalded,

411
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,840
she still smiled at me,

412
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
for fear of being left alone by me.

413
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,640
Ah Xiang already told me that.

414
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,240
I know.

415
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,640
She has suffered a lot.

416
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,040
It's hard for her

417
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,200
to not grow up to be bad
when having a bad example like me.

418
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,360
Ah Xiang is actually not my servant.

419
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,320
I saved her,

420
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,280
so she said she was grateful

421
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
and wanted to serve me when she grows up.

422
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,920
That's why.

423
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
In fact…

424
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,920
LI RESIDENCE

425
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,920
…I didn't realize it until now.

426
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,960
It wasn't me who saved her,

427
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,960
but it was her who saved me.

428
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,720
Without this little girl around me

429
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,400
warming my heart,

430
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,320
I…

431
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,440
After saying so much,

432
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,440
all I want to tell you

433
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,840
is that Ah Xiang
is like a little sister to me.

434
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,520
She, if I may say so,

435
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,840
is like a daughter to me

436
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,840
as I brought her up.

437
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,480
In my whole life,

438
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,840
not many people have been kind to me.

439
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,040
For those few people,

440
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,440
I'll repay their kindness with my life.

441
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,880
And Ah Xiang is one of them.

442
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,200
In the past,

443
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
there were some things

444
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,200
that I didn't dare to dream of.

445
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,040
They were beyond me.

446
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,680
But now,

447
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,320
they seem to be closer.

448
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,800
I want her to have a better life.

449
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,440
I hope she can live

450
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,200
a happy life as a normal person.

451
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,440
Cao Weining,

452
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,200
can you give that to her?

453
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,440
Yes, of course.

454
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,120
Although I can't provide her
with great fortune,

455
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,800
-I can still--
-I'm not asking for great fortune.

456
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,000
Take her back to
the Gentle Wind Sword Sect tomorrow.

457
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,440
But I need you to promise me

458
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,880
that you'll never betray her.

459
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,520
No matter what happens,

460
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,920
you'll protect her, take care of her,

461
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,680
make her happy, and keep her safe.

462
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,800
Can you do that?

463
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,480
I know, Mr. Wen.

464
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,480
Don't worry.

465
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,800
Today, I swear in front of you.

466
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,160
Heaven and earth, please be my witnesses.

467
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,880
I, Cao Weining, in my whole life,

468
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,160
from now until death,

469
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,640
including every second,

470
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,320
will never fail Ah Xiang.

471
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,760
Otherwise, I'll be abandoned
by all gods and devils.

472
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,600
Don't be overconfident about yourself.

473
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,040
After all, you've only known
each other for a short time.

474
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,840
She might not be the person you imagined.

475
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,800
I didn't mean to push you to swear.

476
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,320
But since you did this today,

477
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,400
don't think that gods
and devils are only in tales.

478
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,560
If you fail Ah Xiang in the future,

479
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,960
I'll be the first to cut you into pieces.

480
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,680
I understand. I know her.

481
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,320
Getting to know a person
doesn't depend on the duration.

482
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,280
When I first met her,

483
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,840
I wanted to treat her well my whole life.

484
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,320
Since I got what I wished for today,

485
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,240
I couldn't be happier.

486
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,080
If I indeed fail her later,

487
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,000
I'll kill myself

488
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,000
before you ask me to.

489
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,040
All right, remember what you said.

490
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,480
If you don't keep your word,

491
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,680
I won't let you get away with it easily
even if I am dead.

492
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,200
It's a deal.

493
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,080
It's a deal.

494
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,200
LI RESIDENCE

495
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,520
What kind of "father-in-law" are you?

496
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,920
Aren't you afraid
that he would send her back?

497
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,560
You were eavesdropping.

498
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,960
I did not.

499
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,800
I didn't hide at all.

500
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,560
Weining, if your father-in-law

501
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,040
is mean to you, I'll handle him for you.

502
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,160
You just need to treat Ah Xiang well.

503
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,280
All right, we will leave tomorrow.
I'll make some preparations.

504
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,200
Your son-in-law is nice,

505
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,000
but why are you in a rush

506
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,880
to send Ah Xiang away?

507
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,120
Don't you worry
that his family won't welcome her?

508
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,160
How dare they?

509
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
Lao Wen,

510
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,120
why are you entrusting Ah Xiang
to others in such a hurry?

511
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,800
I have someone caring for me,

512
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,200
so I'm into matchmaking now.

513
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,840
I want to give her a proper arrangement,

514
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,320
leave the martial arts world,

515
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,000
and live a tranquil life with you.

516
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,920
Philanthropist Wen,

517
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,800
please be kind and be my matchmaker too.

518
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,720
Mr. Wen,

519
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,480
don't take Weining away for too long.

520
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,880
I don't know how to cook.

521
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,840
What should I do if the pot is burnt?

522
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,760
He went down the mountain
to buy good food.

523
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,000
You don't need to cook.

524
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,600
See?

525
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,840
Forget about the tranquil life.

526
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,640
With this little brat,

527
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,200
we'll only have chaotic days.

528
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,400
Ah Xu, is this liquor or vinegar?

529
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,400
How could you drink something
as awful as this?

530
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,000
Where can I get good liquor

531
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,960
in this backcountry?

532
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,360
You might as well make do with it.

533
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,960
When we're at the Four Seasons Manor,

534
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,880
I'll dig out the good liquor that I buried

535
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,080
in the plum forest for you.

536
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,160
Master, there is a plum forest
in our manor?

537
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,960
There's not only a plum forest.

538
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,400
People of the martial arts world
praise our manor with a phrase.

539
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,960
"Spring is constant in all four seasons,
knowing everything in the world."

540
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,480
TO ZHAO JING,
CHIEF OF THE FIVE LAKES ALLIANCE

541
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,200
Godfather.

542
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,080
Xie'er, you came at the right time.

543
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,280
You took care of the Xianxia Sect nicely.

544
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,880
Those people deliberately set free
by Pretty Arhat

545
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
ran all the way to Mount Song.

546
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,360
They knelt before the front door

547
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,680
of the Shaolin Temple
for three days and nights

548
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,120
to ask Ci Mu to uphold justice for them.

549
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Guess what Ci Mu did then?

550
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,840
He couldn't bear it anymore.

551
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,280
He's calling on all sects to crusade
against the Ghost Valley.

552
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,640
"Chief Zhao, please join us then.

553
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,680
With sincere regards."

554
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,400
Godfather, what do you say?

555
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,480
I have nothing to say.

556
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,360
These sects are all hypocrites.

557
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,480
Back then,

558
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,680
they just stood aside and watched

559
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,640
when the Ghost Valley was against us.

560
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,800
Now they know what it feels like.

561
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
It's not that easy
to invite the Five Lakes Alliance

562
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,040
to be a part of this.

563
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,960
If they want me to participate,

564
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,720
they need to show their sincerity.

565
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,120
Godfather, I don't understand.

566
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,200
Son,

567
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,720
you're still too young
and have little experience.

568
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,320
It was the same for Gao Chong

569
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,720
and he didn't understand this
all his life.

570
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,000
Think about it.

571
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,880
Among the bad things Ghost Valley did,

572
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,840
most of them were against us

573
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,920
except for some smaller ones.

574
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,280
But why did Gao Chong choose to hold
the lame Heroes Conference at that time?

575
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,360
Those who attended it were all nobodies.

576
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,240
They were there just for fun.

577
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,800
None of the leaders of the famous sects

578
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,280
attended it.

579
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,320
You're right.

580
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
The leaders

581
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,800
of the eight major sects didn't attend.

582
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,120
The Changming Sword Immortal only sent

583
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,239
one disciple to the event.

584
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,600
So my son,

585
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,320
these famous and orthodox sects
in the martial arts world

586
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,080
are either blinded by gain and greed
or aiming at fame and credit only.

587
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,840
They want to get the most benefits.

588
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,280
If you want them to fight

589
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,760
against the Ghost Valley together,
it'll only work

590
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,040
with both the name of justice
and possible benefit.

591
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,000
So you need to make a big cake

592
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,280
and put justice and benefits into it

593
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,239
to attract these sects.

594
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,239
Good boy, eat more until you're full

595
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,920
so you can carry my Ah Xiang.

596
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,880
Behave yourself.

597
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,360
Who is yours?

598
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,440
LI RESIDENCE

599
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,000
Xiao Hong and Da Hong.

600
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,440
Choose one and leave then.

601
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,640
I've prepared the food and water for you.

602
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,800
We need to say goodbye here.

603
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,640
Ah Xiang, why are you still angry at me?

604
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,520
I'm not.

605
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,400
I'm my master's servant,

606
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,280
so I'll follow him for sure.

607
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,800
Just go back
to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

608
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,080
Ah Xiang, I was wrong.

609
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,440
Please don't be angry.

610
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,600
Who says you're wrong?

611
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,200
You're the young hero of a famous sect.

612
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,080
I'm just a wild girl.

613
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,840
We are not the same kind of people.

614
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,520
Who says you're a wild girl?

615
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
Mr. Wen.

616
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,320
Master.

617
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,960
Aren't you my servant?

618
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,200
Does that mean I am a wild person?

619
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,720
Cao Weining,
do you have your purse with you?

620
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,960
Yes, I do.

621
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,720
I don't want this servant anymore.

622
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,720
I can sell her to you
for three maces of silver.

623
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,760
If you want her, give me the money.

624
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,680
Also, you can't regret it after the trade.

625
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,120
Master, you're a bastard.

626
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,160
See? This unruly servant
is bullying her master.

627
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,520
-I--
-How can I keep her anymore?

628
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,560
How about this?
I'll give you a 50% discount.

629
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,960
One and a half maces of silver.
It isn't expensive.

630
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,200
My Ah Xu is so capable,

631
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,480
but he is worth
only three maces of silver.

632
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,040
What are you laughing at?

633
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,960
Zhou Xu, talk some sense into him!

634
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,440
I'm sorry, I can't.

635
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,440
If you can't, then who can?

636
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,480
You're still so fierce.

637
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,080
I'll give her to you for free.
I don't need her.

638
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,040
Just take her.

639
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,680
Mr. Wen.

640
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,960
With God witnessing,

641
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,600
I've never seen Ah Xiang

642
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,120
as a servant.

643
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,320
Thank you for believing in me
and entrusting her to me.

644
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,840
After telling my master,

645
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,200
I'll prepare the dowry

646
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,520
and a proper marriage

647
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,680
without missing a single step.

648
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,880
Dowry?

649
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,120
Shouldn't it be prepared
by the bride's family?

650
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,560
What do you know?

651
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,320
Ah Xiang.

652
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,480
LI RESIDENCE

653
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,440
Xie'er, help me compile
a book of the ghosts.

654
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,200
Distribute it throughout
the martial arts world.

655
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,680
We have allied with each other.
Why are we going back on our word?

656
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,760
Godfather, if you distribute it
to everyone in the martial arts world,

657
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,720
it'll leave them with no choice.

658
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,680
If that's the case,

659
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,840
how can I ask them
to do things for us later?

660
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,520
Xie'er, the Shaolin Temple
has come forward.

661
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,760
It is a perfect opportunity.

662
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,920
Besides,

663
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,080
what is the use of this gang of ghosts?

664
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,840
The traps are all set.

665
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,320
All we need to do
is drive the prey into them.

666
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,840
Do you still not understand?

667
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Since we want
to wipe out the Ghost Valley,

668
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,440
who are we going to kill
if the ghosts are outside?

669
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,880
Once they lose my protection,

670
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,840
where can they even move a step

671
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,040
in this martial arts world?

672
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,400
So you mean

673
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,120
you're taking away their choices

674
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,640
and forcing them to go back
to the Ghost Valley?

675
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,040
But Godfather,

676
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,560
what if they bad-mouth us
when they get out?

677
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,760
Who will believe them?

678
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,880
Besides,

679
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,920
Gao Chong's collusion
with the Ghost Valley is unresolved.

680
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,920
It's still pending up to now.

681
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,000
Though people don't mention it now,

682
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,640
it still has a bad influence on us

683
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,400
to a certain extent.

684
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,400
So at this time,

685
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,520
I'm hoping that these bad guys
have dogfights among them.

686
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,400
We'll take the opportunity
to get one of them to testify for us.

687
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,760
The Ghost Valley
split the martial arts world

688
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,400
by framing the Five Lakes Alliance.

689
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,440
We are the ones who were wronged.

690
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,400
By the time our name is cleared,

691
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,880
Gao Chong won't be able to see it.

692
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Then all sects

693
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,840
would be very embarrassed.

694
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,360
I'll lead them
to eradicate the Ghost Valley.

695
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,480
I'll get both the power
and the reputation,

696
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,160
in addition to the guilt from all sects.

697
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,680
If an election of the chief
comes at this time,

698
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,080
who else could it be except for me?

699
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,240
Godfather,

700
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,560
how could you be so smart?

701
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,480
Even if Zhuge Liang
is brought back to life,

702
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,480
he will be so ashamed
to compare himself with you.

703
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,840
You're indeed glib-tongued.

704
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,000
You know how to make me happy.

705
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,720
How could my little tricks

706
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,680
compare to those of the ancient sage?

707
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,360
It's just that we haven't heard
from Lustful Ghost until now.

708
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,360
Technically,

709
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,320
Yu Qiufeng is no match for him.

710
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,800
He must have hidden away
after sensing that something was wrong.

711
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,040
It doesn't matter.

712
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,920
Now, all sects are helping me
to search for you.

713
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,840
Let's see where you can hide.
