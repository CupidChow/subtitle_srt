1
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,800
Your Highness,

2
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,440
Commander Han is here to see you.

3
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,600
Han Ying?

4
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,360
-Let him in.
-Yes, Your Highness.

5
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,080
PLEASANT VIRTUE

6
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,760
Han Ying.

7
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

8
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,480
It's all right. Just lie down.

9
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,080
I should stick to the formality.

10
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,160
Lie down.

11
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,160
What happened?

12
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,000
Why is there no news for a long time?

13
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,280
Your Highness,

14
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,160
please forgive me.

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,720
My team was tracked down

16
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,680
and ambushed.

17
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,560
All my men died at their posts.

18
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm the only one who survived

19
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,760
all kinds of hardships and dangers.

20
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,960
If it were not for my loyalty
to Your Highness,

21
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,560
I wouldn't have made it until now.

22
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,960
What?

23
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,240
Do you know who did this?

24
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,560
It's the Scorpion Sect.

25
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,720
It's a group that specializes

26
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,960
in assassinating people for money.

27
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
Although they were wearing masks,

28
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,760
this Scorpion Tail Thorn
was pulled out from my wound.

29
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,240
I've asked around about it.

30
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,760
It belongs to the Scorpion Sect!

31
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,280
How unbelievable.

32
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,760
PLEASANT VIRTUE

33
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,800
Good.

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,480
This is very good.

35
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,360
Your Highness,

36
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,840
my men were always cautious
and meticulous.

37
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,880
How did others know our whereabouts?

38
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,680
Something is not right.

39
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,600
I'm afraid that there are spies
in the Window of Heaven

40
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,720
and they might bring trouble
to your plan, Your Highness.

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,680
I was so worried

42
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,000
that I came back as soon as I could move.

43
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,320
But Chief Duan is not in the city now.

44
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,080
Pengju is on the way to Jiangnan.

45
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,800
He hadn't heard from you for a long time,

46
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,800
so he went there in person.

47
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,000
It's my fault.
Please punish me, Your Highness.

48
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,840
But you brought back to me
a piece of the Glazed Armor

49
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,800
which is not easy to get.

50
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,040
Good job. It's almost the end of the year.

51
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,360
Please go home and have a good rest.

52
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,120
I'll reward you later.

53
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,600
If you didn't tell me the truth,

54
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,760
I wouldn't know the key has been hidden

55
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,800
in the Ghost Valley all these years,

56
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,360
even though I've searched
every corner of the world.

57
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,880
GREAT AMBITIONS

58
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,280
Although I'm not so sure,

59
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,200
I've thought about it carefully.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,600
If Gao Chong did collude
with the Ghost Valley,

61
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,040
then the three pieces
of the Glazed Armor he once had

62
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,760
were probably in the Ghost Valley.

63
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,440
And the one I lost must have been stolen

64
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,120
by the Ghost Valley in the chaos.

65
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,960
If that's the case,

66
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
once I take down the Ghost Valley,

67
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,120
I can repay His Highness.

68
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,040
Good. Very good.

69
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,320
The Glazed Armor has long been hidden
in the martial arts world.

70
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,840
People of the martial arts world
are more well-informed than us.

71
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,400
Then I'll wait

72
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,480
for your good news.

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,480
I won't let you down, Officer Duan.

74
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,080
GREAT AMBITIONS

75
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,160
By the way,

76
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,840
I have a request for you, Officer Duan.

77
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,120
Gao Chong was headstrong

78
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,640
and he's got what he deserved.

79
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,040
But could His Highness
please show some mercy

80
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,280
and not blame
the whole Five Lakes Alliance

81
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,600
for Gao Chong's fault?

82
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
Of course.

83
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,960
Let's wipe off the past.

84
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,000
There are a lot of things
in the martial arts world

85
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,440
that we need to count on your help
in the future.

86
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,720
Or if His Highness appreciates you,

87
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,880
maybe we can become colleagues
in the imperial court in the future.

88
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,360
Don't flatter me, sir.

89
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,840
Officer Duan,

90
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,720
you're one of the outstanding talents
and have a promising future.

91
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,720
I'm just a humble boor.

92
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,440
I dare not share
the same footing with you.

93
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,840
Prince Jin is in need
of capable people now.

94
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,440
If you can prove yourself useful,

95
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,360
not only the title of
the chief of the martial arts world,

96
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,760
but the title
of Marquis or State Preceptor

97
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,280
is also all at your choice.

98
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,240
TO PRINCE JIN

99
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,080
Xie'er.

100
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,280
You come at the right time.

101
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,280
Have a drink with me.

102
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Make a pot of tea for my father
to sober up.

103
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,480
-Yes.
-Yes.

104
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,240
Xie'er.

105
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,880
Can you guess…

106
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,240
who has got the piece of
Long-Tongued Ghost's Glazed Armor?

107
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,000
It's in the Window of Heaven!

108
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,720
What a great coincidence.

109
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,640
The Window of Heaven and Prince Jin
are going to collaborate with me.

110
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,240
Isn't that a bonus?

111
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,560
Prince Jin is now dominating
the northwest region

112
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,920
and has a strong army.

113
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,880
That will be of great help to me

114
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,960
when I wipe out the Ghost Valley!

115
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,520
Xie'er,

116
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,000
are you still angry with me?

117
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,880
You're so stubborn.

118
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,280
All right.

119
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,960
I'll apologize.

120
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,480
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,840
Let me pour a cup of tea for you.

122
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,800
Father, you saved me and educated me.

123
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,880
You can hit

124
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,680
or even kill me.

125
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,760
I won't have any complaints.

126
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
I just want to know.

127
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,760
Last time, you said

128
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,040
if I did anything wrong,

129
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,280
you wouldn't consider
our father-son relationship.

130
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,120
Those were said out of anger!

131
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,320
You know,

132
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,720
the closer people are,

133
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,880
like father and son, wife and husband,

134
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,280
the more likely they would say words
to hurt each other.

135
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,080
Those words are not true.

136
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,120
I just want to know

137
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,160
that if one day,

138
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,560
I really make a mistake
and get you in trouble…

139
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,880
What would you do, Father?

140
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,760
Come here.

141
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,520
You little barbarian.

142
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,480
Since I picked you up
and brought you back home,

143
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,520
we've been depending on each other.

144
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,080
We are together as one.

145
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,520
So whatever challenge you'll face
in the future,

146
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,960
I'll stand by you

147
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,440
and handle it with you.

148
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Father.

149
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,400
Do you mean it?

150
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,560
Don't lie to me.

151
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,520
Of course.

152
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,200
You've got me.

153
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,520
Don't worry.

154
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,720
By the way, Father,

155
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,800
you just said

156
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,880
Prince Jin would collaborate with you.

157
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,520
That's a good thing.

158
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
All you want is to change your fate

159
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,720
and this a perfect opportunity.

160
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,480
It's a high-stakes gamble.

161
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,520
We don't stand a chance of winning
given the current situation.

162
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,760
We should reassure Duan Pengju first.

163
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,120
As for the collaboration,

164
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,000
we'll have a further discussion.

165
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,600
But Duan Pengju said

166
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,520
that if we choose the right side,

167
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,560
you can be a State Preceptor
in the future.

168
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,160
But what if we make the wrong decision?

169
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,640
Prince Jin is plotting treason.

170
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,040
Once it's exposed,

171
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,080
the entire family of those involved
will be exterminated.

172
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,600
It's unlike the fights
in the martial arts world.

173
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,600
But I'm not afraid of that.

174
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,240
Father,

175
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,560
fortune should be sought in danger.

176
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,640
If one day,
you become a prince or State Preceptor,

177
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,200
no one in the martial arts world

178
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,600
would dare to say anything about us.

179
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,800
You're so like me, Xie'er.

180
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,080
I--

181
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,000
If I'm still a poor
and ignorant youngster,

182
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,040
I'll bet on him.

183
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,880
But I'm one step away from the top.

184
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,720
Isn't this bet too risky?

185
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,320
Don't act rashly.

186
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,080
Now, all I want is stability.

187
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,400
I'm going to reassure
the Window of Heaven first

188
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,000
and then take action at the right time.

189
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,040
When we see Prince Jin
is really going to succeed,

190
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,280
it's not too late for us to join him then.

191
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,560
But at that time,

192
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,440
Prince Jin will have
too many choices beside us.

193
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,040
Father.

194
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,000
I know you don't want
to take the consequences,

195
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,480
and scared that this will destroy
your lifetime career.

196
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,760
But I'm not.

197
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,480
I have nothing to lose.

198
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,680
I'd like to suggest a plan

199
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,440
to spare you

200
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,840
any future trouble.

201
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
Tell me.

202
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,200
You've never told the public

203
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,240
about your relationship
with the Scorpion Sect.

204
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,520
People in the martial arts world think

205
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,720
we're strangers to each other.

206
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,040
How about I pledge loyalty to Prince Jin

207
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,880
and gather all pieces of the Glazed Armor?

208
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,800
If we make it,

209
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,920
all the rewards will be yours, Father.

210
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,280
If not,

211
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,680
no matter
what kind of penalty there will be,

212
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,440
I'll bear it alone.

213
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,720
I won't get you in trouble.

214
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,480
Your Highness,
you really have wonderful foresight.

215
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,160
Han Ying does intend to betray you.

216
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,880
He sneaked into your study room last night

217
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,440
and left after a long time searching.

218
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,200
I sent someone to follow him secretly

219
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,880
as you ordered

220
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,160
and found that he went to
the place of the former chief, Zhou Zishu.

221
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,840
He hasn't come back yet.

222
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,320
Very good.

223
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,080
Your Highness,

224
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,520
should I arrest this traitor?

225
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,560
No.

226
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,240
Keep following him closely.

227
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,040
With such good bait,

228
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,840
imagine how many big fishes
it will lure for me.

229
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
You can leave now.

230
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,680
Yes, Your Highness.

231
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,840
NOBLE REPUTATION

232
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,120
Zishu, you are indeed a capable man.

233
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,560
Although you have left for so long,

234
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,920
there are still people
who still work for you.

235
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,120
I'd like to see

236
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,360
how many alternative plans
you've prepared against me.

237
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,360
Lord Zhou,

238
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,240
I know why His Highness
wants the Glazed Armor.

239
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,240
Your wound can be cured.

240
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,960
I'll find all the pieces
of the Glazed Armor for you,

241
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,160
even at the risk of my own life.

242
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,400
Mr. Duan.

243
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,680
How dare you?

244
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,240
Coming here to Jiangnan,

245
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,080
you didn't come to see me first,

246
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,160
but drank with the chief
of the Five Lakes Alliance instead.

247
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,640
Tell me.

248
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,040
How should I punish you?

249
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,560
My Bodhisattva,

250
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,600
I didn't know
that you had come to Yueyang as well.

251
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,680
I was thinking about going to Hu

252
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,520
to visit you and Scorpion King
after finishing my work.

253
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,440
Prince Jin heard there had been new
updates on Scorpion King's thaumaturgy.

254
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,880
He cares about that very much.

255
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,120
What your master cares about

256
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,240
is that the Drug Men can help him fight.

257
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,760
Yes, you're right.

258
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,440
But my only concern

259
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,920
is the beautiful

260
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,640
-and charming Bodhisattva.
-Don't think about it.

261
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,320
You haven't been punished yet.

262
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,080
I deserve it.

263
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,880
How would you like
to punish me, Bodhisattva?

264
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,000
I heard that

265
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,520
you were getting along well with the chief
of the Five Lakes Alliance lately.

266
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,480
Mr. Duan, pardon me.

267
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,080
I only have a few words for you.

268
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,080
It won't interrupt
you two old lovers catching up.

269
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,440
Scorpion King, well…

270
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,400
His Highness wants to find
the Glazed Armor.

271
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,520
Why didn't he ask me for help

272
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,320
but turn to others instead?

273
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,360
GENTLE WINDS AND LIGHT CLOUDS

274
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,680
A little bit to the left.

275
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,960
A little bit to the left.

276
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,440
It's slanted.

277
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,200
A little bit to the right.

278
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,760
Yes, that's it.

279
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,480
-Yes, that's right.
-Don't listen to him.

280
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,920
He has poor sight.

281
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,640
If that's true,

282
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,080
I wouldn't be here now.

283
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,880
Right, paste it like that.

284
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,720
It's done, Master.

285
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,280
Master, it feels more like a home now.

286
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,960
Little idiot, look at your happy face.

287
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,000
If you enjoy doing it,
take your time pasting it.

288
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,560
There is a full tub of paste.

289
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,040
They should be pasted in every room.

290
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,360
Your Master Wen found

291
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,560
the girl who was selling
the window paper-cuts was such a beauty

292
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,920
that he bought
nearly all the paper-cuts from her.

293
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,400
Master, this much?

294
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,440
Chengling.

295
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,720
It's not that I don't want to help you.

296
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,920
But there's nothing I can do.

297
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,560
Chengling,

298
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,040
don't be gluttonous and lazy

299
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,520
like your master.

300
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,760
At the beginning of a new year,

301
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,680
we need to do a thorough cleaning
to embrace the new start.

302
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,960
All right.

303
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,120
Just eat your melon seeds.

304
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,800
You have too much to say.

305
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,600
I wish I had a carefree life
like someone does.

306
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,600
Chengling.

307
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,280
FIVE LAKES WORLD ALLIANCE

308
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,880
-How great!
-How great!

309
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,840
Little brat, come here.

310
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,400
Get a knife and kill this chicken.

311
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,920
Master Wen, you want me to kill it?

312
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,720
Do you want it to kill you?

313
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,720
Hurry up.

314
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,720
The chicken takes a longer time
to be well-cooked.

315
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,920
Master Wen,

316
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,720
please give me another task.

317
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,360
I don't dare to do it.

318
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,440
You don't even dare to kill a chicken?

319
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,400
Both of you two are slackers,

320
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,960
always doing nothing
but eating and idling around.

321
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,760
Did you trick me here to be your servant?

322
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,960
I don't care.

323
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,680
You must help me make dinner
for the Spring Festival's eve.

324
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,880
But I can't.

325
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,920
My disciple will have to do it for me.

326
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,640
If so, no dinner for you.

327
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,320
Master.

328
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,440
Believe in yourself.

329
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Don't move.

330
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,120
Don't come over!

331
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,040
Master, help me!

332
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,160
Zhou Xu,

333
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,160
your disciple
couldn't even kill a chicken.

334
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,160
Why do some people can enjoy
such an easy life while others can't?

335
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,560
That's his luck.

336
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,880
I have achieved so much,

337
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,600
yet I still lack some luck.

338
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,440
We complement each other.

339
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,480
Humans are very strange.

340
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,160
Every day is the same. Just live it.

341
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,480
Why do they have to have
all those festivals?

342
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,520
It just shows how boring

343
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,200
and lonely they are, right?

344
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,720
But it's quite serene to be alone.

345
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,920
I wonder if anyone is with Master now.

346
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,280
Gu Xiang, open the door.

347
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,600
-Happy Spring Festival, Gu Xiang.
-Ms. Gu, Happy Spring Festival.

348
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
Why are you guys here?

349
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,960
Of course we'll come.

350
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,600
It's the Spring Festival.
How could we leave you alone here?

351
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,800
-Hurry.
-All right.

352
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,960
You know,

353
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,480
Weining has been restless
and wanted to see you all day long.

354
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,760
After worshiping the ancestors,

355
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,720
he comes here to see you
without having dinner.

356
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,520
Gu Xiang,

357
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,520
I don't know what you eat
for the Spring Festival,

358
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,280
so I bring many kinds of food here--
there's jujube cake, pumpkin pie,

359
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,960
and fresh and hot fried lotus root.

360
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,640
By the way,
the dumplings were made by Master for you.

361
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,080
They're raw though.
I'll cook them for you later.

362
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,400
There's so much food already.
There's no need to cook the dumplings.

363
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,280
Do you think I'm a glutton?

364
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,280
I'm sorry, Master.

365
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,720
I'm just a wild girl.

366
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,680
No one has ever treated me so well.

367
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,560
I just--

368
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,000
I just don't know what to say.

369
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,400
Some sand just got into my eyes.

370
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,080
Miss,

371
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,920
when you're at the Gentle Wind Sword Sect,
this is your home.

372
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,080
From now on,
just consider this place as your home.

373
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,840
If he bullies you,

374
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,320
I'll punish him for you.

375
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,840
Yes, just do it.

376
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,720
It's the Spring Festival.

377
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,160
Not returning home when one's rich

378
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,000
is like wearing fine clothes in the dark.

379
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,960
Today, I come to visit all of you

380
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,440
and have a drink with you.

381
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,600
Gao Chong, I must toast to you first.

384
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,240
Have a drink with me.

Who else?

388
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,560
You, drink!

389
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,480
Here, drink more.

390
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,360
Rong Xuan.

391
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,240
Don't you love drinking the most?

392
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,800
You should drink over there!

393
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,000
It's the only place for you!

394
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,920
Master.

395
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,880
Master, I must toast to you.

396
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,160
You looked down on me the most back then.

accompanying you.

400
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,720

You were a wench.

406
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,320
Didn't you say that
I would have a good ending?

407
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,120
I think my life is pretty nice.

408
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,840
I have liquor,

409
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,880
meat,

410
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,480
and women.

411
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,840
When I come here next year,

412
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,040
I won't be the chief
of Five Lakes Alliance.

413
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,800
Next year,

414
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,040
I'll be the supreme leader
of the martial arts world!

415
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,960
I'll let all of you see

416
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,320
how I reach the peak of the world

417
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,920
step by step.

418
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,240
Unfortunately, you won't see it.

419
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,080
You are all dead!

420
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,120
You are all--

421
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,320
You tripped me over?

422
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,920
You still do that even when you're dead!

423
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,960
You were the person everyone liked, right?

424
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,800
Fine.

425
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,560
He wants to drink.

426
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,680
Fine.

427
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,640
Everyone, look at me.

428
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,920
I'll toast to him now.

429
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,320
Come on!

430
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,120
Drink the liquor toasted by me.

431
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,160
Drink it!

432
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,680
The liquor from me is the best.

433
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,960
Father.

434
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,520
Get out!

435
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,560
Who allowed you to get in?

436
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,760
Father.

Father, please don't be angry.

439
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,080
I saw that you were drunk,
so I brought you the soup to sober up.

440
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,480
Get out!

441
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,800
Father, please don't be angry.

442
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,520
I'll kill whoever comes in.

443
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,240
-Father.
-Get out now!

and the sword that poisoned Rong Xuan.

447
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,040
He keeps one trophy

448
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,760
-for each of his plots.
-Get out!

449
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,680
-Father.
-Get out!

450
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,200
-Father.

00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,920
-Father!
-Get out!

452
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,040
Get out!

453
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,480
Get out!

454
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,400
Look at what's hanging around your neck.

455
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,000
I left my most precious thing to you.

456
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,880
Dinner is ready.

457
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm sorry for the wait, Zhou Xu.

458
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,800
Master, it smells so good.

459
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,960
I'm so tired.

460
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,920
Master Wen, are there any other dishes?

461
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,080
There is a pot of chicken soup
on the stove.

462
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,280
-Go and get it.
-All right.

463
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,640
-Be careful. It's hot.
-All right.

464
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,040
Come on, Zhou Xu.

465
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,800
Try it.

466
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,240
The edible fungus is picked
right before it's cooked.

467
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,400
Let me toast to the chef first. Come on.

468
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,560
Thank you for your hard work. Please.

469
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,160
I'll drink first to show my respect.

470
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,120
-It's so hot!
-Here.

471
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,680
-The liquor is really good.
-Eat something first, you tippler.

472
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,640
Master, it smells so good.

473
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
-Here you go.
-Here.

474
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,960
Chengling, try the dishes.

475
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,240
Chengling,

476
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
you're still growing.

477
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,440
Have some chicken soup.

478
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,640
Here.

479
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,560
Have some vegetables. Here you go.

480
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,680
What?

481
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,800
Are you going to cry
even during the Spring Festival?

482
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,480
Stop it.

483
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,400
If tears come out,

484
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,040
bad luck will follow you all year round.

485
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Hold back the tears.

486
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,640
I wasn't crying.

487
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,680
I'm happy.

488
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,400
I just thought

489
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,600
I wouldn't have a home in my life.

490
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,800
Who knew that I would
celebrate Spring Festival like this?

491
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,760
God is nice to me actually.

492
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,880
That's right.

493
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,680
This is the most decent Spring Festival

494
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,200
I've ever had all these years.

495
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,720
Celebrating the Spring Festival
without a home

496
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,680
is like self-punishing.

497
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,080
Thinking back,

498
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,280
I was so stodgy.

499
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,440
Setting up this and that

500
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,160
and fighting with others
regardless of death--

501
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,640
What is the meaning of that?

502
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,120
Mastering the top martial arts

503
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,440
and being the most powerful person
in the world--

504
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,720
what is the meaning of that?

505
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,760
In the end,

506
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,720
I was still a lonely ghost
without anyone who I could rely on,

507
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,440
who I could drink with at night,

508
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,120
and

509
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,160
who could reassure me.

510
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,600
That's because you've mastered
the top martial art skills

511
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,280
and had someone to drink with at night.

512
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,080
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

513
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,000
Master,

514
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,080
I'd like to toast you
with tea instead of liquor.

515
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,320
Chengling, you're on your way to learn
the top martial art skills now.

516
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,680
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

517
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,920
Happy Spring Festival!

519

-Three threes, four fours, six sixes.

520
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,000
You lose.

521
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,480
Look at how careless you are.

522
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,200
You're thinking
about the fireworks, right?

523
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,760
You're distracted.

524
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,680
Go and play.

525
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,000
Master Wen.

526
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,280
Breaking things
make the next year auspicious.

527
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,560
Your master and I
will take care of this. Just go.

528
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,520
Out of the depth of misfortune
comes bliss.

529
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,040
This year must be a good year.

530
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,080
Come on.

531
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,240
Drink the liquor you owed me first.

532
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,080
I'll drink with you.

533
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,640
Cheers.

534
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,520
I can't let you have all the liquor.

535
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,960
Come.

536
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,800
Master!

537
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,560
Master!

538
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,640
Master!

539
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,720
Master!

540
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
Chengling, what's wrong?

541
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,800
Master.

542
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,600
This man just jumped in from the wall.

543
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,120
Han Ying?

544
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,680
Han Ying!

545
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,080
Here you go, Master Wen.

546
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,960
Here, Han Ying.

547
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,200
-Chengling, go and fetch more braziers.
-All right.

548
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,000
Zhou Xu, help me with him.

549
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,560
My lord,

550
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,680
I've stolen

551
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,440
the Glazed Armor back.

552
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,680
What do I need this for?

553
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,160
Didn't I tell you

554
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,000
not to take risks?

555
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,000
I have investigated it.

556
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,720
The Yin Yang Book of the Healer Valley

557
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,760
can cure all the intractable diseases
in this world

558
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,720
by saving one life with another
and converting yin and yang.

559
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,000
Forget it.

560
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,160
How did you find this place?

561
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,480
What happened
after we parted ways in Yueyang?

562
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,840
In the Window of Heaven,

563
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,840
someone recognized you
at the Heroes Conference in Yueyang.

564
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,520
I intercepted this information.

565
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,880
After that,

566
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,200
when it was about to be disclosed,

567
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,160
I killed them all

568
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,600
and blamed it on the Scorpion Sect.

569
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,920
It was a pity that it could only be hidden

570
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,800
from Prince Jin for a short while.

571
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,520
So I wanted to find something useful

572
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,640
for you before my escape.

573
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,040
Then I sneaked into Prince Jin's study

574
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,160
and found the secret of the Glazed Armor.

575
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
It's a shame that

576
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,000
despite all my efforts,
I only found one piece

577
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,720
before I was discovered
by the Window of Heaven.

578
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,440
Luckily, Xingming covered for me

579
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,600
so that I could escape from Jin.

580
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,040
My lord,

581
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,120
though we didn't have the honor
of joining the Four Seasons Manor,

582
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,520
I'm willing to risk my life
to do anything for you

583
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,760
like all the seniors.

584
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,720
Who wants you to do that?

585
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,920
I just want you to live well.

586
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,080
A loyal servant won't have
two masters in his life.

587
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,840
I'm loyal to you.

588
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,800
I ought to serve you when I'm alive

589
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,560
and die for you when needed.

590
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,560
If you're gone one day,

591
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,640
how could I live alone?

592
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
My lord,

593
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,680
there's one more thing I need to tell you.

594
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,280
In Prince Jin's study,

595
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,120
I found a secret letter.

596
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,600
Your father was killed secretly

597
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,520
for treason

598
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
by the former prince of Jin.

599
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,160
That's impossible.

600
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,240
My father died of illness.

601
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,120
But that's what's written in the letter.

602
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,520
That's impossible.

603
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,320
My father was
the former prince's best friend

604
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,760
and his trusted subordinate.

605
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,080
Where did you find that letter?

606
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,640
It was just on the desk of Prince Jin.

607
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,960
Zhou Xu.

608
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,320
We can discuss this later.

609
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,000
My lord.

610
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,320
Mr. Wen.

611
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,360
If we manage to collect
all five pieces of the Glazed Armor,

612
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,960
we can open the World's Armory

613
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,920
and find the Yin Yang Book

614
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,960
-of the Healer Valley.
-Han Ying!

615
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,880
Hold on.

616
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,400
Let's find the Glazed Armor together

617
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,520
and open the armory

618
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,480
and find the Yin Yang Book.

619
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,840
Hold on.

620
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,680
I didn't expect

621
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,600
my first time coming
to the Four Seasons Manor

622
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,480
would be like this.

623
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,520
My lord,

624
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,240
I have no regrets

625
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
dying for you.

626
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,760
My lord,

627
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,560
take this.

628
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,960
It's all my fault.

629
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,880
If I knew earlier on
that the Glazed Armor could heal you,

630
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,840
I'd do whatever it takes
to collect them all.

631
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,760
What a pity--

632
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,720
Han Ying.

633
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,720
Zhou Xu, did you forget

634
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,320
the Great Shaman of Nanjiang is coming?

635
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,440
Wu Xi is on his way here with Beiyuan now.

636
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,240
Han Ying, hold on a bit longer.

637
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,920
They will heal you when they arrive.

638
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,200
Wen Kexing, I'll go down
the mountain and find Ping'an

639
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,160
to bring back the Great Shaman
as soon as I can.

640
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Take care of Han Ying.

641
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,280
I'll do my best to keep him alive.

642
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,600
Don't worry, Han Ying.

643
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,080
No one can take your life away,

644
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,600
not even the guardians of the netherworld.
