1
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,920
I tried hard my entire life

2
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,480
and owe nothing to the heaven

3
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,400
or brothers of the martial arts world!

4
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,320
Now,

5
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,759
I've fallen into a trap

6
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,160
and cannot explain myself.

7
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,240
My conscience

8
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,240
is clear!

9
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,160
Believe me, if you will.

10
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,680
If you don't,

11
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,920
I have nothing else to say!

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,560
That's right!

13
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,640
Gao Chong has nothing to hide!

14
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,640
If you don't believe him,

15
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,400
then fight us!

16
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,040
Come on!

17
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,400
My head is right here.

18
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,440
Come and get it!

19
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,760
THE WORLD REMAINS DESOLATE

20
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,440
Today,

21
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,200
I will live if Gao Chong lives
and dies if he dies!

22
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,880
I don't believe

23
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,280
that you motley crews

24
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,200
can beat the Five Lakes Alliance!

25
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,600
-Live and die with Chief!
-Live and die with Chief!

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,120
Great!

27
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Let's fight and see who wins!

28
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,600
You want to defeat us with force?

29
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,400
Haven't you heard
that evil will never prevail?

30
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,120
We have thousands of heroes here.

31
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,080
Are we scared of the Five Lakes Alliance?

32
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,080
My son was cruelly killed
by the Ghost Valley.

33
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,800
What's the point of living any longer?

34
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,640
Gao Chong!
You're a ruthless and sinister monster!

35
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,680
I'm going to kill you!

36
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,920
FIVE LAKES WORLD ALLIANCE

37
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,720
-Deng Kuan!
-Deng Kuan!

38
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,320
Master Fan, are we really not going
to stop this?

39
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,040
Master Fan,
this matter is highly suspicious.

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,160
I think that Chief Gao is being framed.

41
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,920
Father isn't here either.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,360
Shouldn't we…

43
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,440
Go!

44
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,160
Let's go.

45
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,360
Master Fan!

46
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,240
Isn't Gao Chong a close friend
of the Gentle Wind Sword Sect?

47
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,800
Who knew

48
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,280
that they would be
the first ones to run away?

49
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,880
Why is Gao Chong still not fighting back?

50
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,800
Why are you

51
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,200
still pretending?

52
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,560
No, I can't be wrong.

53
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,280
Gao Chong definitely
has tricks up his sleeve.

54
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,320
Everyone, attack!

55
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,000
-Attack!
-Attack!

56
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's avenge our master! Kill!

57
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,400
-Let's kill!
-Let's kill!

58
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,280
Master!

59
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,520
Come with me.

60
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,520
Let him go!

61
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,360
DESOLATE THE WHOLE WORLD REMAINS

62
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,400
Who are you?

63
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,840
If you're not close with Gao Chong,
I'll help you rescue Young Master Zhang.

64
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
I am your father!

65
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,360
You…

66
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,680
Attack!

67
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,440
Chengling, be careful!

68
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,800
Are you all right?

69
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,000
Gao Chong!

70
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Mr. Gao!

71
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,520
Mr. Gao!

72
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,560
Chengling!

73
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,920
Take Chengling away!

74
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,200
Let's take Chengling and go.

75
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,560
TAI LAKE SECT

76
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
FIVE LAKES WORLD ALLIANCE
MIRROR LAKE SECT

77
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,040
No!

78
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,680
FIVE LAKES WORLD ALLIANCE

79
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,360
Gao Shan!

80
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,680
LONE ARE THE TAIYUE AND DANYANG SECTS

81
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,960
Everyone, stop fighting!

82
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,600
Stop, everyone!

83
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,320
Stop!

84
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,720
Gao Chong.

85
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,040
Please stop.

86
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,480
We lost.

87
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,760
I'm begging you.

88
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,320
Please give them the Glazed Armor!

89
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,880
Zhao Jing!

90
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,560
What are you saying?

91
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,480
Shen Shen!

92
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,640
Do you still not understand?

93
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,400
Are you helping him?

94
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,960
You're going to get him killed!

95
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,240
Gao Chong!

96
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,960
You did too much evil
and brought on your own demise.

97
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,280
The Five Lakes Alliance's reputation

98
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,440
is ruined because of you!

99
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,040
Do you still want this many people to die

100
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,520
because of your crimes?

101
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,280
Give us the Glazed Armor!

102
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,760
-Yes, give us the Glazed Armor!
-Give us the Glazed Armor!

103
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,960
-Everyone, shut up!
-Give us the Glazed Armor!

104
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,160
What right does a bastard like you have
to question Gao Chong?

105
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,360
The evidence is clear.

106
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,480
Who here doesn't have the right
to question his crimes?

107
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,280
Elder Huang.

108
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,400
The Beggar Gangs have always
kept their promises.

109
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,600
I hope that you can bear witness today.

110
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,400
As long as Gao Chong
hands over the Glazed Armor,

111
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,120
you must let him live.

112
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,640
I'm willing to give up all my wealth,

113
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,280
become a monk with him,

114
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,560
and never be involved in matters
of the martial arts world again.

115
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,160
Elder Huang.

116
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,360
I'm begging you!

117
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,440
Zhao Jing!

118
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,160
Don't kneel to such a conniving man!

119
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,360
Get up!

120
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,880
Gao Chong.

121
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,160
The Five Lakes Monument has fallen.

122
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,560
The Five Lakes Alliance is about to break.

123
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,120
Please wake up!

124
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,480
THE FORMER LEADERS OF YUEYANG SECT

125
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,840
Think about Xiaolian.

126
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,520
Do you want her to live
while shouldering our crimes?

127
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,240
Zhao Jing.

128
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,800
Get up.

129
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,080
I will listen to you.

130
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,720
The Glazed Armor…

131
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
I will give it to them!

132
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,640
Gao Chong, you can't!

133
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
Shen Shen.

134
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,160
Please take care of my daughter.

135
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,160
Let her…

136
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,960
Let her live a normal life.

137
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,120
Gao Chong.

138
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,240
You can't do that!

139
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,480
Shen Shen!

140
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,080
You bastards!

141
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
You used these despicable methods

142
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,240
just to force me to hand over
the Glazed Armor.

143
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,280
Isn't that right?

144
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,480
-Really?
-This…

145
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,280
I was framed by a scoundrel
and have no way to defend myself.

146
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,680
Today, I'll break my ties
with the Five Lakes Alliance

147
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,520
to prove my innocence.

148
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,080
The Glazed Armor has threatened
the martial arts world.

149
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,240
In order to prevent future danger,

150
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240
I will…

151
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,520
destroy it today!

152
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,560
Don't!

153
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,160
-No!
-No!

154
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,520
GAO CHONG

155
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,960
-Master!
-Master!

156
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,800
-Master!
-Master!

YUEYANG SECT

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,240
-No, Master!
-No, Master!

159
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,720
Mr. Gao!

160
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,600
Mr. Gao!

161
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,120
-Master!
-Master!

162
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,960
-Chengling!
-Mr. Gao!

163
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,640
YUEYANG SECT

164
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,920

-Master!
-Master!

169
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,560
Mr. Gao!

170
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,200
Mr. Gao!

171
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,480
Master.

172
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,480
Are you sure we're not going
to the Heroes Conference

173
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,960
and we're going home instead?

174
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,520
The heroes from around the world
are gathering at the conference today.

175
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,760
This is a great opportunity
to make a name for ourselves.

176
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,680
How could we miss such an exciting event?

177
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,160
Besides,

178
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,359
you and Chief Gao are close.

179
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,839
Shouldn't we…

180
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,800
Shut up.

181
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,160
I told you that we're going back.

182
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,480
MO HUAIYANG
CHIEF OF THE GENTLE WIND SWORD SECT

183
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,320
Chengling,

184
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,640
you should eat first.

185
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,760
Thank you, Master.

186
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,560
By the way, Master,

187
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,920
where's Mr. Wen?

188
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,880
You should eat first.

189
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,640
He's outside.

190
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,560
I'm going to look for him.

191
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,960
Ah Xu.

192
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm an evil person, right?

193
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,960
If your heart is kind,

194
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,240
you are not evil.

195
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,800
Are you the only one allowed
to trick others?

196
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,040
How embarrassing to be moody like this

197
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,840
just because someone else

198
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,720
tricked you for once.

199
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,680
You're worse than my disciple.

200
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,440
I made a big mistake this time.

201
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,120
I went to gloat at someone else's actions,

202
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,040
but I didn't expect

203
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,960
that I'd be one of the actors myself.

204
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,640
Do you think

205
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,120
I was too smart for my own good?

206
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,720
You really know
how to compliment yourself.

207
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,560
You were too dumb for your own good.

208
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,280
Master Zhou, you're smart.

209
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,440
Do you understand what happened?

210
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,000
The scheme progressed perfectly.

211
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,400
There must be someone
controlling from behind.

212
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,000
Maybe even more than one.

213
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,680
I can't tell right now

214
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,560
what this person's end goal is.

215
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,720
Is it not for the Glazed Armor?

216
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,360
Not just that.

217
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
No matter what,

218
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,280
Gao Chong's reputation is ruined

219
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,360
and the Five Lakes Alliance is over.

220
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,520
Not necessarily.

221
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,440
Compared to Gao Chong,

222
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,400
Zhao Jing took a step back
at the most important moment.

223
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,880
He pretended he was weak

224
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,920
and moved the blame
from himself completely.

225
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,600
I remember
in the Window of Heaven's records,

226
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,000
he had another nickname
besides Sai Mengchang.

227
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,880
It was Zhao Xuande.

228
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,280
I didn't think much of it at the time,

229
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,480
but looking back,

230
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,480
his acts of crying and speech of morality

231
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,400
to win everyone over

232
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,040
were truly spectacular.

233
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,280
"Zhao Xuande"?

234
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,920
Who gave him that nickname?

235
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,400
What a bad person.

236
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,960
Almost as bad as you.

237
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,200
I'm a bad person?

238
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,760
Philanthropist Wen.

239
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,520
I've always been nice to you.

240
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,240
Really?

241
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,720
Why didn't I know that?

242
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,760
The truth is hard to find
and a scheme is hard to plan.

243
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,840
No matter how hard a person tries

244
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,640
to balance each step,

245
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,440
they can't outsmart heaven.

246
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,640
Breaking a carefully planned scheme

247
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,040
is very easy.

248
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,400
It might be because of
one person's betrayal

249
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,880
or unexpected rain.

250
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,280
No matter how deep the scheme is,

251
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,560
there will be a day
when the truth is revealed.

252
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,160
As long as you're patient
when peeling the layers,

253
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,960
you will definitely

254
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,680
find the missing key.

255
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,600
That means a perfect scheme

256
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,480
changes and adapts to the situation.

257
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,400
What the person in control needs to do

258
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,080
is clearly assess the situation,

259
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,640
and push things along at the right moment.

260
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,880
It's hard to read someone's heart,

261
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,880
but it's easy to control human nature.

262
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,480
Endless greed

263
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,640
is human nature.

264
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,520
This is an unarguable truth.

265
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,800
Lao Wen.

266
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,480
Don't keep thinking
that you understand human nature.

267
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,000
First, it was the matter of
the Four Sages of Anji and now Gao Chong.

268
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,480
Have you not made enough mistakes?

269
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,400
Being mistakenly stubborn
will only harm yourself.

270
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,000
Human nature is greedy,

271
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,240
but humans can also be
righteous and loyal.

272
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,400
What do you actually want?

273
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,960
If I tell you,

274
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,200
will you help me?

275
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,560
I can only help you

276
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,480
if you tell me.

277
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,280
I want…

278
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,440
I want the demons and monsters
that don't belong to this world

279
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,520
to all scram back to hell!

280
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,040
With Gao Chong's martial art skills,

281
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,040
he definitely could have escaped
and found a way out.

282
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,160
But who knew that

283
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,640
he would break down
and prove his innocence with death

284
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,400
after the Five Lakes Monument fell.

285
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,000
If you're no longer alive,

286
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,280
then haven't you lost everything?

287
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,120
Godfather, you really anticipated
everything and read him accurately.

288
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,280
A strong person is easily broken,
an innocent person is easily tainted.

289
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,960
Gao Chong's baggage

290
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,760
burdened him for too many years.

291
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,000
I've also played this game
with him for 20 years.

292
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,320
There was only one straw left
that broke the camel's back.

293
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,760
And now,

294
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,880
I've accomplished everything I need to.

295
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,920
It's just a pity

296
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,080
that it didn't go perfectly.

297
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,960
What didn't go perfectly?

298
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,400
I thought I'd accounted for everything,

299
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,600
but I didn't expect

300
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,840
Elder Huang to fool me

301
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,720
and have Tao Hong and Lu Liu
kidnap Gao Xiaolian.

302
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,720
I've already sent people to go after them.

303
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,920
Godfather.

304
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,960
Should we kill Gao Xiaolian?

305
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Of course not.

306
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,720
I want her to live

307
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,640
and live well.

308
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,480
She is my living mascot.

309
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,680
The better she lives,

310
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,320
the more righteous and loyal I seem.

311
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,480
All right, I will listen to you.

312
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
You did very well this time.

313
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,360
If you didn't use sorcery

314
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,920
to completely muddle Deng Kuan,

315
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,160
it wouldn't have been so easy
to defeat Gao Chong.

316
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,760
But his disciples

317
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,640
are truly loyal.

318
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,600
Especially that Song Huairen.

319
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,600
I treated him so well,

320
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,840
but I didn't expect him
to be a double agent.

321
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,440
I told you before

322
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,640
that he wasn't a good person.

323
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,600
Godfather, you didn't believe me.

324
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,320
You even took him as your godchild.

325
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,160
You also argued
and got mad at me over that.

326
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,800
How about it? Do you see it now?

327
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,960
Wasn't I right?

328
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,280
JINGRUI PALACE

329
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,560
It's you, Scorpion King? You scared me.

330
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,720
-Did Godfather tell you to come?
-Yes.

331
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,280
Give me the Glazed Armor.

332
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,360
Wait.

333
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,280
Do you have Godfather's verbal order
or a token?

334
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,160
I've already come in person.

335
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,600
What token do you need?

336
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,200
This is very important
and we can't make mistakes.

337
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,000
Godfather only told me
to steal this tonight.

338
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,760
He never told me

339
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,480
to give it to you.

340
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,680
What did you say?

341
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Without the token,

342
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,880
I won't give this to you.

343
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,080
We are both
Godfather's trusted assistants.

344
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,480
Only…

345
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,800
Never mind. You can go.

346
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,840
Only one of us

347
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,560
can live.

348
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,440
How can I let someone

349
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,880
ruin my plans?

350
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,960
I can achieve the goals

351
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,400
on my own.

352
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,280
Wasn't I right?

353
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,400
Good thing I killed Song Huairen.

354
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,800
Otherwise, Godfather,

355
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,520
your Glazed Armor and your plans
would have all been destroyed.

356
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,680
All right, I was wrong.

357
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,560
Xie'er, I'm sorry.

358
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,680
From now on,

359
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,760
you are my only son.

360
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,400
Where is the Glazed Armor?

361
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,600
You entrusted it to me.

362
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,600
So I always keep it with me.

363
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,880
Xie'er.

364
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,240
My life and all that I have
are in your hands.

365
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,640
You are the only person I trust

366
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,680
in this world.

367
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,040
There is one more thing I need you to do.

368
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,440
Godfather, please tell me.

369
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,000
We still need to comfort that idiot,
Mu Siyuan.

370
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,320
We may need to use him later.

371
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,320
That idiot Mu Siyuan

372
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,920
is bad at martial arts, dumb like a cow,

373
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,360
and ugly.

374
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,800
Why do you keep him around?

375
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
Xie'er.

376
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,480
Imagine a sheep herd.

377
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,600
A herd of sheep

378
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,280
will naturally and stupidly
crowd together.

379
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,440
If one sheep leads the way,

380
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,240
the rest of the herd will follow,

381
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,040
even if it's going into the wolves' den.

382
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,720
The Five Lakes Alliance
is that herd of sheep.

383
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,240
And Mu Siyuan

384
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,840
is the chosen leader of that herd.

385
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,760
I never think as far ahead as you.

386
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,800
Anyway,

387
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,520
I will always listen to you from now on.

388
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,080
As long as we work together,

389
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,720
the martial arts world

390
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,160
and the rest of the world

391
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,240
will be ours sooner or later.

392
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,720
Qin Huaizhang's disciple.

393
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,360
I didn't expect that for someone with bad
martial skills, you could run so quickly.

394
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,000
-It took me a long time to find you.
-Master Ye, we meet again.

395
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,120
What do you mean "again"?

396
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,440
I've been following you.

397
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,920
But this person was such a nuisance.

398
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,880
He held me up, so I lost you.

399
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,040
Master.

400
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,520
Chengling.

401
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,360
This is Ye Baiyi. Master Ye.

402
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,280
Master Ye. This is my disciple, Chengling.

403
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,440
He seems dumb.

404
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,800
Each generation is worse than before.

405
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,560
No matter how dumb my child is,

406
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,800
he's still better than those old monsters
who can't speak properly.

407
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Your child?

408
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,280
What? Are you also from
the Four Seasons Manor?

409
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,880
Let me go!

410
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840
-Who's in there?
-Who do you want to be in there?

411
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,840
You.

412
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,920
It's definitely not
who you're hoping for then.

413
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,960
All right.

414
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,200
You prettier-than-a-pretty-boy,
old toad monster.

415
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,080
Who do you think you are,
fighting against me?

416
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,800
-Let's fight outside.
-Ah Xu, don't stop me.

417
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,360
-Wait a minute. Let it go!
-Let's go!

418
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,800
Let it go! Master Ye.

419
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,520
Look. It's raining outside.

420
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,480
Can you two pick a clearer day to fight?

421
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,120
Lao Wen.

422
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,240
Let me go!

423
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,560
Let me go!

424
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,760
Little idiot.

425
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,000
Who did you think was in there?

426
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,720
I thought it was Xiaolian.

427
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,040
Chengling.

428
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,160
They need to use her
to find the Glazed Armor.

429
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,560
As long as that holds true,

430
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,720
they won't harm her.

431
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,200
We have time to rescue her.

432
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,320
I almost forgot.

433
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,360
Ah Xu still has
a disciple-in-law lost out there.

434
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,120
Of course we need to rescue her.

435
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,480
Young Chief Long.

436
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,200
Huang He.

437
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,920
How did it go?

438
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,560
My goodness.

439
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,680
We went through
all that trouble for nothing.

440
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,400
My goodness.

441
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,880
At least we still have the girl.

442
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,000
Let me think about whether we should
use her to negotiate with Zhao Jing

443
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,640
or trick that idiot Shen Shen.

444
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,080
Who has the Glazed Armor?

445
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,520
No one.

446
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,800
No one?

447
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,000
Before that bastard died,

448
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,840
he said that he destroyed
the Glazed Armor.

449
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,120
I don't believe that.

450
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,760
But he really didn't have it with him.

451
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,320
-How could it disappear?
-This…

452
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,920
What did we do all this for?

453
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,840
Where is Gao Chong's corpse?

454
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,120
Did the Five Lakes Alliance take it back?

455
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,720
Corpse?

456
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,280
What corpse?

457
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,640
All those crazy dogs tore it apart.

458
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,640
But the Glazed Armor really wasn't there.

459
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,040
CHONGWU PALACE

460
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,760
CHONGWU PALACE

461
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,640
Shen Shen!

462
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,680
Shen Shen!

463
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,360
Shen Shen!

464
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,160
Shen Shen, where are you going?

465
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,840
Gao Chong had just died.

466
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,880
Are you going to leave this mess to me?

467
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,800
Why should I stay?

468
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,640
What dignity do I have left to stay?

469
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,760
If I didn't create trouble,

470
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,000
Gao Chong wouldn't have…

471
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,639
Shen Shen.

472
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,520
Among the five sworn brothers,
we are the only ones left now.

473
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,280
If you leave,

474
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,199
then the Five Lakes Alliance
is really over!

475
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,639
Xiaolian is still lost.

476
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,840
Before he died, Gao Chong told me

477
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,120
to bring Xiaolian back safely.

478
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,840
Everyone in the Five Lakes Alliance
will look for her.

479
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,639
Yaozhi went looking for her as well.

480
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,400
Listen to me. Don't go.

481
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,880
The Five Lakes Alliance
can't be without a leader.

482
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
Stay!

483
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,120
It's better

484
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,880
for me to leave.

485
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,960
If I can find Xiaolian,

486
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,800
I will bring her to the bamboo forest
on Mount Dagu,

487
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,719
and never come back
to this place of sorrow.

488
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,080
Zhao Jing.

489
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,720
The Five Lakes Alliance

490
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,360
rests upon your shoulders.

491
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,720
I'm useless.

492
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,040
I'm sorry.

493
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,440
Godfather.

494
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,640
You're just going to let him go?

495
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,160
The Glazed Armor…

496
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,960
Gao Chong was smart and conniving.

497
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,960
He anticipated a rebellion
at the Heroes Conference

498
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,680
and was afraid that Shen Shen would die,

499
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,160
so he kept the Glazed Armor himself.

500
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,440
Who cares if that's true or not?

501
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,960
Let me chase him and kill him.

502
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,800
Absolutely not.

503
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,080
I need Shen Shen to stay alive.

504
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,600
If you act on your own,

505
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,920
don't blame me for being heartless.

506
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,280
Yes.

507
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,360
You need to understand my intentions.

508
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,720
I waited all my life

509
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,840
to finally be successful.

510
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,960
If I don't have an old friend
as a witness,

511
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
then it would be as if I was hiding

512
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,080
in the dark all this time.

513
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,960
I can bear witness for you, Godfather.

514
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,880
You don't count.

515
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,440
We are family and we are one.

516
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,640
You are not an outsider.

517
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,160
Here.

518
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,480
Everyone on this list needs to be killed.

519
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,840
Use a cruel method

520
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,520
and don't leave anyone alive.

521
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,360
Xie'er, I want you to understand

522
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,400
that greed is not the only thing
that controls the human heart.

523
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,680
What else then?

524
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,640
Godfather, please teach me.

525
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,400
It's fear.

526
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,960
Qin Huaizhang's disciple,
do you have food?

527
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,080
Master Ye, I have a name.

528
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,760
I'll call you whatever I want.

529
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,120
Stop talking nonsense.

530
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,840
You're right, Master Ye.

531
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm right? Where's the food?

532
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,560
What's this?

533
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,480
Is this for humans?

534
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,040
Chengling, does your family have a copy

535
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,680
of the Origin of Chinese Characters
of the 40 Scroll?

536
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,040
I think so.

537
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,240
Then, was his face painted
next to the idiom

538
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,600
"hated by immortals and devils"?

539
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,400
I heard earlier

540
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,440
that someone wanted to find the truth,

541
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,600
got tricked by others,
and even helped them in their scheme.

542
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,680
Do you have no shame,
yelling here right now?

543
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,520
Hey, boy.

544
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,520
In that dictionary collected
by your family,

545
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,320
there must be his face painted
next to "laughingstock," right?

546
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,080
Do you want to find the truth?

547
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,360
Do you think the truth itself

548
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
will just come to you?

549
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,800
Did you go find the truth?

550
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,760
Do you know where to find it?
Can you even find it?

551
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,920
You…

552
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,640
Master Ye, please teach us.

553
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,840
Do you think Gao Chong

554
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,680
tried so hard to invite this boy

555
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,440
just so he could say a few words

556
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,360
at the Heroes Conference?

557
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,240
His father leads the Longyuan Cabinet.

558
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,800
They're basically a theater troupe.

559
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,080
But the title,
"Leader of the Longyuan Cabinet"

560
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,240
is worth nothing now.

561
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,560
What use does he have?

562
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,720
Old Monster, stop with the suspense.

563
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,080
Why did you capture him?

564
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,600
Shut up, you little idiot.

565
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,360
He's the key.

566
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,800
"Key"?

567
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,280
Don't you want to know

568
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,840
what happened to Rong Xuan
and the Glazed Armor 20 years ago?

569
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,560
Longyuan Cabinet is the key to the past.

570
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Why would I

571
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,760
want to know about Rong Xuan
and the Glazed Armor?

572
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,840
When you've reached my age,

573
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,320
you'll know why.

574
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,680
It's not always difficult to find out

575
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,640
what others want.
