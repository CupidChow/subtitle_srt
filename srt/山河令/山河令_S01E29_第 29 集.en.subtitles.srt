1
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,720
PING'AN SILVER MANOR

2
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,960
WE WELCOME VISITORS FROM ALL OVER

3
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,000
Anybody here?

4
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,560
PING'AN SILVER MANOR

5
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,760
Anyone inside?

6
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,920
Master Wen, are you all right?

7
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,680
Mr. Wen,

8
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,120
although you possess
profound internal force,

9
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,280
it's not inexhaustible.

10
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,240
If you go on doing this,

11
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,040
you'll suffer
from a serious internal injury.

12
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,160
How can I accept such a big favor?

13
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Han Ying,

14
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,920
don't be so polite.

15
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,640
If you die,

16
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,120
Zhou Xu would never let it go.

17
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,920
What's more,

18
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,920
he has been tortured
by the death of his junior, Jiuxiao.

19
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There is enough pain.

20
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Just rest assured.

21
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,160
Even if I'm exhausted to death,

22
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,520
I'll keep you alive at all costs.

23
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,280
Master Wen, please rest.

24
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,840
Teach me how to do it,

25
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,520
maybe I can help Mr. Han for a while.

26
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,760
Little idiot,

27
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,200
your weak internal force
doesn't work at all.

28
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,960
Now you're worried?

29
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,360
Let's see whether

30
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,200
you will still fawn over your master
to avoid practicing martial arts.

31
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,680
Kid,

32
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,800
you're the disciple of Lord Zhou?

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,160
Kid,

34
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,200
do you know how much we envy you?

35
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,920
If Lord Zhou accepts me as his disciple,

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,560
even just for one day,

37
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,040
I'll have no regrets when I die.

38
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,480
Stop talking.

39
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,600
Continue to meditate.

40
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,480
Mr. Han,

41
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,480
as soon as you recover,

42
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,560
Master Wen and I will beg Master
to accept you as his disciple.

43
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,080
You will become my senior.

44
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,920
Then we can live here in the manor

45
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,520
to practice, read, and tend the gardens.

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,080
What's that sound?

47
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,880
If I hadn't duplicated the Glazed Armor
and spread them to the world,

48
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,800
this silly boy wouldn't have been
set up by Prince Jin

49
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,560
and risked his life to steal a replica.

50
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,800
GENTLE WINDS AND LIGHT CLOUDS

51
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,600
FOUR SEASONS MANOR

52
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,360
FOUR SEASONS MANOR

53
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,440
Duan Pengju?

54
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
Wen Kexing has fought with him?

55
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,280
Yes.

56
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,240
He is waiting for me.

57
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,200
GENTLE WINDS AND LIGHT CLOUDS

58
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Master.

59
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,760
Where is Master Wen?

60
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,600
He is fine.

61
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,440
Are the people outside hurt by you?

62
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,240
Good boy!

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,280
Set the formation
and attack from the side doors!

64
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,280
Pull the Legs mansion first,

65
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,200
and then pull the Star mansion.

66
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,120
Yes, sir.

67
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,640
You can't die.

68
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,280
I won't let you die.

69
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
Han Ying.

70
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,760
You can't die.

71
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,640
I won't let you die.

72
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,920
I've promised Zhou Xu.

73
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,520
You can't die.

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,960
Han Ying.

75
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,120
Wen Kexing.

76
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
Wen Kexing.

77
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Go away!

78
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,960
I won't let you die.

79
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Han Ying.

80
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,640
Wen Kexing.

81
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,920
You can't die.

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,040
Wen Kexing, it's me, Zhou Xu.

83
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,880
It's me, Zhou Xu.

84
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,040
Zhou Xu.

85
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,360
Where is the Great Shaman?

86
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,720
Put Han Ying down first.

87
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,120
No way.

88
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,440
If I put him down,

89
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,720
he will be gone forever.

90
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,720
I can't put him down.

91
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,400
Han Ying, wake up!

92
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,440
Please wake up.

93
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,200
He has passed away.

94
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,120
Nonsense!

95
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,960
He hasn't!

96
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,120
-Han Ying!
-Let him go!

97
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,400
Han Ying.

98
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,560
-Han Ying.
-Please rest in peace.

99
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,880
Zhou Xu.

100
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,680
It's all my fault!

101
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
Zhou Xu.

102
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,360
In the beginning,

103
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,760
Han Ying asked me to leave him alone

104
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,080
and escort Chengling out,

105
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,920
but I refused.

106
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
So he--

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,400
he broke his heart meridians.

108
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,360
It's all my fault!

109
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,600
If I hadn't duplicated the Glazed Armor

110
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,840
to bring trouble to the world,

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Han Ying--

112
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,560
he wouldn't have
sacrificed in vain like this.

113
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,120
Wen Kexing.

114
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,880
It's all my fault!

115
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,360
Father.

116
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,800
Wen Kexing.

117
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,320
His pulse is chaotic,

118
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,480
and his elixir field is empty.

119
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,720
Wen Kexing--

120
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,880
where has his internal force gone to?

121
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Master, the Heart mansion
hasn't been fixed yet.

122
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,680
What should we do?

123
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,640
Master Wen,

124
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,120
what's wrong with him and Mr. Han?

125
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,080
Chengling.

126
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,800
-Listen to me.
-No!

127
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,600
Master, I won't listen to you.

128
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,120
When my father talked to me
for the last time,

129
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,960
he had the same expression as yours now.

130
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,960
I would rather die with you

131
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,800
than live alone.

132
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,680
Who says we will die?

133
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,240
No one will die anymore.

134
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,960
Do you remember me telling you
that I used to be

135
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,800
the leader of the Window of Heaven?

136
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,600
The people out there
are from the Window of Heaven too.

137
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Just like Mr. Han,

138
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,360
they were trained by me.

139
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,520
Prince Jin,
whom they're serving, is my cousin.

140
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,760
They're only here to capture me.

141
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,880
I don't believe it.

142
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,160
Master, don't bother comforting me.

143
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,240
Mr. Wen, wake up.

144
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,040
-Mr. Wen.
-Chengling.

145
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,080
Why would I lie to you?

146
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,480
They just came to capture me,

147
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,960
not to kill me.

148
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,600
However, your Master Wen

149
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,960
has overconsumed his internal force,

150
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,800
which has driven him
to the edge of going mad.

151
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
If his condition
can't be regulated in time,

152
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,040
he will lose his martial arts skills

153
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,320
or even worse, die from it.

154
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,920
They haven't found out
about your existence.

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,720
I'll take you to the secret room now.

156
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,160
-Lord Zhou, please show up.
-Lord Zhou, please show up.

157
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,800
-The prince would like to meet you in Jin.
-The prince would like to meet you in Jin.

158
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,960
See?

159
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,240
They only came to take me back to Jin.

160
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,960
Chengling,

161
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,800
protect Master Wen first.

162
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,280
After he wakes up,

163
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,160
it won't be too late to save me then.

164
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,640
Be good.

165
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,960
-Lord Zhou, please show up.
-Lord Zhou, please show up.

166
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,120
-The prince would like to meet you in Jin.
-The prince would like to meet you in Jin.

167
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,760
FOUR SEASONS MANOR

168
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,920
Pengju.

169
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,720
Lord Zhou, it has been a while.

170
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
You look

171
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,920
safe and sound.

172
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,080
The Nails of Seven Torments
can indeed be cured.

173
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,960
Given this,

174
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,680
the brothers, who have been turned
into living dead because of your nails,

175
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,400
would be so hurt.

176
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Zhou Zishu, you--

177
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,520
Halt!

178
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,600
Pengju,

179
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,080
Prince Jin has invited me
to a gathering, right?

180
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,000
Ridiculous!

181
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,960
You've betrayed the Window of Heaven
and deceived the prince!

182
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,000
Do you still think
you'll be spared this time?

183
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,480
Take him down!

184
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,680
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

185
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,400
A night of rendezvous

186
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,640
Nothing on earth could be comparable

187
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,480
To be inseparable birds in the sky

188
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
To be twin branches of a tree

189
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,320
Weining,

190
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,600
what nonsense are you talking about again?

191
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,200
Why are you always so happy?

192
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,440
Of course I am.

193
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,920
I'm satisfied being with you.

194
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,600
Gu Xiang,

195
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,080
why do you look distressed?

196
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
Are you missing Mr. Zhou and Mr. Wen?

197
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,760
Don't use such an intimate address.

198
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,640
You should call them "Master" and--

199
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,560
And--

200
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,720
Gu Xiang, what are you laughing at?

201
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,920
Look at these three particles of corn.

202
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,360
It looks like both of them
and Chengling, right?

203
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,640
They look like a family. It's so cute!

204
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,160
Gu Xiang,

205
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,320
it has been a long time
since I saw you laughing.

206
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,800
You've been distressed all these days.

207
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,240
If you miss them,
we can go to the Four Seasons Manor.

208
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,680
No.

209
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,440
I think it's great enough to stay here.

210
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,120
I'm not going down the mountain.

211
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,200
What's more,
my master didn't ask me to go back.

212
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,680
If I go back just like this,

213
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,960
he will scold me.

214
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,360
Mr. Wen won't do that.

215
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,400
He treats you as his sister.

216
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,440
Our visit will make him happy.

217
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
He won't be mean to you.

218
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm just a servant to him.

219
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,040
Gu Xiang, what's bothering you?

220
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,240
Tell me. I might be able to help.

221
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,880
Every time you sigh,

222
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,760
I feel distressed.

223
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,600
No.

224
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,240
Nothing's bothering me.

225
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,200
It's just that

226
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,720
in my memory,

227
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,760
I've never enjoyed such a peaceful life.

228
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,200
You're so nice to me.

229
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,840
Your seniors and masters
treat me well too.

230
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,520
I'm just unaccustomed to it.

231
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,680
Living in a honey pot

232
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,360
is so sweet.

233
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,360
I'm just worried

234
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,640
one day, they will be gone.

235
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,000
May the wind blow away
children's silly talk.

236
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,240
Don't worry because I won't leave you.

237
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,760
That's the alarm.

238
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,160
Enemy attack! Let's go back first.

239
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,800
Listen.

240
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,440
It's the Drug Men army.

241
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,960
-The Drug Men army of the Scorpion Sect.
-What army?

242
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,640
I'll explain to you later. Let's go!

243
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:46,560
MOUNT QINGFENG

244
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,360
Ghosts!

245
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,280
How could a ghost appear in the daytime?

246
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,400
-My senior, what's wrong?
-It's toxic.

247
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,280
It's toxic.

248
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,320
On the monster!

249
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,080
Hey, hang in there!

250
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,520
I'll take you to Master Fan.

251
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,200
Hurry up, go!

252
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,520
Hurry up, go!

253
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,840
Weilan.

254
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,520
EXTREME PURITY CREATES SUCCESS

255
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,680
What's going on?

256
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,880
Weining.

257
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,440
Weilan, what's wrong with you?

258
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
I'm fine.

259
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,200
-Is this--
-Stop chatting.

260
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,000
Let's go to the back of the hill.
Master Fan has escorted others there.

261
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,400
-Go.
-Hurry up. Let's go.

262
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,920
Chief.

263
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,320
The Nails of Seven Torments do exist
in that traitor's body

264
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,960
and have grown into his flesh.

265
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,280
This is called
paying a man back in his own coin.

266
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
What are you waiting for?

267
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,280
What's with the rush?

268
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,240
Lord Zhou,

269
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,600
you enjoyed years of honor and favor

270
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,480
with the best position.

271
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,560
But you were focused on other things
while serving Prince Jin.

272
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,200
I always wondered

273
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,600
what is so good
about the Four Seasons Manor.

274
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,480
But it turns out to be so plain.

275
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,520
Zhou Zishu.

276
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,280
You played so many tricks,
trying to fool everyone around you.

277
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,520
His Highness might know nothing about it,
but I know every bit of it.

278
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,040
Pengju,

279
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,960
if you keep delaying,

280
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,240
aren't you afraid something might happen?

281
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,760
Are there
any of your accomplices hiding within?

282
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,000
Is it Han Ying?

283
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,760
Han Ying is dead.

284
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,120
Good.

285
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,720
Good.

286
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,360
Lord Zhou, you hid Han Ying,

287
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,360
a mole of yours, so well.

288
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,400
I admire you.

289
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,680
If not for this loyal guide,

290
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,720
I wouldn't believe you're hiding here
and not somewhere else.

291
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,920
What a good henchman of Prince Jin.

292
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,720
What a nice trap.

293
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,320
Yes.

294
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,760
Lord Zhou, I'm telling you.

295
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,960
The Glazed Armor that Han Ying stole
at the cost of his life

296
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,200
is a replica.

297
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,440
Prince Jin has keen foresight.

298
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,960
He predicted Han Ying would come to you

299
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,960
as soon as he knew
the secret of the Yin Yang Book.

300
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,800
Since he was so loyal
to the Four Seasons Manor,

301
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,160
he might as well die with it,

302
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,560
which can be counted
as getting the ending he desired.

303
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,680
Enjoy the view.

304
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,360
You don't have much time left.

305
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,200
"Spring is constant in all four seasons,

306
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,840
knowing everything in the world."

307
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,440
As the prince's decree goes,

308
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,840
-"If he loves his sword that much…"
-If he loves his sword that much,

309
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,400
break it.

310
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,120
If he can't depart from his home,

311
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,080
then ruin it.

312
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,640
Lord Zhou, you asked for it yourself.

313
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,280
Ten years of favor and love
failed to tame you.

314
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,360
If I were the one that you betrayed,

315
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,680
I would not only turn you
into a stray dog,

316
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,160
but also beat you to death.

317
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,840
When you meet His Highness,

318
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,040
beg for his forgiveness.

319
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,520
Let's go!

320
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,440
By the way,

321
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,360
since your personal army
is now well-organized,

322
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,280
it deserves a title.

323
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,520
How about "the Army of Kun"?

324
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,200
Your Highness, please forgive me,

325
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,680
I'd like to ask you a favor

326
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,720
to grant my troops the name

327
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,440
"Window of Heaven."

328
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,080
I'm not a great man,

329
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,560
so I don't dare to dream
about making huge achievements.

330
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,880
All I hope is to sacrifice myself

331
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,200
to bring a ray of sunshine
to this dark world,

332
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,200
so that I won't fail the edification
of my master and the saints.

333
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,160
Great!

334
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,920
Window of Heaven. It's a good name!

335
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,160
Zishu.

336
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,840
Today, let's open a window
for this dark and chaotic world.

337
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,960
One day,
I will spare no effort to chase away

338
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,160
whatever has covered the whole sky.

339
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,600
Ten years of ups and downs
in the sea of blood.

340
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,600
I thought an open window

341
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,920
would bring in a ray of sunshine.

342
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,960
I can't believe my sacrifice

343
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,680
ended up feeding one's desire.

344
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,800
So many years of hard work,

345
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,880
Zhou Zishu,

346
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,600
what did you expect to get?

347
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,720
Master Fan.

348
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,640
Have a drink.

349
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,200
Master Fan, there's someone here.

350
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,880
It's me. Open the door.

351
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,800
Weining. It's Weining.

352
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,040
Hurry up. Open the door.

353
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,360
-Open the door.
-Yes.

354
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,600
Master Fan, there's a girl.

355
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,560
Master Fan! Master Mo!

356
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,320
Master Fan. Weixu.

357
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,960
What happened?

358
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,880
Weilan, are you all right?

359
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,480
Master Fan, I'm fine.

360
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,080
But he has been wounded by the monsters.

361
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,840
The south intersection is crowded
with ghosts and monsters.

362
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,320
All right, I know now.

363
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,600
Hurry up. Go and bandage them.

364
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,960
Come on.

365
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,520
Ms. Gu Xiang,

366
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,080
are you all right?

367
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,440
Master Fan, I'm fine. I'm not afraid.
Those monsters are so stupid.

368
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,480
Once we climb up the trees,
they can't catch us.

369
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,440
It's best as long as you're fine.

370
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,480
-Master Fan, this girl--
-Enough.

371
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,760
I'm not so old in fail
in distinguishing girls from boys.

372
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,640
But it's the forbidden area, there are--

373
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,800
Forget about it. Don't you know
that we are in an emergency?

374
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,480
She is the future wife of Weining,

375
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,360
your future sister-in-law.

376
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,720
She's on our side.

377
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,440
Even if she is just a strange girl

378
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,680
living on the hillside,

379
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,160
if you don't allow her to come in,

380
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,120
would you let her be taken away
by the monsters?

381
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,280
You're such an idiot.

382
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,400
You--

383
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,760
I've wasted my effort bringing you up. I--

384
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,200
-Master Fan.
-Master Fan.

385
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,160
You're poisoned?

386
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,440
It doesn't matter.

387
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,440
I was bitten by the monster.

388
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,840
It's all right.

389
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,160
-It's all right.
-Master Fan.

390
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,520
This is the powder
refined by a friend of my master

391
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,040
to overcome the poison.

392
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,280
Just take it.

393
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,200
Although it's not highly toxic,
it's hard to eradicate.

394
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,800
With this powder,
you'll recover when your blood turns red.

395
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,520
Weixu, hurry up.
Take the medicine to cure your junior.

396
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,240
Thank you, Ms. Gu Xiang.

397
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,680
Hurry up!

398
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,120
-Master Fan, here.
-Here.

399
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,360
Go.

400
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,400
Ms. Gu Xiang,

401
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,160
your master dealt
with these monsters before, right?

402
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,880
My master met them several times.

403
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,720
-They used to be alive but were made by
-Come and put this on.

404
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,040
evil witchcraft
into such lifeless monsters.

405
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,000
They're great in strength,
have no sense of pain,

406
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,680
and are pretty stupid.

407
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,600
But their claws are toxic.
We should be careful.

408
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,200
Practicing witchcraft on living people?

409
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,120
How could the Ghost Valley

410
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,000
do such a heartless evil thing?

411
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,960
Are they--

412
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,280
are they not afraid
of being punished by God?

413
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,360
The Ghost Valley?

414
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,040
Who said these monsters
were created by the Ghost Valley?

415
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,880
Last night, four evil ghosts
of the Ghost Valley

416
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,320
conducted a sneak attack here,

417
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,320
but they were repelled by Master Mo.

418
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,760
We were discussing the countermeasures

419
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,680
when a large number of monsters

420
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,720
rushed up from the foot of the mountain.

421
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,600
The Ghost Valley has raised
such a huge army.

422
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,880
These evil demons

423
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,920
can't be counted as human.

424
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,160
Ms. Gu Xiang, don't be afraid.

425
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,680
This place

426
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,720
is the cultivation place
of Mount Qingfeng's predecessors.

427
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,680
It's hidden deep in the mountain.

428
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,080
The monsters can't make their way here.

429
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,960
Master Fan.

430
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,640
Where is my master?

431
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,880
Where did my master go?

432
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,560
Why didn't I see my master?

433
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,480
Master Fan.

434
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,400
Master Mo went up the hill to save us.

435
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,800
I witnessed with my own eyes

436
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,160
that Master Mo walked
into the crowd of Drug Men.

437
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,520
And then,

438
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,960
he just disappeared.

439
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
You doomsayer.

440
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,080
Listen to what you're saying!

441
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,000
-Impossible.
-Weining.

442
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,320
-It's impossible.
-Weining.

443
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,120
Weining, don't listen to his nonsense.

444
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,960
Our chief is excellent in martial arts.

445
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,800
Such monsters and ghosts can't harm him.

446
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,800
Our chief

447
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,680
must be aiming at their leader
to make the gang collapse

448
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,720
and went down the mountain for help.

449
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,920
It's fine.

450
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,760
"Take the leader
to make the gang collapse"?

451
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,960
Since the Four Devils
of the Ghost Valley are here,

452
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,960
Chief of the Ghost Valley,
Wen Kexing, must have arrived too.

453
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,440
As long as our chief kills him…

454
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,200
Master Fan.

455
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,760
You just said

456
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,200
Chief of the Ghost Valley,

457
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,800
Wen something?

458
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,440
Chief of the Ghost Valley,

459
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,920
Wen Kexing.

460
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,880
Grand Master,

461
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,240
Master Qin,

462
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,200
Mr. Han,

463
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,080
and ancestors of the Four Seasons Manor.

464
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,440
Please bless us and help us get out

465
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,600
safe and sound.

466
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,280
Halt!

467
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,600
Where are you going to run now?

468
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,880
Stay back!

469
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,800
Hold him!

470
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,880
Good dog, run!
Run back home and find your mother!

471
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,040
Zhen Yiguo?

472
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,040
Let go of me!

473
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,840
Thank you.

474
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,560
Little boy,

475
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,880
is Zhen your family name?

476
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,920
No, it's not. You are mistaken.

477
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,160
Kid, don't be afraid.

478
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,960
I'm Mr. Zhao.

479
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,600
Zhao Jing of the Tai Lake Sect.

480
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,120
I'm your parents' good friend.

481
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,320
Ruyu and Miaomiao
must have mentioned me before,

482
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,480
right?

483
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,000
Mother, I've met Mr. Zhao Jing!

484
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,680
Mother, I've met Mr. Zhao Jing!

485
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,040
Mr. Zhao of the Five Lakes Alliance.

486
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,800
Mother, look at this.

487
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,520
This is the candied hawthorn
bought by Mr. Zhao.

488
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
It's so delicious.

489
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,760
Zhao Jing, why are you here?

490
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,600
Be careful!

491
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,840
Zhao Jing, take a seat.

492
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,440
Hurry up, take a seat first.

493
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,640
Yan'er, go and play outside.

494
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,960
We have something to discuss.

495
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
What happened to you?

496
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,280
Ruyu, have a talk with Zhao Jing.
I'll make some tea for you.

497
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,040
All right.

498
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,960
Do you want some?

499
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,400
I won't give it to you.

500
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,200
Zhao Jing!

501
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,040
You finally showed your true colors!

502
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,760
I knew it.

503
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,200
I knew it was you!

504
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,160
Miaomiao.

505
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,160
You still have a short fuse.

506
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,040
Since Rong Xuan and his wife are gone,

507
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,480
and they had no children,

508
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,640
if we don't open the door of the armory,

509
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,760
our painstaking effort

510
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,080
will be in vain.

511
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,960
Don't put on an act.

512
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,920
How did Rong Xuan die?

513
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,160
Gao Chong wouldn't have such an evil thing

514
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,640
as the Triple Corpse Poison.

515
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,280
It can only be owned

516
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,840
by a shameless man like you!

517
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,240
Yes,

518
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,200
I'm shameless

519
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,000
and despicable.

520
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,000
So what?

521
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,560
Now, I'm the knife and you're the meat.

522
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,840
Give me the key,

523
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,760
and I'll leave immediately.

524
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,640
From now on, we won't meet each other.

525
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,320
Otherwise--

526
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,720
Or what?

527
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,680
Otherwise--

528
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,600
-You animal!
-Zhao Jing!

529
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,480
Ruyu.

530
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,600
What are you going to do?

531
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,960
Ruyu,

532
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,480
think about it carefully.

533
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,920
The Yin Yang Book is in the armory.

534
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,320
Give me the key.

535
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,200
I can promise you

536
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,000
after we open the door of the armory,

537
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,920
you can get the Yin Yang Book

538
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,080
to heal your wounds.

539
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,160
By then, you'll still be
a respectable healer.

540
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,480
You don't have to live in this dump

541
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,520
with your beloved wife and son.

542
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,000
Ruyu,

543
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,200
even if it's not for yourself,

544
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,640
you should think about it for your kid.

545
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,680
Zhao Jing,

546
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,280
think for yourself first.

547
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,920
When you used your true qi just now,

548
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,240
didn't you feel anything strange?

549
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,640
Wicked woman,

550
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,120
did you poison me with the tea?

551
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,440
Doctors have known poison well
since ancient times.

552
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,440
You've underestimated our Healer Valley.

553
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,440
Ruyu has lost his martial arts.

554
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,240
I'm just a weak woman,

555
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,960
I must be vigilant against evildoers.

556
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,120
Give me the cure.

557
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,440
We can negotiate.

558
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,680
Fine, Zhao Jing.

559
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,280
Zhao Jing, hurry up and take it.

560
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,920
As soon as it takes effect,

561
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,040
you'll suffer the pain
of being gnawed by worms

562
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,760
before dying
from visceral organs breaking.

563
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,640
After all, we were once friends,

564
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,040
I'm not willing
to watch you suffer from this.

565
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,920
Inside the bottle is the cure
for three months.

566
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,360
I'm not done yet.

567
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,120
Once it shows the effect,
it can't be cured.

568
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,160
If the three of us are alive,

569
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,080
you can pay a regular visit to us.

570
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,080
Otherwise--

571
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,520
You…

572
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,240
Zhao Jing, forgive me

573
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,200
for not seeing you off.

574
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,480
Father.

575
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,680
-Yan'er.
-Mother, what's wrong?

576
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,160
Is Mr. Zhao a bad guy?

577
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
I shouldn't have taken him back home.

578
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,040
I'm sorry.

579
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,000
Mother, please hit me.

580
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,160
Master Wen!

581
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,000
-It's me.
-Master Wen, what's wrong with you?

582
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,200
-It's me.
-Master Wen.

583
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,080
-I'm going to kill him.
-Master Wen.

584
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,080
-I'm going to kill him!
-Master Wen!

585
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,560
Wu Xi, what is the situation?

586
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,400
I've checked several times.

587
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,640
GREAT SHAMAN

588
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,120
Inside the ruins,

589
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,640
PRINCE QI, JING BEIYUAN

590
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,920
there is only a charred body of a man.

591
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,520
Impossible.

592
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,640
-I have to go inside to check in person.
-Beiyuan,

593
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,840
I've asked Ah Qinlai to bury that corpse--

594
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,840
That man.

595
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,320
Wu Xi, you don't understand.

596
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Zishu wouldn't die just like this.

597
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,960
Prince Jin won't kill him.

598
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,920
Beiyuan!

599
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,400
Who is the one that doesn't understand?

600
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,600
If he can send someone to kill you,
why couldn't he do the same to Lord Zhou?

601
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,320
No.

602
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,120
Now that Zishu has left
the Window of Heaven,

603
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,720
he must be with his former subordinates
of the Four Seasons Manor.

604
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,560
Not to mention he has
a second junior and disciple.

605
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,000
How could you tell it's his body?

606
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,840
Beiyuan,

607
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,200
I didn't tell you.

608
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,680
His former subordinates
of the Four Seasons Manor

609
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,400
have all been persecuted

610
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,080
by Prince Jin.

611
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,720
That's why

612
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,200
Lord Zhou left the Window of Heaven
and roamed about the world.

613
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
Don't blame Ping'an.

614
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,600
I made the decision.

615
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,840
Wu Xi, you--

616
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,840
-Let me go!
-Master Wen!

617
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Let me go!

618
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,840
-Let's go.
-Master Wen!

619
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,680
Let me go!

620
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,080
-Let me go!
-Master Wen!

621
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,920
-Master Wen!
-I'm going to kill him!

622
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,400
Let me go!

623
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,400
Master Wen!

624
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,000
-Master Wen!
-Let go of me!

625
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,960
-Master Wen!
-I'm going to kill him!

626
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,400
-Master Wen!
-I'm going to kill him!

627
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,920
Isn't that the disciple of Lord Zhou?

628
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,520
I'm going to kill him!

629
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,720
I'll kill you!

630
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,520
-Master Wen!
-I'll kill you!

631
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,280
Master Wen!

632
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,640
Young Master Zhang.

633
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,560
Young Master Zhang.

634
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,720
Mr. Ping'an.

635
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,880
This is Prince Qi and the Great Shaman.

636
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,200
Where is Lord Zhou?

637
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,560
Don't be afraid.

638
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,080
I'm your master's best friend.

639
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,680
You can tell me anything.
We can work together to figure it out.

640
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,640
Prince Qi, my master has been taken away
by the Window of Heaven.

641
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,440
Master Wen seems to be mad.

642
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,440
Please save him.

643
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,880
I'll kill you!

644
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,760
Sir, calm down, you've gone mad.

645
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,960
I'll kill you!

646
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,080
Sir, we're old friends of Zhou Zishu.

647
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,080
Zhou Xu?

648
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,320
Where is he?

649
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,120
Master Wen!

650
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,520
What have you done to him?

651
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,240
He is fine.

652
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,600
He's just exhausted.

653
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,960
Let him rest.

654
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,000
You must be starving, right?

655
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,880
Come on.
Master Fan gave this to you. Enjoy.

656
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,960
Weining.

657
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,160
Ms. Gu Xiang.

658
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,200
What's the matter?

659
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,840
It's nothing.

660
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,960
At this critical time,
how could you argue with each other now?

661
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,200
Weixu, how is the situation outside?

662
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,920
They indeed can't get inside,

663
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,600
but we can't get out either.

664
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,960
There isn't much food left in the cave.

665
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,280
What's Master Fan's plan?

666
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,080
If we stay here for a few more days,
we'll be too hungry

667
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,320
to lift our swords
even if we want to fight.

668
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,200
If so,

669
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,080
why not just go outside
and fight until we die?

670
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,360
-We can try our best in killing them.
-Weining.

671
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,040
You must calm down.

672
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,040
Master is excellent in martial arts.

673
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,840
The demons outside
won't be able to trap him.

674
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,760
We haven't heard from him yet.

675
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,520
He must have fought his way out
to ask for help.

676
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,000
Master Fan has said

677
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,640
that we can wait for one more day.

678
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,120
If there isn't any news,

679
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,520
we will go out
and fight to our last breath.

680
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,000
By then, you have to do your best
to protect Gu Xiang

681
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,080
to get out of here.

682
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,440
-Weixu.
-This is Master Fan's arrangement.

683
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,760
The century-long history
of the Gentle Wind Sword Sect

684
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,760
can't stop at this generation.

685
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,200
What's more,

686
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,040
we can't drag Gu Xiang into trouble

687
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,360
and lead her to death.

688
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,280
Since her master is an isolated man
with excellent martial arts,

689
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,360
by then,

690
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,240
you can take the secret books and scripts
passed down by the ancestors

691
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,600
to ask for his help.

692
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,600
Weixu,

693
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,920
stop talking.

694
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm going nowhere.

695
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,840
You can't eat your words.

696
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,280
Now, you say I'm an outsider?

697
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,480
Since I'm already here,

698
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,640
I'll fight with you until I die.

699
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,680
Weixu,

700
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,880
don't underestimate me
just because I'm a girl.

701
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
I might have killed more people
than you have.
