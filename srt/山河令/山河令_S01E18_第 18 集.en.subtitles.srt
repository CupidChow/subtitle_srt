1
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,280
Chengling, carry this little brat
on your back.

2
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,680
Let's go.

3
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,800
Little brat, the strength
of your lower body has grown.

4
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
Master.

5
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,640
Don't make such a big fuss.

6
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,280
What impropriety it is.

7
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,800
There are many dangers ahead.

8
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,560
If you don't want to die,
just follow my steps closely.

9
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,440
Qin Huaizhang's disciple,

10
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,080
keep a close eye on your silly disciple.

11
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,640
Little brat,

12
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,160
you'd better be smart.

13
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,760
Your little tricks could do me no harm.

14
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,720
I can forgive you for the first time,

15
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,839
but if you dare to do it again,

16
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,520
I'll let Wen Kexing break your fingers.

17
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,480
Why me?

18
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,760
Don't you know my nickname?
It's Philanthropist Wen.

19
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,800
How could I do

20
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,440
such a cruel thing?

21
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,280
-Ah Xu, what do you think?
-Be quiet.

22
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,440
Master.

23
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,200
Why does the Leader
of the Longyuan Cabinet

24
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,360
live in such a remote place?

25
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,760
There are all kinds of people
in this vast world.

26
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,960
He lives in a place

27
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,080
with so many traps.

28
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,480
How frightening!

29
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,560
What if he gets lost

30
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,000
when he goes out here?

31
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,680
Is that the same as

32
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,480
putting mouse clips aside one's own bed?

33
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,600
"Putting mouse clips aside one's own bed"?

34
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,240
One time, a mouse got into my room

35
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,560
and I couldn't catch it.

36
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,840
So I put two mouse clips under my bed.

37
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,000
But I forgot about them
when I got up the next morning.

38
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,160
Once I stepped down,

39
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,800
I was caught in one of them
and broke my foot.

40
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,680
You little brat,
the reasons why people hide

41
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,600
are actually very common.

42
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,480
Either he always feels that
an enemy is after him,

43
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,400
so he needs to hide
in a place no one can find,

44
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,480
or…

45
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,920
Long Que is a yes-man.

46
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,280
He's always being taken advantage of
and he never starts a feud with others.

47
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,680
Qin Huaizhang's disciple,

48
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,160
your master knows this best.

49
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,880
Then it must be the second reason.

50
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,800
Sadness.

51
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,240
The person he wants to meet
won't appear anymore,

52
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
so he just hides and refuses
to meet anybody else

53
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,200
to avoid being reminded of that person.

54
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,760
If your master disappears one day,

55
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,120
I'll also find a place like this to hide

56
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,320
and see no one anymore.

57
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,120
Just like…

58
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,400
Just like the story of Yu Boya
cutting the strings of his zither?

59
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,200
It's all right. It won't happen.

60
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Master's internal skills are amazing

61
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,720
and he always does good things,
so he will grow old safe and sound.

62
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,640
Doing evil brings gold and fortune

63
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,960
while doing good leaves no whole corpse.

64
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,320
Little brat, do you want to die?

65
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Master Ye, please lead the way.

66
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,520
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

67
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,520
Don't you want to go
to the Longyuan Cabinet?

68
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,800
It's on the opposite side.

69
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,240
What?

70
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,720
Are you afraid
that I will trigger the traps?

71
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,000
Three masters are watching me.

72
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,480
What can I do?

73
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,120
Little idiot, let me carry him.

74
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,160
Let's go.

75
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,160
Hold on.

76
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,400
Young Chief Long, please forgive me.

77
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,920
I'll go first then, Ah Xu.

78
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,080
It's not your turn.

79
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,320
I'll go first.

80
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,040
-Master Ye!
-Old Monster!

81
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,800
I was just kidding.

82
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,760
How childish.

83
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,480
Come over.

84
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,160
I'll go first.

85
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,800
Watch out!

86
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,720
I was just pretending
it really happened to you?

87
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
Master!

88
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Mr. Wen!

89
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,400
Master! Mr. Wen!

90
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,640
Master!

91
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,800
Lao Wen.

92
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,240
Lao Wen.

93
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Ah Xu.

94
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,480
Don't talk.

95
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,040
I'm all right.

96
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,480
It just feels like
having all my guts moved.

97
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,720
I need to get used to that.

98
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,440
-I don't know--
-Where is the little brat?

99
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,040
I didn't expect

100
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,160
that he was really determined.

101
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,960
I'm hurt so badly from falling.

102
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,280
He must be dead now.

103
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,080
He didn't fall.

104
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,280
How's that possible? Could he fly?

105
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,960
That's weird.

106
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,120
I did memorize Ye Baiyi's every step.

107
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,200
Why is he fine?

108
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,960
And why did I trigger the trap?

109
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,440
This trap

110
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
might be triggered by weight.

111
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,720
The weight of Ye Baiyi
is not enough to trigger it.

112
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,120
But when the three of us stepped on it,
things were different.

113
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,560
I thought they wouldn't do anything

114
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,200
as long as Long Xiao is under our control.

115
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,360
Who would know that the traps
in Longyuan Cabinet are so ingenious?

116
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,880
What is this place?

117
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,360
Why is it so dark?

118
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,560
I thought this was the netherworld.

119
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,360
It's not really that high.

120
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,920
If it weren't

121
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,600
for me…

122
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,520
You would not have fainted.

123
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,600
We must have hit
the second tier of the trap

124
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,600
on the way down.

125
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,600
That's why we are here.

126
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,960
Master.

127
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,320
Mr. Wen.

128
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
All right, just get up.

129
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,520
Don't mourn.

130
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
Little idiot,

131
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,600
use your brain.

132
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,320
The brat triggered the trap

133
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,880
and was the first to fall into the valley.

134
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,320
Did you think he was willing to die
with those two?

135
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,800
There must be some tricks!

136
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,160
You're right. Master wouldn't die.

137
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,400
Neither would Mr. Wen.

138
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,000
Don't worry. Scourges last long.

139
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,920
They won't die that easily.

140
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,440
Lao Wen.

141
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,800
What?

142
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,120
Are you that nervous?

143
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,120
What am I nervous about?

144
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,120
Why are you grabbing me then?

145
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,960
I'm not.

146
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,320
-Drug Men.
-Drug Men.

147
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,000
I wanted you two to die
without a burial place.

148
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,840
But after a second thought,

149
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,400
if you guys die without enjoying

150
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,880
these sophisticated traps,

151
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
it will be a waste.

152
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,200
Look at these adorable kids.

153
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,920
They are my best work

154
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,720
and the first group of Drug Men
that I made.

155
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,200
Although they are silly,

156
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,160
they are still my firstborn.

157
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,480
I couldn't bear to destroy them,

158
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,840
so I secretly kept them here.

159
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,600
When people pass here by chance,

160
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,600
I would trigger the trap
to throw them down here

161
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,600
to feed these kids.

162
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,080
I've left them for so many days.

163
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,320
They must be starving.

164
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,480
Kids, time to eat.

165
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,400
It turns out Drug Men are made
by the Longyuan Cabinet.

166
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,360
Mr. Long has been upstanding
his whole life.

167
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,600
I didn't expect his beloved only son

168
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,760
to be so fixated

169
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,000
on making Drug Men with Scorpion.

170
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,720
"Upstanding"?

171
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,720
That's stupid!

172
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,440
I'm his only son.

173
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,960
He knows that there's something
in this world that can cure me,

174
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,200
but he still leaves me

175
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,200
in this horrible condition!

176
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,360
It's a disability you're born with.

177
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,960
There is no medicine to cure it.

178
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,480
Even the elixir to bring the dead back

179
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,520
can't make you grow.

180
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,160
You know nothing.

181
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,520
Yin Yang Book, the most
valuable treasure in Healer Valley,

182
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,200
can cure all
intractable diseases in this world!

183
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,640
When Rong Xuan was terminally ill

184
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,520
and all the meridians
in his heart were broken,

185
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,360
Yue Feng'er could still
bring him back to life!

186
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,120
My sickness can and must be cured too!

187
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,840
All right,

188
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,440
if you say so.

189
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,280
You're the butcher and I'm the meat.

190
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,440
As long as you're happy.

191
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,600
You…

192
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,000
You're doomed to die.
I won't waste time talking to you.

193
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,120
The old man doesn't help me, but God does.

194
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,880
I can open the armory without him!

195
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,920
It's too bad.

196
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,640
You can't see me

197
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,000
when I stand tall.

198
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,160
Even though Rong Xuan

199
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,200
was saved by Yin Yang Book before,

200
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,520
what happened after that?

201
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,920
He went against the laws of nature
and became mad.

202
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,040
Don't you care about that?

203
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,080
I almost forgot

204
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,720
that you're a lunatic.

205
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,480
Of course you don't care about that.

206
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,760
What exactly do you know?

207
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,040
If you want to know the secret
of the Yin Yang Book,

208
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,400
you've found the right person.

209
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,920
It's just that

210
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,520
I don't like talking to people
with my head tilting up.

211
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,000
You need to figure it out yourself.

212
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,880
Are you the heir of the Healer Valley?

213
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,440
Something like that.

214
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,240
Little brat, who are you trying to fool?

215
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,160
All the heirs of Healer Valley
have already died.

216
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,920
Well, that didn't work.

217
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,920
Kids, eat them up!

218
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,079
Kill them first.

219
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,000
Darn it.

220
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,440
Why are there so many of them?

221
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,960
Ah Xu,

222
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,920
can you keep going?

223
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,280
What if I can't?

224
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,200
Stop talking nonsense.

225
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,440
If we can't get through this,

226
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,920
your death is on me.

227
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,400
Keep your discouraging crap to yourself.

228
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,320
Lao Wen,

229
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,720
my life is worthwhile

230
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,400
with you as my friend.

231
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,080
We're thinking the same thing,

232
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,280
how lucky I am.

233
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,720
Your words give me a headache.

234
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,760
Long Que!

235
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,000
It's Ye Baiyi. I'm here.

236
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,240
Won't you come out and greet me?

237
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,360
Master Ye, are we going in?

238
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,760
There must be many traps
in the Longyuan Cabinet.

239
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,560
I'll go inside and check it first.

240
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,800
Stay here and wait. Don't move.

241
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,600
Petty tricks.

242
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,760
Be careful, Master Ye!

243
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,840
Little brat!

244
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,440
Long Xiao, come out here!

245
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,800
No wonder no one can find
the Longyuan Cabinet.

246
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,680
It was camouflaged.

247
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,720
The real one is under the abyss.

248
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,440
Master.

249
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Master.

250
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,880
Master.

251
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,000
We know you're still alive!

252
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,400
Where is my master?

253
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,880
Your master might be walking

254
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,040
on the Naihe Bridge now.

255
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,760
If you die faster,

256
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,560
you might catch up with him.

257
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,000
That's bullshit!

258
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,480
Darn it.

259
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,760
The number of times
I have to run for my life like this

260
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,120
can be counted with one hand
and it's all because of you!

261
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Like they say, "Arrogance will eventually
bring you retribution."

262
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,080
Ah Xu, please pity me.

263
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,280
I have never suffered
any setback in my life.

264
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,760
Now I end up in this poor state
because I was set up.

265
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,760
Maybe I've run out of good fortune
for the chance to get to know you.

266
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,720
This is my worst misfortune!

267
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
Let's go.

268
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,280
It seems like we're in the mountains.

269
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,760
Let me take the lead.

270
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,720
Cover me.

271
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,880
Or what?

272
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,600
If you die,
I can't go on living without you.

273
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,840
It wasn't like we didn't go through

274
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,280
an extremely dangerous place before.

275
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,520
I suddenly remembered this story.

276
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,000
There is a man in the desert--

277
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,600
I've heard this story before,
Philanthropist Wen.

278
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,360
Let's go.

279
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,480
Ah Xu, come here!

280
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,840
Thank you.

281
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,080
What? Aren't you getting up?

282
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,960
All right.

283
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,840
There is a paradise here.

284
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Hello, sir!

285
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,720
Where is this place?

286
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
Hey!

287
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,960
Sir.

288
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,320
Sir.

289
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,080
I didn't expect the puppet skills
of Longyuan Cabinet

290
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,640
to be so ingenious.

291
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,400
What evil thing is this?

292
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,840
It's so rare

293
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,680
to hear you call other things evil.

294
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,920
Watch out!

295
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,040
I only gave a little comment.

296
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,720
Did the words irritate him enough
to make it explode?

297
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,920
Ah Xu, its temper is so bad,

298
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,200
just like yours.

299
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,240
What an idiot.

300
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,160
Just like I said, scourges last long.

301
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,680
That foolish boy was crying
as if his parents died

302
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,880
while you were enjoying yourself
and flirting with each other.

303
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,880
Master Ye, where is Chengling?

304
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,240
Old Monster, he is asking you.

305
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,640
Where is our silly disciple?

306
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,000
I've lost him.

307
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,400
-What?
-What?

308
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,720
Little brat, you run so fast.

309
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,480
Longyuan Cabinet
is full of traps and holes.

310
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,040
Look at you.

311
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,040
Even if I allow you to run as you like,

312
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,000
believe it or not,

313
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,240
you can't escape
and you'll even starve to death.

314
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,600
You're so stubborn.

315
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,440
Good. Very good.

316
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,880
I like kids like you.

317
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,720
The tougher you are,

318
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,440
the sound will be more melodious
when I break your bone.

319
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,320
Have you figured it out yet?

320
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,200
What are you rushing for? Shut up.

321
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,360
That silly boy of ours
is still in Long Xiao's hands.

322
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,960
He's not your kid.

323
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,120
-That's why you aren't worried.
-Lao Wen.

324
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,560
The trap is a vicious cycle
and is changing all the time.

325
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,440
No one can figure it out
within a few minutes.

326
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,120
It's all right then.
The most powerful weapon is strength.

327
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,080
We can barge in
if there's no better choice.

328
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,560
I'll burn this place down with fire.

329
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,440
Little idiot,

330
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,760
do you know what purple golden liquid is?

331
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,400
I bet you don't know.

332
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,320
Look how ignorant you are.

333
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,160
Old Monster, do you still have time
to mock me?

334
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,320
Hurry!

335
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,120
I'm telling you

336
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,600
all you need to know about

337
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,880
the mechanism that powers
the traps in this valley

338
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,480
comes from the purple golden liquid.

339
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,880
And it will explode once it's ignited.

340
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,960
It's powerful enough
to blow things to pieces.

341
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,840
This is…

342
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,280
This is the map of Longyuan Valley.

343
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,480
Let go of me!

344
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,360
Why did you tie me up?

345
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,680
Kill me if you dare!

346
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,000
I won't kill you, kid.

347
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,400
You're the son of Zhang Yusen, right?

348
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,320
Twenty years ago,

349
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,760
our fathers were good friends.

350
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,440
Why didn't you tell me that before?

351
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,360
Your father was
my grand master's friend too.

352
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,160
Since we are related,

353
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,440
we can talk things through.

354
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,640
If we are not related,

355
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,040
I can let you die a quick death.

356
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,200
For the friendship
between your father and Long Que,

357
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,360
I won't let you die so easily.

358
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,040
Don't worry.

359
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,200
These two are masters trained by me.

360
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,680
They will make you feel better.

361
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,800
Where to start?

362
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,200
I'll dig out your eyes first.

363
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,400
Human eyeballs
are good medicinal materials.

364
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,600
Hold on!

365
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,360
Do you know

366
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,720
why I like to stay underground?

367
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,840
It's because I've lived in the dark

368
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,440
since the moment I was born.

369
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,560
As I am doomed
to live my life in darkness,

370
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,200
the darkness is my home.

371
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,200
What's wrong?

372
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,920
You really like living underground.

373
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,560
Is it because you were born
to be a mouse in the gutter?

374
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,120
Purple golden liquid.

375
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,600
That's right.

376
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,880
Your mouse hole
is circuitous and intricate.

377
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,560
Even with a map in hand,

378
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,240
nobody wants to figure it out.

379
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,720
Why not just explode it?

380
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,000
My kids!

381
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,800
What did you do to them?

382
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,440
That's their heart!

383
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,280
Drug Men are your kids.

384
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,560
The puppets are also your kids.

385
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,160
You're a mouse
dedicated to raising bastards.

386
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,880
This is such a remote place.

387
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,920
Where can we find a lot of explosives?

388
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,760
Luckily, you have so many kids

389
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,440
and they're generous enough

390
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,680
to sacrifice themselves.

391
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,760
I still have one piece left.

392
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,320
-I'll give it back to you.
-Wait, Lao Wen.

393
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,840
Now, tell me

394
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,040
if the needles in my disciple's head
can be removed?

395
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,520
Zhou Zishu, you killed my kids

396
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,400
and used their hearts as explosives.

397
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,080
I'll never let your disciple go!

398
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,880
He'll die together with me!

399
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,320
Little brat, you need to think twice.

400
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,040
As far as I know,

401
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,320
people with a perfect body
react differently

402
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,520
from those who are not.

403
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
Do you want me to help you experience it?

404
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,520
I was born disabled.

405
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,280
You can't scare me.

406
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,199
I didn't even think
about letting you go either.

407
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
Master Ye.

408
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,560
What is this for?

409
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,360
Hold on! Don't!

410
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,480
Why not?

411
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,920
What are you afraid of?

412
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,240
It won't kill him.

413
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,280
If he dies, I'll get you a new one.

414
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,080
Master,

415
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,240
you come to my rescue again.

416
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,120
The word "again" sounds really nice.

417
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,680
Ah Xu, why didn't you seek advice
from a fortune-teller

418
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,400
before you took him as your disciple?

419
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,080
How miserable his life is!

420
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,440
He encounters disasters nonstop.

421
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,960
Master, they wanted to dig my eyes out.

422
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,720
Chief Long is benevolent and loyal.

423
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,960
Yet you're so vicious.

424
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,320
"Benevolent and loyal"?

425
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,840
That old man is a hypocrite.

426
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,520
He only sat idly
and watched his half-dead son!

427
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,720
You can tell this crap

428
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,280
to your father when you see him.

429
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,640
Master,

430
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,800
this puppet looks

431
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,360
like this villain a lot.

432
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,680
It was this puppet

433
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,520
that led us to the entrance
in the underground.

434
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,560
It must have been made by Long Que

435
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
in the image of his "good" son.

436
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,920
Some people spent their lives

437
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,280
bringing troubles to their parents.

438
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,680
Master, what is this smell?
It smells so bad.

439
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,880
A dead and alive person
in a remote and humble place.

440
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,800
Please forgive my poor hospitality.

441
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,560
CHIEF LONG QUE OF LONGYUAN CABINET

442
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,560
This is Long Que?

443
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Mr. Long.

444
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,840
Zishu, it's you indeed.

445
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,360
I thought I was dreaming.

446
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,440
Is your master doing fine?

447
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,960
Mr. Long!

448
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,080
Mr. Long, you still remember me.

449
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,000
My master

450
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,200
has passed away.

451
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,760
Yes, how can I forget you?

452
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,240
Once someone is too miserable

453
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,040
to face reality,

454
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,200
all he could do is sink into the memory.

455
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,600
When I close my eyes,

456
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,600
I can see how lively and active you were

457
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,760
when you first came
to the Four Seasons Manor.

458
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,280
Huaizhang has passed away.

459
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,520
Some dead people are alive

460
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,320
because they are remembered.

461
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,920
Some people who are alive
are better to be left dead.

462
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,240
Instead of letting your son live,

463
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,360
you'd better choke him to death
when he was born.

464
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,360
He is not my son, he's a beast.

465
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,640
My son died long ago.

466
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,280
I don't want to know
who's right and who's wrong.

467
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,280
I don't care if

468
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,440
you close your eyes and ears
and lie to yourself.

469
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,600
However, this little beast of yours
is lying and harming others outside

470
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,880
in the name of Longyuan Cabinet.

471
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,040
Won't you talk some sense into him?

472
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,080
I can't!

473
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,000
Mr. Long!

474
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,600
I don't know how long I have been

475
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,840
imprisoned here by that vile spawn.

476
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,000
How could you do this to your father?

477
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,280
Even animals are better than you!

478
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,360
I am a beast.

479
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,880
How about him then?

480
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,280
Even a vicious tiger
will not eat its cubs.

481
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,280
Yet he treats me in such a cruel way.

482
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,080
He knew that there is a medicine
that can cure me,

483
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,160
but he still let me be a half-dead loser.

484
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,000
Even though I did this to him,

485
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,400
he still refuses to help me.

486
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,640
Nonsense!

487
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,680
Your father has been so worried
about your illness.

488
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,120
Everyone knows that!

489
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,120
He is referring to helping him
get the Yin Yang Book,

490
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,320
the one in the armory!
