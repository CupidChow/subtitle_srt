1
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,880
Mr. Gao.

2
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,400
Mr. Zhao.

3
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,800
Mr. Shen.

4
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,840
Chengling, is everything all right?

5
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,320
You shall stay at Yueyang Sect
from now on.

6
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,520
Chengling, do you have any illnesses?

7
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,320
No, Mr. Gao.

8
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,680
Why is your body so weak then?

9
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,480
Gao Chong, he is still young.

10
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,080
It's not too late to train him now.

11
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,640
He's not young.

12
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,240
Everyone in the martial arts world says

13
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,040
that Mirror Lake Sect
has been exterminated.

14
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,080
But they are wrong
as long as Zhang Chengling is alive.

15
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,600
Zhang Chengling, if you can't take on

16
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,880
your father's legacy,

17
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,160
then the Zhang family
will have no successor.

18
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,920
Give me the Glazed Armor.

19
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,440
Come on.

20
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,160
Gao Chong, Chengling has been traumatized

21
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,440
and lost his memory.

22
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,480
We shall discuss the Glazed Armor later.

23
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,480
Later?

24
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,280
The Glazed Armor
is more important than Zhang Yusen's life.

25
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,120
It's more important than our lives!

26
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,160
Yusen barely managed
to let Chengling escape

27
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,160
to bring us the news of the Glazed Armor!

28
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,600
Chengling.

29
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,880
Do you want your father and your family
to have died for nothing?

30
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,800
How many times
do you want me to repeat it?

31
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,160
I don't know anything
about the Glazed Armor!

32
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,200
Stop it!

33
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,320
Tell us where the Glazed Armor is.

34
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,480
Chengling, don't be afraid.

35
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,000
Hurry and tell us!

36
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,720
Chengling.

37
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
I know.

38
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,080
Your father has not been

39
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,760
in contact with us
at the Five Lakes Alliance for years,

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,320
so you don't trust us.

41
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,279
But besides us,

42
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,920
who else can you trust now?

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,520
You have no other choice, kid!

44
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,280
Gao Chong, the child doesn't understand.

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,600
We can teach him slowly.

46
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm not that patient to coax you.

47
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,680
The longer you keep the Glazed Armor,

48
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,680
the more people
in the martial arts world will suffer!

49
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,920
Do you understand?

50
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,520
I don't know!

51
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
I…

52
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,240
Gao Chong!

53
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
Chengling!

54
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,720
Gao Chong, don't be angry.

55
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,640
Why don't we talk about

56
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,360
the Glazed Armor next time?

57
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,360
You may leave.

58
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,640
Hurry up.

59
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,200
Go.

60
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,480
Gao Chong, I know.

61
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,800
There have been misunderstandings
between you and Yusen for many years.

62
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,800
But the child is clueless.
He doesn't know anything.

63
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,520
Shut up!

64
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,720
Zhao Jing, that was unwise.

65
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,400
What happened with Yusen
broke Gao Chong's heart.

66
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,640
Why did you mention him?

67
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,200
Help me resolve this.

68
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,640
I was just pitying that child.

69
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,440
He has to make a living here later.

70
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,040
You're wrong again.

71
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,600
Even if Gao Chong is angry,

72
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,520
will he hurt a child?

73
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,640
You've underestimated
Gao Chong's generosity.

74
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,600
Sir.

75
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,400
I was in an awkward situation today.

76
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,600
I was a stranger to you,
but you still helped me out.

77
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,600
I feel bad.

78
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,000
I live in Yueyang Sect,
not far away from here.

79
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,800
Sir, can you wait here?

80
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,760
I'll be back soon.

81
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,520
It's our fate to meet each other.

82
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,120
Money is just my possession.

83
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,920
If I'm able to meet a new friend with it,

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,800
isn't that even better?

85
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,040
I'm Zhou Xu. May I know your name?

86
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,960
My surname is Cao. I'm Cao Weining.

87
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,920
I'm a disciple
of the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

88
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,480
I heard that the Gentle Wind Sword Sect is
the strictest in choosing their disciples.

89
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,480
All of its disciples are elegant,

90
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,200
handsome, well-educated,
and well-trained in martial arts.

91
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,800
After seeing you,
I think that's indeed the case.

92
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,240
You overestimated me.

93
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,600
I'm one of the worst in my sect.

94
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,760
Don't say that.

95
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,000
It's our fate to meet each other.

96
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,640
If you don't mind, have a seat.

97
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,760
We can drink and chat.

98
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,200
-All right.
-Come on.

99
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
Mr. Zhou, you're straightforward.

100
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm impressed.

101
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,480
Mr. Zhou, let's drink.

102
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Here.

103
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,440
Here, cheers.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,160
Kick him out for me.

105
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,520
-He can help me get into Yueyang Sect.
-Eat as you like. Drink as you want.

106
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,600
Ah Xiang.

107
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,440
Find Fang Buzhi.

108
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,280
Fang Buzhi?

109
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,280
Fang Buzhi's martial arts are quite good.

110
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,960
Ah Xiang is just a girl.

111
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,320
Are you looking down on girls?

112
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,080
Girls are great.

113
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,800
How about…

114
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,640
How about I go with you?

115
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,680
There are many people outside.

116
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,920
Mr. Zhou, excuse me.

117
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,600
May I know where you will be staying?

118
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,320
I'll visit you and treat you
to a meal in return.

119
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,400
Making friends is mostly about resonance.

120
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,960
It's fine.

121
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,560
We are invited by Hero Zhao Jing.

122
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,840
Once we're done with our task,

123
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
we will definitely visit Yueyang Sect.

124
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,520
If you can't find the pouch,

125
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,400
don't come back.

126
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,560
You only remember someone
when you need their help.

127
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,840
Mr. Cao.

128
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,760
Please go back and notify Yueyang Sect.

129
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,280
I hope that you can find your pouch soon.

130
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
All right.

131
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,200
See you.

132
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,799
FENGYANG PUB

133
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,760
Who are you again?
Why are you following me?

134
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,080
It's Cao Weining.

135
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,440
I don't care who you are.

136
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,800
Why are you following me?
You have no money to buy food again?

137
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,400
You want me to lend you money?

138
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,320
All right!

139
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,440
Then 32% interest rate per day. Deal?

140
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,600
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,360
I was being impolite.

142
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,000
Ms. Gu, how about I bring you
to Yueyang Sect?

143
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,760
You won't lose your master's stuff.

144
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,200
I may relax if I let
the Five Lakes Alliance handle this.

145
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,960
Do you come to Yueyang frequently?

146
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,280
Then you must know what is tasty

147
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,920
or interesting around this place.

148
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,800
I know them very well.

149
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,320
If you give me a chance to serve you,
I'll show you all the food in Yueyang.

150
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,200
I really want to bring you back to them.

151
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,160
They always say that I'm a glutton

152
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,440
and I only like to eat.

153
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,440
After meeting you today,

154
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,400
I found out that there's someone
who's more into eating than me.

155
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,960
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

156
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,280
Ms. Gu, this way.

157
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
CONSTANTLY BE IN THE ASCENDING

158
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,200
The chief of the Gentle Wind Sword Sect

159
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,120
is a cunning old fox.

160
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,080
Why is there a big rabbit in his fox den?

161
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,960
If you live long enough,
what strange thing you won't encounter?

162
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,640
Just like a certain someone.

163
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,400
He's cold and doesn't speak to his friend.

164
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,080
But he was warm and friendly

165
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,160
towards the young master
from a famous sect who he had just met.

166
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,120
I know that you wanted
to get some news about

167
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,160
your so-called disciple in Yueyang City
through that big rabbit.

168
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,360
When I see that guy being foolish
towards Ah Xiang, I get annoyed.

169
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,400
Don't worry.

170
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,680
I've asked Ah Xiang to play along

171
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,840
and follow him to get into Yueyang Sect.

172
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,240
She will check on
your silly disciple for you.

173
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,360
How about that? Am I considerate?

174
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,160
You're just making use
of Ah Xiang's good looks.

175
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,600
Anyway, she will leave
when she becomes mature.

176
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,440
She will hate me if I hold her back.

177
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,360
How shameless.

178
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,600
It's all because of you
and your ungrateful disciple.

179
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,160
Why do I think

180
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,480
that is not your real motive?

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,080
Don't you know?

182
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,080
I'm called Philanthropist Wen

183
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,840
because I would feel uneasy
after not helping people around

184
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,160
for a few days.

185
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,280
If it continues, I would even fall sick.

186
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,520
So I travel around to help people.

187
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,080
Does that mean you're doing good deeds
to accumulate virtue?

188
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,960
I will never be a Buddha
until hell is empty.

189
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,120
But in Yueyang City,

190
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,400
decent sects and heroes are everywhere.

191
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,680
Wen Kexing, where can you find
the dwellers of hell?

192
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,400
There is always a dark side
to the bright side.

193
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,080
The fiercest ghosts tend to disguise
themselves as humans

194
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,880
and hide in the crowd.

195
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,120
I'm here

196
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,360
to reveal them

197
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,240
and destroy them.

198
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,480
Ah Xu.

199
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,280
Do you think this counts
as doing good deeds?

200
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,680
I didn't expect you

201
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,120
to be a gentleman who fights bad guys

202
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,200
and seeks justice.

203
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
It's nothing.

204
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,960
It's all thanks to my partner.

205
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,840
Chengling.

206
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,440
Chengling, please slow down.

207
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,160
I know the way back to my room.
I can go by myself.

208
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,720
I don't need you to walk me there.

209
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,880
No way.

210
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,760
Master said
that you're an important guest.

211
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,880
There must be someone
to accompany you around.

212
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,040
Really?

213
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,400
Am I a guest or a criminal?

214
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,120
-You--
-What's wrong?

215
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,040
Xie Wuyang, why are you two arguing?

216
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,920
Xiaolian, I wanted to bring Chengling

217
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,920
to the Second Generation
Disciple Compound.

218
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,000
But he doesn't want a companion.

219
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,160
I understand. You may leave.

220
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,360
Leave Chengling to me.

221
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,120
Yes.

222
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,760
Chengling.

223
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,920
Recently, Yueyang City
has been quite messy.

224
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,600
My father is concerned about your safety.

225
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,400
I can't go out either.

226
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,880
Are you frightened
because my father spoke too fiercely?

227
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,200
You'll understand him
after you get along with him longer.

228
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,000
He's cold on the outside,
but warm on the inside.

229
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,160
Normally, he is actually nice to us.

230
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,680
Chengling.

231
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,520
Yueyang Sect is used to being frugal.

232
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,600
It might not be as exquisite as your home.

233
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,920
So we've arranged to let you stay here.

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,960
PINE HALL

235
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,280
Tell me if you have any problems
in the future.

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,880
All right. It's my fault.

237
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,640
You're not a kid anymore.

238
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,000
You're an adult now.

239
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,560
Xiaolian, Cao Weining is looking for you.

240
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,840
All right, I got it.

241
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,840
Yes.

242
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,480
The disciples here are about your age.

243
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,000
Train your martial arts with them
in the future.

244
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,520
Everyone, please come here.

245
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,680
This is Zhang Chengling.

246
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,640
Please take care of him from now on.

247
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,880
-All right, Xiaolian.
-All right, Xiaolian.

248
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,640
Train your martial arts here from now on.

249
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,160
I don't think he can even take a punch.

250
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,080
Yes.

251
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,120
He will collapse
after taking a few punches.

252
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,880
That's why it's taking a while
to capture Zhang Buzhi.

253
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
It's not so safe in Yueyang City recently.

254
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,480
Ms. Gu Xiang is a girl.

255
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,720
She might feel inconvenient outside.

256
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,120
Moreover, Master Zhou and Master Wen

257
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,680
are Hero Zhao's friends.

258
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,400
They will come to visit Yueyang Sect soon.

259
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,360
So…

260
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,840
I think…

261
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,120
If you don't mind,

262
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
can you let Ms. Gu Xiang stay here?

263
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,560
Since she's your friend,

264
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,280
that's not a problem at all.

265
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,480
Ms. Gu, do you mind staying

266
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,880
at my compound?

267
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,640
Thank you, Xiaolian.

268
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,080
Thank you.

269
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,600
My good sister, you're welcome.

270
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,400
Cao Weining's friend is my friend.

271
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,080
Xiaolian.

272
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,280
Master asked you
to prepare for the worship.

273
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,400
It's getting dark.

274
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,160
Why is he going to worship now?

275
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,680
What kind of worship should I prepare for?

276
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,640
Master wants to bring the disciple
from the Zhang family

277
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
to worship the Five Lakes Monument.

278
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
All right.

279
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,280
Help me take Ms. Gu to my compound.

280
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,680
She will stay in the west wing.

281
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Yes.

282
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,800
My good sister, I'll leave now.

283
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,640
Feel free to tell my junior
if you need anything.

284
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,760
All right.

285
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,960
You can tell Cao Weining too.

286
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,080
Candied hawthorn on sale!

287
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,200
Candied hawthorn on sale.

288
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,560
Good day, sir.

289
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,800
-Candied hawthorn on sale.
-Welcome.

290
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,920
Wen Kexing.

291
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Take care.

292
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,440
What's wrong?

293
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,320
I have something else to do.

294
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,080
We shall part here.

295
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,520
See you…

296
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,440
I'll follow you wherever you go.

297
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,080
Aren't you going to fight the bad guys
and save the dwellers of hell?

298
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,920
The dwellers of hell have been happy
to stay there for many years.

299
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,359
There is no rush.

300
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,119
I don't understand then.

301
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,800
Why do you keep following me?

302
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,240
Didn't you allow me to follow you?

303
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,599
We should do whatever we want in life.

304
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,280
Why do you have so many questions?

305
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,000
Then let me ask you this.

306
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,119
Why do you keep following Chengling?

307
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,320
Yes. I have been stubborn.

308
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,080
I know that you're worried
about Chengling's situation

309
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,400
in the Five Lakes Alliance.

310
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,840
Didn't I send Ah Xiang to check on him?

311
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,440
Those old foxes are clever.

312
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,360
They would not expose themselves so soon.

313
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,480
I'm not just worried
about the Five Lakes Alliance.

314
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,600
Now, many forces in the martial arts world
are keeping an eye on Chengling.

315
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,080
I talked to the waiter just now.

316
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,360
I asked him if he had seen
unruly martial artists.

317
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,880
He said that there was a group of them.

318
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,040
People who dress like feudal officials
outside the town?

319
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,520
It's still bright outside.
Who is releasing the lanterns?

320
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,960
The Window of Heaven
is taking action in this area.

321
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,200
Those who dress like feudal officials
are from the Window of Heaven.

322
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,880
-I'll go to Yueyang Sect to have a look.
-Master!

323
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
Master, thank goodness
you haven't gone far.

324
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,320
Girl, why are you back so soon?

325
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,480
It's fine. Just say it.

326
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,600
I sneaked into Yueyang Sect.

327
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,920
Good girl. How's the little idiot?

328
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,360
I'm here to tell you some urgent news.

329
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,560
Gao Chong wants to bring the little idiot

330
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,560
to worship the Five Lake Monuments.

331
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,520
I don't understand. It's getting dark.

332
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,760
What is there to worship?

333
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,280
At night…

334
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
Go back first.

335
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,320
FIVE LAKES WORLD ALLIANCE

336
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,640
FIVE LAKES WORLD ALLIANCE

337
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,440
LAKE OF THE FIVE CONTINENTS

338
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,560
One hundred years ago,

339
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,680
our ancestors imitated
the Three Heroes of the Peach Garden

340
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,720
in a bamboo forest.

341
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,440
They became five sworn brothers.

342
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,920
They worked together

343
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,400
and helped each other.

344
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,680
They founded their sects
and accepted many disciples.

345
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,320
That's the origin
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

346
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,880
MIRROR LAKE SECT

347
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,720
They built a monument here
so that their descendants know

348
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,640
the righteousness of the Five Lakes

349
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,240
came before the World Alliance.

350
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,000
Kid.

351
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,280
If you inherit your father's position
as the chief,

352
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,160
your name will also be carved
on this monument in the future.

353
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,040
You'll be respected by your descendants,
generation after generation.

354
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,040
Someone told me

355
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,640
that you're incapable
of becoming the chief.

356
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,120
Someone also told me

357
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,760
that you can't bear this responsibility.

358
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,080
They hope that I could find
an outstanding disciple

359
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,640
from the Five Lakes Alliance to be
the successor of the Zhang family

360
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,440
and bear the responsibility
on your behalf.

361
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,360
But I don't agree with that.

362
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,960
You're the direct descendant
of the Zhang family, no matter what.

363
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,600
Mr. Gao, you're the chief.

364
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,120
I will do as you decide.

365
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,040
Gao Shan!

366
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,240
Yao Zhi!

367
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,800
-Master!
-Master!

368
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,320
Chief Gao, we meet again.

369
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,600
Commander Han.

370
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,440
You even use such a cheap trick?

371
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,720
Are you trying to force me
to obey your command?

372
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,600
Chief Gao, I would like
to settle this peacefully.

373
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,840
Hand over the orphan
of the Zhang family to me.

374
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,000
I'll release them.

375
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
Or else…

376
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,520
What would you do?

377
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,120
Crossbows are important weapons
of the country!

378
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,920
No one is allowed
to possess them privately!

379
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Is Prince Jin planning to revolt?

380
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,600
Chief Gao.

381
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,920
Stop worrying about us.

382
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,000
Hand over the child. He can still live.

383
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,560
If you refuse,

384
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,400
today will be
your death anniversary next year.

385
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,760
You want to take Zhang Chengling away?

386
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,240
Kill me first!

387
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,480
Chief Gao.

388
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,040
Don't think I'm just trying to scare you
and won't take action.

389
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,640
The Window of Heaven is omniscient.

390
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,880
Even if I kill every one of you today,

391
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,320
I still can find out
the truth about the Glazed Armor.

392
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,720
Damn it.

393
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,640
Where did they come from?

394
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,760
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

395
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,720
It's none of your business.

396
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,280
The crossbows need some time to set up.

397
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,680
I'll draw their attention away
during their first shot.

398
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,800
You can go and capture their leader
when they reload their arrows.

399
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,160
No way.

400
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,120
The arrows will be powerful and swift.

401
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,240
Men can't fend them off,
no matter how good one's martial arts are.

402
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,200
A gentleman is willing to die
for his soul mate.

403
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,040
So what if I risk this for you?

404
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,520
I'll distract the crossbowmen
and you'll capture the guy.

405
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,720
Stop!

406
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,560
Why aren't you releasing them?

407
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,280
Release them.

408
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,040
Sirs, you are…

409
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,560
Chief Gao, don't try to befriend us.

410
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,200
Aren't you leaving?

411
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,080
Are you waiting for a carriage?

412
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,400
I can't express my gratitude.
See you next time.

413
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,720
Let's go.

414
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,520
Little Master, please come with us.

415
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,840
Let our master go!

416
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,880
Retreat!

417
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,040
Everyone, retreat!

418
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,560
They won't hurt me.

419
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,640
You're right. I dare not provoke you guys.

420
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,920
We will send this master back intact
to you later.

421
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,360
Hurry and leave!
Take care of your crossbows!

422
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,080
Wait for me.

423
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,840
Let's go.

424
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,160
Ah Xu.

425
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,400
You owe me a big favor today.

426
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,480
Hey!

427
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,120
Little Master, watch your eyes.

428
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,760
I abducted you.

429
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,120
Why are you staring at him?

430
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,880
My lord.

431
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,080
My lord, it's really you.

432
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,640
I thought I was mistaken
when I saw the Swift Moving Steps.

433
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,480
My lord, why are you here?

434
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,000
Why aren't you disguising yourself?

435
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,400
How's your injury?

436
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,720
I've had enough of hiding myself

437
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,800
for years.

438
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,000
Han Ying, I'm sorry.

439
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,200
I knew you would recognize me.

440
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,040
It was urgent.

441
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,360
So that you could explain it
to your subordinates.

442
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,360
You saved my life.

443
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm willing to risk everything
at your command.

444
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,440
Ah Xu, shall I leave for a while?

445
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,600
First, I saw the Window of Heaven's
Trapped Sparrow and Drunk Like a Dream.

446
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,200
Then I saw disciples of Yueyang Sect

447
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,200
communicating with
the Window of Heaven's secret code.

448
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,840
I thought they were coming at me.

449
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,640
I didn't expect that the Window of Heaven
is looking for the Glazed Armor.

450
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,240
Yes. Since the news
about the extermination

451
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
of Mirror Lake Manor spread to Prince Jin,

452
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,400
I was dispatched to Jiangnan

453
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,360
to investigate the song.

454
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,400
That is just a tale
of the martial arts world.

455
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,040
Why is the Window of Heaven taking action?

456
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,760
I'm sorry, I don't know.

457
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,280
I only know that Duan Pengju cares
about the Glazed Armor very much.

458
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,640
He's eager to get it.

459
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,280
My lord, if you want to know,

460
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
-I can try and investigate it secretly.
-Don't.

461
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,760
Since I took the risk
and showed up just now,

462
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,960
I've put you in danger.

463
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,920
That was my last resort.

464
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,920
Few of those who joined the Window
of Heaven because of me are alive now.

465
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,280
You are loyal to me

466
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,760
as long as you stay alive.

467
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,880
Little Master.

468
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,440
Master, you're my lord's friend.

469
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,880
You may call me Han Ying.

470
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,120
Little Master.

471
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,760
Why did you want to take the orphan
of the Zhang family from Gao Chong?

472
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,960
Mirror Lake Sword Sect
was exterminated by Hanged Ghost.

473
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,640
The Glazed Armor should be
with the Ghost Valley.

474
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,760
Why do you want the Zhang family's child?

475
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,200
Master, you don't know.

476
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,120
The Window of Heaven had a spy
in Mirror Lake Sect.

477
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,760
The spy witnessed that people

478
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,360
from the Ghost Valley killed
the father and sons of the Zhang family

479
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,160
and forced them
to hand over the Glazed Armor.

480
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,160
Zhang Yusen didn't surrender until death,

481
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,040
so the Glazed Armor must be
with his youngest son who escaped.

482
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,560
The old foxes
in this martial arts world are sensitive.

483
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,640
Even if they don't know
about this incident,

484
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,920
when the Ghost Valley tried to abduct
Zhang Chengling in Sanbai Manor,

485
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,080
it has hinted that the case
of Mirror Lake Sword Sect is not over yet.

486
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,680
My lord, what are your orders?

487
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,440
Actually, Zhang Chengling

488
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,720
belongs to your lord.

489
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
-Lao Wen.
-My lord.

490
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,920
Do you know Zhang Chengling?

491
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,280
Please forgive me for not knowing that.

492
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,080
-I will try to--
-No need.

493
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,800
After you return,

494
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,640
act as if you haven't seen me.

495
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,880
Act as usual.

496
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,360
But don't hurry to take action.

497
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,960
If my guess is correct,

498
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,800
the Five Lakes Alliance will definitely
force Zhang Chengling

499
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,200
to hand over the Glazed Armor.

500
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,720
And they will do that
before the Heroes Conference.

501
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,760
"The Iridescent Clouds are scattered
and the Glaze is shattered."

502
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,440
Is this really the Glazed Armor
of the legend?

503
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,520
But that man was carrying it around.

504
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,280
Is he a fool?

505
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,160
Damn it.

506
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,600
What's going on?

507
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,640
First, the Window of Heaven.
Then, the leader of a manor.

508
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,440
What kind of man am I following?

509
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,720
Just now…

510
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Thank you.

511
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,800
Answer my question first.

512
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,120
Why did a man of high status
in the Window of Heaven

513
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,120
go sunbathing in Yue?

514
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,400
Were you trying to have fun
with the people?

515
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,680
I've left the Window of Heaven.

516
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,240
Lao Wen.

517
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,280
I owe you a favor.

518
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,080
You don't owe me a favor.

519
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,760
But you owe me an explanation.

520
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,720
Ah Xu.

521
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,800
Do you want me to believe

522
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,280
that you would do all this
because of three maces of silver?

523
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What's your relationship
with Zhang Chengling?

524
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,720
I've fulfilled my promise
to the old fisherman in Yue.

525
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,840
But when I saw this child in danger,

526
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,880
I couldn't stay there and do nothing.

527
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,520
Take it as a charity.

528
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,240
Maybe 100…

529
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,360
Maybe when I go to hell,

530
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,280
I may suffer less
from the pain of tendon-and-skin peeling.

531
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,520
Close friends of generations
deceive each other.

532
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,880
Newly met strangers
entrust each other with their lives.

533
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,720
How interesting.

534
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,200
Interesting indeed.

535
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,040
But Ah Xu…

536
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,400
Are you really not related
to the Five Lakes Alliance?

537
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,600
You're not, right?

538
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,680
Since you asked me that,

539
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,640
are you holding a grudge
against the Five Lakes Alliance?

540
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,040
Since you brought it up,

541
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,920
I have a question for you too.

542
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,320
The day that Mirror Lake Manor
was exterminated,

543
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,440
was your appearance on the island

544
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,880
a coincidence?

545
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,400
It wasn't really a coincidence.

546
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,440
Wasn't I following you?

547
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,280
Didn't you say

548
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,120
that we would meet if we're fated?

549
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,000
I didn't want to wait for fate.

550
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,880
So I had to take initiative.

551
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,640
I'm asking you directly
because I treat you as my friend.

552
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,800
You're treating me as your friend?

553
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,720
We've been through thick and thin
many times.

554
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,400
But you're only treating me
as your friend.

555
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,080
Wen Kexing.

556
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,960
It seems like

557
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,960
you have to work harder.

558
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Why don't you ask me what I think of you?

559
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,600
I don't care.

560
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,720
Let's go. We are about
to leave the mountain.

561
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,160
You're my soul mate.

562
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,160
Search the place.

563
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,400
He died from poison.

564
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,840
Be careful.

565
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,160
Don't simply touch things in here.
Beware of leftover poison.

566
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,200
-Yes.
-Yes.

567
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,320
Gao Shan, look!

568
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,440
Are the things on this table the spoils?

569
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,400
Fang Buzhi is very cunning.

570
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,080
Who was so competent
to find him before us?

571
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,600
-Come again.
-Candied hawthorn!

572
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,240
Watermelon on sale!
Big and sweet watermelon!

573
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,960
-Watermelon on sale!
-Look.

574
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,640
Watermelon! Big and sweet!

575
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,920
Sir, taste it. Big and sweet watermelon.

576
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,160
Which one is the sweetest?

577
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,640
Here. This one. This one is sweet.

578
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,680
-Take the bigger one.
-Ah Xu.

579
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,040
It's so sweet.

580
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,520
Sir, you haven't paid.

581
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,120
This one.

582
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,040
Here.

583
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,960
-All right. Thank you.
-Here you go.

584
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,080
Do you want some?

585
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,000
Thank you.

586
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,960
SOUP

587
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Good day.

588
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,840
Are you done eating?

589
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,159
Why do you look like a child
who's on his first visit to a market?

590
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,400
Don't you want to find
your pouch and your jade amulet?

591
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,120
It's fine if I can't find them.
It doesn't matter.

592
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:34,440
Ah Xu, do you want to try this dessert?

593
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,639
I even asked him to add
two more spoons of syrup.

594
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,280
You aren't spending your own money.

595
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,440
You're generous at spending others' money.

596
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,239
Don't be so stingy.

597
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,639
I saved your silly disciple, right?

598
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,199
-It's not a bad deal.
-Who's making a deal with you?

599
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,400
Return me the money.

600
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,639
Ah Xu.

601
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,960
Just let me spend your money.

602
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,240
It's not a loss.

603
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,160
You risked your life for the old man
because of three maces of silver.

604
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,280
I only spent a little bit.

605
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,760
Or I can listen to your commands.

606
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,560
Is that all right?

607
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,080
All right.

608
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,080
Please stay away quietly.

609
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,040
All right. I'll go wherever you go.

610
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,480
JINYAN STREET

611
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,640
Come and have a look!

612
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,320
A troupe from the Western Regions!

613
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400
-It's a rare chance.
-Western Regions' magic

614
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,280
-Ah Xu.
-A world-wonder.

615
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,120
-Have you seen Western Regions' magic?
-All kinds of art.

616
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,080
A world-wonder.

617
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,480
Why are they cutting
a pretty lady with knives?

618
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,640
Magic of a living person!
A string of coins for entry!

619
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,440
I guarantee that you'll be impressed.

620
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,320
Let's go and have a look.
I've never seen this.

621
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,360
-A troupe from the Western Regions.
-Let's go.

622
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,680
Fang Buzhi might be inside.

623
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
Let's go.

624
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,600
Welcome, sirs. Please come in.

625
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,880
An exotic performance.

626
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,280
It's quite special.

627
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,440
This zither…

628
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,440
Let's see what tricks he has.

629
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,480
No.

630
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,240
-Good!
-Good!

631
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,960
-Good!
-Good!

632
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,920
-There's nothing wrong.
-There's no blood.

633
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,160
-Good!
-Good!

634
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,040
THE WATER FROM THE FIVE LAKES
GATHERS AROUND THE WORLD.

635
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,720
WHO ELSE DESERVES THE SUPREMACY
IN THE MARTIAL ARTS WORLD?

636
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,400
Congratulations on
the upcoming Heroes Conference

637
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,440
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

638
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,560
Here are ten human heads,

639
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,400
representing the Ghost Valley's goodwill.

640
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,440
-Run.
-Someone was killed!

641
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Hurry up! Arrest them!

642
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,120
-Run.
-Run.

643
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,080
Wei?

644
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,760
Dear folks,

645
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,280
please don't panic.

646
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,360
Yueyang Sect will definitely

647
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,960
investigate this.

648
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,200
Under Chief Gao's leadership,

649
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,600
we will definitely bring
the bad guys to justice.

650
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,160
Don't be afraid.

651
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,920
Yueyang Sect seems more powerful
than the feudal officials here.

652
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,440
Protecting this place?

653
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,240
Chief Gao hasn't even passed away,

654
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
so why do they see him as an immortal?

655
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,320
Yueyang Sect is heavily guarded.
They've been constantly patrolling around.

656
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,560
There are many martial artists
in this town too.

657
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,920
I didn't expect the Ghost Valley

658
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,360
would cause this chaos.

659
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,440
It's like a slap on his face.

660
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,000
Chief Gao has been humiliated.

661
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
The Ghost Valley made a great effort

662
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,000
only to humiliate Yueyang Sect.

663
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,200
Do you believe
that this is just the start?

664
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,120
Move backward!

665
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,440
Are you worried
about your so-called disciple?

666
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,960
Since when did I have a disciple?

667
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,000
Here you go again. Why don't you admit it?

668
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,680
Why don't we take this chance
to meet with Zhao Jing?

669
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,440
We can also pay our respects

670
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,880
to the beneficent Iron Judge, Gao Chong.

671
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,880
Master!

672
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,480
Wei…

673
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,800
Yunge, my son!

674
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,240
I'll take revenge for you!

675
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,000
Curse you, Ghost Valley!

676
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,680
Those heartless demons!

677
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,680
I will fight you to death!

678
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,840
Absurd! How can they be so defiant?

679
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,960
I think Ghost Valley
is overestimating itself!

680
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,440
Why? Even though the ghosts
in Mount Qingya are fierce,

681
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,360
do they still dare to go
against the world of martial arts?

682
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,680
But they still do it!

683
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,640
Gao Chong, don't be anxious.

684
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,880
The Ghost Valley will collapse
of its own accord with its evil deeds.

685
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,840
Gao Chong, don't be angry.

686
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,040
I swear

687
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,160
I'll make the Ghost Valley
pay back tenfold!

688
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,080
Tenfold?

689
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,200
This is extremely shameful!

690
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,000
If I can't demolish the Ghost Valley,

691
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,480
how can I live on in this world?

692
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,160
-Yes!
-Chief, you're right!

693
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,480
An eye for an eye!

694
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,680
Demolish the Ghost Valley!

695
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,120
An eye for an eye!

696
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,640
Demolish the Ghost Valley!

697
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,960
An eye for an eye!

698
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,360
Demolish the Ghost Valley!

699
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,760
CHONGWU PALACE

700
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,120
Masters, please wait for a while.

701
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,560
Thank you.

702
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,560
-Mr. Wen. Mr. Zhou.
-Hero Zhao.

703
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,480
How have you been?

704
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,600
I'm sorry for not welcoming you earlier.

705
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,200
Hero Shen.

706
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,520
We were looking for you guys.

707
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,000
But you came here yourselves.

708
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,000
Hero Shen, you were looking for me?

709
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
I'm flattered.

710
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,280
Stop pretending.

711
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,200
The incident at Sanbai Manor
was unexpected.

712
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,160
Yet you guys left without a word.
Why is that?

713
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm sorry.

714
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,040
I noticed that you had many incidents

715
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,760
and were not free to welcome guests,

716
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,080
so we decided to leave.

717
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,800
I did leave a note before I left.

718
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,320
Hero Shen, why are you blaming me?

719
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,720
What a good excuse.

720
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,840
The night you left,

721
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,520
Zhao Jing's manor
suffered a loss by theft.

722
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,240
Can you explain that?

723
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,360
I have nothing to say to that.

724
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,360
Hero Zhao.

725
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,400
Are you blaming me

726
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,400
for the theft?

727
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,360
Of course not.
It's all a misunderstanding.

728
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,240
They are the benefactors
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

729
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,880
Why are you suspecting them?

730
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Benefactors?

731
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,440
Gao Chong.

732
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,080
Mr. Wen rescued Chengling

733
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,320
from Mirror Lake Sword Sect

734
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,760
and brought him all the way
to my residence.

735
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,240
They've indeed helped a lot.

736
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,880
Mr. Wen, do you know me?

737
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,520
Iron Judge, Gao Chong, is so famous.

738
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,640
It's not strange that I know you.

739
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,560
It's an honor if you know me.

740
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,240
Chief Gao, do you know me?

741
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,360
I'm sorry.

742
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,520
I don't know you, Mr. Wen.

743
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,040
Mr. Wen.

744
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,160
How did you know my brother, Zhang Yusen?

745
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,120
Thank you for your escort,
Mr. Wen and Mr. Zhou.

746
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,320
The Five Lakes Alliance
will remember your kindness.

747
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,360
Why does Lao Wen look strange?

748
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,920
What's his relationship with Gao Chong?

749
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,800
I didn't have the honor
to get to know Hero Zhang.

750
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,200
I did it for justice. It was fate.

751
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,760
We came here today

752
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,600
to visit Chengling.

753
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,400
But it seems that we came
at the wrong time.

754
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,120
Is Chengling doing well?

755
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,400
Chengling is feeling unwell.

756
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,480
He's taking a rest.
It's not a good time to visit him.

757
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,640
Chengling is sick?

758
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,920
Is it serious?

759
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,480
Why don't we have a look?

760
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,720
Mr. Wen, your full name is…

761
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,560
I'm Wen Kexing.

762
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,640
Mr. Wen.

763
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,440
I forgot to ask which sect you are from.

764
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,320
I don't belong to any sects.

765
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,840
It's just that my father
taught me some martial arts

766
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,200
and I've been practicing casually.

767
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,360
Then may I know who your father is?

768
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,960
He has raised such a heroic young man.

769
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,280
My father was just an ordinary,
unsophisticated man.

770
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,600
He was a nobody.

771
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,240
He was not even

772
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,760
a clever man.

773
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,720
It has been many years
since my father passed away.

774
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,840
You heroes have been busy.

775
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,760
How would you remember someone like him?

776
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,880
Master! This is bad, Master!

777
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,600
Master! They've killed someone again!

778
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,400
Don't you see the guests here?
Why are you panicking?

779
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,280
Master.

780
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,840
When Gao Shan was patrolling,
he found a corpse.

781
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,320
The body was left out there.

782
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,320
All right.
