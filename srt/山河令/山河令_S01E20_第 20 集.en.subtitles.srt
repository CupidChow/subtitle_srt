1
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,760
Mr. Long!

2
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
-Mr. Long!
-Mr. Long!

3
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,600
Mr. Long, please rest.

4
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,800
It turns out that the answer is so simple.

5
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,360
All parents in the world

6
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,479
desire to offer the best

7
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,960
to their children.

8
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,480
If they don't,

9
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,440
it means that it's not something
that they can offer.

10
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,240
Fate fools men.

11
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,800
Fate fools men.

12
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,920
Zishu.

13
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,280
On the right side
of the bamboo building on the map,

14
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,280
there is a building, the library.

15
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
There are two maps inside.

16
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,640
One of them is the map of Longyuan Valley

17
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,600
and the other is the chart of the traps
in the armory.

18
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,120
Give the latter one

19
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,120
to Master Ye for me.

20
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
And also,

21
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,080
I can't bear to abandon

22
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,080
the techniques of Longyuan Cabinet.

23
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,000
So I wrote them into two volumes of books

24
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,880
which are also in the library.

25
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,280
My disciples have all been killed
by Long Xiao.

26
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,000
For the sake of the close bond
between your master and me,

27
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,640
please find me a successor.

28
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,600
Mr. Long,

29
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,200
I haven't told you yet.

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,960
Chengling is now

31
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,720
the sixth-generation disciple
of our Four Seasons Manor.

32
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,360
Previously, I didn't know

33
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,000
the deep connection
between his father and my master.

34
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,040
This has to be fate.

35
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,640
Mr. Long, if you don't think
Chengling is too unqualified,

36
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,560
please accept him as your disciple.

37
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,680
How great!

38
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,600
You're Yusen's son,

39
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,400
the disciple of Huaizhang's disciple.

40
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,760
If you could become my disciple,

41
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,840
that would be really great.

42
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,160
One day, you'll master three stunts.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,600
Our friendships

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,920
wouldn't be broken off.

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,240
-Mr. Long.
-Silly kid. What did you call him?

46
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,280
-Master Long.
-Yes.

47
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,720
-Master Long!
-Mr. Long.

48
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,480
Zishu.

49
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,160
Do you carry
the White Cloth Sword with you?

50
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,600
Cut off this crap for me.

51
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,680
Mr. Long,

52
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,880
you can't cut off the iron chain
just like that.

53
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,680
Since you've been chained for so long,
your meridians are weak and withered.

54
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,160
If you cut off the chain,
pure vital energy will surge

55
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,680
and it definitely will cause
great harm to you.

56
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,280
It doesn't matter.

57
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,560
Kids, tell me.

58
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,360
What's the meaning for me to live longer?

59
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,320
My friends have died,

60
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,120
so have the love of my life.

61
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,000
Even my disciples are dead.

62
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,960
I owe the world nothing!

63
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,760
I deserve everlasting rest.

64
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Master Long.

65
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,840
Please. Please don't leave me behind!

66
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,840
Death is no big deal.

67
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,760
On the contrary, it's actually a relief.

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,960
Do you know

69
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,760
that it's so difficult for me to live?

70
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,280
-Zishu!
-Master Long.

71
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,800
I don't have much time.

72
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,960
Please.

73
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,640
Please cut it off for me.

74
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,120
If I die with this in me,

75
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,600
when I see Rong Xuan and others
after death,

76
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,040
I will be embarrassed to greet them.

77
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,880
-Master Long.
-Please, Zishu.

78
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,960
Zishu!

79
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
Zishu.

80
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,240
Do it for him.

81
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,840
Master Long, please don't die!

82
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,000
I will behave.

83
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,920
I will work hard to learn martial arts.

84
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,840
I will revive the Four Seasons Manor

85
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,680
and the Longyuan Cabinet.

86
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,080
Master Long!

87
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,360
Zhen Yan,

88
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,520
do you really not intend to tell Mr. Long

89
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,960
your true identity?

90
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
My junior.

91
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,960
Ah Xu.

92
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,840
Who are you calling that?

93
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,400
What's wrong with you today?

94
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,720
Are you insane?

95
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,120
Mr. Long.

96
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Please rest assured.

97
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,200
The Zhen family
have concealed their identities,

98
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,800
escaped from the secular world,

99
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,760
and spent their remaining years
in comfort.

100
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,160
Their child has grown up…

101
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,040
to be a man who is sometimes annoying,

102
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,919
but he's not a bad person.

103
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,240
He is quite good at martial arts.

104
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,640
Really?

105
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,120
Was it Huaizhang's doing?

106
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,240
Yes.

107
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,840
Master helped them disguise

108
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,000
and covered their tracks.

109
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,560
Their child became his disciple

110
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,120
and his junior.

111
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,680
That is great.

112
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,880
That's so great.

113
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,880
Mr. Long!

114
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,000
-Mr. Long!
-Master Long.

115
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,440
Master.

116
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,600
Mr. Wen…

117
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,520
Let him be alone for a while.

118
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,800
Thank you.

119
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,680
It has been days.

120
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,520
Master must have arrived in Shu.

121
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,840
But why didn't he send me any message,

122
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,640
leaving me alone with this idiot?

123
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,600
Hey!

124
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,120
You fool!

125
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,520
Why did you get out of bed?

126
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,480
Come over here.

127
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,960
You're not allowed to get out of bed.

128
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,720
The physician said you would only recover
after a good rest.

129
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,760
Don't move. Always stay in bed.

130
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,800
Ah Xiang,

131
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,720
I already know what happened during
the Heroes Conference in Mount Jun.

132
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,360
I must recuperate soon and go back

133
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,840
to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

134
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,360
Which blabber from
Mount Hua Sect told you that?

135
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,720
I'll cut off his tongue!

136
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,920
Don't be so mean.

137
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,280
It's my fault because I kept asking them.

138
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,800
What? Are you detesting my fierceness?

139
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,800
No.

140
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,040
Although you look fierce,

141
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,880
I know that deep in your heart--

142
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,240
You know nothing about me.

143
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,160
I look fierce and I'm malicious inside.

144
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,640
If you get out of bed again,
I will break your legs.

145
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,320
Ah Xiang,

146
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,480
I must go back
to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

147
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,000
Are you willing to go back with me?

148
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,000
Why should I?

149
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,720
If you want to, go as you wish.

150
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,560
If you die on the way,
it's none of my business.

151
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,080
I…

152
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,480
I have to find my master.

153
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,480
Ah Xiang,

154
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,240
I will return
to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect first.

155
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,040
I can't idly stand by
when my sect is in trouble.

156
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,920
I'll come back
as soon as it's over, all right?

157
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,440
Ah Xiang.

158
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,800
Don't worry.

159
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,480
No matter where you are,
as long as I'm alive,

160
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,800
I will come to you.

161
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,280
What for?

162
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,280
My memory is not good.

163
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,920
When you come back to me,

164
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,200
I might have forgotten your face.

165
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,800
The Gentle Wind Sword Sect is in trouble?

166
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,040
What happened?

167
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,000
I sensed that something
was wrong for a while.

168
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,360
My master and Chief Gao
are on the best of terms.

169
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,760
Why did he run back to the sect
before the Heroes Conference started

170
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,280
when he had just arrived?

171
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
So,

172
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,680
are you saying that

173
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,040
your master might have left
with the Glazed Armor?

174
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,360
That's what I'm afraid of.

175
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,880
Think about it.

176
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,840
If I could figure it out,
others could too.

177
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm afraid that…

178
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,240
So you must go back to your sect.

179
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,760
Yes, I have to go back and check.

180
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,880
I really hope that I'm wrong.

181
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,680
What else can I do?

182
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,480
I will accompany you there.

183
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,960
You're a wounded fool.

184
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,280
Without my protection,

185
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,960
in such a sinister world,

186
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,840
you won't be able to make a single move.

187
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,640
Drink the medicine.

188
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,000
BEWILDERED INFATUATION

189
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,240
I have to follow this fool

190
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,440
to learn the whereabouts
of the Glazed Armor for Master.

191
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,000
Master gave me this task.

192
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,680
It's not that I want to follow him.

193
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,280
You won't fail me

194
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,000
and I won't fail you.

195
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,480
Master of the Unfaithful List,

196
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,240
grey hair and red dress.

197
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Qianqiao,

198
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,520
why don't you understand?

199
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,600
It hasn't been long since Zhao Jing
became the chief of Five Lakes Alliance.

200
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,240
Now is a critical moment.

201
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,400
How can we waste such a good tool

202
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,800
for a threat?

203
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,720
Threat?

204
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,680
Yes!

205
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,400
The whole thing about
Gao Chong's working together

206
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,760
with the Ghost Valley is not over yet.

207
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,720
If the scandal about Zhao Jing

208
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,120
being fickle in love
is being spread around,

209
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,120
the reputation of the Five Lakes Alliance
will be totally ruined.

210
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,400
Zhao Jing will be scared of that.

211
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,080
Qiufeng.

212
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,120
You're a grown man.

213
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,160
Why don't you understand
the secular rules?

214
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,880
Gao Chong failing his brother
can't be tolerated by the secular.

215
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
If a woman fails a man,

216
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,440
the whole world will turn against her.

217
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,600
But if it's the other way around…

218
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,480
It will only be taken

219
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
as a romantic affair
during that man's youth.

220
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,680
It's not a threat at all.

221
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
Qianqiao.

222
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,600
What happened between us
is different from them.

223
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,400
After all, Tragicomic Ghost

224
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,760
is just a miserable woman.

225
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,800
She wouldn't turn into a demon

226
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,840
if it weren't for that rat.

227
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
But out there,

228
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,360
nobody knows that the rat is Zhao Jing.

229
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,160
Tragicomic Ghost has killed
so many people.

230
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,760
Can Zhao Jing dismiss the blame?

231
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,280
So what?

232
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,240
What do you get out of Zhao Jing's name

233
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,800
being dragged into the mud?

234
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,080
The position of the chief
of the Five Lakes Alliance

235
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,640
is the last thing you can get.

236
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,440
Foolish girl.

237
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,240
I'll get nothing
from ruining his reputation,

238
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,000
but we could make use of this

239
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,440
to make a trade with Zhao Jing

240
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,600
for something good for both of us.

241
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,080
What?

242
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,240
Something that can turn back time?

243
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,440
The whereabouts of the Glazed Armor.

244
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,200
Gao Chong destroyed the Glazed Armor
before committing suicide.

245
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,880
There must be something behind that.

246
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,200
The real one must be in the hands
of Zhao Jing and Shen Shen.

247
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,680
The treasure in the armory
can turn a nobody into a supreme.

248
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,320
No man can resist such temptation.

249
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,240
The Five Lakes Alliance has hidden
the Glazed Armor for two decades.

250
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,760
If they wanted to destroy it,
they would have done it long ago.

251
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Qianqiao.

252
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,720
The Yin Yang Book of the Healer Valley

253
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,760
can revive the dead and heal all injuries.

254
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,920
There are no diseases
that can't be healed with that.

255
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,760
I want to get it for you.

256
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,480
Even if you don't trust me anymore

257
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,840
or our alliance will eventually fail,

258
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,440
Qianqiao,

259
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,520
as long as I could take away
the regrets in your heart,

260
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,800
I will be content

261
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,720
even at the cost of my life.

262
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,880
Do you mean it?

263
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,440
Qianqiao.

264
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,839
Qianqiao, are you in there?

265
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,520
Liu Qianqiao, are you in there?

266
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,400
If Sirius Fortress
and Striking Cloud Hall join us,

267
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,280
our power will be much greater.

268
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,160
Chief Sha, you've been through
a tough journey to Bian

269
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,160
and achieved a big accomplishment.

270
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,360
It's nothing at all.

271
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,640
I'm just a gofer.

272
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,640
Actually, things were easy this time.

273
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,960
I just took out the command flag
of Five Lakes Alliance

274
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,200
and showed it to them.

275
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,320
What do you think happened?

276
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,520
They said nothing

277
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,160
and agreed at once.

278
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,080
What does this imply?

279
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,680
It was because of our chief's prestige!

280
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,600
You're overpraising me.

281
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,200
I'm not that prestigious

282
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,240
and I'm just the chief for temporary.

283
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,080
After what happened in Mount Jun,

284
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,520
our alliance didn't collapse

285
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,280
and our reputation has become better.

286
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,360
This is an amazing miracle.

287
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,280
Gentlemen,

288
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,680
in my opinion,

289
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,200
no one is more qualified than Chief Zhao

290
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,800
to be our chief in this world.

291
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,440
-In other words,
-Yes.

292
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,120
if anyone dares to take over,

293
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,720
I'll be the first one to smash him.

294
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,440
Chief Sha, you shouldn't say that.

295
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,520
It has only been a few months
since I became the chief.

296
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,040
The accomplishments that I've gained

297
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,080
should be credited

298
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,600
to all of you and not me.

299
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,880
However,

300
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,400
compared to the expansion
of the Five Lakes Alliance,

301
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,560
I care more

302
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,080
about those two lost kids.

303
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,560
Xiaolian and Chengling.

304
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,000
I watched Xiaolian grow.

305
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,040
She is a vulnerable lady,

306
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,240
who has never set foot
in the martial arts world.

307
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,200
In my opinion,

308
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,800
she shouldn't be dragged
into secular chaos.

309
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,160
But Tao Hong and Lu Liu

310
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,280
have taken her hostage.

311
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,120
They are really despicable!

312
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,920
As for Chengling,

313
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,400
after the Heroes Conference,

314
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,800
he disappeared with a mystery man.

315
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,360
No one knows how he is doing now.

316
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,520
Here I am,

317
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,280
begging for your help,

318
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,840
to find these two kids.

319
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,640
I'm willing to find them

320
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,320
at all costs.

321
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,480
-Chief, please rest assured.
-Chief, please rest assured.

322
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,600
Yes, we will do a thorough search

323
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,240
to bring them back.

324
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,320
We will bring them back, alive or dead.

325
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,360
Hey, Chief Sha.

326
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,840
Please excuse my words.

327
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,760
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

328
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Ah Xiang.

329
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,840
Is Yu Qiufeng inside?

330
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,880
What did he do to make you work with him?

331
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,160
Those girls
from the Department of the Unfaithful

332
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,880
have told me about that two-timer.

333
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,640
Why are you still with him?

334
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,720
Ah Xiang, lower your voice.

335
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,360
The situation in Yueyang City
is tense and chaotic.

336
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,120
Master is not in her right mind yet

337
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,360
and both of us are not good
at martial arts.

338
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,160
We have no way to get her out.

339
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,320
We still need to stay here for now.

340
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,960
Nonsense!

341
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,600
You have such amazing
transformation skills.

342
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,720
We can disguise ourselves
as someone else and escape the city.

343
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,480
And when I rendezvous
with those old ghosts,

344
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,560
I will ask them
to tear Yu Qiufeng into pieces!

345
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,440
Ah Xiang, you don't get it.

346
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,880
The Ten Devils' interests
conflict with each other.

347
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,000
They have always desire to kill
one another to take over the power.

348
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,600
Especially for girls like us.

349
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,760
We depended on
Master's strong martial arts for years

350
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
and the protection of the valley chief.

351
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,600
That's how we stay safe.

352
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,000
Now that Master is in a coma,

353
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,960
-I'm afraid that…
-Afraid of what?

354
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,440
They wouldn't dare!

355
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,800
If they dare to bully us,

356
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,760
Master will slice them into pieces
to feed the dogs.

357
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,160
Distant water can't put out a nearby fire.

358
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,880
Unless you can get
to the valley chief fast.

359
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,680
Only he can find me.

360
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
I have no idea where he is.

361
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,640
I've asked the girls
from the Department of the Unfaithful

362
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,960
to go down the mountain to search for him.

363
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,040
There are many of them.
They will leave marks.

364
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,600
If the valley chief sees one,

365
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,800
he will contact us.

366
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,880
That's not the best way.

367
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,080
It's such a big world out there.

368
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Who knows when Master will see them.

369
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,440
If Master doesn't show up,

370
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,800
will you and Madam Luo stay here forever?

371
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,040
Is that Yu Qiufeng reliable?

372
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,520
Rest assured. I can deal with him.

373
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,160
I don't believe you.

374
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,880
You've been fooled by that bastard,

375
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,680
so you don't have the heart to leave.

376
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,200
If Master and Madam Luo knew about this

377
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,240
when you entered the valley,

378
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,640
they would have forced you

379
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,920
to drink the Soup of Oblivion
and forget this bastard.

380
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,480
Don't just say what you like.

381
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,280
What does a little girl like you know?

382
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,440
Never mind!

383
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,680
I won't tell on you.

384
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,280
So for now,

385
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,200
have you figured out a way
to rescue Madam Luo?

386
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,400
No.

387
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,400
The Soup of Oblivion's effects is strong.

388
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,800
After taking it,
trying to awaken the memories

389
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,400
that it wipes from your mind is taboo.

390
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,640
Master suffered
from soul-dissociation before.

391
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,320
She flares up every now and then.

392
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,200
Her mind is more chaotic than others.

393
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,240
What should we do then?

394
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
I will try harder to fix Master's illness.

395
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,560
By the way, Ah Xiang,

396
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,480
why did you come to me?

397
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,480
I came to say goodbye.

398
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,200
Cao Weining said that he's going back
to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

399
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,560
So I'm accompanying him.

400
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,760
I'm not doing it for him.

401
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,040
I…

402
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,280
I'm doing it for…

403
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,080
It's a task Master assigned to me.

404
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
I know it now.

405
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,480
You were careless and heartless,

406
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,480
but suddenly, you've become sensible.

407
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,720
-I see.
-Don't talk nonsense.

408
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,560
But you're now

409
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,560
in this kind of situation.

410
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,800
How can I leave
without being worried about you?

411
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,840
It's all right, Ah Xiang.

412
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,080
Don't worry and just go.

413
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,520
When you grow older, you will know.

414
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,760
There is no time

415
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,120
more important than
time spent with our loved ones.

416
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,680
One day of staying together means a lot.

417
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,040
One more day of that is your fortune.

418
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,840
As for other things,

419
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,360
you will just ignore them.

420
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,480
Xie'er.

421
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,080
-You must be bored.
-Godfather.

422
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,080
How did the meeting go?

423
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,080
As usual.

424
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,840
The Sirius Fortress
and the Striking Cloud Hall

425
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,360
used to be so arrogant

426
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,080
and domineering.

427
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,400
But now, all of them are fawning on me.

428
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,920
And those losers
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

429
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,760
I asked them to go eastward

430
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,920
and they didn't dare to go westward.

431
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,520
The chief of the Sirius Fortress
is said to be doughty and ferocious.

432
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,280
I only pulled a little trick.

433
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,760
He actually went down on his knees,

434
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,400
saying that he would serve
our alliance willingly.

435
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,240
The Striking Cloud Hall is no better.

436
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,040
They are smart enough to swear allegiance
right from the start.

437
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,640
Good boy.

438
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,560
You're a big help to me.

439
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,480
For the things
that I can't handle in person,

440
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,640
you dealt with them properly for me.

441
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,280
To have such a good son like you,

442
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,200
I'm a fortunate father.

443
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
I'm still not good enough.

444
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
If I was,

445
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,720
you wouldn't keep me in the dark
until today.

446
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,520
I'm longing for that day as well.

447
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
However,

448
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Scorpion has a bad reputation
and so many enemies.

449
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,560
It's not the best time.

450
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,400
Be patient and wait.

451
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,200
I will do whatever you say.

452
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,560
Bai Qifeng, the chief of the Xianxia Sect,

453
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,360
knows too many things he shouldn't know.

454
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,520
Before we recommence
the Heroes Conference,

455
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,040
I want him to shut his mouth forever.

456
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,680
Take some right-hand men with you

457
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,240
and lead the Ghost Valley
to root them out.

458
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,480
Don't leave any trouble to the future.

459
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,920
Yes, Godfather.

460
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,440
How about Long Xiao. Any news?

461
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,600
He is in the know

462
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,520
and he has suddenly disappeared.

463
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,320
I'm worried.

464
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Not yet.

465
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
From what I know,

466
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,040
Long Xiao wouldn't leave without a word.

467
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,560
I'm afraid he has been kidnapped.

468
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
However, Godfather, don't worry.

469
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,320
I've sent men to investigate it.

470
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,880
I think…

471
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,360
we'll get the news soon.

472
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,480
Long Xiao,

473
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,160
who told you to lie

474
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,760
at the Heroes Conference?

475
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,680
Are you going to tell us or not?

476
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,560
I will kick you off the cliff
if you decline.

477
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,240
I wonder whether your "kids"
can still recognize you as their father?

478
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,080
Long Xiao.

479
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,400
You're the descendant of Mr. Long.

480
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,600
So we don't want to force you.

481
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,400
No, I don't take him as my father.

482
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,680
I don't!

483
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,960
I don't!

484
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,840
This body was given by him.

485
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,280
I will just return it back to him.

486
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,120
I won't tell you.

487
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,520
I'd rather die!

488
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,600
Given what he has done,

489
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,200
he deserves to die a hundred times.

490
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,960
But he was Mr. Long's only son.

491
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,440
TOMB OF BELOVED WIFE, YU ZHUI

492
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,720
TOMB OF MY MASTER, LONG QUE

493
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,360
Let's go to the library first.

494
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,840
Find the map and then find a way out.

495
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,280
Chengling,

496
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,040
work harder in the future.

497
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,320
Master Mr. Long's mechanical arts

498
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,840
and make it known to the world.

499
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,200
TOMB OF MY MASTER, LONG QUE

500
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,280
Master Ye, you're back.

501
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,920
TOMB OF BELOVED WIFE, YU ZHUI

502
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,320
Let's go first.

503
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,120
That's the descendant
of Mount Changming's Sword Immortal.

504
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,400
The two who kidnapped
Zhang Chengling are there too.

505
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,400
Damn it!

506
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,760
Why are they all in the Longyuan Valley?

507
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,440
I must inform Scorpion King fast.

508
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,320
TOMB OF MY MASTER, LONG QUE

509
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,800
Slow down.

510
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,880
What is that Old Monster muttering?

511
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,880
I want to hear it.

512
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Forget it.

513
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,920
Let's take a walk around.

514
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,960
Mr. Wen, let's go.

515
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,240
Hey! I want to hear more!

516
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,960
Master. Mr. Wen.

517
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,320
Where are we going?

518
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,600
I wonder where Ah Xiang is.

519
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,920
But she is quite smart.

520
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,120
We don't need to worry about her.

521
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,680
After what happened in Mount Jun,

522
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,600
the Five Lakes Alliance
must be having a tough time,

523
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,320
and its martial arts exponents
are disgraced.

524
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,520
It might be fun to watch that.

525
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,960
You'll catch a cold for underdressing.

526
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,760
Your master is so fragile.

527
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,240
Even a gentle breeze can make him shiver.

528
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,880
Ah Xu, when everything's over,

529
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,400
let's find a warm and peaceful place

530
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
to live for retirement.

531
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,000
Chengling,

532
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,480
where do you want to go?

533
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,480
I will go wherever you go.

534
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,960
Let's not delay any longer.

535
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,640
Let's go back to the Four Seasons Manor.

536
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,240
The Four Seasons Manor?

537
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,200
Are you so eager

538
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,360
to take your disciple back to your master?

539
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,360
Taking such a silly disciple with you…

540
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,360
Aren't you scared that your master

541
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,320
might be furious in the netherworld?

542
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,480
It's our master.

543
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,720
What's the relationship
between you and me?

544
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,960
How is he "our" master?

545
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,760
If you keep behaving like this,

546
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,200
I will teach you a lesson

547
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,680
on behalf of Master.

548
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,120
Master. Mr. Wen.

549
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,880
What are you talking about?

550
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,960
From now on, don't call him "Mr. Wen."

551
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,880
Call him "Master Wen."

552
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,720
Master Wen.

553
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,080
Save it. I'm not your master.

554
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,960
Ah Xu, your disciple is already a fool.
Don't fool him.

555
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,680
My junior.

556
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,080
Are you still unwilling
to acknowledge me as your senior?

557
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

558
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,600
Fate has treated me unfairly
for half of my life.

559
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,560
Now, it has finally shown me some mercy.

560
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,760
I was the only one left
in the Four Seasons Manor.

561
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,640
But I've had such a good disciple

562
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,640
and I even got you back.

563
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,240
I believe this will comfort Master

564
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,480
in the netherworld.

565
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,840
-Mother!
-Miaomiao!

566
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,760
-Mother!
-Miaomiao!

567
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,400
Yan'er, don't be afraid!

568
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,360
White Cloth Sword!

569
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,120
WHITE CLOTH

570
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,960
Huaizhang.

571
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,880
If you didn't come in time,

572
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,520
my family wouldn't survive.

573
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,920
For your great kindness,

574
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,040
-I--
-Stop it.

575
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,000
You silly. What are you talking about?

576
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,400
Do you consider me as your brother or not?

577
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,920
Lie down.

578
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,240
Please don't hurt my father!

579
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,760
-Don't hurt my father!
-Stop it, Yan'er!

580
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,080
-Don't hurt my father!
-Yan'er!

581
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,200
Yan'er, stop it.

582
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,800
-Come on, go with me.
-Father!

583
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,480
-Father!
-Be good.

584
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,520
Father!

585
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,120
I'm sorry.

586
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,560
My son witnessed

587
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,120
Master breaking my tendons,

588
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,160
so he has been traumatized.

589
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,680
Darn it!

590
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,440
Master was forced to do so.

591
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,880
My thoughtlessness shouldn't lead to

592
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,200
the destruction
of the whole Healer Valley.

593
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,160
Those people were mad.

594
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,040
If Master didn't do what he did,

595
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
everyone in the Healer Valley
would suffer.

596
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,360
If that's the case,
my death couldn't atone my sins--

597
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,480
What did they come for?

598
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,480
Rong Xuan alone

599
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,280
couldn't have offended so many people.

600
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,880
Now, even your whole family
has been involved.

601
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,760
Yan'er, what did I tell you?

602
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,679
Mr. Qin is our benefactor.

603
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,960
You shouldn't be rude to him.

604
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,920
I'm sorry.

605
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,840
Mother, I'm afraid.

606
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,280
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

607
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,199
Why are you crying?

608
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,800
Miaomiao.

609
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,480
It was so chaotic last night,

610
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,360
so I didn't have the time
to introduce him to you.

611
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,800
This is my beloved disciple.

612
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,920
My "little forebear."

613
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,040
Zhou Zishu.

614
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,320
Master, don't tease me.

615
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,800
We revere the world
and we respect our masters.

616
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,960
That's enough.

617
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,679
You've collected so many herbs?

618
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,520
Thank you for your hard work,
little saint.

619
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,800
Go out and play with this little boy.

620
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,600
Take good care of him.

621
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,480
I don't know how to play.

622
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,760
What else do you know
if you don't even know how to play?

623
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,280
Just go and play until dusk.

624
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,560
Little boy, what's your name?

625
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,600
I'm…

626
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,520
Zhen Yan.

627
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,120
Yan as in "needle eye"?

628
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,720
Yan as in "extending."

629
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,200
It means limitless and free.

630
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,160
All right, I get it.

631
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,440
It's Zhen Yan.

632
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,360
What's its name?

633
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,480
It is Yiguo.

634
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,960
Yiguo?

635
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,800
Silly boy, it's your mother.

636
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,760
See? How is my disguise skill?

637
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,120
Do you want to learn it?

638
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,680
Go inside to check on your father.

639
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,840
Go. Kneel down in front of Mr. Qin.

640
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,400
Three kowtows in front of him.

641
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,280
Master.

642
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,040
Are we going back home with him?

643
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,560
Yes.

644
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,880
From now on, you'll have a friend.

645
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,560
You must love and care for each other.

646
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,520
You're the older one here,
so take care of him.

647
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,560
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

648
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,160
Zhen Yan.

649
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,200
There's a lot of fun things
and delicious food back home.

650
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,800
As long as we're there,
I will give them all to you.

651
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,880
Address him as your junior.

652
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,560
My junior.

653
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,680
Are you all right?

654
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,880
We were often away from home,

655
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,280
so he is spoiled
to be stubborn and obstreperous.

656
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,520
Please spend more time teaching him
to be more disciplined in the future.

657
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,320
If he does anything wrong,
punish him as you wish.

658
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,320
It's just that

659
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,040
he's already miserable,

660
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,240
please don't loathe him.

661
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,160
Father,

662
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,240
what do you mean?

663
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,440
Are you not going to leave with me?

664
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,160
Two decades have passed since then.

665
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,160
Fortunately, we're lucky enough.

666
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,920
I thought I wouldn't live long.

667
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,200
I don't know how much kung fu
Chengling could learn from me.

668
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,680
Now that you're back,

669
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,200
this is the best arrangement for us.

670
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,760
Revive the Four Seasons Manor.

671
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,440
Take care of Chengling

672
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,280
and inherit Master's legacy.

673
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,120
Only then can I rest assured.

674
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,400
Master.

675
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,440
What do you mean by "wouldn't live long"?

676
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,520
Why?

677
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,520
Are you done with the crap?

678
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,840
Don't just shift
your responsibility on me!

679
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,920
If you want to revive the Manor
to its former glory,

680
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,400
do it yourself.

681
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,720
The character for "Yan" divided into two

682
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,840
is "Kexing," isn't it?

683
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,880
I was mistaken.

684
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,040
I thought you were the descendant
of Master Rong.

685
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,360
It turned out that
you're my junior, Zhen Yan.

686
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,720
Why did you change your surname to Wen?

687
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,120
My surname is Wen!

688
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,360
Master. Master Wen.

689
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,560
What are you talking about?

690
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,400
All right, I won't ask anymore.

691
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,120
What exactly happened all these years?

692
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,040
The Zhen…

693
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,040
Are you all right?

694
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,960
Master Wen!

695
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,200
Chengling, stop!

696
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,080
Master, he…

697
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,400
Wait until he comes back.

698
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,000
It's too late.

699
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,040
It's too late.
