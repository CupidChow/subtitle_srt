1
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Zhou Zishu.

2
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,360
Master Ye.

3
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,280
I've been waiting here for a long time.

4
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,040
You must be tired from the journey.

5
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,640
Are you making fun of me?

6
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,560
Since you and the Great Shaman
are best friends,

7
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,520
why not ask for help yourself?

8
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,120
Living in the mountains for many years
has made me a frog in the well.

9
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,960
I'm actually showing off my acquaintance
in front of the Window of Heaven's chief.

10
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,839
I'm sorry, Master Ye.

11
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,480
I didn't know

12
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,519
you were friends with the Great Shaman.

13
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,880
I've known them for a long time.

14
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,120
I have my reason

15
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,880
for not being able to visit Nanjiang
to seek medical treatment.

16
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,600
It really is a misunderstanding.

17
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,240
For me, you have taken the trouble

18
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,520
to travel thousands of miles.

19
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,680
I'm really grateful.

20
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,280
Cut the crap.

21
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,560
I don't care.

22
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,400
I only took this wasted trip

23
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,040
to repay the favor that I owed Wen Kexing.

24
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,720
I just want to ask you

25
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,560
whether you know who he is.

26
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,840
Yes, I do.

27
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,520
He is the son of Zhen Ruyu,
namely Hero Zhen,

28
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,640
the best friend of your disciple,
Rong Xuan, and my master.

29
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,080
He's my previously lost
and recovered junior disciple

30
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,160
and my lifetime soul mate.

31
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,760
You good-for-nothing fool.

32
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,840
You are Qin Huaizhang's disciple,

33
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,560
but you have also been lied to
by this brat.

34
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,040
Listen to me.

35
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,240
Wen Kexing is the current chief
of the Ghost Valley.

36
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,760
Since all sects
have got the Brochure of Ghosts,

37
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,080
the ghosts will have nowhere to hide.

38
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,400
Do you think he's hiding his identity

39
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,840
and following you for so long
out of kindness?

40
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,240
But I didn't expect

41
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,720
that as a chevalier couple,
Master Zhen and his wife

42
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,200
would raise such a self-depraved beast.

43
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,200
But it's possible

44
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,360
that he's not their son.

45
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,520
He is.

46
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,040
So…

47
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
You've long known that
he is the chief of the Ghost Valley?

48
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,400
Not long enough,

49
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,960
but fortunately, not too late.

50
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,040
You have associated with that devil?

51
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,400
Fine.

52
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,240
All my life, I didn't expect

53
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,840
to be lied to by two brats.

54
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,200
Master Ye.

55
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,640
I didn't mean to keep it a secret.

56
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
It was after entering the Longyuan Cabinet

57
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,440
that I found Lao Wen is Zhen Yan.

58
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,080
Anyway, he became my junior first

59
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,800
before he joined the Ghost Valley.

60
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,080
If only we had taken him back

61
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,000
to the Four Seasons Manor at that time,

62
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,840
none of this would have happened.

63
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,440
For whatever reason,

64
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,120
I can't stay out of it.

65
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,840
"For whatever reason"?

66
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,760
Ever since the Ghost Valley interfered
with the martial arts world,

67
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,040
the bloodshed has never stopped.

68
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,040
Do you know how many innocent people died?

69
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,440
Zhou Zishu.

70
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,240
Right now, you can only see
the brotherhood between you and him.

71
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,800
What about justice?

72
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,400
You are muddleheaded and narrow-minded.

73
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,040
How can you live up
to Qin Huaizhang's teachings?

74
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
Master Ye, after getting along with him
for a few days,

75
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,240
don't you already know
what kind of person he is?

76
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,880
Although he is one of the Ghost Valley,
he hasn't lost his heart.

77
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,560
He shouldn't be the only one
held responsible for Ghost Valley's sins.

78
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,840
Don't you think
that you're being ridiculous?

79
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,880
In such an evil place,
Wen Kexing ascended as the chief.

80
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,480
But you're telling me
that he still has his heart?

81
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,160
As the chief,

82
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,720
he can't escape the sins
the 3,000 ghosts committed.

83
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,240
I pledge by the Dragon's Back

84
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,120
once the ghosts bring disasters
to the world if one day,

85
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,680
I, Ye Baiyi,

86
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,520
will exterminate the Ghost Valley.

87
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,440
In that case,

88
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,880
bring it on, Master Ye.

89
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,040
Are you saying

90
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,880
you're going to protect him until the end?

91
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,920
I'm just protecting my junior.

92
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,040
We are brothers,

93
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,640
whose interests are in line
with each other.

94
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,600
I should take half of his punishment.

95
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,960
I'm afraid you can't afford to bear it.

96
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,120
WHITE CLOTH

97
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,880
Do you really think
I can't bear to kill you?

98
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,640
Don't make me draw my sword.

99
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,640
Master Ye.

100
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,600
With all due respect,

101
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,640
you can't enter
the Four Seasons Manor today.

102
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,520
Not over my dead body.

103
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,080
Do you think I wouldn't dare?

104
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,720
Zhou Zishu.

105
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
For the sake of your dead master,

106
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,040
I'll let you live today.

107
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,400
If Huaizhang were still alive,

108
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
he would have definitely expelled you.

109
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,400
He would not let a selfish guy like you

110
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,680
tarnish the reputation
of the Four Seasons Manor.

111
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,280
You don't know my master at all.

112
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,760
If my master were still alive today,

113
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,160
we would stand here together!

114
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,280
How stubborn!

115
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,400
Come on!

116
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,880
Wen Kexing,

117
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,120
I took a solemn oath.

118
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,760
Once the ghosts on Mount Qingya
escaped the Ghost Valley,

119
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,040
I will destroy them.

120
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,840
As the chief of the Ghost Valley,

121
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,640
you lead a group of ghosts
to commit a lot of evil deeds

122
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,960
which are villainous and unforgivable.

123
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,880
I feel sorry for your miserable life,

124
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,480
so you are allowed to take your own life.

125
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,920
That's not going to happen!

126
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,920
Kill me if you want!

127
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,840
After being killed by you,
I'll turn into a devil

128
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,000
and fight with this damn world
until the end!

129
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
All right.

130
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,320
You'll get what you want.

131
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,320
You have no right!

132
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,160
Ye Baiyi,

133
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,000
Zhen Ruyu risked his life
to protect Rong Xuan.

134
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,640
That's how he ended up
with a broken family,

135
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,800
my junior lost his parents at a young age

136
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,080
and had to go to the Ghost Valley.

137
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,280
Put your hand on your chest
and ask yourself.

138
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,760
Everyone else can judge him!

139
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,800
But can you?

140
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,280
The Divine Hand Zhen Ruyu did good
and accumulated merit all his life.

141
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,640
Countless people were saved.

142
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,520
Why is his only son

143
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,000
being treated so unfairly?

144
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,800
If you are in his shoes,

145
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,680
can you do better than him?

146
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,920
Is it a sin to struggle for your life?

147
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,560
Gratitude can't clear the debt.

148
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,200
My disciple and I
have indeed failed the Wen family.

149
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,600
But I also promised
to eradicate the Ghost Valley.

150
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,760
Today, I'll kill him.

151
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,640
Later,

152
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,400
when I eradicate the Ghost Valley

153
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,160
and fulfill my promise someday,
I'll definitely repay him with my life.

154
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,280
The Ghost Valley should not exist.

155
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,000
The evil world is in people's hearts.

156
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,800
You can eradicate the Ghost Valley,

157
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,960
but can you eradicate
the greed and filth in their hearts?

158
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,960
Master Ye,

159
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,800
you said my master would place
righteousness above family loyalty.

160
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,280
You are wrong.

161
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,520
Master is sensible.

162
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,720
If he knew what my junior had suffered,

163
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,640
he would not be opinionated

164
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,880
and indiscriminate like you.

165
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,440
He would only guide my junior
towards kindness

166
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,640
to make up for the mistake he had made.

167
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,760
To be honest,

168
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,520
you don't deserve to be
my master's friend.

169
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,560
There's no need to think about old times.

170
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,440
If you want to kill,

171
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
just kill both of us.

172
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,720
Nature treats all things impartially.

173
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,200
Wen Kexing,

174
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,360
if you stay in the Four Seasons Manor

175
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,840
and learn to behave, I'll spare you.

176
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,600
But if I meet you again outside,

177
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,920
I'll definitely kill you.

178
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,440
Ah Xu, are you all right?

179
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,520
I'm sorry,

180
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,600
I've always wanted to tell you.

181
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,960
You should feel sorry.

182
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,040
Wen Kexing, let me ask you something.

183
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,000
If I hadn't guessed what was on your mind,

184
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,120
what were you planning to do

185
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,320
when you met Ye Baiyi?

186
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,280
I…

187
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
I just wanted to stop him

188
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,560
from entering the manor.

189
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,840
What if you can't?

190
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,840
If I can't,

191
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,440
then I would let him kill me

192
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,640
rather than expose me

193
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,640
in front of you and Chengling.

194
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,880
I should take out a mirror

195
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,840
and show you how you look right now.

196
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,520
When did the handsome
and charming Wen Kexing

197
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,360
become such a coward?

198
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,040
Zhou Zishu, you…

199
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,520
I'm badly hurt.

200
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,120
Aren't you going to give me a hand?

201
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,560
Aren't you a capable man?

202
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,600
Get up yourself.

203
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,120
I can't.

204
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,560
Aren't you a capable man?

205
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,640
Why can't you even help me up?

206
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,680
Ah Xu,

207
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,680
answer me.

208
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,200
Did you intentionally send me away

209
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,360
and take a shortcut to stop Ye Baiyi?

210
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,680
What if you can't stop him?

211
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Make a guess.

212
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,000
Let's go!

213
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,360
That hurts a lot!
My shoulder is almost broken.

214
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,840
You did that on purpose, right?

215
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,000
All right, I'll be gentle.

216
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,200
What if Chengling sees you hurt like this?

217
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,160
What would you say?

218
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,880
I'll tell him you did it.

219
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,560
Ah Xu.

220
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,200
BREEZE PAVILION

221
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,640
Are you done looking at me?

222
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,640
No, not yet.

223
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,120
It's easy to follow a bad example.

224
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,720
You haven't known my master
for a long time.

225
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,560
Why are you as cheesy as him?

226
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,840
Mr. Wen is not like that at all.

227
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,560
He's a gentleman
with the utmost sincerity.

228
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,160
Stop it.

229
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,720
Are you in here, Weining?

230
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,320
Weixu, what can I do for you?

231
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,120
I've got a letter for you.

232
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,800
I don't know if it's urgent or not,

233
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,520
-but I came here right away.
-They send me the letter this quick?

234
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,880
Hasn't Mount Qingfeng been sealed off?

235
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,440
It's from Mr. Zhou and Mr. Wen.

236
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Weining,

237
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,640
Mr. Zhou and Mr. Wen are…

238
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,760
Friends.

239
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,440
They're friends of Cao Weining.

240
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,160
They're not good guys.

241
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,600
They're always sneaky
and regard being cheesy as funny.

242
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,880
I don't like that Cao Weining
is hanging out with them.

243
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,240
He might learn from bad examples.

244
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,200
-Please bear with him.
-Ah Xiang, what are you talking about?

245
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,600
Weining, may I have a word with you?

246
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,000
Go ahead.

247
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,440
All right.

248
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,080
Let's go, Weixu.

249
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,320
TO CAO WEINING, DISCIPLE OF
THE GENTLE WIND SWORD SECT

250
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,400
Weixu, what do you want to tell me?

251
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,760
Weining.

252
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,360
Do you know who Gu Xiang is?

253
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,240
Weixu, what do you mean?

254
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,080
She claims

255
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,840
to be a handmaid of an elder senior.

256
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,400
Have you met her master?

257
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,800
Yes, of course.

258
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
It was Gu Xiang's master

259
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,160
who entrusted her to me.

260
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,440
Who is he?

261
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,560
He…

262
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,720
Weixu,

263
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,080
although I know who he is,

264
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,080
I can't tell you.

265
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,840
I've promised Ah Xiang

266
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,120
I would never tell anyone
the identity and name of her master.

267
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,640
But please don't worry.
They are good people.

268
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,560
"They"?

269
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,640
Weining,

270
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,000
I know you have
a deep affection for Gu Xiang

271
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,800
and I'm happy to see

272
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,280
that you've found your loved one.

273
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,960
But you have to know

274
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,800
that the world is complicated

275
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,200
with all kinds of people in it.

276
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,080
With all due respect,

277
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,920
these days,

278
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,480
I find that
the way Gu Xiang talks and acts

279
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,080
is somehow evil.

280
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,040
Weixu, please mind your words.

281
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,680
If she did learn the martial arts
from some miraculous people,

282
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,960
it would be normal for her temperament
to be different from a noble lady.

283
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,600
Ah Xiang is not evil.

284
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,120
She is just innocent in her nature.

285
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,320
Weining,

286
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,320
if the situation is as peaceful
as it used to be,

287
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,560
I would not be so cautious.

288
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,720
But now,

289
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,040
the Gentle Wind Sword Sect
has sealed the mountain.

290
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,960
I shouldn't have told you,

291
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,640
so you wouldn't have to worry either.

292
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,440
I see.

293
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,720
Weixu.

294
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,680
Chief Gao entrusted
the Glazed Armor to Master.

295
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,920
-Weining--
-Weixu.

296
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,840
Although I'm slow-witted,

297
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,440
I know that righteousness comes first.

298
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,720
While being wronged,

299
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,320
Chief Gao gave such
an important thing to Master.

300
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,480
We, the Gentle Wind Sword Sect,
sealed the mountain for it.

301
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,920
Even if one day,
we have to risk our lives for it,

302
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,920
that's the responsibility we should bear.

303
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
But you're doubting a girl's innocence

304
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,480
just for the suspicion
that came from insecurity.

305
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,920
I can't agree with you.

306
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,400
I'm not doubting her.

307
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,040
-I just want to know the truth.
-Weixu.

308
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,000
Ah Xiang's life story
is full of twists and turns.

309
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,800
Since she doesn't want to tell me,
I'll respect her decision.

310
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,680
I've gone through

311
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
so much with her.

312
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,280
I swear on my life

313
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,960
that she is definitely a good girl.

314
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,760
I've chosen her

315
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,920
and promised her,

316
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
so I won't betray or distrust her.

317
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,240
Weixu.

318
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,840
Please respect my decision.

319
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,040
Master,

320
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,440
the herbal soup is ready.

321
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,120
Should I pour some for Master Wen?

322
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,760
I'll be cooked if you add more.

323
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,320
You've been so weak lately.

324
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,680
Of course you need more hot water.

325
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,040
Master, does your wound still hurt?

326
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,640
Where did those stinking bandits
come from?

327
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,240
When you are better,

328
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,640
let's burn their house down!

329
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,240
It's all right.

330
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,800
They were all killed by Mr. Wen.

331
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,520
All of them.

332
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
Chengling,

333
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,400
grind the medicine into powder at once.

334
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,000
All right.

335
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,320
Ah Xu.

336
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,040
You're really bad at lying.

337
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,280
What kind of bandits could wound us?

338
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,320
You should feel lucky
that we have a foolish disciple.

339
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,880
I'm not as good at lying, unlike you.

340
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,000
You should come up with something then.

341
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,200
Ah Xu.

342
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,880
I don't want to lie to Chengling anymore.

343
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,080
Stay where you are.

344
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,920
Stand there and listen to me.

345
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,240
Some words

346
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,760
are not easy to say
when I'm looking at you.

347
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,640
I'm part of the reason

348
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,360
for Chengling's

349
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,480
broken family.

350
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,080
You're the one
who wiped out the Mirror Lake Sect?

351
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,320
No.

352
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,680
Do you remember,

353
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,560
in spring,

354
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,520
there was a popular song
that goes like this,

355
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,080
"The water from the Five Lakes
gathers around the world"?

356
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,920
I couldn't forget it.

357
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,600
The second part of the song…

358
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,360
"The Iridescent Clouds are scattered
and the Glaze is shattered.

359
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,000
Who will cry
with the Ghosts on Mount Qingya?"

360
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,760
It was written by me.

361
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,680
I know

362
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,240
once I sow this seed of doubt,

363
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,320
the news will spread.

364
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,000
All those who want the armory

365
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,000
will focus on the Five Lakes Alliance
like a fly does to blood.

366
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,240
But what I can't figure out is that

367
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
the armory was a decision
from a group of people.

368
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,320
When it was time to pay the piper,
where were those people?

369
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,800
In order to protect them,

370
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,760
my father brought
the secret of the armory to his death

371
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
while they stayed out of it.

372
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,960
When my family was banished
from the Healer Valley

373
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,640
and hunted by the martial arts world,
where were they?

374
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,200
They could retaliate in kind.

375
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,800
Why couldn't I?

376
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,920
Lao Wen.

377
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,960
All these years,

378
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,880
I have been living

379
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,560
only for revenge.

380
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,080
But when I regretted it,

381
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,000
what's done can't be undone.

382
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,200
Ah Xu.

383
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,960
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

384
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,240
But even if you can forgive me,

385
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,960
how could I face Chengling?

386
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,480
Even though I didn't kill them,

387
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,080
they're dead because of me.

388
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,880
What I did to Chengling

389
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,560
is no different from what

390
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,560
the Five Lakes Alliance did to me.

391
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,800
Then answer me.

392
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
Do you know who exactly wiped out

393
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,480
the Mirror Lake Sect?

394
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,680
Maybe there was a traitor
in the Ghost Valley

395
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,840
or someone trying to frame us.

396
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,360
-Anyway--
-Enough.

397
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,240
After the Great Shaman

398
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,120
cures me of this shitty sickness,

399
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,160
let's find out the truth together

400
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,520
and avenge the Zhang family.

401
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,360
When that day comes,

402
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,080
you can explain it to Chengling.

403
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,000
But

404
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,440
if he hates you and blames you then,

405
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,760
you should still accept it.

406
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,200
You don't want to face it.

407
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,400
But can you really avoid it?

408
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,080
Whatever your identity is,

409
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,040
you are still my junior.

410
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,200
When you're done with your bath,

411
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,520
make a good meal

412
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,920
for me and Chengling.

413
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,120
Life is about three meals a day.

414
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,320
Why do we need to worry
about eternal sorrow?

415
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,040
Don't create trouble for ourselves.

416
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,880
Godfather,

417
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,200
I've got some strange news.

418
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,960
The maid of Wen Kexing,
the Amethyst Fiend, Gu Xiang,

419
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,440
followed Cao Weining to Mount Qingfeng.

420
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,120
I sent some people to investigate this
and found out

421
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,440
that after the Heroes Conference,

422
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,920
the Gentle Wind Sword Sect
sealed off the mountain.

423
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,280
So far, no one has been seen
coming in or out.

424
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,440
And Mo Huaiyang

425
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,800
has also isolated himself for half a year.

426
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,200
No one has seen him.

427
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,440
Godfather!

428
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,480
WHEN YOU ARE TRANQUIL,
YOU CAN BE AT EASE

429
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,880
I've been writing all morning.

430
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,960
This is the only piece of work
I am most satisfied with.

431
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,560
Xie'er,

432
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,400
you should keep this.

433
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,000
Godfather, I'm talking
about something serious.

434
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,120
I want to go to
the Gentle Wind Sword Sect for inspection.

435
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,600
For what?

436
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,160
The notice for the reopening
of the Heroes Conference

437
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,480
has been sent
all over the martial arts world.

438
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,520
I'm sure

439
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,480
that as Gao Chong's best friend,
Mo Huaiyang will attend the conference.

440
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,720
There is no need to make a fuss
at this juncture.

441
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,000
That's why

442
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,400
I have to figure things out
before it starts.

443
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,480
Wen Kexing is quite mysterious.

444
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,040
Why did he send his trusted subordinate

445
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,200
to be with the disciple
of the Gentle Wind Sword Sect?

446
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,120
There's something odd about it.

447
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,840
There's no need to investigate it.

448
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,160
I have long guessed
that Gao Chong's three Glazed Armors

449
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,960
are possibly kept by Mo Huaiyang.

450
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,960
But

451
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,040
Wen Kexing was quick to realize it.

452
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,200
Despite Mo Huaiyang
and Gao Chong's friendship,

453
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,520
Mo Huaiyang, who had clearly arrived
at the Yueyang Sect,

454
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,640
left without a word
before the conference commenced.

455
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,440
This is the first point.

456
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,000
Fan Huaikong attended
the conference for him

457
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,120
but turned a blind eye
to Gao Chong's death.

458
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,440
This is the second point.

459
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,760
HALL OF VIRTUE

460
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,200
And in the past few months,

461
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,480
there has been no news
of the Glazed Armor.

462
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,160
This is the third point.

463
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,000
What's even more ridiculous is that
as soon as he went back,

464
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,000
this idiot sealed off
the mountain at once.

465
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,440
Wasn't he giving himself away?

466
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,200
Godfather.

467
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,800
Since you already knew it,

468
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,360
why didn't you tell me?

469
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,840
Tomorrow morning,

470
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,160
I will wipe out
the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

471
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,400
See? You're acting like this again.

472
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,760
You little barbarian.

473
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,680
Mo Huaiyang is excellent in martial arts.

474
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,080
We have no idea how powerful he is
after ten years of seclusion.

475
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,280
If we are not sure,

476
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,880
we might wake a sleeping wolf.

477
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,160
I'm not going to fight him alone.

478
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,760
Even if he is extremely powerful,

479
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,760
he can't avoid being hit below the belt.

480
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,600
As a last resort,

481
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,040
I'll take a group of Drug Men

482
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,560
and turn the Gentle Wind Sword Sect

483
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,520
into a dead realm.

484
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,480
Xie'er,

485
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,160
I remember telling you

486
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,520
to destroy all the Drug Men.

487
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
Did you take my words

488
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,400
for nothing?

489
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,840
HALL OF VIRTUE

490
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,960
The Scorpion Sect lives by assassinating,

491
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,360
which has already been
a taboo of the martial world.

492
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,640
What's more, you use demon tricks
to control people's minds

493
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,200
and make the living
into Drug Men as weapons.

494
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,120
You'll be punished by heaven
for doing such unforgivable deeds!

495
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,960
But my demon tricks
also helped you take down Gao Chong!

496
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,000
Godfather, trust me.

497
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,360
I'll prove myself.

498
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,880
Why don't you get it?

499
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,480
If people know

500
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,120
I have something to do
with any demon tricks,

501
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,520
my reputation will be in shreds
and I will be sieged by everyone!

502
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,160
Not to mention the position
of the chief of the martial arts world.

503
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,680
Everything I've been working
so hard for so many years

504
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,440
will be ruined!

505
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,800
You…

506
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,360
You finally said it.

507
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,560
HALL OF VIRTUE

508
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,840
There is no unity between father and son.

509
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,920
When I'm useful,

510
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,200
I'm your beloved son.

511
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,720
When I'm not,

512
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,680
I'll be kicked away, right?

513
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,040
If you think that way,

514
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,120
I have nothing to say.

515
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,480
But my dear Xie'er,

516
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,720
I'm warning you.

517
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,320
If what you have done

518
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,160
ruins all my hard work--

519
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,480
What? Are you going to kill me?

520
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,440
You…

521
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,520
All right.

522
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,240
Since you saved me,

523
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,320
you can take my life back if you want it.

524
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,080
You unfilial son!

525
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,960
Look at what's hanging around your neck.

526
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,800
Open your eyes and see!

527
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,640
I left my most precious thing to you.

528
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,880
How can you say something like that?

529
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,080
Xie'er.

530
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,200
You've let me down!

531
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,840
Get out!

532
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,880
It turns out

533
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,040
that I'm also a gambler.

534
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,480
How did it go?

535
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,440
What did Weixu tell you?

536
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,440
Nothing, just some matters about our sect.

537
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,480
Don't worry.

538
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,160
Did Mr. Wen and Mr. Zhou
arrive at the Four Seasons Manor safely?

539
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,120
Yes.

540
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,800
What's in the letter?

541
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,800
Nothing. They just wanted to tell us
that they have safely arrived.

542
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,360
-Let me see it.
-No.

543
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,280
Why should I let you?

544
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,199
Don't you know that my master
always acts like a lunatic

545
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,440
and says nothing serious?

546
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,239
If I show you,
you'll follow the bad example.

547
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Ah Xiang,
you can't judge Mr. Wen like that.

548
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,360
Normal people are narrow-minded

549
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,840
and only look on the surface.

550
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,920
So they would think
that Mr. Wen and Mr. Zhou

551
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,239
are not nice people.

552
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,320
But in my heart,

553
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,600
Mr. Wen and Mr. Zhou
are both upright and free.

554
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,120
They are brilliant soul mates.

555
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,280
People misunderstand them.

556
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,639
All right, I'm wrong.

557
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,679
Cao Weining.

558
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,080
You didn't tell the identities
of my master and Zhou Xu

559
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,199
to anyone, did you?

560
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,199
Of course not.

561
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,800
I have promised you.

562
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,560
Besides, my masters are not laities.

563
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,360
They won't believe the rumors,

564
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,560
nor will they have
any negative opinion of you.

565
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:07,560
BREEZE PAVILION

566
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,400
Chengling, here. Have some tea.

567
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,640
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

568
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,120
Master, it's so spicy.

569
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,240
Lao Wen.

570
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,360
You are really mean.

571
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,000
You tricked me into eating
spicy food a few days ago.

572
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,920
Since it's your tradition in Kun
to play tricks on people,

573
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,600
why shouldn't I
return the favor like this?

574
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,760
Do you want more?

575
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,120
My lord, it's nice to meet you.

576
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,280
Ping'an.

577
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,120
Is the Great Shaman here?

578
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,320
I'm sorry, my lord,

579
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,720
the Great Shaman needs a few more days.

580
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,680
He is trying to make you a magic medicine.

581
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
Does he have a method
to cure the sickness?

582
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,000
I dare not guess, Master Wen.

583
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,360
But it should be helpful.

584
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,880
My master said as long as it goes well,

585
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,520
they should be able to arrive in time
for the Spring Festival.

586
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,320
In such a cold winter…

587
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,560
I really appreciate his help.

588
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,560
Master Ye wrote again.

589
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,720
Please have a look.

590
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,520
TO ZISHU OF THE FOUR SEASONS MANOR

591
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
WIPE OUT THE EVIL GHOSTS
TO CLEAR THE WORLD

592
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,680
TOKEN OF HONOR

593
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,480
Master, this pattern

594
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,640
is the Token of Honor.

595
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,840
Mr. Gao and Master Ye
kept one respectively before.

596
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,040
Master Ye is leading
the reopening of the Heroes Conference

597
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,280
to wipe out the Ghost Valley.

598
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,560
That's great, Master.

599
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,000
Can we join them?

600
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,800
Ah Xu,

601
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,160
why are you up so late?

602
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,240
You've had difficulty
sleeping recently, right?

603
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,400
Drunk Like a Dream is dried out

604
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,760
and can be used as medicine
after being powdered.

605
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,720
Drunk Like a Dream in the manor

606
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,080
has been kept for so long

607
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,440
that the drug properties have worn off.

608
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
Let me help you.

609
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,440
Are you crazy?

610
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,600
Aren't you grinding medicine?

611
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,960
This can't cure your madness.

612
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,320
All right, let me clean it up for you.

613
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,560
How childish.

614
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,720
Don't think that I don't know
what you're thinking.

615
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,880
If you ever make a decision
without my knowledge again,

616
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,720
I'll slap you in the face!

617
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,320
I don't dare to.

618
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,000
I have long known

619
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,160
that there will be a battle
between good and evil someday.

620
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,600
That's why I made Ah Xiang
and the others leave.

621
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,880
Apart from that,

622
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,400
whether the righteous people are going
to wipe out the Ghost Valley or not,

623
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,360
it has nothing to do with me.

624
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,640
Letting these evil ghosts
and monsters perish early

625
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,080
will do no harm to the world.

626
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,440
So what are you worried about?

627
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,280
Ah Xu.

628
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,360
How long do I have to keep this
a secret from Chengling?

629
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,120
Since it was your doing,

630
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,320
I'm also responsible.

631
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,760
What else can we do?

632
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,760
Nothing but just keeping it a secret.

633
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,600
After I am cured,

634
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,480
we'll find the killer
who wiped out the Mirror Lake Sect

635
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,320
and then confess to Chengling together.

636
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,120
We're in the same boat anyway

637
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,080
and we can't leave each other.

638
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,000
However, why has my Chief Wen,

639
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,840
who was once a merciless man,

640
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,040
suddenly become so sentimental?

641
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,520
You're even feeling sorry
for keeping a secret from a kid.

642
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,680
You lied to me for so long.

643
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,080
How would you explain this?

644
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,880
Ah Xu, you are really good
at grinding medicine.

645
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,280
I feel sleepy as soon as I smell it.
I'm going to bed.

646
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,440
-You should rest early too.
-You should smell it more then!

647
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,840
Don't stay up too late!

648
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,400
For the chief of evil ghosts,

649
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,960
once he finds the way
back to the human world,

650
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,520
he'll become human again.

651
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,960
An ordinary and sentimental man

652
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,200
will yearn for days
without secrets and haze

653
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,720
and hope that there will be someone

654
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,680
to accompany him forever.
