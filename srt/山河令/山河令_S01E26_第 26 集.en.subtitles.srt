1
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,560
Why are you abusing Zhen Yiguo?

2
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,160
Is this your dog?

3
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,840
My senior left it to me.

4
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,960
Yiguo?

5
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,320
What a good name!

6
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,000
Let me cook it

7
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,440
and see if it can fill a pot.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,919
Give it to me.

9
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,400
No!

10
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,520
No? We'll take it!

11
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,120
Where are you going to run now?

12
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,280
Stay back!

13
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,280
Give it to me!

14
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,200
Hold him!

15
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,560
Good dog, run!

16
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,280
Run back home and find your mother!

17
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,440
Zhen Yiguo?

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,920
Let go of me!

19
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,600
Go home.

20
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Thank you.

21
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,360
Little boy,

22
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,760
is Zhen your family name?

23
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
No, it's not.

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,760
You are mistaken.

25
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,080
Why did Ah Xu's Drunk Like a Dream

26
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,680
lead me to such a weird dream?

27
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,360
EVERLASTING

28
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,840
Little brat.

29
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,400
Mr. Wen,

30
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,560
you woke up so early.

31
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,320
What's the time now?

32
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,560
I've practiced Eight Trigram Palm
more than fifty times.

33
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,880
It's about seven in the morning.

34
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,880
Why did you wake up so early?

35
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,280
I woke up at the first crowing

36
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,880
and I couldn't get back to sleep.

37
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,400
So I decided to practice martial arts.

38
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,000
Why are you trying so hard?

39
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,440
I keep having dreams
and I couldn't sleep well.

40
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,440
When I think about the evil things
that the Ghost Valley has done

41
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,200
and the people who lost
their families like me,

42
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,520
I just can't eat and sleep well.

43
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,040
I hope that in just one night,

44
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,440
I can become as good as you and Master

45
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,000
so I can kill those bastards.

46
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,520
If the Ghost Valley
doesn't exist in this world,

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,640
there won't be
so many miserable things happening.

48
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,320
More haste, less speed.

49
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,200
No matter how hard you try,

50
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,120
martial arts skills
can't just be acquired overnight.

51
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,320
Your master has some incense
that can help you sleep.

52
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,920
I'll get some for you tonight.

53
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,640
You're still growing.

54
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,800
You need to get enough sleep.

55
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,800
You exerted your strength wrongly.

56
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,160
That's why your arms were not powerful.

57
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,400
The Eight Trigram Palm emphasizes
the central waist and vital energy.

58
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,200
It's also the key to most fighting skills.

59
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,400
Little brat.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,240
Loosen your shoulders, lower your elbows,

61
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,320
and brace your belly.

62
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,760
Didn't someone say he was an outsider

63
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,760
and refused to teach him?

64
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,840
It's none of your business.

65
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,360
Master, I'll answer the door.

66
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
Who are you?

67
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,280
I'm from Ping'an Silver Manor.

68
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,840
Mr. Ye ordered me

69
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,320
to deliver a letter
to the Four Seasons Manor.

70
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,720
VENOMOUS TEMPLE

71
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,720
Scorpion King.

72
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,880
That damned Brochure of Ghosts
contains all the information about us.

73
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,560
From the chief of the valley
to the Ten Devils.

74
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,520
Even our skills, schools, origins,

75
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,480
and all the things we've done are on it.

76
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,160
It's as if we're ripping our pants off

77
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,960
and showing ourselves to everyone.

78
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,160
If it goes around
in the martial arts world,

79
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,400
we can hardly do anything anymore.

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,080
What Brochure of Ghosts?

81
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,360
The Five Lakes Alliance is distributing
brochures about the ghosts to all sects.

82
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,960
What's going on?

83
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,800
If this is the case,

84
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,040
how can we work
for Chief Zhao like this outside?

85
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,320
I remember.

86
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,000
There is indeed such a thing.

87
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,200
But what's wrong with that?

88
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,840
Before you go out, just find someone

89
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,720
who is good at making disguises

90
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,400
to change your appearance.

91
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,240
Perhaps

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
you'll look much better.

93
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,120
Happy Ghost!

94
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,040
Besides,

95
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,520
with such a reputation,

96
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,080
don't you want to be
as notorious as possible?

97
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,800
Godfather is helping you with that!

98
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Isn't it a good thing?

99
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,600
-You bastard!
-Hey!

100
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,280
The alliance of two powers,

101
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,840
they'll sustain if they work well.

102
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,640
If not, it breaks.

103
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,320
If Chief Zhao is trying to use
this kind of despicable means

104
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
to force us to the corner,

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,440
isn't that too awful?

106
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,000
Today,

107
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,200
I heard something really ridiculous.

108
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,520
You evil ghosts

109
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,240
call someone else despicable?

110
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,960
That is so funny!

111
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,000
All right.

112
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,840
If that is the case,

113
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,720
we'll just leave now.

114
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,880
The martial arts world is vast.

115
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,920
We'll find another place to serve.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,840
Do you dare?

117
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,480
Why not?

118
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
I think it makes sense.

119
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,440
If they work well, it'll sustain.

120
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,000
If not, it breaks.

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,160
If you don't want to stay,

122
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,240
then

123
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
why should I keep you?

124
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's go!

125
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,640
See them out.

126
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,520
Your Majesty.

127
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,720
What are you planning
with Chief Zhao again?

128
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,160
Mind your words.

129
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

130
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,120
By the way, Your Majesty,

131
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,280
we received a letter from Liu Qianqiao.

132
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,400
It's about how to make
the Soup of Oblivion.

133
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,320
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

134
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,559
PING'AN SILVER MANOR

135
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,240
PING'AN SILVER MANOR

136
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,560
Sir.

137
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,080
A servant from your manor told me

138
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,640
that I've received a letter.

139
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,960
Just a moment, please.

140
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,240
SAFE AND SOUND

141
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,880
Greetings from Ping'an, Lord Zhou.

142
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,800
Ping'an, why are you here in Kun?

143
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,840
Are you running this manor?

144
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,360
That's beyond what I'm capable of.
Please have a seat, Lord Zhou.

145
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm just overseeing the 56 sub-manors
in the Central Plain for Prince Qi.

146
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,560
Ruyi is overseeing
four or five more branches in Nanjiang.

147
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,280
The Ping'an Silver Manors
are all over the world.

148
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,240
I didn't expect
that your master would own them.

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,440
How could a man like him

150
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,280
do business related to money?

151
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,680
That's what you don't know.

152
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,080
Although our manor
deals with financial businesses,

153
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,960
it mainly gathers information
on the Central Plain for the Great Shaman.

154
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,240
We're using the mechanical birds
that you taught him to make.

155
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,680
Thanks to this precious gift,

156
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,000
I got the news

157
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,880
that Prince Qi was on his way to Kun
and had arrived before him.

158
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,120
Prince Qi is coming to Kun?

159
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,080
Lord Zhou,

160
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,680
didn't you send Mr. Ye
to visit the Great Shaman?

161
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,800
Prince Qi was told that
you are in poor health.

162
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,240
So he decided to come to Kun
along with the Great Shaman at once.

163
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,440
That's nonsense.

164
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,960
Why would he come to the Central Plain?

165
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,280
It's fine.

166
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,960
Lord Zhou, Prince Qi will be with
the Great Shaman and many bodyguards.

167
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,880
Moreover,

168
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,320
Kun is a remote place,

169
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,880
far beyond the reach of Prince Jin.

170
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
What is this?

171
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,800
Ah Xu, are you familiar with

172
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,400
the person invited by Ye Baiyi?

173
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,920
They're more than
familiar with each other.

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,520
They have a lifelong friendship.

175
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,680
Lord Zhou, honestly,

176
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,680
all these years,

177
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,960
you haven't sent any messages
to my master.

178
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,400
Now, when you are in need of help,

179
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,800
why did you ask someone else
to deliver the message?

180
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,840
You should go to Nanjiang yourself.

181
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,520
My master misses you a lot
after all these years.

182
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
By the way,

183
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,760
this is the letter from Mr. Ye.

184
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,240
YOU JERK

185
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,000
What does Master Ye mean?

186
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,640
Why did he write a letter to scold you?

187
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,120
I'll see you during the winter solstice.

188
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,120
I want dumplings

189
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,720
with cabbage and pork stuffing.

190
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,080
This letter…

191
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,600
What does it mean?

192
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,040
Prince Qi and the Great Shaman

193
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,760
are collecting
some precious medicine in Nanjiang.

194
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,760
Mr. Ye couldn't wait that long,

195
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,320
so he decided to come back first

196
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,280
and sent this letter
through the sub-manors in the south.

197
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,520
Thank you, Ping'an.

198
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,040
WANG'S OIL SHOP

199
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,400
Master, who is the Great Shaman?

200
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,880
And who is Prince Qi?

201
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,040
Are they the people

202
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,800
Master Ye has invited to heal you?

203
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,120
That's nonsense.

204
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,040
If I knew that his old friend
is the Great Shaman,

205
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,440
I'd spare his trip there.

206
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,720
You haven't told us

207
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,480
who those two people are.

208
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,200
They are my old friends in Jin.

209
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,280
They used to work for Prince Jin.

210
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,520
But later, they were disappointed
by Prince Jin,

211
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,720
so they went to Nanjiang

212
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,600
and never came back.

213
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,760
Can they heal you?

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,360
The Great Shaman has good medical skills

215
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,200
and knows a lot
about the secret witchcraft of Nanjiang.

216
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,480
Prince Qi usually thinks it through
before he acts.

217
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,880
If they decide to come,

218
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,240
then they must be confident.

219
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,840
Isn't this a good thing?

220
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,320
If you are old friends,
why didn't we ask for their help earlier?

221
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,360
Earlier?

222
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,040
I didn't want to live.

223
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,680
Master,

224
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,960
why did Master Ye curse in the letter?

225
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,120
Little idiot,

226
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,600
don't you get it yet?

227
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,320
That Old Monster

228
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,640
took such a long journey
to Nanjiang to look for physicians.

229
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,160
After meeting the Great Shaman,

230
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,480
he found out that

231
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,240
the legendary figure
who would hardly accept his invitation

232
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
owed your master a favor.

233
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
The great Changming Sword Immortal

234
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,320
eventually proved to be an errand boy.

235
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,000
A man like him

236
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,680
would feel so embarrassed.

237
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,080
Being scolded is actually a mercy.

238
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,440
What's the problem then?

239
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,080
In the end, Master Ye is the one
who invited the Great Shaman.

240
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,480
No matter whose favor it is,

241
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,760
as long as Master can be healed,
it's perfect.

242
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,040
Isn't that right, Master Wen?

243
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,520
Ma'am,

244
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,480
do you have any other color
for this cloth?

245
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,680
Here it is.

246
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,840
Look at this one. It's pretty good.

247
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,680
-I don't think this color…
-Ah Xu.

248
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,160
Since we don't
go down the mountain very often,

249
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,760
-Do you have other choices?
-I have to go around and see

250
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,520
if there's a painter
who can do the repairing.

251
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,360
-Can you take Chengling back first?
-Thank you.

252
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,480
-Sure. Come back soon.
-It's all right. Have a good day.

253
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,080
We need you to cook our dinner.

254
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,560
What on earth?

255
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,800
Am I your servant?

256
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,240
Aren't you?

257
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,440
Chengling.

258
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,080
Let's get some rest.
We're going to leave soon.

259
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,000
All right.

260
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,000
The chief is coming!

261
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,280
The chief is coming!

262
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,800
I've found Chief!

263
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,960
The chief is here!

264
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,280
I've found Chief!

265
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,640
I've found Chief.

266
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,840
-Chief.
-The chief is here.

267
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,040
-Chief.
-Chief.

268
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,560
-Chief.
-Chief.

269
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,800
Chief, we've finally found you.

270
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,240
Do you know how hard our life has been
for the past few days?

271
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,080
Like rats on the street,

272
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,840
we were chased by everyone!

273
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,160
Show me the Brochure of Ghosts.

274
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,360
BROCHURE OF GHOSTS

275
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,400
WINE

276
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Now,

277
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,240
almost everyone

278
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,280
in all sects has a copy of this.

279
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,040
My goodness!

280
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,600
The whole world is looking for us.

281
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
They have almost found
every one of us scattered

282
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,480
here and there in the martial arts world.

283
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,040
I'm so lucky

284
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,560
that I got to save
these young girls and men.

285
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,920
We've been hiding in the wilderness

286
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,640
while looking for you, Chief.

287
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,800
I've become skinny due to starvation.

288
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,040
If it wasn't because
Gu Xiang took in Yun Zai

289
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,600
who's not in the brochure

290
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,800
and can go out to run the errands,

291
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,520
I wouldn't be able to see you again.

292
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,200
The Ten Devils.

293
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,040
How many of them are left?

294
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,640
What?

295
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,800
It…

296
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,680
Chief, didn't you know?

297
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,040
I heard that one sect
has been destroying another sect

298
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,520
and the other was destroyed
by another one.

299
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,000
It's said that the Ghost Valley did it.

300
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,080
I thought it was done by you
and the Ten Devils.

301
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,640
So that wasn't the case?

302
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,600
Have you heard from
the Master of the Unfaithful List?

303
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,040
No.

304
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,200
Ever since

305
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,400
Tragicomic Ghost was abducted

306
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,240
before the Heroes Conference started,

307
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,920
I haven't heard from her or Beauty Ghost.

308
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,320
By the way, Chief,

309
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,320
I heard that those high-born bastards

310
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,080
were trying to recommence

311
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,880
that damn Heroes Conference.

312
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,840
My goodness.

313
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,960
They really don't know their places,

314
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,280
like monkeys trying to claim
the throne of the wilderness.

315
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,680
Thank goodness you showed up in time.

316
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,880
Let's return to the Ghost Valley now

317
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,240
to prepare for defense

318
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,680
and teach them a lesson!

319
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,880
-Kill them!
-Kill them!

320
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,600
Master Wen!

321
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,280
What is it?

322
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,440
Master Wen, you've finally returned.

323
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,079
I'm starving.

324
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,040
And you just wait until I come back?

325
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,960
Can't you make some noodles first?

326
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
No. we can't.

327
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,079
How did it go? Did you find a painter?

328
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,440
Not at the foot of the mountain.

329
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,000
I heard that a painter had just returned
from Chang'an to Qingshui Town.

330
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,560
I'll visit him with the painting soon.

331
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,080
Ah Xu.

332
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,360
Shall I teach you how to cook?

333
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,760
I won't come back in time
to prepare meals that day.

334
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,920
No, thank you.

335
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,800
A sage once said,

336
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,360
"A nobleman should stay away
from the kitchen."

337
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,840
Don't worry.

338
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,200
We won't be starved.

339
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,800
If there are no other choices,

340
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,840
I'll take Chengling to the town for food.

341
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,560
Fine.

342
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,280
Call me when dinner is ready.

343
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,040
All right, Old Zhou.

344
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,160
Take your time.

345
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,480
Master Wen, what is it?

346
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,080
It's nothing.

347
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,040
It's getting dark.

348
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,080
"The sunset is so sublime,

349
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,360
yet sadly it's in its demise."

350
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,960
Chengling, what do you want
for dinner tonight?

351
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,840
I'll cook for you.

352
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,320
Greetings, Scorpion King.

353
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Didn't I send someone

354
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,360
to tell you about
the solution to the venom?

355
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,320
VENOMOUS TEMPLE

356
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,680
Why did you come back?

357
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,440
I've changed my mind.

358
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,960
It has been an honor to serve you.

359
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,040
I am willing to be your servant,

360
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,120
as long as…

361
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,440
As long as you release my master,
Tragicomic Ghost, and…

362
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,040
And Yu Qiufeng.

363
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,800
Scorpion King, I'm begging you.

364
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,800
Enough.

365
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,440
I don't want to hear empty words.

366
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,840
No merit,

367
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,360
no reward.

368
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,320
I can promise you that I won't kill them,

369
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,560
but I can't let them go

370
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,840
with just your words.

371
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,440
Of course,

372
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,600
if you can prove yourself useful,

373
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,840
I will not mistreat you.

374
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,320
Rise now.

375
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,600
Thank you, Scorpion King.

376
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,280
However,

377
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,280
if it wasn't for the recipe
that you gave me,

378
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,440
I wouldn't find out

379
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,920
that the Soup of Oblivion
is made of orange daylily.

380
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,320
Scorpion King, you mean…

381
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,200
Have you heard of

382
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,960
something called Drunk Like a Dream?

383
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,320
There's a plant in Kun
named orange daylily.

384
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,240
The mixture of seven kinds of
poisonous insects with the orange daylily

385
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,160
makes the Soup of Oblivion.

386
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,880
It can make you forget
the things you're most infatuated with.

387
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,920
If you add seven kinds
of scented flower to it…

388
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,560
It will produce Drunk Like a Dream.

389
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,880
They are like the two sides of a coin,

390
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,560
which reinforce,
but also counteract each other.

391
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,200
A large dose of Drunk Like a Dream

392
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,600
can counteract the effect
of the Soup of Oblivion

393
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,600
and reveal the sealed memories.

394
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,560
Scorpion King, are you going to…

395
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,080
Tragicomic Ghost doesn't have
a sound mind right now.

396
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,800
To avoid using large doses

397
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,560
which might damage her brain,

398
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,720
I used incense

399
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,360
so the medicine
would be absorbed gradually

400
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,080
and reach the level we need.

401
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,040
You are here just in time.

402
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,000
She has been in the medical room
for seven days.

403
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,080
I think she'll wake up soon.

404
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,440
And I'll know the truth soon.

405
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,640
All those words are just rumors.

406
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,600
Godfather will not deceive me.

407
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,520
Yes.

408
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,680
After Tragicomic Ghost reveals the truth,

409
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,040
his name will be cleared.

410
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,960
That's why I'm doing this.

411
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,360
Your Gentle Wind Sword Sect

412
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,000
is located in a desolate place like this.

413
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,960
How smart of you!

414
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,360
If I were a thief,

415
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,280
I wouldn't bother to come
and steal from you.

416
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,400
Ah Xiang, cut it out.

417
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Who is the one saying

418
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,840
that Mount Qingfeng is desolate?

419
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,680
Little idiot.

420
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,960
Master Fan!

421
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,760
Brat.

422
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
Master Fan!

423
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,840
Master Fan and Weixu. You are all here.

424
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,360
I finally got to meet you!
I really miss you!

425
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
You've finally returned.

426
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
You're just in time
for the Spring Festival.

427
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
How is everyone?

428
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,000
How's my master?

429
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,600
Did everyone miss me?

430
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,000
I want to ask you something. Be honest.

431
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,200
How did you trick this little girl
into coming with you?

432
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,000
-I--
-My name is Gu Xiang.

433
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,320
It's nice to meet you.

434
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,560
Ah Xiang.

435
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,760
It's nice to meet you.
My name is Mo Weixu.

436
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,480
I'm Cao Weining's senior disciple.

437
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,600
This is the elder of our sect,
Fan Huaikong.

438
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,920
You may call him Master Fan
as Weining does.

439
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,400
Master Fan.

440
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,560
Master Fan, it's nice to meet you.

441
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,600
Weixu, it's nice to meet you.

442
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,160
Everyone, it's nice to meet you!

443
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,880
-It's nice to meet you too.
-It's nice to meet you too.

444
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,960
I'm wondering

445
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,240
where you found her?

446
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,760
She looks foolish.

447
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,760
I'm not foolish!

448
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,560
-You're not?
-Yes.

449
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,760
If you aren't,
then how were you tricked to be here

450
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,400
by my foolish nephew?

451
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,880
He thinks you are foolish.

452
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,800
-Me?
-You're the fool!

453
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,240
Weining.

454
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,520
Is this your fiancée that
you mentioned in the letter?

455
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,280
Great. Good for you!

456
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,440
I'm not.

457
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,920
Cao Weining, what did you tell them?

458
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,920
Nothing.

459
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
A fierce fiancée.

460
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,200
Weining.

461
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,360
You're going to suffer.

462
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,320
Stop it, Master Fan.
Don't make fun of her.

463
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,360
She's timid.

464
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,880
Gu Xiang, please don't mind us.

465
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,640
We make jokes like this all the time.

466
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,120
Miss, we were just joking.

467
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,640
Weining spoke highly of you in his letter.

468
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,800
We knew you would be here this morning,

469
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,560
so we have cleaned
a small villa for you at the hillside.

470
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,760
Master Fan,

471
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,200
can't Ah Xiang stay with me
up in the mountain?

472
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Miss.

473
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,000
Our leader just gave an order
to seal off the mountain,

474
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,400
so we can't receive guests.

475
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,080
We came down here just for you.

476
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,240
Seal off the mountain?

477
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,080
Master Fan, is it because of--

478
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,440
Miss, let's take a look at the villa

479
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,160
and see if you like it.

480
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,400
Let's go.

481
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,680
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

482
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,160
-Come.
-Let's go.

483
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,080
-Go.
-Go.

484
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,840
The issue with the Eagle Claw Clan
and the Mount Hua Sect…

485
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,600
I'll leave it to you this time, Chief Sha.

486
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,080
No problem.

487
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,680
If this time, Cao Gang…

488
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,640
Chiefs, let's call it a day.

489
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,920
Thank you for your work.

490
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,760
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

491
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,520
PROFOUND EXPECTATIONS

492
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,600
How many times have I told you

493
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,720
-not to come to the front hall?
-Why?

494
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,360
Those lackeys

495
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,960
know about me anyway.

496
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,720
Why are you afraid of them?

497
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,840
-The less trouble the better.
-Godfather.

498
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,600
When your status was insecure,

499
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,320
you had to hide your connection
with the Scorpion Sect.

500
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,360
I understand that.

501
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,040
But now you are in power,

502
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,840
why can't I stand by your side?

503
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,440
Things are not settled yet.

504
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,720
There are still variables!

505
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,200
When will things be settled then?

506
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,240
Such bullshit

507
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,160
may be enough to fool
those idiots in the Ghost Valley.

508
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,600
But you're now avoiding me
using the same reason.

509
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,280
Are you insulting me?

510
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,960
Xie'er,

511
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,400
what's wrong with you today?

512
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,560
Did you hear something?

513
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,520
Or did I make a mistake?

514
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,640
Xie'er,

515
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,560
I know.

516
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,040
I had you support me in the dark before

517
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,360
because of the hostile situation.

518
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,760
I have wronged you.

519
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,800
But I didn't expect you

520
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,160
to be so capable

521
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,640
that you managed
to make the Scorpion Sect,

522
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,560
an assassin organization,
as influential as the Window of Heaven.

523
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,200
I'm so glad.

524
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,680
That's why…

525
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,760
I feel that I'm indebted to you.

526
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,440
I've worked hard

527
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,640
cautiously and conscientiously

528
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,360
for our cause.

529
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,640
I have no children

530
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,720
and you are my closest kin.

531
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,600
Who else…

532
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,760
can I entrust

533
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,080
my achievements to except you?

534
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,960
In the future,

535
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,960
you can be wayward
or lose your temper once in a while.

536
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,560
I can take it.

537
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
But please don't hurt my heart

538
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,640
with those cold words.

539
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,880
All right?

540
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,240
Godfather.

541
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,680
Why did you lie to me?

542
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,640
What did I lie to you?

543
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,360
What's with, "You won't fail me

544
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,160
and I won't fail you"?

545
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,400
YOU WON'T FAIL ME AND I WON'T FAIL YOU.

546
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,520
How did you get this?

547
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,480
Yu Qiufeng sent it to me.

548
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,960
Godfather.

549
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,440
Is this your writing?

550
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,240
Yu Qiufeng.

551
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,280
He's pushing me into a corner?

552
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,320
BREEZE PAVILION

553
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,640
Here. Have more.

554
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,000
-Here.
-Thank you, Weixu.

555
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,240
-Thank you.
-Here.

556
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,280
-Here.
-Thank you.

557
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,080
Have more.

558
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,320
You must be tired from the journey.

559
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,480
Don't be nervous.

560
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,120
Make yourself at home.

561
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,800
Yes, make yourself at home.

562
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,600
Miss.

563
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,880
I can tell you have learned
some martial arts,

564
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,680
just like us.

565
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,560
Which sect do you belong to?

566
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,440
I'm not a disciple of any sect.

567
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,440
I'm only a maid.

568
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,840
My master taught me

569
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,920
some basic skills and that's it.

570
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,920
Ah Xiang, don't be too humble.

571
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,120
Master Fan, her master is--

572
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,240
Eat more.

573
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,360
All right, I will.

574
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,760
Please forgive me, Master Fan.

575
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,240
My master leads a reclusive life.

576
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,680
He has a strange temper.

577
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,560
I'm not allowed to say his name.

578
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,320
Master Fan,

579
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,000
there are different kinds of people
in the martial arts world.

580
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,360
It's understandable, right?

581
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,400
Yes.

582
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,680
Do you have any family?

583
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,920
No.

584
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,520
I'm an orphan

585
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,840
brought up by my master.

586
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,480
But he doesn't want me anymore.

587
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,000
It doesn't matter.

588
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,640
You are an orphan just like our Weining.

589
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,920
Both of you had a miserable life.

590
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,640
It's all right.
You don't have a family now.

591
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,760
But in the future,

592
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,560
you can dedicate yourself
to one of your own.

593
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,400
It's a pity that the timing is not right.

594
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,120
If we don't have to seal off the mountain,

595
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,160
I'll choose a day

596
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,200
for you to get married

597
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,960
after the Spring Festival.

598
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,560
Master Fan,
why do we seal off the mountain?

599
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,360
Have some dinner first.

600
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,080
Ah Xiang, have some more.

601
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,760
Yes, eat up.

602
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,840
I did have an affair

603
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,600
with Tragicomic Ghost, Luo Fumeng.

604
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,200
At that time,

605
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,840
she was the princess of the Neon Palace

606
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,840
and I was only a poor boy from
the declining branch of the Zhao family.

607
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,600
Her family opposed our marriage

608
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
and grounded her.

609
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,960
She sent me

610
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,560
this bloodletter at that time…

611
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,240
to show me her decision.

612
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,360
You two…

613
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,800
once loved each other.

614
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,720
Then why did you fail her?

615
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,200
It was because of that vicious Li Yao.

616
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,040
Mother?

617
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,280
I told you
that you aren't allowed to call her that!

618
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,120
She was just a wench!

619
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,720
You don't know what she did to me!

620
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,840
GREAT AMBITIONS

621
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,880
Back then, she was from a noble family
and loved me a lot.

622
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,640
I really appreciated that.

623
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,480
I'm the one who should be blamed

624
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,880
for not refusing her in time.

625
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,720
So when

626
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,680
Fumeng and I were about to overcome
all the difficulties

627
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,160
and get married,

628
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,880
she threatened me with my involvement

629
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,800
in stealing in the armory.

630
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,360
She demanded that I must go with her

631
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,560
and break up with Fumeng.

632
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,440
Xie'er.

633
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,840
If I was the only one behind that,

634
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,880
I would not compromise.

635
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,120
But it involved so many people

636
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,800
and I couldn't get my friends in trouble.

637
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,240
So I endured this humiliation

638
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,480
and married into her family.

639
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,040
Godfather, do you know that

640
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,640
on the day of your wedding,

641
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,280
Luo Fumeng went crazy
and slaughtered the entire Neon Palace?

642
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,120
Do you know

643
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,760
why no one has heard of her since then?

644
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,960
It was because I tried so hard to find her

645
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,280
and sent her to the Healer Valley
for treatment.

646
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,840
But when I was trying to subdue her,

647
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,040
I was badly hurt by her.

648
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,160
I can't make any progress
in martial arts since then.

649
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,960
I've ruined her life.

650
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,640
If it wasn't for me,

651
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,520
she wouldn't end up

652
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,800
in such a poor condition like this.

653
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,360
Xie'er.

654
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,760
This is

655
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,920
the most painful memory

656
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,560
and the biggest humiliation of my life.

657
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,840
I planned to take it to my grave.

658
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,560
But since you want to know,

659
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,040
I'm telling you about it now.

660
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,960
There's another reason

661
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,080
for hiding it from you.

662
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,480
I killed Li Yao as well.

663
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,920
I knew it.

664
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,000
I was obedient and loyal,

665
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,719
but not anymore.

666
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,280
The Zhao Jing in front of you

667
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,040
is someone who killed his wife,

668
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,600
murdered his brothers,

669
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,760
and scourged the world.

670
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,160
Someone who shall not be forgiven.

671
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,280
The world has failed me

672
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,320
and I shall do the same to the world.

673
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,920
But to you…

674
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,400
My son…

675
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,080
The old me has died.

676
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,200
But if I were to keep some kindness

677
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,840
and affection for my family,

678
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,800
they are for you.

679
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,920
This is the last piece of purity
in my life.

680
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,000
Promise me

681
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,840
that you will guard it well.

682
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,920
Do not abandon it.

683
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,800
Godfather.

684
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,400
It's my fault.

685
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,360
I shouldn't have asked you this.

686
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,840
I won't ask again.

687
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Xie'er,

688
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,440
you should know that

689
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,320
you are the only one I have

690
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,720
and I'm the only one you have.

691
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,920
"You won't fail me

692
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,920
and I won't fail you."

693
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,320
"You won't fail me

694
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,520
and I won't fail you."

695
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
Master.

696
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,000
Don't call me that.

697
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,520
Don't you have a new master already?

698
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,000
How did it go?

699
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,480
Did you find an answer?

700
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,280
He said

701
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,160
it was his wife, Li Yao,

702
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,840
who threatened him
with the secret of the armory.

703
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,400
I can't believe

704
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,400
that his ability to make up stories
is still as good.

705
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,840
It was my father who threatened him first.

706
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,520
Why did he frame Li Yao?

707
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,120
Because he killed Li Yao after that.

708
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,920
Li Yao was just a stupid girl.

709
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,560
Although we were rivals in love,

710
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,720
I didn't hate her.

711
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,800
If I was the one

712
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,800
who married Zhao Jing,

713
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,440
the skeleton buried in the ground

714
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,480
would be me instead.

715
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,160
"He dallied with me

716
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,720
and he forsook me in the end."

717
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,800
I gave up everything for Zhao Jing.

718
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,600
But I couldn't believe

719
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,520
that he went for Li Yao, a high-born girl.

720
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,240
My father saw me cry all day

721
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,280
and he couldn't bear it,

722
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,560
so he threatened Zhao Jing
with the secret of the armory

723
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,800
and lured him with the position
of the chief of the Neon Palace.

724
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,800
That's why Zhao Jing had to marry me.

725
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,320
But I didn't expect

726
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,760
that he would be so ruthless.

727
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,920
He conspired
with the traitors of Neon Palace

728
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,560
and slaughtered all the people

729
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,160
on the day of our wedding.

730
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,120
Master.

731
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,240
It wasn't you?

732
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,160
The past can't be verified.

733
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,520
Neither of you has any solid proof.

734
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,480
If he is indeed as cold-blooded
as you said he is,

735
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,880
why would he spare your life?

736
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,280
And why would he

737
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,440
keep and cherish your bloodletter?

738
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,240
You really…

739
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,440
You really don't understand Zhao Jing.

740
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,920
Do you know that all his life,

741
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,920
he is most proud

742
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,760
of his ability to fool everyone?

743
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,080
He keeps one trophy

744
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,840
for each of his plots.

745
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,400
I'm guessing that

746
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,240
he has his master's ring

747
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,920
and the sword that poisoned Rong Xuan.

748
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,440
If you don't believe me,

749
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,680
go and check it for yourself.

750
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,240
There should be

751
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,120
something left
by that stupid girl, Li Yao.

752
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,440
It's very likely to be their love token.

753
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,600
If I'm not wrong,

754
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,920
Zhao Jing has also given you

755
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,880
a special token

756
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,120
to prove his sincerity.

757
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,800
Am I right?

758
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,400
Master Wen,
tomorrow is the winter solstice.

759
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,280
Will Master Ye be back in time?

760
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,480
Yes, tomorrow is the winter solstice.

761
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,920
Shall we make dumplings?

762
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,360
Master Ye said

763
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,920
he wanted dumplings
with cabbage and pork stuffing.

764
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,720
What else do you know besides eating?

765
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,920
Master Ye requested it in his letter.

766
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,840
Besides, I've worked so hard every day.

767
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,080
Why can't I have some?

768
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,240
You little brat, how dare you talk back?

769
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,800
Be careful what you're learning!

770
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,200
All right.

771
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,960
I'll buy some ingredients tomorrow.

772
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,440
What else do you want?

773
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,320
You're going to listen to him this time?

774
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,280
That Old Monster is getting older.

775
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,760
It's not easy for him to go through
such a long journey to help us.

776
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,520
I'm just going to give him

777
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,120
what he wants to eat.

778
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,480
That's reasonable.

779
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,280
But he has a big appetite,

780
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,480
so we should prepare a lot more food.

781
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,440
The liquor is not good either.

782
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,040
How about this, Lao Wen?

783
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,280
Hire a carriage to Qingshui Town

784
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,120
and buy some good food and liquor.

785
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,080
All right.

786
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,400
Mr. Wen, I'll go with you.

787
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,640
Go where?

788
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,360
One round trip takes a whole day.

789
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,000
Don't even think about it.
Stay and practice your martial arts.

790
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,280
That's not fair.

791
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,560
I have never slacked off.

792
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,560
You're still talking back?

793
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,840
Go to bed now.

794
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,360
Lao Wen.

795
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,600
Get some rest.

796
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,520
Shall we chat a while longer?

797
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,280
And have some drinks?

798
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,800
I'll pass.

799
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,800
We'll have a fierce battle soon.

800
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
We need to have a good rest.

801
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,280
That's right.

802
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,160
Go to bed then.

803
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,600
Let's go, Chengling.

804
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,640
Let's go.

805
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,160
GENTLE WINDS AND LIGHT CLOUDS
