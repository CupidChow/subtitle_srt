1
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,040
He also said

2
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,960
that even if it was not for the alliance
with the Window of Heaven,

3
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,080
he would handle it well with no mistakes

4
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,160
for the reputation
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

5
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,520
He asked me not to worry.

6
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
He--

7
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,880
Did he say this without any hesitation?

8
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,560
Did he struggle to say it?

9
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,440
Now that you know this, why bother--

10
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,880
Why bother asking such a question?

11
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,200
Please forgive me for saying this.

12
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,600
This test is absolutely unnecessary.

13
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,520
Qianqiao.

14
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,280
How dare you?

15
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,560
I'm sorry for my impudence.

16
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,600
Scorpion King, please forgive me.

17
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,520
The ones who are obsessed with gambling

18
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,200
are always good at finding excuses,

19
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,600
wanting to turn the table.

20
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,120
So do I.

21
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,920
I just want to give him

22
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,040
one more chance.

23
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,560
And one more chance for me too.

24
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,360
It's fine.

25
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,480
It's fine.

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,240
Since that is the case,

27
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,040
I will take one more superfluous action.

28
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,560
Qianqiao.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,960
Take it.

30
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,040
This--

31
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Here.

32
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,440
This is the antidote to Slave Voodoo.

33
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,520
There are two of them.

34
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,280
This is the prescription
for the monthly cure.

35
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,720
Don't you understand?

36
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,520
You kept begging me

37
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,240
to spare Yu Qiufeng, didn't you?

38
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,040
I did promise you.

39
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,280
Since the life of the jerk
from the Mount Hua Sect

40
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,440
doesn't matter at all,

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm willing to fulfill your wish.

42
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,720
If he's willing to give up

43
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,400
his position as
the chief of Mount Hua Sect

44
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,280
and leave with you when he comes back,

45
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,760
then consider all of these

46
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,160
as my gifts for your wedding.

47
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,160
Scorpion King.

48
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,160
-I--
-It's just that

49
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,040
whether you want to give him the antidote

50
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,440
or to use the Slave Voodoo

51
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,280
to make him your loyal servant forever.

52
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,040
It's all up to you.

53
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,280
You've suffered a lot in your life.

54
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,400
I don't have the heart
to just stand by and watch.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
So I'm giving you a chance to decide.

56
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,920
You must cherish it.

57
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,280
Scorpion King.

58
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,560
Qianqiao.

59
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,000
Qianqiao.

60
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,800
Do you come for yourself or Scorpion King?

61
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,320
Qiufeng.

62
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,080
Are you willing to leave with me?

63
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,440
He--

64
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,640
Qianqiao.

65
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,240
Tomorrow is the Heroes Conference.

66
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,960
Why are you talking
about these things now?

67
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,280
Qianqiao.

68
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,480
Of course I'm willing to go
as far as possible with you.

69
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,840
However, we're suffering
from the Slave Voodoo.

70
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Have you forgotten it?

71
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,120
If we don't get the monthly cure,

72
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,840
we will die a tragic death.

73
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,080
Then let's be husband and wife
for one month, shall we?

74
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,440
Qianqiao.

75
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Qiufeng, trust me.

76
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,000
I know exactly how dangerous
the traps in the Ghost Valley are.

77
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,280
Scorpion King wants us to be the pawns

78
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,280
and it's filled with
grim possibilities this time.

79
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,360
Why don't we just escape?

80
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,280
At least, we can enjoy
one last month together.

81
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,160
Qianqiao.

82
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,560
That's not the issue.

83
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,200
Although fighting against the Ghost Valley
is definitely dangerous,

84
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,240
we might survive by a hair's breadth.

85
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,520
-However, once we escape--
-I've made up my mind.

86
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,080
I'm leaving tonight.

87
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,440
It's up to you

88
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,680
to come with me or not.

89
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,640
Qianqiao.

90
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,720
Qianqiao, you can't leave.

91
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,600
Qianqiao.

92
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,000
Scorpion King won't spare me if you leave.

93
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,640
That's why I'm asking you to choose.

94
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,960
I--

95
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,080
It's fine. You don't need to say it.

96
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,920
I don't want to hear it.

97
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,160
Qianqiao, what is this?

98
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,120
That is the antidote to Slave Voodoo.

99
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,800
Take it and leave White Deer Town.

100
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,280
It's dangerous to go
against the Ghost Valley.

101
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,520
I'm not lying to you.

102
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,400
This fan

103
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,880
is a treasure
that I've kept my whole life.

104
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,280
YU QIUFENG

105
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,240
Now,

106
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,560
I'm giving it back to you.

107
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,760
Qianqiao.

108
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,360
Do you have more?

109
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,720
Have you taken it?

110
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,200
What you just said

111
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,320
makes everything worthwhile.

112
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,560
Qiufeng.

113
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,880
Life is still long ahead.

114
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,480
Please take good care of yourself.

115
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,280
Our relationship is destined to end here.

116
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,080
Qianqiao, what do you mean?

117
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Qianqiao!

118
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Qianqiao, what are you doing? Stop it!

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,480
I must forget about you forever.

120
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,640
"The calm surface of the river

121
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,480
reflects the green willow.

122
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,040
Flowers and the moon

123
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,800
are concomitant in the distance.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,720
Year after year,

125
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,160
the scene reappears

126
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,800
after the snow melts."

127
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,000
Today, many heroes across the country
all gather together.

128
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,160
Since we differ in martial arts

129
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,560
and we don't know each other well,

130
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,080
we must elect a leader

131
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,560
to guide us in conquering
the Ghost Valley.

132
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,560
Judging from virtue,

133
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,000
Master Ci Mu is a person with prestige.

134
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,960
As for martial arts,

135
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,000
the chief of Bodhidharma Hall's skills

136
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,600
is impressive.

137
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,960
In terms of reputation,

138
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,520
Shaolin Sect has always had a good
reputation in the martial arts world.

139
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,040
Therefore, I recommend Master Ci Mu

140
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,800
to guide us to conquer the Ghost Valley.

141
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,960
Amitābha. Thank you for your appreciation.

142
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,040
As a Buddhist,

143
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,040
it's not proper for me
to lead a movement that aims to kill.

144
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,880
I'd like to recommend someone.

145
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,240
Mo Huaiyang, the chief
of the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

146
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,000
He was the champion of
the Young Heroes Conference 20 years ago.

147
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,200
In the past 20 years,
he has secluded himself for practice.

148
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,480
His martial arts skills
must have reached the top level.

149
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,680
Since we're martial artists
and we're voting

150
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,640
for the supreme leader
of the martial arts world,

151
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,880
we should consider
that person's martial arts skills first.

152
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,720
Therefore, I vote for Chief Mo.

153
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,040
Everyone,

154
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,000
we are voting for a leader today.

155
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,400
He should not only have virtue
and a good reputation,

156
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,400
but also a strong leadership quality.

157
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,000
Currently, the Ghost Valley is rudderless.

158
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,320
But it has a geographical advantage
and is heavily guarded.

159
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,480
Therefore, in my opinion,

160
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,040
this person must be good
at plotting and decisive.

161
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,280
What's more, he must be equipped

162
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,760
with experience in battle commanding.

163
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
Considering all this,

164
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,520
I think the most suitable one
is the chief of the Five Lakes Alliance.

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,880
Isn't that right?

166
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,720
-Yes!
-That's right!

167
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,960
-Yes, you're right.
-That's right!

168
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,840
Chief Mo, that's fair enough.

169
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,160
You are all outstanding
in the other aspects.

170
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,880
However, as for these three aspects,

171
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
no one can be compared to Chief Zhao.

172
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,280
He is the perfect one.

173
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,440
Am I right?

174
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,160
-Yes, you're right.
-That's right!

175
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,680
-You're right.
-That's right!

176
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,520
-Vote for Chief Zhao.
-Vote for Chief Zhao.

177
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,000
Just now,

178
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,680
Chief Zhao made a good point.

179
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,560
When martial artists select their leader,

180
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,480
martial arts skills should come first.

181
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,600
Why not let the candidates
have combat in public?

182
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,560
The final winner will be the supreme
leader of the martial arts world.

183
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,840
Isn't that easy and simple?

184
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,280
-Yes, you're right.
-That's right!

185
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,800
-Yes.
-Compete in martial arts.

186
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,960
-Compete in martial arts.
-Compete in martial arts.

187
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,960
-Compete in martial arts.
-That's only fair!

188
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,680
It's only fair to compete in martial arts.

189
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,280
-Yes.
-It makes sense.

190
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,880
Chief Zhao.

191
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,640
Please.

192
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,080
It's an honor to learn
from Chief Mo's good skills.

193
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,960
Go ahead.

194
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,400
Everyone,

195
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,720
I've only heard

196
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,280
about Chief Zhao nobility in morals
and he's excellent in strategizing,

197
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,240
but not that he's good in martial arts.

198
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,640
The demonstration today has shown…

199
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,520
-As expected of Chief Zhao.
-Amitābha.

200
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,560
He is indeed awesome.

201
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,080
I didn't expect that
Chief Zhao's martial arts skills

202
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,200
have reached such a high level.

203
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,360
Chief Mo is amazing in martial arts,

204
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,080
but Chief Zhao has managed
to be on par with him for quite a while,

205
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,840
without a hint of losing.

206
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,760
There are a lot of talents
emerging in the martial arts world.

207
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,240
How ridiculous.

208
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,440
Since ancient times,

209
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,360
the leader of the martial arts world
must be intelligent and virtuous.

210
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,320
Zhao Jing,

211
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,120
how dare you stand on this stage!

212
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,440
Zhao Jing.

213
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,840
You were the son of a servant.

214
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,280
After the mysterious death of the only son
of the former chief of Tai Lake Sect,

215
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,880
you volunteered to be his foster son.

216
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,480
That's how you become one of the five sons
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

217
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
Later, the five sons
of Five Lakes Alliance and Rong Xuan

218
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,040
became good friends
and jointly built the armory.

219
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,440
Shut up!

220
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,160
How dare you!

221
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,040
How dare you stand here and accuse
Chief Zhao by spreading rumors!

222
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,080
Guards! Catch him!

223
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,720
After the armory was built,

224
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,440
you secretly put poison
on Gao Chong's sword

225
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,400
when the five sons
were sparring with Rong Xuan.

226
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,440
Gao Chong thought
he had hurt Rong Xuan by mistake.

227
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,520
Rong Xuan later went mad

228
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,960
and died because of it.

229
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,600
Gao Chong failed to explain for himself
and passed away with regrets.

230
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Then the five sons
went their separate ways,

231
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,680
feeling regret all their lives.

232
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,000
This was all caused by you.

233
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,040
If such a man with no loyalty and morality

234
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,560
defeats all of you with his martial arts

235
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,880
and becomes the supreme leader
of the martial arts world,

236
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,960
will you still follow him?

237
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,320
-Master!
-Huaiyang!

238
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,240
Master!

239
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,200
-Master!
-Master!

240
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,040
-Huaiyang!
-Master, are you all right?

241
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,720
Despicable man!

242
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,920
That was a sneak attack! How vile!

243
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,040
Zhao Jing, what's your explanation?

244
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,640
Why should I explain?

245
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,760
This bastard

246
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,600
kept babbling
when I was combating with Chief Mo!

247
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,960
He was trying to set me up!

248
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,720
Look at him, everyone.

249
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,480
He is the accomplice
of the chief of the Ghost Valley!

250
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,600
When we surrounded
and tried to eliminate Wen Kexing,

251
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,240
he risked his life to save him!

252
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,240
All of you witnessed it
with your own eyes.

253
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,920
So…

254
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,240
He was the one who used
the hidden weapon to frame me up!

255
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,320
Since you're the winner,

256
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,640
I, Zhou Zishu,
lord of the Four Seasons Manor,

257
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,920
am willing to challenge
and learn from you, Chief Zhao.

258
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,680
Who said the Four Seasons Manor is doomed?

259
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,400
Who?

260
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,640
-Why is he here?
-It's Wen Kexing.

261
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,280
-Didn't he die a long time ago?
-He's not dead?

262
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,920
-Why didn't he die?
-He fell from the cliff, didn't he?

263
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,440
What's going on now?

264
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Zishu.

265
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,360
Please let me handle this.

266
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,000
Isn't he Wen Kexing,
the chief of the Ghost Valley?

267
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,720
Indeed, my name is Wen Kexing.

268
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,240
But I'm from the Four Seasons Manor.

269
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,680
We just share the same name.

270
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,120
Are you all mistaking me for someone else?

271
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,520
Wen Kexing.

272
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,040
Do you think we are all fools?

273
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,920
How dare you talk nonsense?

274
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,800
Heroes!

275
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,640
Don't believe his nonsense!

276
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,760
He is indeed
the chief of the Ghost Valley!

277
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,920
That's right.

278
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,440
We all witnessed it with our own eyes.

279
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,640
He is the chief of the Ghost Valley
that's on the Brochure of Ghosts.

280
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,400
The Brochure of Ghosts
was compiled by Zhao Jing,

281
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,960
who is unfaithful and unjust.

282
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,800
Couldn't it be that
he did it to set me up?

283
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,760
That's ridiculous!

284
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,080
That's beyond dispute.

285
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,480
The three ghosts that betrayed
the Ghost Valley are here.

286
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,280
Whether he is the chief
of the Ghost Valley or not,

287
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,480
we can find out by asking them directly.

288
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Bring them up.

289
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,360
They're Changing Ghost, Black Grim Reaper,

290
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,120
and Happy Ghost
who have forsaken darkness for light.

291
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,800
Look at the man on the stage.

292
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,880
Is he your former master?

293
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,160
-We don't know him.
-We don't know him.

294
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,320
As we know,

295
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,160
Wen Kexing, the chief of the Ghost Valley,
had been killed at the White Deer Cliff.

296
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,160
His body is still being kept in
the stronghold of the Five Lakes Alliance.

297
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,360
Does Hero Zhao intentionally

298
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,920
finagle all the heroes?

299
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,440
Xie'er.

300
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,320
You--

301
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,360
I'm a disciple of the Four Seasons Manor,

302
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,640
my master is Hero Qin, Qin Huaizhang.

303
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,680
This is my senior disciple.

304
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,920
As for my parents--

305
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,760
Zhou Xu.

306
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,760
Please lend me your sword.

307
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,520
I'll explain to you later.

308
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,120
I have a question.

309
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,120
Does any of you remember
the Eighteen Moves of Qiuming?

310
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,000
Zhen Ruyu? Zhen Ruyu of the Healer Valley?

311
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,840
Eighteen Moves of Qiuming?

312
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,280
The Eighteen Moves of Qiuming
of Divine Hand Zhen Ruyu.

313
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,280
What's your relationship with him?

314
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
It turns out that
you haven't forgotten him.

315
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,160
When he sacrificed himself
in Mount Qingya,

316
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,520
when he was threatened
in the Healer Valley,

317
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,280
when he lost all his martial arts skills,

318
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,440
when he was slaughtered
by the evil ghosts,

319
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,080
where were all of you?

320
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,600
Answer me!

321
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,720
What's your relationship
with Divine Hand Zhen Ruyu?

322
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,480
He was my late father.

323
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,880
That's nonsense!

324
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,760
Just now, you said your surname was Wen.

325
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,480
My father's surname used to be Wen.

326
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,360
Then Chief Zhen of the Healer Valley
gave him the surname, Zhen.

327
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,560
However, since he had been expelled
by his sect,

328
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,960
as his son,

329
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,760
I followed his wish

330
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,320
and changed my surname back to Wen.

331
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,720
That's why my name is Wen Kexing.

332
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,320
That's nonsense!

333
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,040
How dare you ruin
the late Hero Zhen's reputation?

334
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
You must be the chief
of the Mount Emei Sect, right?

335
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,680
When I was one month old,

336
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,520
the women chevalier of the Mount Emei Sect
had jointly sewed a patchwork

337
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
and sent it
to the Healer Valley as a gift.

338
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,800
It's my fault

339
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,760
that I haven't come to thank you for
your kindness and benevolent affections.

340
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,440
You're really…

341
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,080
Nun Zhi Yin.

342
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,320
Don't be tricked by him!

343
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,400
Zhen Ruyu was upright
and honest his whole life.

344
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,600
How could he have such a vile son?

345
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,600
Wen Kexing.

346
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,480
The three ghosts earlier
were obviously your henchmen.

347
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,360
You asked them to pretend to surrender
to me and turn against me now.

348
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,840
This is what you've arranged, right?

349
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,880
Listen to me.

350
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,320
Such tricks

351
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,520
won't fool all heroes here!

352
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,400
Heroes, please listen to me.

353
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,840
The Ghost Valley is good
at turning people against each other.

354
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,360
My brother, Gao Chong, was set up by them

355
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,600
and died while being wronged,
even until now.

356
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,320
The Five Lakes Alliance
has five pieces of the Glazed Armor,

357
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,720
and you have taken four.

358
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,960
Now, you're targeting mine.

359
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,920
Everyone, don't fall for it!

360
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,880
Shut up!

361
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,040
How dare you call Gao Chong by his name?

362
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,320
You aren't qualified!

363
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,680
Shen Shen!

364
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,520
I understand now.

365
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,720
Shen Shen!

366
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,000
It was you who colluded with
the Ghost Valley and killed Gao Chong!

367
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,720
I suspected long ago that
there was a mole in the alliance.

368
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,120
But I didn't expect it to be you!

369
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,360
You divulged the secret
of the Glazed Armor!

370
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,680
You murdered the chief
of the Mount Tai Sect.

371
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,760
You worked with some outsiders
to kidnap Gao Xiaolian

372
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,480
and threatened Gao Chong using her!

373
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,760
That's why he endured

374
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,520
all the humiliation and eventually
committed suicide in public!

375
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,800
It turns out that you're the evil ghost!

376
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,720
That's nonsense!

377
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,840
Thirty years ago,

378
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,320
Zhao Wenda,
the chief of the Tai Lake Sect,

379
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,600
was confined to his bed
for the pain of losing his son.

380
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,080
Zhao Jing served him
and took good care of him.

381
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,880
Chief Zhao was touched,
so he adopted him as his foster son.

382
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,680
That's how he made rapid progress.

383
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,280
Little girl,

384
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,280
how dare you come here
to fool everyone with lies!

385
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,600
Why did I mention the past

386
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,600
in front of all heroes here?

387
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,480
I just want to ask you, Chief Zhao,

388
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,360
why did you hate my father so much?

389
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,440
Not only did you murder my father

390
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,000
and take his position,

391
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,680
but you also utterly discredited him,

392
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,040
making him regret his life
and die with no hope of clearing his name!

393
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,880
Is it only because my father saw

394
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,640
how miserable you used to be 30 years ago?

395
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,320
All the eyewitnesses of your tough time

396
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,920
died tragically.

397
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,960
Are these all just coincidences?

398
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,640
Didn't you witness everything?

399
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,600
Why can't they be coincidences?

400
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,880
I'm Zhang Chengling,

401
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,400
the son of Zhang Yusen,
the chief of the Mirror Lake Sword Sect.

402
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,400
TO MASTER YE OF MOUNT CHANGMING

403
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,960
This is the letter given
by my father before he died.

404
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,840
He asked me to send it to Master Ye.

405
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,960
In the letter,
it's said that 20 years ago,

406
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,960
Master Rong Xuan went mad

407
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,520
because of Zhao Jing.

408
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,360
He knew that the sparring
between the five brothers

409
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,120
would result in wounds and injuries.

410
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,760
So he secretly put poison
on Chief Gao's sword.

411
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Eventually, he managed to pull his plan

412
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,840
and Master Rong Xuan
was poisoned and went mad,

413
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,880
which led to a series of tragedies later.

414
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,040
In other words,

415
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,920
thousands of people who died
in the battle of Mount Qingya

416
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,800
should be blamed on Zhao Jing!

417
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,200
Did such a thing happen?

418
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,520
Chengling.

419
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,600
I loved you and treated you so well.

420
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,760
How could you say that?

421
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,240
That's nonsense!

422
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,440
Zhao Jing.

423
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,000
Failing to defend yourself
feels terrible, right?

424
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,960
In the past, you slandered
my father by just giving

425
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,840
one side of the story, didn't you?

426
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,000
Everyone, look at this!

427
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,440
Isn't he the elder
of the Yueyang Sect?

428
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,440
It's Deng Kuan!

429
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,600
-Didn't he commit suicide?
-Didn't he die?

430
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,440
Yes, he is the first disciple
of our Yueyang Sect

431
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,160
and my senior disciple, Deng Kuan.

432
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,440
As we know,

433
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,560
at the Heroes Conference in Mount Jun,

434
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,680
Deng Kuan was the one
who accused my father.

435
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,800
My father couldn't defend himself

436
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,960
so he could only prove
his innocence through his death.

437
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,240
Then Deng Kuan disappeared.

438
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,760
Didn't you find it strange?

439
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,600
Missing?

440
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,080
Zhao Jing.

441
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,880
Zhao Jing set me up!

442
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,520
Master.

443
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,000
I've failed my master!

444
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,400
Deng Kuan.

445
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,680
All of you have heard it now.

446
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,400
Back then,
my senior was captured by Zhao Jing,

447
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,200
and occult tricks were used on him!

448
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,760
That's why he accused my father
at the Heroes Conference!

449
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,640
We tried every means to save him.

450
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,640
Although we've been trying to heal him,

451
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,480
he couldn't recover completely.

452
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,520
Zhao Jing is the evil manipulator!

453
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,200
Zhao Jing is the embarrassment
of the martial arts world.

454
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,760
-We were deceived for so long.
-What a scum.

455
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,720
I can't believe he's such a person.

456
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,360
-If children
-What a hypocrite.

457
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,800
can't avenge their parents,

458
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,960
what's the difference
between them and beasts?

459
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,560
I'm just a girl with no power.

460
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,440
Today, I risked my life
to unmask Zhao Jing,

461
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,560
hoping that all of you heroes

462
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,920
can uphold justice for me.

463
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,680
-He's despicable.
-Indeed.

464
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,800
He deserves to die.

465
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,600
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

466
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,080
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

467
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,000
-Kill him!
-Amitābha.

468
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:03,160
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

469
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,400
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

470
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,600
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

471
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,080
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

472
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,400
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

473
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,440
Kill this embarrassment
of the martial arts world! Bastard!

474
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,840
Petty tricks!

475
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,960
Wen Kexing, kill me if you can!

476
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,080
Unable to confess.

477
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,040
Betrayed by all.

478
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,160
Isolated without help.

479
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,560
The traitor, Zhao Jing,

480
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,040
do you plead guilty or not?

481
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,160
Wen Kexing, you did well

482
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,520
trying to frame me.

483
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
I fell into your trap.

484
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,440
If you want, just kill me.

485
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,600
However, if you want

486
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,280
to force me to plead guilty
for all those lies…

487
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,840
you must be out of your mind!

488
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,760
Chief of the Ghost Valley,

489
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,680
you are twisting the facts!

490
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,440
I did not do such a thing.

491
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,360
I'm just

492
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,880
correcting the mistakes.

493
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,560
How stubborn!

494
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,440
Just as Ms. Gao said,

495
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,600
if children

496
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,600
can't vindicate their parents,

497
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,840
they are no different than beasts.

498
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,440
Here comes the question.

499
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,760
An eye for an eye.

500
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,560
That is only fair, right?

501
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,880
-Yes!
-Yes!

502
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,400
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

503
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,800
My parents spent their whole life
healing people.

504
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,360
Thousands were saved by them.

505
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,040
But Zhao Jing betrayed them,

506
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,960
so they were both tortured to death.

507
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,280
I swear to God.

508
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,840
I, as the son of my parents,

509
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,520
will let Zhao Jing suffer
all the tribulations

510
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,480
that he had brought upon my parents!

511
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:18,080
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

512
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,240
-I've made a wrong move.
-Kill him!

513
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,800
-Kill him!
-But I did not lose.

514
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,120
You're the one who failed!

515
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,760
You've been fooled by me
for more than 20 years.

516
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,360
The whole martial arts world
has been turned upside down by me!

517
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,120
I feel content!

518
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,880
I lived a free and unrestrained life,

519
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,600
so I'll die a noble and heroic death!

520
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,720
This is just the beginning.

521
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,400
Kill me.

522
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,920
And you'll all live under my shadow!

523
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,960
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

524
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,080
Great!

525
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,280
I'll make you wish you were dead.

526
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,360
Father. Mother.

527
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,360
Master.

528
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
Chief Gao.

529
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,560
Zhou Xu.

530
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,800
This is the path
that you'd hope me to choose, right?

531
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,360
You deserve it.

532
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,000
Father.

533
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,600
Take this.

534
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,440
It's good for you.

535
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,520
Father.

536
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,240
I know you're good at talking.

537
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,640
As long as you talk,

538
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,560
you can convince me of anything.

539
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,640
Therefore, from now on,

540
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,120
don't ever try to speak.

541
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,040
Just rest.

542
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Zhou Xu.

543
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,200
Here's your sword. Let's go home.

544
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,920
Let's go home first. All right?

545
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,960
I will tell you everything
after we're home.

546
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,920
After that,

547
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,080
it's all up to you

548
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,400
on how to take care of me.

549
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,920
Zhou Xu.

550
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,120
This is the best day

551
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
of my whole life.

552
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,160
Don't beat me here.

553
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,800
All right.

554
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,120
I'll remember this
and keep it for another day.

555
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,560
-Master. Master Wen!
-All right.

556
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,480
Little idiot, come on.

557
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,640
Let's go home.

558
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,680
What do you want for dinner?

559
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,520
Chief of the Ghost Valley,

560
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,640
where are you going?

561
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,280
What did you call my junior?

562
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,960
Zhao Jing has faced retribution
for his life of crimes.

563
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,280
He could only blame himself for that.

564
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,320
Today, we gather here

565
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,080
not to judge Zhao Jing,

566
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,080
but to crusade against
the chief of the Ghost Valley.

567
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,520
Wen Kexing, you have had your revenge.

568
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,760
Isn't it time to settle down
the public indignation?

569
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,040
Mo Huaiyang, are you insane?

570
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,560
This kid is the descendant of Hero Zhen,

571
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,280
not the chief of the Ghost Valley.

572
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,360
Putting the reliability
of his words aside,

573
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,080
even if he's telling the truth,

574
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,280
Zhen Ruyu was your sect's benefactor.

575
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,720
But what about us,
the Gentle Wind Sword Sect?

576
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,160
Is it none of our business?

577
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,560
Wen Kexing.

578
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,080
What tricks did you pull
at the White Deer Cliff?

579
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,600
You're the chief of the Ghost Valley.

580
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,200
Why don't you dare to admit it?

581
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,560
Don't you feel ashamed?

582
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,640
All right, I'll admit it.

583
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,400
I'm the chief of the Ghost Valley.

584
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,920
Earlier,

585
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,880
I was just kidding.

586
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,720
Wen Kexing, how dare you lie to me?

587
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,160
Please forgive me.

588
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,680
If I didn't lie to you,

589
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,160
I wouldn't have gotten the chance
to judge Zhao Jing, right?

590
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
Are you the descendant of Zhen or not?

591
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,880
Why did you join the Ghost Valley?

592
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,240
I ended up there thanks to all of you.

593
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,360
That's nonsense!

594
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,560
-Our benefactor, Zhen--
-Enough, Nun Zhi Yin.

595
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,920
Don't you think it's ironic
to keep calling him that?

596
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,800
When your benefactor was utterly
discredited and ended up wrecked,

597
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,640
where were you
and the whole Mount Emei Sect?

598
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,200
I never understood this.

599
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,560
Back then, my father had
many bosom friends, relatives,

600
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,520
and old acquaintances.

601
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,040
But when darkness crept into our family,

602
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,160
where were all of you?

603
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Your parents' tragic ending

604
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,560
wasn't because of
the persecution of others.

605
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,360
But it was because your father
protected the devil, Rong Xuan,

606
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,360
and hid the secret of the armory.

607
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,200
That's why
I'll settle this debt with you today.

608
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,320
Anyone who wants to do that today

609
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,760
must come at me first.

610
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,920
It's not your turn to settle your debt.

611
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,840
-Immortal Ye.
-Immortal Ye.

612
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,960
-Immortal Ye.
-Immortal Ye.

613
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,240
Master Ye.

614
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,800
Master Ye, you're just in time.

615
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,200
Please lead all of us
to wipe out the Ghost Valley.

616
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,160
That's right.

617
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,080
I will definitely destroy
the Ghost Valley.

618
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,200
All those from the Ghost Valley
are doomed to die.
