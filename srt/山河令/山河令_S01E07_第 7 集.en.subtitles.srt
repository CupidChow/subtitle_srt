LUO MANSION

00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,520
HAPPINESS

3
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,000
NATURAL DEATH IN DREAM

4
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,240
My goodness.

5
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,040
All this red is making me hungry.

6
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,640
Can that crazy woman

7
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,080
hurry up and finish it

8
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,880
so that we can go eat?

9
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,440
Ghoul, be patient.

10
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,880
The timing isn't right yet.

11
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
Miss.

12
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,760
You have worked hard.

13
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,400
Lustful Ghost.

14
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,760
That crazy woman is almost here.

15
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
Keep yourself under control.

16
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,120
What are you doing?

17
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,160
What are you looking at?

18
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,760
Why do you care? Why can't I look?

19
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,960
No matter how hard you look,
this chair is mine.

20
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,560
Is it yours because you said so?

21
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,720
Don't make me kill you.

22
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,080
Say that again.

23
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,280
The Master of the Unfaithful List is here!

24
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,840
Tragicomic Ghost,
this setup is enough, right?

25
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,040
But you can't keep asking us

26
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,000
to play pretend

27
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,360
with you.

28
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,920
If you really love acting that much,

29
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,720
then set up your own stage and sing!

30
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,600
-Crazy woman!
-Happy Ghost.

31
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,800
All right.

32
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,200
Tragicomic Ghost.

33
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,680
Why are you fighting him?

34
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,800
It's the blessed hour now.

35
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's start the ceremony.

36
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,960
All right then.

37
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,120
Hurry up and bring in our groom.

38
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,880
Please welcome the groom!

39
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,320
HAPPINESS

40
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,120
Please welcome the bride!

MEMORIAL TABLET OF THE DISCIPLE
OF MOUNT EMEI SECT, MO YANWAN

42
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,320
Mu Yunge, Young Chief
of the Broken Sword Manor

43
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,960
and Mo Yanwan,
a disciple of Mount Emei Sect,

44
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,320
promise to love each other.

45
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,320
Today, Tragicomic Ghost
will be the matchmaker,

46
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,000
and all of the ghosts as witnesses

47
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,640
to celebrate the Mu and Mo family's

48
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,600
marriage ceremony.

49
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,320
Whether in heaven or on earth,

50
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,000
shall they never part.

51
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,840
First, bow to heaven and earth.

52
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,480
Second, bow to your parents.

53
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,600
Third, bow to each other.

MEMORIAL TABLET OF THE DISCIPLE
OF MOUNT EMEI SECT, MO YANWAN

55
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,240
The ceremony is over.

56
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,680
Waiter.

57
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,720
I'm coming!

58
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,120
Master, what do you need?

59
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,280
This Wucheng wine is very good.

60
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,560
Bring me another bottle.

61
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,840
My apologies, Master.

62
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,400
I'll be honest with you.

63
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,040
There is an important person from Hu
in the private room

64
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,880
that bought out all of our Wucheng wine.

65
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,160
Why don't I bring you something else?

66
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,680
All right.

67
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,600
All right.

68
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,480
Why does he look like my master?

69
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,680
Only their physiques look the same.

70
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,440
Master is not that handsome.

71
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,680
I wonder where Master and Mr. Wen are now.

72
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,920
Little idiot.

73
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,480
Bring out the young masters.

74
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,600
Who are all of you?

75
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,080
Do you not know who I am?

76
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,120
I forgot to tell you the rules.

77
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,520
You're not allowed to talk

78
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,680
without my permission.

79
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,720
Whoever talks will die.

80
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,960
Out of all of you,

81
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,000
only one person is going to leave alive.

82
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,360
We don't care who it is.

83
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,160
You back there.

84
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,320
You look very knowledgeable.

85
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,720
Do you know why my master

86
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,560
presides over the Unfaithful List?

87
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,160
Master of the Unfaithful List,
Tragicomic Ghost,

88
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,000
kills all cheaters in the world.

89
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,240
-What--
-You're correct.

90
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,120
But you still need to die.

91
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,360
Didn't I tell you?

92
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,520
Don't talk without my permission.

93
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,680
I asked you a question,

94
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
but I didn't tell you to answer.

95
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,080
Mu Yunge tricked Ms. Mo
into promising to marry him

96
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,800
and then betrayed her,

97
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,080
causing Ms. Mo to hang herself
to death under the Broken Arrow Manor.

98
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,640
Since my master found out about this,

99
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,000
she's going to maintain justice today.

100
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,320
For the marriages she presides over,

101
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,520
ten of the cheater's friends and relatives

102
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,480
will be invited as guests.

103
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,480
Today, out of the ten of you,

104
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,840
only one can leave here alive.

105
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,240
As for who can live until the end,

106
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,880
it will be up to all of you.

107
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,600
Young masters,

108
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,080
I look forward to your performances.

109
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,080
Don't be scared.
Worst comes to worst, it's just death.

110
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,560
We absolutely cannot hurt
Yueyang Sect's reputation.

111
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,840
Fellow brothers.

112
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,120
Let's fight our way out!

113
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,400
They're humiliating us on purpose for fun!

114
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,400
What are you thinking about?

115
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,040
They are

116
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,760
purposely trying to divide us.

117
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,000
Even if there's only one of us left,

118
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,920
will these devils keep their promise?

119
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,360
My friend, that's wrong.

120
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,520
The Ghosts on Mount Qingya
do all kinds of bad deeds,

121
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,160
but never break promises.

122
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,840
It's the exact opposite

123
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,680
from you heroes
who throw around empty words.

124
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,320
But then again,

125
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,840
at this moment,

126
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,640
do you even have a choice?

127
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,040
What are you all waiting for?

128
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,680
Start fighting.

129
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,920
Didn't I make myself clear?

130
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Only one of you will live.

131
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,080
Stop! Are you all crazy?

132
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,040
-Go ahead, fight!
-My goodness.

133
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,040
-This is fun!
-Take him or you will be dead.

134
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,280
-Stop!
-Tragicomic Ghost.

135
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,120
I truly respect smart people like you.

136
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,600
I'm willing to stay with you
for the rest of my life

137
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,520
and be your sidekick
just for the excitement

138
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,000
-of seeing these dogs fight.
-Stop!

139
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,120
Stop, brothers!

140
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Stop fighting!

141
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,520
Fight harder.

142
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,640
Hurry up, kill him!

143
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,280
Zhang Yusen,
the respected Hero of Mirror Lake,

144
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,160
was such an aggressive person.

145
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,400
How does he only have

146
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,800
this one useless child left?

147
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,120
If his first or second son
was still alive,

148
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,680
he would at least have an heir.

149
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,720
But this child…

150
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,560
His younger son is indeed a bit spoiled.

151
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,080
After all, he was born during peacetime

152
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,000
and hasn't experienced any challenges.

153
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,320
Zhao Jing.

154
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,160
Do you really believe
that he doesn't remember anything?

155
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,960
Why would a child lie to us?

156
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,880
You're overthinking.

157
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,600
Did you know?

158
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
Our two nephews from the Zhang family

159
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,920
were sliced into pieces before they died.

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,040
Yusen even

161
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,160
crushed his own skull!

162
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,320
Why would the Ghost Valley
go through all this trouble

163
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,840
if they successfully found
the Glazed Armor?

164
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,800
They must've tortured them

165
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,240
because they weren't able to find it,

166
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
which caused the suffering

167
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,040
-of Yusen and the children!
-Yusen.

168
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,600
Do you still believe
that Chengling doesn't know anything?

169
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,960
I just don't know what got into him

170
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,720
that made him so distant and quiet.

171
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,400
All right, stop talking.

172
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,320
My heart aches.

173
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,440
What's the point of your heart aching?

174
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Great!

175
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,280
My junior.

176
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,680
My junior.

177
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
My junior.

178
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,920
My junior.

179
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,480
My junior!

180
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Great!

181
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,200
Amazing!

182
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,520
We watch fighting dramas all the time,

183
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,040
but we rarely get to see

184
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,560
an emotional scene
between brothers like this.

185
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,920
Bravo!

186
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,880
Well,

187
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,160
I quite like

188
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
today's survivor.

189
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,080
Turns out there are not only cowards

190
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,880
in those righteous sects and clans.

191
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,240
There are still two people left.

192
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,440
YUEYANG SECT

193
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,960
PROFOUND EXPECTATIONS

194
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Officer Han.

195
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,800
GREAT AMBITIONS

196
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Greetings, Hero Gao.

197
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,080
I'm the commander
of the Window of Heaven, Han Ying.

198
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,880
You came all the way from Jin.

199
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,200
What business do you have?

200
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,720
I'll get straight to the point.

201
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
I came to the south

202
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,360
to investigate the Glazed Armor.

203
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,800
Hero Gao,
as the chief of the Five Lakes Alliance,

204
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,480
please tell me what you know.

205
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,920
The Glazed Armor is just a rumor

206
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,600
in the martial arts world.

207
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,480
Officer Han,
don't believe everything you hear.

208
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,760
An honest man does not lie.

209
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,040
Don't dodge my question.

210
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,280
Hero Gao.

211
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,640
If you tell me all that you know
about the Glazed Armor,

212
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,480
then the Window of Heaven
will owe you a favor.

213
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,160
We will have many opportunities

214
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
to work together in the future.

215
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,960
Or else…

216
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,920
I've heard about the reputation
of the Window of Heaven.

217
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,480
They are shadows without traces.

218
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,960
They join without exiting.

219
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,840
They know everything and are everywhere.

220
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,600
Now that I've met you,

221
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,200
I understand why.

222
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,680
Since the Window of Heaven
knows everything,

223
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,520
then why did you come to see me

224
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,960
for the Glazed Armor?

225
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,800
Doesn't that mean your reputation is fake?

226
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,680
I heard that the Five Lakes Alliance

227
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,000
is searching for the orphan
of the Mirror Lake Sect.

228
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,840
This is the Five Lakes Alliance's
internal matter.

229
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,440
Outsiders shouldn't worry.

230
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,080
As for the Glazed Armor,

231
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,760
I don't know anything about it.

232
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,880
If you don't have any other matters,
please leave then.

233
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,440
Don't make me do this the hard way!

234
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,280
The Window of Heaven
may rule over the Northwest,

235
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,640
but we are in Yueyang City now,

236
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,120
under the rule of the emperor.

237
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,680
If Commander Han wants to stay for dinner,

238
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,200
then the Five Lakes Alliance
will treat you as our guest.

239
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,200
Would you like to leave or stay?

240
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,400
How did Prince Jin
find out about the Glazed Armor?

241
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,520
Chengling and the others are almost here.

242
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,560
We must bring them into the city

243
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,520
in case anything happens.

244
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,760
Gao Chong.

245
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,640
Gao Chong.

246
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,360
Where is Chengling?

247
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,600
Leave your luggage to the servants.

248
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,440
Get on horseback with only Chengling
and come to the city immediately.

249
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,440
Yes.

250
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,200
Gao Chong, what's wrong?

251
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,400
You're making me nervous.

252
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,359
Father!

253
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,359
You're back?

254
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,600
Mr. Shen and Mr. Zhao.

255
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,040
Xiaolian, you have really grown up.

256
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,080
Here, this is
your younger brother, Chengling.

257
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,000
Chengling, this is my daughter.

258
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,720
You can call her Xiaolian.

259
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,320
Chengling.

260
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Xiaolian.

261
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,800
Take your brother to rest.

262
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Yes.

263
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,080
Chengling.

264
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,240
My father and uncles
have important things to discuss.

265
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,760
Let's go out first.

266
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,000
You can all go as well.

267
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,560
Gao Chong, can you tell us now?

268
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,280
Why did you ask us
to bring Chengling back this urgently?

269
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,160
I'm afraid that from now on,

270
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,600
the martial arts world
won't be peaceful anymore.

271
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
Why not?

272
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,480
The secret of the Glazed Armor is out.

273
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,800
YUEYANG SECT

274
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,560
Buns! Hot steamed buns!

275
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,040
Come and buy hot steamed buns!

276
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,640
-Guards out in the open and in hiding.
-Steamed buns!

277
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,040
-Buns!
-Their defenses are strong for a sect.

278
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,400
-Gao Chong was so cautious
-Buns!

279
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,880
and greeted them himself.

280
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,080
-That child should be safe now.
-Steamed buns!

281
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,080
Buns!

282
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,600
From now on, your future is bright.

283
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,680
I hope that you can overcome it

284
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,800
and turn this challenge into a fortune.

285
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,760
Buns!

286
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,520
Steamed buns!

287
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,520
Since when did
the Window of Heaven send spies

288
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,480
to Yueyang Sect?

289
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,000
What do they want?

290
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,600
TIANXIANG STORE

291
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,000
Umbrellas on clear days,
fans on rainy days.

292
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,840
Master, I'm not selling umbrellas or fans.

293
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,800
What? Is he not from the Window of Heaven?

294
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,760
But I have something more interesting.

295
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,800
Amazing.

296
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,720
Amazing.

297
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,880
You are really like your name,

298
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,720
flexible like a willow branch

299
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,720
and light as catkins.

300
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,240
Ah Xu.

301
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,560
Why did you attack him so cruelly?

302
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,160
How does that saying go?

303
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,480
There's a saying that goes,

304
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,960
"One has a fair and handsome face
but has a heart of a poisonous scorpion."

305
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,440
Ah Xu.

306
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,560
Why can't you be a good person

307
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,600
like me?

308
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,200
The Scorpion Sect?

309
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
You also know about that?

310
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,600
I know a lot of things.

311
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,760
The Window of Heaven in the north,
the Scorpion Sect in the south.

312
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,560
The two largest assassin organizations
in the world

313
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
are both looking for the Glazed Armor.

314
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,520
Ah Xu,

315
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,760
your beloved disciple

316
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,440
is really a treasure now.

317
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,600
The world is in chaos.

318
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,760
Are you scared
that you're going to run into trouble?

319
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,200
Trouble?

320
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,680
I, Philanthropist Wen, am modest, gentle,

321
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,680
sophisticated, even-tempered,
and successful.

322
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,640
Why would trouble find me?

323
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,880
I'm not like you, a merciless killer,

324
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,440
running into trouble everywhere.

325
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
All right,

326
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,480
Philanthropist Wen.

327
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,880
Please stop following me then.

328
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,240
Don't let this merciless killer

329
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,360
ruin your view.

330
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,280
As long as you don't hide
your handsome face,

331
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,720
you won't ruin my view.

332
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,720
For no reason,

333
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,000
why are you in disguise again?

334
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,920
Who are you hiding from?

335
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,160
The sun, all right?

336
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,120
TOFU PUDDING

337
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,160
Ah Xu, don't walk so fast. Wait for me.

338
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,000
Stay away from me.
I want to live a few more years.

339
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,640
TIANXIANG STORE, NECKLACES

340
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,960
Don't worry.

341
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,720
Although all people in this world
are looking for that item,

342
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,440
they might not actually recognize it

343
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,720
even if someone flashed it

344
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,600
in front of their eyes.

345
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,320
Haven't you heard
that the best way to hide money

346
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,600
is to put it in a money box?

347
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,160
Ah Xu!

348
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,440
-Sir, would you like a jade pendant?
-Ah Xu, why are you leaving again?

349
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,560
Don't be upset.

350
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,840
I'm just saying that.

351
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,680
Tell me, how much is this?

352
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,680
Ten taels.

353
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,120
-The Nine Clawed Fox, Fang Buzhi.
-Ten taels? Ah Xu.

354
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,760
Ah Xu, how about these?

355
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,040
I don't like any of them.

356
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,640
Pick one.

357
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,800
You don't like me wearing this, do you?

358
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,240
So choose one for me

359
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,880
and I'll switch it.

360
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,800
Is he drawing attention on purpose?

361
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,720
Ah Xu.

362
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,440
Ah Xu!

363
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,080
Where are you going?

364
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,640
Is everything done?

365
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,640
Yes, Master.

366
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,360
I've done it and nobody noticed.

367
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,320
Good.

368
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,320
The stage is set.

369
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,680
We'll wait and see what a fantastic play

370
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,520
the Window of Heaven, the Scorpion Sect,
the Five Lakes Alliance,

371
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,160
and other martial artists will put on.

372
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,960
I look forward to it.

373
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,040
Here, miss. Look at this fabric.

374
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,040
This is too red.

375
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,720
Not at all, it fits you well.

376
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,400
-Does it?
-Yes.

377
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
Ah Xu!

378
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,400
Wait for me. Are you mad?

379
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,560
Excuse me, sir.

380
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,320
Are you going to take part
in the Heroes Conference?

381
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,880
I guess so.

382
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,960
May I ask your name,
which sect you're from,

383
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,400
and whether you have an invitation?

384
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,400
I'm just an insignificant nobody.

385
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,560
Sir.

386
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,960
He is my brother.

387
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,320
We were invited by Hero Zhao Jing.

388
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,440
You are Master Zhao's friends?

389
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
My apologies.

390
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,040
Do you need me to send a junior
to bring you to the courier station?

391
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,440
There's no need for that. Thank you.

392
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,240
Then we'll leave now.

393
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,600
Goodbye. Let's go.

394
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Gao Chong really paid a lot this time.

395
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,800
The whole Yueyang City
is heavily fortified.

396
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,640
Ah Xu, your dumb disciple

397
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,360
will be safe in Yueyang City.

398
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,920
Don't worry.

399
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,160
All right now.

400
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,320
You're far more troubled
than a centenarian.

401
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,800
What's the use?

402
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,320
Let's find something fun to do. Let's go.

403
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,160
Let's go!

404
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,920
AMASS FORTUNES

405
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,920
Miss, enjoy your meal.

406
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,320
Here.

407
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Master always puts me on the spot,

408
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,680
telling me to find a chance
to get into the Yueyang Sect.

409
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,040
How am I supposed to do that?

410
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,480
Should I sell myself as a servant?

411
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,800
I'm so pretty and charismatic,

412
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,880
I don't seem like a servant at all.

413
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,920
This stupid Yueyang Sect

414
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,200
is even more guarded
than the Imperial Palace.

415
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,560
If Master comes to Yueyang City,

416
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,000
how should I face him?

417
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,760
Ladies and gentlemen,

418
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,360
please tell us what songs
you would like to listen to

419
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,600
and we'll sing them for you.

420
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,400
Sing a song for us!

421
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,360
Sir.

422
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,400
Which song would you like to listen to?

423
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,520
-We can play a lot.
-Then sing us "18 Touches."

424
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,280
-Great.
-"18 Touches."

425
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,080
-We can't play this one.
-This is good.

426
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,680
You can't?

427
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,880
-How about picking another one?
-I can teach her!

428
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,080
-Sir.
-Learn it

429
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,040
and sing it for us,

430
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,280
and we'll give this silver to you!

431
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,480
How about we sing "Willow Branch"?

432
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,200
-Father!
-My daughter!

433
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,880
Sir!

434
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,600
She doesn't know the song, but I do.

435
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,320
If I sing it,
will you give the silver to me?

436
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,840
If you're willing to,

437
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,280
I'll give you double of it!

438
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,760
-Double!
-Double!

439
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,720
This is for you.

440
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,440
-Please accompany me while I sing.
-This…

441
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,160
My daughter.

442
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,200
Let's go.

443
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Great!

444
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,080
Beat the drum fast and the gong slow

445
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,720
I'll sing the "18 Touches" as a show.

446
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,080
Stick out my hand and touch your hair

447
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,160
The dark clouds fly in the air

448
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,200
Stick my hand out again
And touch your face!

449
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,760
Stinky girl, do you want to fight?

450
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,920
Do you still want to listen?

451
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,440
Do you want me to keep singing?

452
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,120
-Do you still want to fight?
-You!

453
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,480
Stinky girl, you just wait and see!

454
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,960
Don't leave!

455
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,320
Do you still want to touch?

456
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,680
-Where else do you want to touch? Tell me!
-You wait and see!

457
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,080
Why are you running?
I'm not done singing yet!

458
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,800
-You…
-Why are you running?

459
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,440
Look at where you are
before looking for trouble!

460
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,400
Making trouble in Yueyang,
the Five Lakes Alliance's area?

461
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Stay here if you dare!

462
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,880
-You wait and see.
-I'll wait right here!

463
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,760
What are you looking at?

464
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,320
What? Do you want to hear me sing too?

465
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,200
No. I want to buy you a meal.

466
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,800
What is he up to?

467
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,480
I'm not scared of you.

468
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,160
Miss, the food is here.

469
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,120
Miss, try it.

470
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,400
This Silver Needle Chicken dish

471
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,800
is cooked with the famous
Silver Needle tea and chicken slices.

472
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,200
Try it.

473
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,960
It's delicious!

474
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,600
It's good, right?

475
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,800
I don't really have any other skills

476
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,760
except for tasting delicacies
around the world.

477
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,560
That's a good skill!

478
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,440
You don't look like a bad person either.

479
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,400
What's your name?

480
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,120
I am Cao Weining
from the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

481
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,360
May I ask

482
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,560
what your name is, miss?

483
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
-My name is--
-Stinky girl!

484
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,800
That stinky girl was the one that beat us.

485
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,320
I am Zhu Yaozhi from the Yueyang Sect.

486
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,920
May I ask who started trouble
in the Five Lakes Alliance's area?

487
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,520
Please explain it to us.

488
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,280
Explain?

489
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,840
Why don't you ask

490
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,600
the girl that you harassed
for an explanation?

491
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,040
Harassed?

492
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,560
Mr. Liu, what happened?

493
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,160
-Nonsense! She made it all up.
-Yes.

494
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,480
Mr. Zhu, I can attest to what she said.

495
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,840
This Mr. Liu harassed that girl first

496
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,320
and this lady rescued her.

497
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,520
Young Hero Cao, my apologies.

498
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
"Young Hero"?

499
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,040
Are you trying to act
like you're close now?

500
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,480
You're Young Hero Zhu, right?

501
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,480
Is this how you act chivalrous

502
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,440
in the martial arts world?

503
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,840
Harassing others

504
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,560
and not helping the needy?

505
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,880
So is this how the Five Lakes Alliance
cultivates its disciples?

506
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,320
That's marvelous!

507
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,560
Miss, please don't say that.

508
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,800
The Five Lakes Alliance

509
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,800
would never tolerate evil deeds

510
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,840
such as sexual harassment.

511
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,960
But Mr. Liu isn't one of our disciples.

512
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,160
He's just a local citizen.

513
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,040
Miss, please don't worry.

514
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,280
We'll definitely seek justice

515
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,320
and give you an explanation
for such a rascality.

516
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,880
Mr. Liu, how could you lie to me?

517
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,600
I…

518
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,360
It's my fault.

519
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,800
Hurry up and leave.

520
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,160
-You all, go back too.
-Let's go.

521
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,080
-Let's go.
-Go.

522
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,080
Young Hero Cao.

523
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,560
Can you not tell anyone else
about what happened today?

524
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,360
Especially my master.

525
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,840
All right, I got it.

526
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,320
Hurry up and go back.

527
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,240
Thank you. Goodbye.

528
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,640
That's all? We're not fighting anymore?

529
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,720
Yes, they were in the wrong.

530
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,240
Miss, you…

531
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,640
Do you really like to fight?

532
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,720
What? Am I not allowed to?

533
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,160
Yes, you can!

534
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,760
It's great.

535
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,040
I like to fight too.

536
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,320
Then fight with me.

537
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,400
No. How can I do that?

538
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,720
I can't fight you.

539
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,360
I never fought with girls.

540
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,360
What do you mean?
Are you looking down upon me?

541
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,960
Don't think that I can't beat you!

542
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,320
That's not what I meant!

543
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,240
It's just that you're very beautiful

544
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,920
which makes me want to protect you.

545
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,880
How would I try to hurt you?

546
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,360
Don't eat that.

547
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,800
All the dishes are cold.

548
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,240
I'll ask them to make some new ones.

549
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,080
-That's all because you were too slow!
-Miss--

550
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,760
Then place a new order.

551
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,800
FENGYANG PUB

552
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,560
Ah Xu, you want to drink again?

553
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,520
Are you addicted now?

554
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,280
This is where the martial artists gather.

555
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,240
If anything happens,

556
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,200
you can hear about it here.

557
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
Hear about it? How?

558
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,920
FENGYANG PUB

559
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,480
INCOMPUTABLE TREASURES

560
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,760
Sir, what would you like?

561
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,440
Do you have fresh tea leaves
from this spring?

562
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,719
Sir, you must be joking.

563
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
With so many martial artists and heroes
here recently,

564
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,040
we serve all kinds of tea.

565
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,400
Which region's tea would you like?

566
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,400
Do you have one roasted with raw rice?

567
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,679
Not in the city.

568
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,600
But I heard that there was a batch

569
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,080
imported by the government.

570
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,719
Our store can't afford it though.

571
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,520
Thank you for the tip.

572
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,320
I will get it for you right away.

573
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,080
Ah Xu.

574
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,280
What did the code phrases

575
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,679
you used just now mean?

576
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,719
Philanthropist Wen.

577
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,080
Don't you know the commonly used
code phrases in the martial arts world?

578
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,720
How would I not know?

579
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,880
I was just testing you.

580
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,640
Come.

581
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,760
-Drink!
-Drink!

582
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,920
Your good girl is being taken by bad guys.

583
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,920
Do you know Chief Gao well?

584
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,000
No, that's not it.

585
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,880
My master knows Chief Gao very well

586
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,760
and they are close friends.

587
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,240
Both sides meet often,

588
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,080
so we are all acquainted with each other.

589
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,520
That's amazing!

590
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,080
My name is Gu Xiang.

591
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,560
Let's be friends!

592
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,840
Here, a toast!

593
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,320
Here, cheers!

594
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,960
Cheers.

595
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,280
The immortals welcome Madam Xiang

596
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,280
Crowding around her like clouds in the sky

597
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,040
Fluttering like flying snow in the wind

598
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,960
Miss, your name Gu Xiang
is wonderful and exquisite.

599
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,560
Why do you keep speaking like a book?

600
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,440
I know someone
that would love to talk with you.

601
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,960
Really?

602
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,440
Of course. He loves eating

603
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,960
and talking like a literatus too!

604
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,600
I don't think so.

605
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,880
Come here, have a seat.

606
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,840
This is Cao Weining
from the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

607
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,720
He's a very important guest
of the Yueyang Sect.

608
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,520
Ms. Gu Xiang.

609
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,000
This is?

610
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,680
This is my master.

611
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,000
You're a maid?

612
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,760
What? Do you look down upon maids?

613
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,120
No, maids are great.

614
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,720
I thought that you were

615
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,720
a disciple of a martial arts master

616
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,120
or a daughter of a noble family.

617
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,240
I was afraid…

618
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,920
-Afraid of what?
-I…

619
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,920
Nothing.

620
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,240
I don't care if it's the Gentle Wind
Sword Sect or the Wind Stroke Sect.

621
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,240
Do you know our Ah Xiang well?

622
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,960
I don't. We just met.

623
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,800
-Master, let's eat--
-Since you're not close

624
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,400
and the person she's close with is here,

625
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,320
please conveniently leave now,

626
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,560
if you don't mind.

627
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,760
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

628
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,040
I'm sorry.

629
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,440
Master, what does
"conveniently leave" mean?

630
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,640
It's a nice way of saying "scram."

631
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,320
Ah Xiang.

632
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,720
Where did you meet

633
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,760
such a crafty and shallow person?

634
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,120
He mixed up Nine Songs
and the Ode to Goddess of Luo River.

635
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,800
Qu Yuan is rolling in his grave.

636
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,040
Who is Qu Yuan?
What does this have to do with him?

637
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,040
Come closer.

638
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,400
Either way, don't interact

639
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,000
with that uncultured boy again,

640
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,320
do you hear me?

641
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,840
I think he seems very cultured.

642
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,200
More so than me.

643
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,440
Compared to you?

644
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,480
Why isn't Sick Man here?

645
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,760
Where did he go?

646
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,160
Why are you asking about him?

647
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,800
Why?

648
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,600
Do you want him to marry you?

649
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,440
I don't dare.

650
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,960
He looks like he's nice,

651
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,560
but when no one's looking at him,

652
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,560
his glance is even scarier than a ghost's.

653
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
Really? Then why ask about him?

654
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,160
I feel like when he's around,

655
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,840
you feel more like a person.

656
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,240
You look and sound like a decent person.

657
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,880
How could you dine and dash?

658
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,000
You're trying to pay with calligraphy?

659
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,720
Which famous scholar are you?

660
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,040
Waiter, please be quiet.

661
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
Hey!

662
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,880
What happened? You don't have money?

663
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,120
No.

664
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,280
Sir, you invited her to a meal,
but have no money?

665
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,960
That's not right.

666
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,720
Don't worry, I have money.

667
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,600
How could you let a girl pay?

668
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,120
I will pay his bill.

669
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,320
Ah Xu, your wallet.

670
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,560
Where is your wallet?

671
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,680
One will often make careless mistakes.

672
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,080
When we were on the street,

673
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,200
I saw a handsome scholar.

674
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,560
He passed by me and even smiled at me.

675
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,840
Who knew that
he who could have been a friend,

676
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,480
was a thief instead?

677
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,920
Was it a scholar in green

678
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,040
with long eyes and fair skin?

679
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,080
I saw him in front of
the calligraphy and paintings stand

680
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,360
and we chatted for a bit.

681
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,560
It must be him.
He must have stolen my wallet.

682
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,200
Even you fell into Fang Buzhi's trap?

683
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,960
Fang…

684
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,880
Fang Buzhi?

685
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,120
Fang Buzhi the Thief Master?

686
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,880
I got it. He stole my wallet!

687
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,840
A kind and weak scholar like me

688
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,280
always takes a beating
out in the martial arts world.

689
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,560
It's all right.

690
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,840
Ah Xu, give me your wallet.

691
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,520
No.

692
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Why should I pay for you?
We are not close.

693
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,560
Master, who is that? Just leave him.

694
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,880
I have money.

695
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,520
Ah Xiang,

696
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,360
don't get involved in matters

697
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,000
you shouldn't.

698
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,560
You…

699
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,680
You are…

700
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,720
You are…

701
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,680
What do you think?

702
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,960
Your master has good taste, right?

703
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,400
I told you, he's no ordinary treasure.

704
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,600
Sick Man!

705
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,920
Your face is real?

706
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,920
Master, this is the first time
you're right!

707
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,920
Take your hands off.

708
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,920
Ah Xu.

709
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,320
Why do you always attack me
when I touch you,

710
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,200
but you just let her touch you?

711
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,160
If you were a cute girl,

712
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,720
you could touch me too.

713
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,360
Masters.

714
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,000
Can you all pay first?

715
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,280
Then you can touch whoever you want

716
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,800
and however you want, all right?

717
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,080
Ah Xu, your wallet.

718
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,160
I didn't expect our Ah Xu
to be a little millionaire.

719
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,720
Borrowing money comes with interest.

720
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,800
It will be 1% every day.

721
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,760
Master, we don't need his money.
We have our own.

722
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,320
If you don't pay me back,
then I'll take the girl.

723
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,360
-I--
-Ah Xiang.

724
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,240
If you stick your hands out again,

725
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,840
I promise that you won't just have money,
but you'll also have trouble.

726
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,960
Thank you so much, Master!

727
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,800
I'll return your change right away.

728
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,720
There's no need.

729
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,320
Bring me a full set

730
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,680
