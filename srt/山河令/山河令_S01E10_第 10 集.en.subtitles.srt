1
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,480
Ah Xu.

2
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,080
Isn't your bloodlust getting out of hand?

3
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,840
Why does every time I see you,

4
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,560
I would either murder people
or bury bodies?

5
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,880
The martial arts world is full of evil.

6
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,280
It's hard to live in that world.

7
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,560
Please rest in peace,

8
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Four Sages of Anji.

9
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,880
If you know it in the netherworld,

10
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,680
in your next life,

11
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,320
don't be too trusting.

12
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,000
You have to be careful
when making friends.

13
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Death is just another side of life,

14
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,520
but your death was too unjust.

15
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,080
They say when you have made your bed,

16
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,080
you must lie in it.

17
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,840
For now, I won't fight with you.

18
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,400
But the Four Sages of Anji

19
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,200
weren't bad people.

20
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,040
They died after suffering

21
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,480
an unreasonable crime.

22
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,440
Wen Kexing.

23
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,040
Are you happy now?

24
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,320
Are you satisfied?

25
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,960
Is this the result you wanted?

26
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,560
Bad peopleâ€¦

27
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Yes.

28
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,080
They aren't bad people.

29
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,800
But Chief Zhou,

30
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,840
do you dare say that
you've only ever killed bad people?

31
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,279
Good.

32
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,200
Very good.

33
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,600
YUEFAN TOWER

34
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,760
But Chief Zhou,

35
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,800
do you dare say that
you've only ever killed bad people?

36
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,960
Sir.

37
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,160
Sir.

38
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,760
I really thought he was my soul mate.

39
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,760
How can people like you and me

40
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,360
bear to be asked

41
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,880
about our lives?

42
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,120
Never mind.

43
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,480
It was my mistake.

44
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,160
Does it look good?

45
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,160
-Yes!
-Yes!

46
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,960
But Master,

47
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,160
why is this glaze broken?

48
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,440
Such a pity.

49
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,160
Valuable things are rarely sturdy.

50
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,880
"Iridescent Clouds scatter easily,
the Glaze shatters easily."

51
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Young Master.

52
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,640
Who can drink this jug with me tonight?

53
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,920
One jug in exchange for one gold bead.

54
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,080
-Let me!
-Let me!

55
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,360
Let me.

56
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,560
Pour me a glass.

57
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,120
Does that mean you're doing good deeds
to accumulate virtue?

58
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,000
I will never be a Buddha
until hell is empty.

59
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,400
There is always a dark side
to the bright side.

60
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,160
The fiercest ghosts tend to disguise
themselves as humans

61
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,880
and hide in the crowd.

62
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,960
I'm here

63
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,680
to reveal them

64
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,080
and destroy them.

65
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,760
Ah Xu.

66
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,920
Do you think this counts
as doing good deeds?

67
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,800
"I will never be a Buddha

68
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,920
until hell is empty."

69
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,240
"There's nothing undoable in the world.

70
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,720
Ignorant people always
create trouble for themselves."

71
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,640
Waiter!

72
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Bring me wine! Wine!

73
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,840
Master.

74
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,880
I really can't drink anymore.

75
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,760
I feel so dizzy.

76
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,200
Have you experienced this?

77
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,000
There was something

78
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,560
you really wanted,

79
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,600
but it disappeared.

80
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,160
You thought you would never find it again.

81
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,400
But years later,

82
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,880
it appeared again.

83
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,160
Isn't that a good thing?

84
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,800
Something that was once lost is back.

85
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,480
But as time goes by,

86
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,080
you can't afford to have it anymore.

87
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,440
CHONGWU PALACE

88
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,680
Shen Shen,

89
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,400
have you caught Feng Xiaofeng?

90
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,080
I'm sorry, Gao Chong.

91
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,920
I let him get away.

92
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,360
But don't worry, Gao Chong.

93
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,440
After the Heroes Conference,

94
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,680
I will definitely catch that demon
and avenge the Four Sages of Anji!

95
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,640
How are the funeral arrangements
for the Four Sages of Anji coming along?

96
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,760
Gao Chong, everything has been prepared
as per your order.

97
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,720
We're waiting
for their disciples and families

98
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,280
to lead their spirits back home.

99
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,520
However, when I went
to Renyi Hall that day,

100
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,240
I saw a half-finished grave that was dug.

101
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,960
I don't know who did it.

102
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Could it be

103
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,720
the Beggar Gangs?

104
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,680
Don't get carried away.

105
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,640
That's right!

106
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,800
That cunning old Huang

107
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,040
meant no good!

108
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,440
If you ask me, he has been coveting

109
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
the Glazed Armor since the beginning!

110
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,120
Ever since that nonsensical song
spread from Ghost Valley,

111
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,320
-the martial arts world--
-That song

112
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,040
didn't come from Ghost Valley.

113
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,240
What do you mean, Gao Chong?

114
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,000
"The Iridescent Clouds are scattered.

115
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,960
And the Glaze is shattered.

116
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,800
Who will cry
with the Ghosts on Mount Qingya?"

117
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,320
This clearly shows that Ghost Valley
is going against the Five Lakes Alliance.

118
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,680
Zhao Jing.

119
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Are you sure that Ao Laizi

120
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,480
was killed by the Ghost Valley?

121
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,480
Of course!

122
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,760
That night, when I followed Ao Laizi,

123
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
I followed him to a place
covered with yellow joss paper.

124
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
That was where I lost him.

125
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,200
And right after
I returned to Sanbai Manor,

126
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,440
they showed off their might
with the hanging corpses.

127
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,600
They are too unbridled!

128
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,760
Shen Shen, didn't I send you home

129
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,280
after you got drunk early that night?

130
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,640
Did you go

131
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,600
after Ao Laizi

132
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,360
to grab his Glazed Armor?

133
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,240
What do you mean by grabbing?

134
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,840
The Glazed Armor belongs to
our Five Lakes Alliance, to begin with!

135
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,960
Zhao Jing!

136
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,520
Shen Shen!

137
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's enough.

138
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,600
All in all,

139
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,720
it was Ao Laizi's fault for not being able

140
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
to protect the Glazed Armor.

141
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,480
If he had handed
the Glazed Armor over to us,

142
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,960
things wouldn't have ended up like this.

143
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,080
In any case,

144
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,320
I think we are still at fault

145
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,600
for what happened to him.

146
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,120
Besides, before Taichong died,

147
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,160
he gave the Glazed Armor to Ao Laizi.

148
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,480
We should comply with his last wish.

149
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,560
After all, we should respect the dead.

150
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,360
We can't force someone
to do things they don't want.

151
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,760
So what if we use force?

152
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,160
It's the martial arts world!

153
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
It has always been a place
where the strong prey on the weak!

154
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,880
Taichong died without children.

155
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,760
It should naturally be up to us

156
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,040
to take over his belongings and disciples.

157
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,400
What does it have to do
with an outsider like Ao Laizi?

158
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,880
He is incapable, yet insists on

159
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,680
getting involved
in Five Lakes Alliance's matters!

160
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,720
Shen Shen!

161
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,560
Are you saying

162
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,720
you can just go ahead
and raise hell at Mount Tai Sect?

163
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,560
Forcing people to come out
and beg for help?

164
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,200
Causing Ao Laizi to die
in a place far away from home?

165
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,120
What will the righteous
of the martial arts world

166
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,760
think of our Five Lakes Alliance?

167
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,920
I didn't kill him.

168
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,240
We'll just avenge him.

169
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,960
Master, all the people of Renyi Hall

170
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,920
look down on our Mount Hua Sect.

171
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Iâ€¦

172
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,840
Such insolence!

173
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,360
What's the use of saying all this?

174
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,200
Tell the disciples

175
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,360
not to participate
in this kind of matter in the future!

176
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,960
And report it to me immediately!

177
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,640
You want to join the gathering

178
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,480
of the world's greatest alliance
and the world's greatest sect?

179
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,400
Are you trying to get killed?

180
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,840
Master, why are you
overestimating other sects

181
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,440
and underestimating our own?

182
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,800
Back then,
our Five Mount and Sword Sects--

183
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,720
There are no
Five Mount and Sword Sects left.

184
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,040
Ao Laizi is no longer alive.

185
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,000
Mount Tai Sect has been destroyed.

186
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,120
Even if I have the ability

187
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
to move heaven and earth,

188
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,080
how can I support
the Five Mount and Sword Sects on my own?

189
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,400
Please forgive me.

190
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,560
Enough.

191
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,120
Is there still no news from Tianjie?

192
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,120
No.

193
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,640
Master.

194
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,320
-Is there any news about Tianjie yet?
-No.

195
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,280
Seniors from Mount Tai Sect
are here looking for you.

196
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,280
-They said--
-What did they say?

197
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,000
They said there is more

198
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,680
to Master Ao Laizi's death.

199
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,080
They said the Five Lakes Alliance did it.

200
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,520
Master, what shall we do then?

201
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,840
Tell them I'm not here.

202
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,040
How do I tell them that?

203
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,040
Tell them that I went out.

204
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,760
Tell them that I'm sick.

205
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,160
Tell them that I'm dead!

206
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,280
I don't care what you say.
I won't see them!

207
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,960
-Yes, Master.
-Go!

208
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,680
You should leave too!

209
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,880
Yes.

210
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,760
Han Ying?

211
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,800
It's an eventful time for Yueyang City.

212
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,320
With yesterday's incident in Renyi Hall,

213
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,360
if it wasn't for the fact that
the Window of Heaven's spy

214
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,760
happened to be our confidant,

215
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,040
you'd have been exposed by now!

216
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
How was your injury?

217
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,000
I've experienced ups and downs
in the court wearing an obscure face.

218
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,160
Days have gone by since I've left.

219
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,760
If I continue to live in fear,

220
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,119
what would be the point of leaving?

221
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,040
My lord,

222
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,280
you created the Nails of Seven Torments.

223
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,560
Is there really no cure?

224
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,480
There are the Healer Valley, the Witch
Doctor Valley, and the Western Regions.

225
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,400
There will always be a way
in this vast world.

226
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,760
-How about I accompany you--
-Enough.

227
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,960
I've done too many evil deeds.

228
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,720
God won't let me die this easily.

229
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,360
Han Ying.

230
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,120
When did you start to believe
in Gods and Buddhas?

231
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,880
I had no request before,

232
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,120
thus I did not believe it.

233
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,240
But now, I do,

234
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,480
thus I have to believe.

235
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,240
You will not be blessed
by Gods and Buddhas

236
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
on this journey I have taken you upon.

237
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,040
My lord,

238
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,160
it is either

239
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,240
this way

240
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,840
or death for us.

241
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,920
Any day we live is a day we gained.

242
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,160
I was lucky to have you
taking care of me last night.

243
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,880
Han Ying,

244
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,800
the more we are interconnected,

245
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,360
the more danger you'll find yourself in.

246
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,000
Lie low in the Window of Heaven.

247
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,440
Always remember to protect yourself.

248
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,600
I'm leaving.

249
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
My lord!

250
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,920
If anything is troubling youâ€¦

251
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,200
If there's something I can do for you,
I'll lay down my life with no regret!

252
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Butâ€¦

253
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,840
I already had the two pieces
of Glazed Armor sent to Jin.

254
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,120
Why do you have another piece of it?

255
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,560
-Two pieces?
-Yes.

256
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,080
My subordinates found
two identical pieces on Fang Buzhi,

257
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,480
the Nine Clawed Fox.

258
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,680
It's very strange.

259
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,960
It's not surprising.

260
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,840
There are even more.

261
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,160
There should be many imitations
floating around the martial arts world.

262
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,040
That's why these two pieces
look exactly the same

263
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,320
while the five pieces

264
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,320
of Glazed Armor
in the prince's painting are so varied.

265
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,600
It turns out they are all imitations.

266
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,280
Why did Lao Wen do such a wicked thing

267
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,840
which didn't even benefit himself?

268
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,240
Who made these imitations?
They must be evil at heart!

269
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
Han Ying.

270
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,280
The scramble for the Glazed Armor

271
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,400
will only get worse.

272
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,680
Just do what you're told,
do not investigate any further.

273
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,400
Never get involved.

274
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,560
My lord,

275
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,040
if you need me to,

276
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm willing to do anything
to find the two lost pieces of the Armor!

277
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,040
Don't do that!

278
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,840
You'll be violating the prince's orders.

279
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,480
When I first came to the Window of Heaven,

280
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,640
I swore to stay loyal to you forever

281
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
and not to Prince Jin!

282
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,200
I'm a dying man.

283
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,120
What would I want such ominous things for?

284
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,360
You only need to remember my words.

285
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,240
Living a good life

286
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,400
is the best way
to show your loyalty to me.

287
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,400
The 81 people who founded
the Window of Heaven with me

288
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,440
have been annihilated.

289
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,320
I do not wish to hear "my lord" anymore.

290
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,240
Butâ€¦

291
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,120
Even if all your brothers are gone,

292
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,120
-there's still--
-Enough.

293
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,720
Perhaps my end is near.

294
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,960
These days, I often wonder

295
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,720
if there really are Gods and Buddhas,

296
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,280
karma and retribution,

297
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,080
wouldn't I, with my blood-stained hands,

298
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,360
have to suffer in the deepest pits of hell
for thousands of years?

299
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,000
Elder Huang,

300
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,280
we got ourselves
into real trouble this time!

301
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,480
Which rascal did it?

302
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,320
He created a fake Glazed Armor

303
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,560
and played us like a fiddle!

304
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,800
Tao Hong,

305
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,480
stop repeating yourself.

306
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,280
We are all angry.

307
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,200
Gao Chong wants to marry off
his daughter to Zhang Chengling.

308
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,200
Step down.

309
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,720
Once Gao Chong gets serious,

310
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,280
he can even treat his brothers,

311
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,240
his own children, and disciples

312
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,600
like his pawns.

313
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,560
What do you mean?

314
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,840
He wants to marry off his own daughter

315
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,640
to that little bastard Zhang!

316
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,440
You could truly say,

317
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,480
"You can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs."

318
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,520
If that little bastard
really gets controlled by him,

319
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,520
no one from the outside

320
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,000
will gain any benefit from it.

321
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,480
XIANGZHU HALL

322
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,600
WOLONG

323
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,360
-Hero Gold Bean!
-Gu Xiang.

324
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,040
Silly boy, I've got something delicious!

325
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,000
Since you're putting so much effort
into your practice,

326
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,440
I bought you some nuts.
It will nourish your body!

327
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm fine, Gu Xiang.

328
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,280
I don't want it. Thank you.

329
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,400
Why?

330
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,600
Your senior disciple, Cao,
specially bought these Wolong nuts for me.

331
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,080
They are so delicious
and really popular in town!

332
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,400
The queue for it is really long, you know?
It tastes really good. Come and try some!

333
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,240
What's wrong?

334
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,960
What happened? Who bullied you?

335
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,640
Tell me! I'll break their legs!

336
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,280
Don't cry, you good-for-nothing
Hero Gold Bean.

337
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,760
You can't stop talking
when I tell you to be quiet.

338
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,880
But when you should be talking,
you don't say anything.

339
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,880
It's all right.

340
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,320
If you can't beat them,
you can always tell on them.

341
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
Let's go and tell on them.

342
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,160
Gu Xiang.

343
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,920
Why do they hate me so much?

344
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
They saidâ€¦

345
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,200
Silly boy, if you tell on them,

346
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,120
-Gao Chong will definitely--
-Gu Xiang.

347
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,600
You two know each other?

348
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,280
Yes, Xiaolian.

349
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,480
You didn't know?
We've known each other for a long time!

350
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,320
What can I do for you, Gao Xiaolian?

351
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,680
What happened to you?

352
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,760
Who bullied you?

353
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,680
That's too much!

354
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
Gao Xiaolian, no one bullied me.

355
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
I was practicing moves with the disciples.

356
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,360
My skills are poor.
I have nothing to say for myself.

357
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,720
Practicing moves?

358
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,360
You've only just arrived here.

359
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,000
You haven't even learned any skills yet!

360
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,040
I came at the wrong time.

361
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,760
You two must want
to speak in private, right?

362
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,920
I'll be leaving.

363
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,760
Gu Xiang gave this to you, didn't she?

364
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,480
Those are Wolong nuts.

365
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,280
If you like it, you can have it.

366
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,560
Gu Xiang is so kind to you.

367
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,040
These Wolong nuts
are truly popular in Yueyang City.

368
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,080
It's really hard to get them.

369
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,800
I was worried
you aren't used to eating our food,

370
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,240
so I especially asked someone
to teach me how to make

371
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,760
these Yueyang-style Osmanthus cakes

372
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,280
since this is your hometown's specialty.

373
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,280
Thank you, Gao Xiaolian.

374
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,640
I feel very grateful.

375
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,200
But please take back
this gracious present.

376
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,800
Chengling.

377
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,000
Father told me to take care of you.

378
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,360
I'm grateful for
Chief Gao and your kindness.

379
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,160
Thank you.

380
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,800
Chengling.

381
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,920
Why do you keep calling me
"Gao Xiaolian" today?

382
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,160
Why are you being so formal?

383
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,240
Don't you usually call me--

384
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,600
As you said,

385
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,640
we used to address each other
like brother and sister.

386
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,200
I bear no grudge against you.

387
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,440
Even though I'm still young,

388
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,440
I'm not a puppet at the mercy of others.

389
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,040
Chief Gao made arrangements
for my marriage.

390
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,560
I didn't know about it and I'm afraid

391
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,600
I don't deserve this blessing.

392
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,720
-Chengling.
-Gao Xiaolian,

393
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,280
you need not say more.

394
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,760
I know myself.

395
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,680
If I say yes to this marriage,

396
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,360
I'd be taking what isn't mine to take
and people will misunderstand.

397
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,680
I may feel looked down upon.

398
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,800
What's wrong with you?

399
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,640
Is it wrong for her to treat you well?

400
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,200
I know Xiaolian treats me well.

401
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,440
I'm justâ€¦

402
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,720
All right.

403
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,400
Stop it, Hero Gold Bean.

404
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,960
Gu Xiang.

405
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,680
Where are Master and Mr. Wen?

406
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,320
I don't know.

407
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,920
Why are you looking for them?

408
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,720
Why?

409
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,320
You aren't happy living here?

410
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,600
I'm not living here.

411
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,440
This is a house arrest.

412
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,080
Spring is constant in all four seasons,

413
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,000
knowing everything in the world.

414
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,400
Master.

415
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,960
What happened?

416
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,640
Something big.

417
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,120
Gao Chong wants his daughter
to marry Zhang Chengling.

418
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,440
He's going all-in.

419
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,320
Yes.

420
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,280
Originally, Gao Xiaolian
was with Deng Kuan,

421
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,160
the eldest disciple of the Yueyang Sect.

422
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,480
Even though there was
no promise of marriage yet,

423
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
everyone has already accepted the fact.

424
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,800
Once Gao Chong announced his decision,
many people began commenting on it.

425
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,720
That's right. That Deng Kuan,

426
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,480
the survivor of the last Funeral Game,

427
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,200
returned to the Yueyang Sect
a few days ago.

428
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,560
He was hurt by someone
and still lies unconscious.

429
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,400
By someone?

430
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,680
I was at the Funeral Game that day.

431
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,240
Deng Kuan only suffered some scratches.

432
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,440
He should've recovered long ago.
He shouldn't be unconscious anymore.

433
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,960
Is the corpse incident in the theater

434
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,160
Changing Ghost's work?

435
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,400
How much do you and Tragicomic Ghost know?

436
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,920
Not much. Is there anything wrong?

437
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,400
What did Zhang Chengling say?

438
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,840
If he marries Gao Chong's sole daughter,

439
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,080
he'd be climbing
the ladder of society quickly.

440
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,760
That kid seems quite stupid,

441
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,960
but on this matter,

442
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,560
he clearly knows what's going on.

443
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,080
Gao Xiaolian gave him hints many times.

444
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,800
But he ignored them all.

445
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,560
But I think that Gao Chong
was being too obvious.

446
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,680
It's as if he keeps Chengling arrested

447
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,200
inside Yueyang Sect.

448
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,600
That place is heavily guarded all around.

449
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,760
He can't get out and no one can get in.

450
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,640
Master.

451
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,080
Chengling asked me
if there's a way to get him out.

452
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
He misses you two a lot.

453
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,720
Why?

454
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,800
It's nothing.

455
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,960
I just find him a bit pitiful.

456
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,800
You dare

457
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,240
to criticize my plan?

458
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
I wouldn't dare.

459
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,880
Did you forget who you are

460
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,400
after wearing that human skin for so long?

461
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,560
Don't forget that you are
the Heartless Amethyst Fiend.

462
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,520
Humans and ghosts
travel on different roads.

463
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,800
You pity him.

464
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,480
Who will pity you?

465
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,600
If Gao Chong
watches Zhang Chengling so closely,

466
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,120
he must have something planned.

467
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,040
Watch him.

468
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,800
If anything happens,

469
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,000
report to me immediately.

470
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,600
Ah Xiang.

471
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,240
Do you think I'm crazy?

472
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,680
Aren't you afraid
that I will go crazy someday

473
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,320
and kill you too?

474
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,680
I'll follow you even if you go crazy.

475
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,480
If you kill me,
I'll even follow you in death.

476
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,560
Good.

477
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,360
In that case,

478
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,920
I shall go crazy to the end.

479
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
PROFOUND EXPECTATIONS

480
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,920
The Heroes Conference will be held soon.

481
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,800
Everyone, do your best.

482
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,080
Do not slack off.

483
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,680
-Yes!
-Yes!

484
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,120
Gao Chong, don't worry too much.

485
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,320
It has been quite peaceful lately.

486
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,640
There should be no problem.

487
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,160
Shen Shen, you don't know.

488
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,840
The martial arts world
seems peaceful on the surface,

489
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,120
but in fact, danger lurks everywhere.

490
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,400
Things are not that bad.

491
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,160
Right now,

492
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,000
heroes from all over the world
have gathered in Yueyang City.

493
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,840
Ghost Valley wouldn't dare
to cause trouble again.

494
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,920
Humans are unpredictable.

495
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,440
The Five Lakes Alliance has many enemies.

496
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,960
Ghost Valley isn't the only one

497
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,600
that wants to watch us fall.

498
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,760
Father. Mr. Shen.

499
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,120
Seeing how troubled
you both have been lately,

500
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,640
I made some lotus seed soup for you.

501
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,720
Good girl.

502
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,040
Gao Chong,
it's so great to have a daughter.

503
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,560
We won't eat it.

504
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,560
Bring it to Chengling later.

505
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,960
Father, I don't want

506
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,040
to do that anymore.

507
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,520
Do what?

508
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,200
Father.

509
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,120
Why did you betroth me to him

510
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,800
without even asking me first?

511
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,960
He is still a kid!

512
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,760
Children will grow up.

513
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,280
Your marriage has been decided in advance.

514
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,720
You can make the marriage official
in several years.

515
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,880
But he doesn't like me!

516
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,280
Parents should decide
their children's marriage!

517
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,000
How can a girl ask something like this

518
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
from her father?

519
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,440
You're shameless!

520
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,600
Gao Chong.

521
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,000
Calm down.

522
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,120
Listen to her first.

523
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,240
Father, so you know
that I have my pride too.

524
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,120
I listened to your orders

525
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,640
and repeatedly expressed
my goodwill to Chengling.

526
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,440
But he turned me down again and again.

527
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,840
I know

528
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,040
I've never done Chengling wrong!

529
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,240
I don't understand
why you're doing this to me

530
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,680
and why Chengling
is treating me like this!

531
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,480
Enough.

532
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,880
Don't bring it to him then.

533
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,120
I'll have someone send it to him.

534
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,600
Go.

535
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,520
Father!

536
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,800
Just go!

537
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,639
I'm in a really good mood today.

538
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,520
-Can I listen to a song?
-Sure.

539
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,639
Of course!

540
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,800
Anything you want.

541
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,440
I'm only responsible for the bill.

542
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,800
Miss, come here.

543
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,040
Sing me a song.

544
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,400
What song should I choose?

545
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,920
Which music house are you from?

546
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,239
We are from Qingyu Tower.

547
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,920
Qingyu Tower?

548
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
It's a good place.

549
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,400
"Happy Meeting." Can you play it?

550
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,360
Yes.

551
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,000
Madam, please tune the qin.

552
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,760
"Happy Meeting"?

553
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,120
Is Ah Xiang trying

554
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,000
to tell me something through this song?

555
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,080
ROASTED FISH

556
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,040
QINGYU TOWER

557
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,160
Qianqiao, the chief asks for you.

558
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,480
LUO MANSION

559
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,120
You are

560
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,200
very good.

561
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,720
I allowed 3,000 ghosts of Mount Qingya
to break the oath and leave the valley

562
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,840
so you could catch the Hanged Ghost

563
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,560
and take back the Glazed Armor he stole.

564
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,000
Yet

565
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,320
you haven't even found
a single hair of his.

566
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,040
You caused quite a lot of trouble instead.

567
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,840
You organized three Happy Funerals,

568
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,160
annihilated the Danyang Sect,

569
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,280
destroyed the Mirror Lake Sect,

570
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,280
killed Mount Tai Sect's chief,

571
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,000
and publicly threw out the corpses
to provoke the Five Lakes Alliance.

572
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,560
In just three months,

573
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,680
you destroyed the peace
that has been maintained for 20 years

574
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,360
between the Ghost Valley
and the Five Lakes Alliance.

575
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,320
Very good. Very good indeed.

576
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,040
-Forgive us for our crimes.
-Forgive us for our crimes.

577
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,720
Crimes?

578
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,520
Do you think I'm being sarcastic?

579
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,040
I'm praising you.

580
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,440
Although you didn't do
any proper business these three months,

581
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,880
we are evil ghosts.

582
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
And as evil ghosts,

583
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,000
bringing disasters to the world
is our job.

584
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,880
What crimes did you commit?

585
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,320
You did a great job!

586
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,360
I want to give you a reward!

587
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,200
Get up.

588
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,160
I said

589
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,120
get up!

590
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,320
Come!

591
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,880
As for merit,

592
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,720
Tragicomic Ghost,

593
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,360
were the Happy Funerals fun?

594
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,040
Wasn't it a great idea of mine?

595
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,400
Watching those fake things
show their true faces

596
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,920
and kill each other like crazy animals,

597
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,240
wasn't it even more fun
than killing them yourself?

598
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
You are wise, Chief.

599
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,320
Danyang Sect shelters evil people
and countenances evil practices.

600
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,480
Lu Taichong deserves all the credit.

601
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,040
It's fine to kill all the disciples
of the Danyang Sect,

602
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,720
but Lu Taichong died from anger.

603
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,000
Originally, I wanted to keep him alive
to deal with him slowly.

604
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,480
What a misstep.

605
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,000
This counts as your mistake.

606
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,960
I won't reward or punish you.

607
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,560
Do you accept it?

608
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,400
I do.

609
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,960
Great.

610
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,200
Let's talk about the second merit.

611
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,360
Mirror Lake Sect's overnight annihilation.

612
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,760
Great job!

613
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,160
Who did it?

614
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,960
Isn't he here?

615
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,200
That only leaves Long-Tongued Ghost.

616
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,640
Changing Ghost, where is your subordinate?

617
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,400
Chief.

618
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,600
Ever since we left the valley,

619
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,800
Long-Tongued Ghost
no longer listened to my orders.

620
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,160
I believe that Long-Tongued Ghost
has already defected.

621
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,800
As for the destruction
of the Mirror Lake Sect,

622
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,320
it should be Long-Tongued Ghost's work.

623
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,280
I was unable to govern my subordinate.

624
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,400
Please bestow upon me
the sin of incompetence.

625
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,280
Long-Tongued Ghost
wouldn't listen to you anymore?

626
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,000
That's nothing.

627
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,760
In the Ghost Valley,
the weak are the prey of the strong.

628
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,040
The able ones are the ones in charge.

629
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,000
If he has the ability to kill you,

630
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,040
I will make him
the head of the Ten Devils.

631
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,880
If you have the ability to kill me,

632
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,040
I'll admire you even in death!

633
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,360
I wouldn't dare.

634
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,280
You wouldn't dare?

635
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,480
That's funny.

636
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,360
The evil ghosts of Mount Qingya
fight for their life and death

637
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,160
and struggle every single day of the year.

638
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,280
If I sat injured here today,

639
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,360
would you dare say
you won't kill me and replace me?

640
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,280
Is that so, White Grim Reaper?

641
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,560
I wouldn't dare!

642
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,560
I wouldn't dare!

643
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,200
Chief!

644
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,320
-I wouldn't dare!
-Stand up.

645
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,520
Everything is fine. Don't be afraid.

646
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,160
Chief.

647
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,120
Chief!

648
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,120
Please have mercy, Chief!

649
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,320
Changing Ghost.

650
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,480
He is your subordinate.

651
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,800
Do you think he deserves to die?

652
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,840
He doesn't deserve it! He doesn't!

653
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,640
Please calm down, Chief!

654
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,280
Ghost Valley requires manpower!

655
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,320
Please, Chief!

656
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,880
You're right.

657
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,360
Ghost Valley requires manpower.

658
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,680
The martial arts world

659
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,520
is full of rotten people.

660
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,040
I want to use them too.

661
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,200
But I am the chief of Ghost Valley.

662
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,720
Ghosts are

663
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,080
the only ones I can use.

664
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,760
Isn't that right?

665
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Black Grim Reaper.

666
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,760
You are right, Chief.

667
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
Black Grim Reaper.

668
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,680
I turned

669
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,000
your good brother into a ghost
for no reason.

670
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,200
Do you feel resentful?

671
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,000
Chief, it was great that you killed him.

672
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,960
How boring.

673
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,720
Come on.

674
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,360
Let's talk about your merits
for the time being.

675
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,200
Changing Ghost.

676
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,720
Was it you who came up with the plan
to throw out corpses

677
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,040
in Yueyang City?

678
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
Yes.

679
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,880
Did someone assist you?

680
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,080
I ordered my subordinates to do it.

681
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,080
I'm not too sure

682
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,680
about the specific details.

683
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,760
I don't think there was any assistance
from the outside.

684
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,480
Who did you send to handle this?

685
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,240
White Grim Reaper.

686
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,920
Well planned.

687
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,720
Changing Ghost, you planned it too well.

688
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,840
White Grim Reaper is guilty
of his inability.

689
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,440
You get rid of
my subordinates for me, Chief.

690
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,800
It's great that you killed him.

691
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,680
It was great.

692
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,240
And who killed Mount Tai Sect's chief?

693
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,880
Happy Ghost.

694
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,400
Your marks

695
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,880
were left behind on his face.

696
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,040
Chief.

697
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,040
It wasn't me.

698
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,160
Someone set me up.

699
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,200
If it was really me,

700
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,480
I'd never deny it.

701
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,440
Is it funny?

702
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,280
Chief, this is an old problem of mine.

703
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,320
It's a breathing issue.

704
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,960
I can't speak without laughing.

705
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,440
Please have mercy, Chief.

706
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,640
It is quite funny.

707
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,080
Seeing you guys so scared

708
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,640
is definitely funny.

709
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,840
But it's only funny for a while.

710
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,760
We have to find some other fun.

711
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,520
The gathering of
those righteous bastards is in two days.

712
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,600
Come on. Speak freely.

713
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,080
We have to devise a cunning plan

714
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,320
to utterly destroy the pride

715
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
of the Five Lakes Alliance's survivors,

716
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,080
the three dogs,
so much they can't reassemble them again.

717
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,960
That would truly be funny.
