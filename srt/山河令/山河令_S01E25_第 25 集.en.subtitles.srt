1
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,000
GENTLE WINDS AND LIGHT CLOUDS

2
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
What's wrong?

3
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,120
You couldn't sleep well?

4
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,080
I had a bad dream
and I couldn't fall asleep again.

5
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,680
So I decided to take a walk.

6
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,200
It's raining.

7
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,000
That explains the coldness in my dream.

8
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,480
Yes.

9
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,640
Winter comes after the first frost.

10
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,240
The Spring Festival comes
after Laba Festival.

11
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,080
Ah Xu,

12
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,800
it would be great if we could live

13
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,080
in Four Seasons Manor forever.

14
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,840
Why can't we?

15
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,280
I'll do it. You don't know
where the coal is placed.

16
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,880
How about having some wine

17
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
since we can't sleep?

18
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,800
Sure.

19
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,240
Wait.

20
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,560
How secretive.

21
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,840
Don't you know

22
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,520
these things go well with wine?

23
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,880
You have it.

24
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm fine with just wine.

25
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,240
Drinking without food
will hurt your stomach.

26
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,560
This tin contains six kinds of nuts,

27
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,520
each of which has a special effect
and is good for health.

28
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,160
This is Wolong's specialty
which is popular all over the country.

29
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,480
You should have some every day.

30
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,520
Lao Wen,

31
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,240
don't let the world
of martial arts hamper you.

32
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,920
With such eloquence,

33
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,520
you should have been rich
by doing business.

34
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,240
Come on. Try it.

35
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
No, I don't want it.

36
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,800
Ah Xu,

37
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,200
look at you.

38
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,760
You are already this old,

39
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,520
but you are still a picky eater
and a night owl.

40
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,040
How can you set an example
for your disciple?

41
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,720
Do you think I want to stay up late?

42
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,000
Get some nails on your chest
before you talk.

43
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,480
You slept well the past few days,
didn't you?

44
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,480
That's because

45
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,720
of the Drunk Like a Dream
I found in the manor.

46
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,840
I remember the night

47
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,520
when you smelt the scent
of Drunk Like a Dream

48
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,960
and shouted the name "Zhou Zishu"
for the first time.

49
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,040
Can you tell me now

50
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,720
what you saw?

51
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,000
I dreamed

52
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,120
of myself being seven years old.

53
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,840
The three of us in my family
came to the Four Seasons Manor.

54
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,080
Mother and Father started a small clinic
at the foot of the hill.

55
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,720
I practiced martial arts with Master
at the manor during the day

56
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,920
and went home for dinner in the evening.

57
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,280
Those Drug Men in my dream

58
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,560
were like wild dogs,

59
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,640
chasing and biting me for no reason.

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,240
You appeared as Zhou Zishu

61
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,440
and sometimes as Zhen Yiguo,

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,560
standing in front of me and protecting me.

63
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,320
Zhen Yiguo?

64
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,920
Did you forget that?

65
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,120
The little dog that followed you around.

66
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,800
What's its name?

67
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
It is Yiguo.

68
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Yiguo?

69
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,600
Wait for me.

70
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,920
Let me see it.

71
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,760
I kept it.

72
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Hero Qin said

73
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,240
he was going to cook it in a pot.

74
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,800
So my parents gave it this name.

75
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,960
I knew that you have

76
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,120
a deep connection
with the Four Seasons Manor,

77
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,960
I just didn't expect that…

78
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,640
The Four Seasons Manor has vanished
for a long time.

79
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,440
I saw you using Swift Moving Steps

80
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,320
and just took it as a clue,

81
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,240
so I followed you.

82
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,880
Even when you drew
the White Cloth Sword out,

83
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
I was not quite sure.

84
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,560
At last,

85
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,800
you said your surname was Zhou.

86
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,840
I guess…

87
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,760
Take a lover's hand
and watch the clouds unfold.

88
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,240
What a good name!

89
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,920
Lao Wen.

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,320
Your name, Wen Kexing…

91
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,920
My father's surname was Wen,

92
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,240
but he was an orphan

93
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,360
and later adopted the surname
of the Healer Valley's old chief.

94
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,000
Since the old chief decided

95
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,520
to banish my father,

96
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,800
there were no more reasons
to adopt his surname, right?

97
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,680
I'm a lone bird and a traveler of no root.

98
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,080
This new name

99
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,240
suited me well.

100
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,400
But now you…

101
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,000
Before meeting you and Chengling,

102
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,720
I was going to wander around the world

103
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,480
and drink myself to death

104
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,480
to end this miserable life.

105
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,160
I thought I was homeless,

106
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,000
but now it's good

107
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,320
that we are all back.

108
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,840
Come on,

109
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,400
I'll toast to you,

110
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,560
the lone bird and traveler of no root.

111
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,600
Take a lover's hand
and watch the clouds unfold.

112
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,800
I'm going to stay here forever.

113
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,720
As long as Master Ye can heal me,

114
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Chengling and I

115
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,600
will live here forever.

116
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,680
Lao Wen,

117
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,960
you are welcome here at all times.

118
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,360
Traveling is fun,

119
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,520
but home is sweeter.

120
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,280
Ah Xiang.

121
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,880
What took you so long to get the water?

122
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
Let's go!

123
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,320
Ah Xiang,
I think I saw Tao Hong and Lu Liu.

124
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,160
Who? Hua Hong and Liu Lu?

125
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,560
The old couple who attacked us

126
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,240
and abducted Xiaolian at Yueyang Sect.

127
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,840
Are you sure about that?

128
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,840
-Is it really them?
-I'm sure.

129
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,880
I'm sure that the girl
was Xiaolian in disguise.

130
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,480
When I was getting water,

131
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,800
I heard her voice.

132
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,360
I guess her acupuncture points
were restrained,

133
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,640
so she can't move or speak
but can only eat and drink.

134
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,080
Hanged Ghost's Soul Winding Box

135
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,600
broke each
of Tao Hong's and Lu Liu's arms.

136
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,200
You were too far away to see clearly.

137
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,040
That old couple
both have one of their arms broken,

138
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,280
covering them
with their sleeves on purpose.

139
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,160
If it is really them…

140
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
Ah Xiang, I'm sure it is them.

141
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,000
We found them by luck
and shouldn't lose them again.

142
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,120
Let's think of something.

143
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,400
Ah Xiang, what's wrong with you?

144
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,480
Ah Xiang, don't be afraid.

145
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
No matter how strong they are,

146
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,480
I'll give it my all
to protect you and Xiaolian.

147
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,240
Who can you protect with your ability?

148
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,640
Cao Weining, how about just letting it go?

149
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,760
You almost lost your life last time.

150
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,440
Ah Xiang, how could you say that?

151
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,480
How could I leave Xiaolian like this?

152
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,680
If you're scared, just stay here. I'll go.

153
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,960
The worst case is to get beaten to death.

154
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,800
Even so, it's much better
than being a coward.

155
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Go then!

156
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,800
We'll see who you can save
at the expense of your life.

157
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,760
Stop!

158
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,560
Cao Weining!

159
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,320
How dare you treat me like this?

160
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,520
You…

161
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,880
You promised my master
that you would never abandon me.

162
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,640
Ah Xiang, I will never abandon you.

163
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,800
But loyalty is more important than love.

164
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,280
How could I leave my good friend behind?

165
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,520
I won't deserve your kindness
if I do that.

166
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,800
Did I say I wouldn't let you go?

167
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,680
I'm just stopping you from dying in vain.

168
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,640
If we can't confront them by force,
we need to outwit them.

169
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,920
Ah Xiang,

170
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,600
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,880
I misunderstood you.

172
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,840
Stop talking nonsense.

173
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,880
Let's save her first.

174
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,360
You have to follow them first,

175
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,760
tailing them and leaving marks.

176
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,040
We're not far from the Broken Sword Manor.

177
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,160
They're part of the Five Lakes Alliance.

178
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,880
I'll ask them for help
to stop the old couple.

179
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,000
Ah Xiang, that's a good idea.

180
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,280
You are really smart.

181
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,480
Stop wasting your words.

182
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,240
I'll remember this grudge.
We'll talk about it later.

183
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,280
Hurry up and go!

184
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,600
This fool.

185
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,400
He's really a big fool.

186
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,760
How can he live alone after I leave?

187
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,280
The thought of him getting bullied

188
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,760
makes me angry.

189
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,720
Elder Huang,

190
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,920
haven't we agreed

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
to meet at the ruined temple
in Great Stone Town?

192
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,240
Why did you come in advance?

193
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,720
I was exposed in Great Stone Town

194
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,160
and was hunted by the Scorpion Sect.

195
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,920
I just got rid of them.

196
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,040
We were tricked
by that bastard, Zhao Jing.

197
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,720
Both the righteous
and the evil are hunting me.

198
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,440
The former wants to arrest me
and the latter wants to kill me.

199
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,640
Ms. Gao,

200
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,840
do you know the relationship
between Zhao Jing and the Scorpion Sect?

201
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,920
I've told you before

202
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,360
that Mr. Zhao would definitely
come to save me.

203
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,920
Stop dreaming.

204
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,920
I sent him a message to exchange hostages,

205
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,000
but he didn't give any response.

206
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,680
I guess he hopes that we kill you

207
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,360
so there will be no more witnesses.

208
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,120
Darn him!

209
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,040
Perhaps the trap which killed Gao Chong

210
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,640
was also set by that bastard.

211
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,800
Huang He,

212
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,520
from what you just said,

213
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,680
we risked our reputation

214
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,600
to abduct this girl for you,

215
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,320
living in the wild
and hiding our tails all the way,

216
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,240
but it turns out to be a waste!

217
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,960
No one can predict fate.

218
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,560
Who could foresee Gao Chong
would just die like that?

219
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,840
Who could foresee that his brothers

220
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,120
do not care about
his only daughter at all?

221
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,120
What's done is done.

222
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,000
Zhao Jing will not exchange
the Glazed Armor for her.

223
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,480
Hey, girl.

224
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,480
If you can't find anyone to pay
for your freedom,

225
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,400
then you are a worthless piece of rubbish.

226
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,680
Believe it or not,

227
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,280
I'll sell you to the worst brothel.

228
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,640
Huang He,

229
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,680
you're as old as her grandfather.

230
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,480
Don't you feel ashamed

231
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,320
for saying such dirty words?

232
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,320
Madam Tao Hong,

233
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,200
if not so,

234
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,760
how could vengeance be taken

235
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,160
for those valiant heroes
who died at Mount Qingya?

236
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,040
The Five Lakes Alliance
has caused so many deaths.

237
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,880
The demon Gao Chong's death alone
is far from enough.

238
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,720
We can't let the demon's daughter
get away from it.

239
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,520
My father is not a demon.

240
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,080
My father didn't kill anyone!

241
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,040
Shut up!

242
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,960
You know nothing.

243
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,560
This little girl
doesn't know anything, does she?

244
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,120
Then I'll tell you now.

245
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,560
Twenty years ago,

246
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,760
the Battle of Mount Qingya caused
numerous people to lose their lives

247
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,720
because they were deceived
by the Five Lakes Alliance.

248
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,640
They besieged Rong Xuan

249
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,360
only for his Glazed Armor,

250
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,480
yet they did it in the name
of slaying the demons.

251
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,920
Countless people were cheated
to sacrifice their lives in the battle.

252
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,920
The only child of Tao Hong and Lu Liu

253
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,120
died from severe injuries in this battle.

254
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,240
The Five Lakes Alliance

255
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,360
owes its rise to those righteous ones
who died miserably in this battle.

256
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,120
What a tragedy!

257
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,800
Those who were buried in Mount Qingya

258
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,120
had no idea what they died for until now.

259
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,080
You are lying!

260
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,040
Huang He, we are all smart foxes.

261
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,520
Do you think you can trick me?

262
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,120
Since she is worthless,

263
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,440
all right then.

264
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,120
Why don't we stop
torturing this innocent girl

265
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,160
and just kill her?

266
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,720
-No!
-Stop!

267
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,079
Xiaolian.

268
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,200
Cao Weining?

269
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
Elder Huang,

270
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,640
I've always respected you as a senior,

271
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,079
but I can't believe
you're doing such an evil thing.

272
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,720
Is your master here?

273
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Better late than never.
Come to the righteous side now.

274
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,440
Help me kill them and save Ms. Gao.

275
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,880
Where did this idiot come from?

276
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,800
Old man, are you hearing this?

277
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,080
He asked Huang He
to come to the righteous side.

278
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,120
Stop laughing!

279
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,680
Young man, are you her lover?

280
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,600
Risking your life to save her,
don't you fear death?

281
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,040
No. I'm not afraid
as I am doing the right thing.

282
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,880
Let go of her now and you won't
be held responsible for this.

283
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Otherwise…

284
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,480
All righteous clans are looking for her.

285
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,160
What?

286
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,200
Huang He, your cover is blown, isn't it?

287
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,200
You were trying to trick us

288
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,240
to leave her to you,

289
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,640
so you could take all the benefits alone.

290
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,320
We've done all the dirty work,

291
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,080
now you want to get rid of us?

292
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,760
That won't be so easy!

293
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,880
Let's just see who's better.

294
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,560
Xiaolian, let's go!

295
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,240
Quickly!

296
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,040
Where are you going?

297
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,320
Elder Huang has died in our hands.

298
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,800
Girl, come with me.

299
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,800
Xiaolian, run. I'll stop them.

300
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,040
Let's go together.

301
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,040
Run!

302
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,720
Weining!

303
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,200
Tao Hong and Lu Liu, how dare you!

304
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,280
Mr. Shen.

305
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,920
I'm warning you.

306
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,840
Leave Xiaolian alone.

307
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,160
Scram!

308
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,440
Ah Xiang.

309
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,320
Cao Weining.

310
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,400
Cao Weining, are you all right?

311
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,600
Are you all right?

312
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,000
Shen Shen, stop your nonsense.

313
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,160
We're taking this girl today.

314
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,600
My dear.

315
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,280
Mr. Shen.

316
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,560
My dear.

317
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,880
-My dear.
-My dear.

318
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,480
-Leave.
-My dear.

319
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,080
A couple is just like birds in the woods.

320
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,120
They run for their lives
as disaster comes.

321
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,640
Run.

322
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,200
Shut up!

323
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,760
Shen Shen, do it now.

324
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,800
Shen Shen,

325
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,520
please let go of my wife.

326
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,280
I…

327
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,000
-I--
-There's no need to beg them.

328
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,160
My dear,

329
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,240
isn't it good for us to die together?

330
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,080
I'll be your husband

331
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,480
in our next life

332
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,600
to let you bully me.

333
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,040
Fine, I'll give you what you want.

334
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,200
Mr. Shen, wait.

335
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,400
Sir and madam.

336
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,560
Elder Huang said

337
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,360
that back then,

338
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,800
it was the Battle of Mount Qingya
led by the Five Lakes Alliance

339
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,400
that caused the death of your child.

340
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,600
Is that true?

341
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,400
Why are you asking us?

342
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,320
Ask Hero Shen.

343
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,840
The Five Lakes Alliance

344
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,880
cost us our child,

345
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,600
hurting us both mentally and physically.

346
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,800
I live only to seek revenge!

347
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
If I can't get my revenge while I'm alive,

348
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,120
I'll be a ghost

349
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,480
haunting Gao Chong.

350
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,160
So…

351
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,560
they were telling the truth.

352
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,600
That's why my father, all these years…

353
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Mr. Shen.

354
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,960
-Please let go of them.
-Xiaolian.

355
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,160
You were kidnapped for so long.

356
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,160
It was Elder Huang's conspiracy.

357
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,920
They were used by him.

358
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,880
Although she kidnapped me,

359
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,440
she has a good nature.

360
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,120
Every time Elder Huang tried to abuse me,

361
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,520
she would stop him.

362
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,920
Mr. Shen,

363
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,160
when can the circle of revenge be stopped?

364
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,560
We, the Five Lakes Alliance,

365
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,040
owe them a life.

366
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,480
We should return it today.

367
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,840
Stupid girl, we don't need your pity!

368
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,080
Is that the way to make things even?

369
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,840
My son died at a young age.

370
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,240
-Shut up, dear.
-I--

371
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,960
Chief Shen,

372
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,840
we have been out
in the martial arts world for 20 years.

373
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,120
Although we aren't considered
kind or righteous,

374
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,400
we never lie.

375
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,080
Today,

376
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,640
if you spare us,

377
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,160
we will

378
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,160
quit this martial arts world.

379
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,280
Shut up.

380
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,240
You can't decide for me.

381
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,320
Shen Shen.

382
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,520
He's afraid,

383
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,840
but I'll never stop
taking my revenge against the Alliance.

384
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,080
Kill me if you dare!

385
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,560
When the Battle of Mount Qingya happened,

386
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,600
Xiaolian was not born.

387
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,480
The resentment of the last generation

388
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,440
shouldn't involve the kids.

389
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,960
Considering that you kept Xiaolian safe,

390
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,920
I'll let you go.

391
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,840
If you still want to take revenge
on the Five Lakes Alliance,

392
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,360
just come for me.

393
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,440
I'll wait.

394
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,760
Get out of my sight!

395
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,760
You…

396
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,760
Wait.

397
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,240
Sir.

398
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,640
Madam.

399
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,720
Take care of yourselves.

400
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,080
Is Weining all right?

401
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,160
You've been together all the way?

402
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,920
You found Mr. Shen, right?

403
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,320
All right.

404
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,080
I'm relieved as they are safe.

405
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,160
Hero Shen,

406
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,240
just kill me as you want to.

407
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,760
Ah Xiang, what are you talking about?

408
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Why would Mr. Shen kill you?

409
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,840
Where is Wen Kexing?

410
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,360
I said I didn't know.

411
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,920
I still don't know if you keep asking.

412
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,840
People won't lie
when they are about to die.

413
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,800
I'm not lying.

414
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,560
Ah Xiang, what are you talking about?

415
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,120
Xiaolian,

416
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,360
considering that I've never hurt you
but have helped you,

417
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,160
please promise me

418
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,360
that you won't tell Cao Weining,

419
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,480
-I am--
-Tell him what?

420
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,720
-What are you talking about, Ah Xiang?
-Xiaolian, come here!

421
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,120
Don't stand with her.

422
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,080
Mr. Shen,

423
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,560
there must be some misunderstanding.

424
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,640
We can resolve any misunderstandings.

425
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,800
What misunderstanding?

426
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,080
She's a henchman
of the Ghost Valley's chief.

427
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,920
Just ask her.

428
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,840
Is Ah Xiang her true name?

429
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,880
This is truly my name.

430
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,760
I'm not changing my name no matter what.

431
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,520
I'm the Amethyst Fiend, Gu Xiang.

432
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,640
That Brochure of Ghosts

433
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,480
even records a small ghost like me?

434
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,160
I feel respected.

435
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,760
Why did you leave Wen Kexing

436
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,040
and stay with Weining?

437
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,720
Just tell me the truth.

438
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,760
Even if I tell you,

439
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,200
you wouldn't believe me.

440
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,480
I don't want

441
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,280
to be a lone ghost anymore.

442
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,840
I want to find a way back
to the human world

443
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,680
and spend my life

444
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,840
with him.

445
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,880
Can you believe it?

446
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,400
Since you knew that your identity
had been exposed,

447
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,720
why did you still come to me?

448
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,680
Weren't you afraid that I would kill you?

449
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,760
I had no choice.

450
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,080
As the saying goes,

451
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,240
"A woman should follow
the ways of the man she marries."

452
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,720
I could only do that

453
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,280
since I have found myself
a man of righteousness.

454
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,240
I have to follow his ways.

455
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,840
Chief Shen,

456
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,160
taking into consideration my good deeds,

457
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,560
please tell me,

458
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,680
am I on the Brochure of Ghosts?

459
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,840
No.

460
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,400
No. That would be great.

461
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,280
Cao Weining will never know then.

462
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Chief Shen.

463
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,360
Xiaolian.

464
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,520
I have a favor to ask.

465
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,480
After killing me,

466
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,840
can you not tell Cao Weining the truth?

467
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,160
Just tell him I was killed by Huang He

468
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,160
so that he won't know I lied to him.

469
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,320
Can you do that for me?

470
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,160
No, you are not!

471
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,760
Mr. Shen, Ah Xiang is a good girl.

472
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,240
Don't kill her.

473
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,840
Don't kill her, please.

474
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Silly girl, don't be such a fool like me.

475
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,800
I have lived half of my life,

476
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,000
but still can't tell ghosts from men.

477
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,160
Come with me.

478
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,760
Master, are you going to teach me
how to fight?

479
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,080
Since I finished my learning,

480
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,360
I haven't spent much time
on fighting skills.

481
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,920
If your Master Wen
can teach you a thing or two,

482
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,720
you will benefit a lot from it.

483
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,080
Nonsense.

484
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,600
Is it right not to teach your disciple,
but let an outsider do it?

485
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,720
Are you an "outsider"?

486
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,680
Of course not.

487
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,120
Mr. Wen, may I call you Master Wen now?

488
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,240
If you don't answer,
I'll take it as a yes.

489
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,640
Little brat,

490
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,440
you were a simple-minded obedient boy.

491
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,760
But now, you're as cunning as a monkey
after getting familiar.

492
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,080
Dear Master Wen,

493
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,400
where did you learn your skills?

494
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,680
Little brat, stop it!

495
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,480
He became so naughty thanks to you.

496
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,440
Chengling,

497
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,480
you've just begun to learn martial arts,

498
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,800
advanced ones are too hard for you.

499
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,880
Today, I'm teaching you
the most basic one,

500
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,360
the Eight Trigram Palm.

501
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,400
Your grand master

502
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,040
introduced martial arts to me
with this one.

503
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,240
Master, speaking of which,

504
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,600
we have been back for days

505
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,240
and the rooms are cleared up.

506
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
I haven't paid my respects
to Grand Master.

507
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,480
Before you teach me today,

508
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,200
how about paying tribute to him?

509
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,480
You have to tell him

510
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,960
you have a good disciple like me

511
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
and have found Master Wen.

512
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,560
He will be relieved in heaven.

513
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,680
Chengling, I…

514
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,280
I owe Lord Qin a lot.

515
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,240
I should have paid my respects to him.

516
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,040
Fine, we'll go together.

517
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,640
Grand Master and Master Qin,

518
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,680
I, disciple Zhang Chengling,
am finally here to kowtow to you.

519
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,680
Please rest assured.

520
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,560
I will try my best

521
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,440
to bring glory to the Four Seasons Manor.

522
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,480
Grand Master,

523
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,080
I guess you would have already seen
my father and Master Long.

524
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,920
The addresses are a little messed up.

525
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,560
But it doesn't matter. We are a family.

526
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,560
Please tell them

527
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,520
that Chengling is doing well
and making progress every day.

528
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,800
I'm devoted to learning
the secret technique of Longyuan Cabinet

529
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,840
taught by Master Long,

530
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,280
although it is hard.

531
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,200
Little brat,

532
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,920
you have been so long-winded
since you were young.

533
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,600
I can't imagine how you would be
when you grow up.

534
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,800
I have a lot to say

535
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,560
to Grand Master and Master Qin.

536
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,560
My father told me that

537
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,120
the dead still maintains consciousness.

538
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,280
They are always watching over
those they love.

539
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,000
No.

540
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,600
They can't.

541
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,360
They can.

542
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,720
Mr. Wen, say something to Grand Master.

543
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,040
Chengling,

544
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,200
even if spirits
can maintain consciousness,

545
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,240
one doesn't have to speak out.

546
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,880
Sometimes,

547
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,400
it's better to say it in your heart.

548
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,400
Right.

549
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,960
Fine, I'll say it in my heart.

550
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,840
TOMBS OF QIN HUAIZHANG AND HIS WIFE

551
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,880
Chengling,

552
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,600
stop that.

553
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,000
If you continue,

554
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,640
Grand Master will be annoyed.

555
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,040
If you have anything else to say,

556
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,600
save them for next time.

557
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,840
We will come to visit them often.

558
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,760
Lao Wen.

559
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,800
Ah Xu.

560
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,080
Can you leave first?

561
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,560
I need some time alone.

562
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,240
Fine.

563
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,200
Chengling.

564
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,880
TOMBS OF QIN HUAIZHANG AND HIS WIFE

565
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,920
Does the netherworld

566
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,880
indeed exist?

567
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,000
Master.

568
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
No, I mean…

569
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,679
Mr. Qin.

570
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,239
Elder Qin.

571
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
If you are in heaven,

572
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,800
have you seen my parents?

573
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,400
I hope there are spirits after death.

574
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,159
But I also fear that if you see…

575
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,160
If you see the path

576
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,520
I have taken,

577
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,720
you'll find me disgracing the name
of the Four Seasons Manor.

578
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,160
In the beginning,

579
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,680
when I couldn't take it,

580
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,400
I would pretend

581
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,000
that I wasn't the one suffering,

582
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,000
and that was just Zhen Yan's nightmare.

583
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,720
When I woke up,

584
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,880
I would find myself still in the yard.

585
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,200
Time stopped

586
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,600
at the moment
when you accepted me as your disciple

587
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,240
and never went forward.

588
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,680
TOMBS OF QIN HUAIZHANG AND HIS WIFE

589
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,480
TOMB OF QIN JIUXIAO

590
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,760
But I found out later

591
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,960
that it wasn't Zhen Yan in a nightmare,

592
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,000
but it was

593
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,960
me in a sweet dream as Zhen Yan.

594
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,240
God doesn't carry out justice

595
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,520
and karma isn't paid.

596
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
If this is the case,

597
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,040
I would rather be a devil

598
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,760
and find my justice against fate.

599
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,360
It wasn't blood in my veins
for the past 20 years,

600
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,840
but hatred.

601
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,880
The thought of revenge is the only thing

602
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,640
that supported me to crawl up from hell

603
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,840
and become the lord of all ghosts

604
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,360
and the king of venom.

605
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,520
That old bastard didn't expect

606
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,000
that 20 years later, I would carry out

607
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,200
the curses Zhen Yan made
before his death one by one.

608
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,760
-Kill them all.
-I will turn into the fiercest ghost

609
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,400
and hunt all of you down!

610
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,520
All of them.

611
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,320
But after killing all of them,

612
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,360
my hatred hasn't been alleviated.

613
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,440
All those who betrayed,

614
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,040
abandoned,

615
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,480
and forced us

616
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,360
are stained with the blood of my parents.

617
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,720
They are demons under human skin.

618
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,400
I will not spare any one of them.

619
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,160
The world has abandoned me

620
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,640
and I shall kill them all.

621
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,760
When I left the valley,

622
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,680
I had sworn to myself

623
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,320
that I would end
this world of hypocrisy with fire

624
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,080
and drive these devils back to hell.

625
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,080
If this is a sin,

626
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,720
be it countless death or flagrant crime,

627
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,440
I will take all the blame alone.

628
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,960
If I have to die in this filthy world,

629
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,760
I am willing to do so.

630
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,000
But…

631
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,040
But…

632
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,120
Since fate has thrown me into hell,

633
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,400
why did it give me a way
back to the human world?

634
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,560
My life as Wen Kexing is ruined.

635
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,080
I'm not qualified to call you master.

636
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,720
If there is a next life,

637
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,480
I will do anything to repay your grace.

638
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,480
If there isn't,

639
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,680
even if I'm destined to hell,

640
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,080
I will still thank you for giving me

641
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,880
a moment of brightness.

642
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,800
Ah Xiang.

643
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,480
You fool, you're awake?

644
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,840
Ah Xiang, where is Xiaolian?

645
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,560
Don't worry.

646
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,880
Have some water first.

647
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,800
You fool!

648
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,760
I told you to just watch
and not show yourself.

649
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,520
Luckily, I brought people
of the Broken Sword Manor

650
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,560
and arrived in time

651
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,880
or you would lose your life.

652
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,400
You've saved her?

653
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,560
Where did they go?

654
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,760
Xiaolian fainted out of shock

655
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,000
and was taken back
to the Five Lakes Alliance by Chief Mu.

656
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,800
That's all right.

657
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,680
Nothing has been delayed.

658
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,480
It's better not to tell him anything.

659
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,840
Ah Xiang, you're so smart.

660
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,200
Smart?

661
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,200
No, not really.

662
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,480
Someone said I was a coward.

663
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
No, Ah Xiang.

664
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,680
I'm sorry for that.

665
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,640
I was confused.

666
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,000
And I was impatient and stupid.

667
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,400
Just hit me, all right?

668
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,440
Don't be angry.

669
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,040
You…

670
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,000
You fool.

671
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,680
Just stay where you are.

672
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,160
Who wants to beat you?

673
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,640
I'll keep my hands clean.

674
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,160
Ah Xiang.

675
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,720
Hey.

676
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,680
Is it that

677
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,440
we have conflicting fates?

678
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,640
Ever since you met me,

679
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,560
you have been injured very often.

680
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,480
It's not your fault.
My martial arts aren't good.

681
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,320
That's why I often get beaten up.

682
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,560
But don't worry.

683
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,840
After we're back to Mount Qingfeng,

684
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,160
I will enhance my skills

685
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,400
so I can protect you
and never let anyone hurt you.

686
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,640
Who dares to do that except you?

687
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,320
No. How dare I?

688
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,080
Moreover, my master
treats girls very nicely.

689
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,520
The girls from other sects

690
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,000
who came to visit us

691
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,640
were all treated like treasures.

692
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,920
If my master knows I teased you,

693
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,360
he will surely break my legs.

694
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,160
And Mr. Wen…

695
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,680
Wait, Ah Xiang,

696
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,280
how could I tease you?

697
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,640
You made me go off track.

698
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,800
What if we really have conflicting fates?

699
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,720
What shall we do?

700
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,360
What are you talking about, Ah Xiang?

701
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,120
It's impossible.

702
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,920
I'm serious about it.

703
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,120
What if we really have conflicting fates?

704
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,000
Then I would give my life to you.

705
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,480
Ah Xiang.

706
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,280
But before that,

707
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,720
can you give me something to eat?

708
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,160
I'm starving to death.

709
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,520
Sure, here you go.

710
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,760
Be careful, it's hot.

711
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,240
Here, have one first.

712
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,440
I'll just watch you eat.

713
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,960
The bigger one is for you.

714
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,360
The buns roasted by you taste so good.

715
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,760
It's the tastiest food in the world.
