1
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,320
Is it my fault

2
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,040
that your wife died in childbirth?

3
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,840
If you hate me,

4
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,120
just kill me early on

5
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,760
to avenge your wife's death.

6
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,200
Since you decided to raise me,

7
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,680
why did you let me grow up
with a disability?

8
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,680
You know the Yin Yang Book
can raise the dead

9
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,200
and reverse yin and yang.

10
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,240
You also knew it was in the armory,

11
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,160
but you've never said a word about it!

12
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,120
You just sat by and watched me
become a wreck for over a decade!

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,160
I've told you 100 times,
but you never trusted me.

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,720
What else can I do?

15
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,200
Healers care about patients
like parents do to children.

16
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,040
If Yin Yang Book
really has such a miraculous effect,

17
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,000
why did the Healer Valley

18
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,960
keep it a secret?

19
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,880
That's bullshit!

20
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,720
That's just an excuse!

21
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,280
You didn't even try it!

22
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,120
You can move the Longyuan Cabinet
for your dead wife.

23
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,600
You can bear all these years of suffering

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,880
for your so-called good friends,

25
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,240
but you refuse to open that armory

26
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,720
for your living son!

27
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm so sorry.

28
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,800
It's my sin for not teaching him well.

29
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,000
I deserve all of this.

30
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,040
Do you know Yue Feng'er
from the Healer Valley?

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
Master Ye,

32
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,000
do you mean

33
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,880
the senior of the Three Heroes
of the Healer Valley,

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Fairy Ganoderma Yue Feng'er?

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,640
Without the Three Heroes
of the Healer Valley's help,

36
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,920
Yu Zhui might not have agreed to marry me.

37
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,480
Yue Feng'er.

38
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,280
Is she the wife of Rong Xuan?

39
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,800
Yes.

40
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,800
Only my friend, Rong Xuan,

41
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,320
is suitable for a lady like her.

42
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,560
So what exactly happened
between Rong Xuan and his wife?

43
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,160
You know what happened, don't you?

44
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Yes.

45
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,240
Master Long, I have a question.

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,560
Could you please give me an answer?

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,920
Zishu, who is he?

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,440
That friend of yours?

49
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,600
Mr. Long.

50
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,200
He is my close friend.

51
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,680
His name is Wen Kexing.

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Lao Wen hates his father.

53
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,040
The situation is not clear yet.

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,680
Should I reveal his identity?

55
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,800
You've finally got a friend.

56
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,519
That's great.

57
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,360
Long Xiao said at the Heroes Conference

58
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,760
that Gao Chong once forced and used you
to open the armory for him.

59
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,720
Is that true?

60
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,880
Where did you hear that?

61
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,640
The last time I saw him

62
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,720
was 20 years ago.

63
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,160
Besides, Glazed Armor is in their hands.

64
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,360
It's useless to me to open that armory.

65
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,000
Long Xiao also said that 20 years ago,

66
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,240
Rong Xuan once deceived you
into building the armory for him.

67
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,600
-Is that true?
-Deceived me?

68
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Kid, don't trust
even a single word from him.

69
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,000
I helped Rong Xuan

70
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,000
reconstruct the armory willingly.

71
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,520
Mr. Long,

72
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,400
for the past 20 years,

73
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,600
about the origin of the armory…

74
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,560
There have been many false rumors
in the martial arts world.

75
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,640
Can you tell us the whole story?

76
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,240
Why did Mr. Rong Xuan insist
on constructing the armory?

77
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,680
And what happened to this armory?

78
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,560
If you are curious about that,

79
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll tell you then.

80
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,200
But where should I start?

81
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,080
It was your master, Qin Huaizhang,

82
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
who met Rong Xuan first.

83
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
Thanks to the serendipity,

84
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,840
we got to know each other later on.

85
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,480
Together, we practiced chivalry and
justice and cracked down on evil forces.

86
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,600
It was such a free and happy time.

87
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,360
Thanks to your master and Rong Xuan,

88
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,800
a nerd like me

89
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,400
had such a good time.

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
A gang of us, a beam of light.

91
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,920
What a wonderful time that was!

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,640
What good had I done

93
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,280
that I get to be one of them?

94
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,600
Mr. Long,

95
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,920
in Master Rong's armory…

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,040
Zishu.

97
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,360
Although Rong Xuan was our mainstay,

98
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,840
the armory wasn't his.

99
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,280
Together, we helped him build it.

100
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,040
You mentioned the five brothers
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

101
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,800
Was my father one of them?

102
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,520
Who is your father?

103
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
My father

104
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
was the hero of Mirror Lake, Zhang Yusen.

105
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,120
What?

106
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,920
You are Yusen's son?

107
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,560
Good boy. Come and let me see you.

108
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,320
I never thought that a goon like Yusen

109
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,480
could have such a handsome boy.

110
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,440
You must have taken after your mother.

111
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,840
How is your father?

112
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,160
My father

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,320
is gone.

114
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,120
Mr. Long,

115
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,360
it's a long story.

116
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,600
Master Zhang died
protecting the Glazed Armor.

117
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,360
Chief Lu Taichong

118
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,440
and Chief Gao Chong

119
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,400
both died for the Glazed Armor.

120
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,600
The ghosts of Mount Qingya
have entered the world of the living,

121
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,040
creating bloody turmoil again.

122
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,640
Panic and vendetta have flooded
the martial arts world.

123
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,160
All of these

124
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,560
are for these two words, "Glazed Armor."

125
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,880
But scrambling for it
will only end up in vain.

126
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,240
Glazed Armor is merely a lock.

127
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,280
Without Rong Xuan's key,

128
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,400
what's the point of having the lock?

129
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,200
Key?

130
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,440
Do you have Rong Xuan's key?

131
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,040
No.

132
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,360
"No"?

133
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,680
That's it.

134
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,320
You don't believe me, neither do they.

135
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,600
I can't do anything about it.

136
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,720
Yu Zhui is gone anyway.

137
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
I have no desire to see anyone now.

138
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,680
Well, that's enough.

139
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,280
Where's the key?

140
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,480
I know where it is, but I won't tell you.

141
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,320
I've sworn not to tell anyone.

142
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,480
You have to tell me now.

143
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,159
Otherwise, what would happen?

144
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,480
My son killed

145
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,280
my disciples and servants
right before my eyes.

146
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,280
He even severed my legs inch by inch.

147
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,760
What else can you do to me?

148
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,920
Master Ye. Hero Ye.

149
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,680
Please don't be hard on this old man.

150
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,120
-He--
-Shut up.

151
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,840
I need to figure out
what on earth happened to Rong Xuan.

152
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,680
You built the armory together.
What happened then?

153
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,560
How did he go crazy
as everything was right?

154
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,440
Did any of you do him any harm?

155
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,160
Old Monster!

156
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,760
Why are you being so pushy
when he doesn't want to bring it up?

157
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,800
Tell me now!

158
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,840
Are you done?

159
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,400
-Are you crazy?
-I'm fed up with you.

160
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,800
What's wrong with beating you up?

161
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,520
You've gone through hardships
seeking the truth.

162
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Have you lost your mind now?

163
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,520
Do you know what is coming in high spirits
and returning after much enjoyment?

164
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,480
I don't want to know
the truth now. All right?

165
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,160
Enough of this. No more fights.

166
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,880
Wen Kexing, stop it
or you might regret it.

167
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,680
I must find out how Rong Xuan died.

168
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,800
He was my disciple!

169
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Your disciple?

170
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,400
MEMORIAL TABLET OF GAO CHONG

171
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,000
MEMORIAL TABLET OF GAO CHONG

172
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,120
Mountain Closing Sword.

173
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,200
The Three Heroes of the Healer Valley.

174
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,360
The leader of the Five Lakes Alliance.

175
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,200
Gao Chong.

176
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,520
I finally got all of you together.

177
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,240
You belittled me, singled me out,

178
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,320
and bossed me around like a puppet.

179
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,720
Have you ever thought

180
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,480
that one day,

181
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,640
I would be the one who is worshiping you?

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,120
The idea of the armory is total bullshit!

183
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,000
I had to shed my blood with you

184
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,520
for your damn whim.

185
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,680
But you, a wild bastard,

186
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,400
had nothing to care about.

187
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
That's why you dare to offend
the world of martial arts.

188
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
But how about us?

189
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,360
I've struggled for most of my life.

190
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,120
From a poor young man

191
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
to the chief of Tai Lake Sect.

192
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,800
But because of you,

193
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,960
all of my efforts were almost wasted!

194
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,680
You had
the Combined Six Cultivation Power,

195
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,680
but you didn't let us practice it

196
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,480
because you failed to master it.

197
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,880
Well…

198
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,280
Let's not practice it all together then.

199
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,920
MEMORIAL TABLET OF RONG XUAN

200
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,360
You were the cloud
and I was the mud in those days.

201
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,280
You were right about everything.

202
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,840
I was wrong in everything I do.

203
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,800
But now?

204
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,600
You are reduced to just a tablet,

205
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,320
yet I'm still standing here, alive.

206
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,120
Gao Chong,

207
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,280
if you are seeing this from heaven,

208
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,280
you must be feeling regretful.

209
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,120
I tried to talk some sense into you,

210
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,840
but you never listened.

211
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,160
You were upset with Rong Xuan

212
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,320
and trusted that idiot Shen Shen instead.

213
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,000
Why did you have to cling to the power?

214
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,120
You deserve to end up like this.

215
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,560
MEMORIAL TABLET OF GAO CHONG

216
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,400
The only thing that I regret the most

217
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,040
is that I didn't get to show you
all of this when you were alive.

218
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,320
MEMORIAL TABLET OF GAO CHONG

219
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,680
I just want all people to know

220
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,480
that I am the only true hero here.

221
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,920
Only I, Zhao Jing,

222
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,880
can carry the Five Lakes Alliance forward!

223
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,400
Mountain Closing Swordsmanship.

224
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,400
You really are his master.

225
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,960
You are Ye…

226
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,040
Ye Baiyi.

227
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,800
You are still alive?

228
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,440
Is that Combined Six Cultivation Power?

229
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,640
Combined Six Cultivation Power,

230
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,480
it really exists!

231
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,040
Immortality!

232
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,360
Nature and man combined as one!

233
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,040
Master Ye,

234
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,920
your Combined Six Cultivation Method

235
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,320
is still well-kept in the armory.

236
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,880
The dead are gone.

237
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,720
Rong Xuan was ignorant then

238
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,520
and did things wrongly.

239
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,760
He felt guilty and was full of remorse.

240
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,520
"Guilty and remorse"?

241
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,680
How foolish!

242
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,080
Rong Xuan asked his wife

243
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,040
to send the key of the Glazed Armor

244
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,000
to his master in Mount Changming

245
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,520
and tell him what happened.

246
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,440
And she needed to kowtow and apologize
to his master for him.

247
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,480
Yet things were not
as we expected them to be.

248
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,600
And then?

249
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,800
What happened next?

250
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,560
Zishu.

251
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,920
Do you have any alcohol?

252
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,120
Master.

253
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,280
No sun and moon
can barely be seen here in the mountain.

254
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,200
I have no idea

255
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,080
how long I haven't drunk
such good alcohol.

256
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,040
Long Que, stop that nonsense.

257
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,360
Just get back to the point.

258
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,960
Master Ye, that's not nonsense.

259
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,320
God let me live until now,

260
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,280
as He wants me
to reveal the truth to the world.

261
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,040
Nice one!

262
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,600
The Yellow River comes from the sky,

263
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,720
rushing into the sea
and never coming back!

264
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,120
Do you not see…

265
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,600
Do you not see how sad it is

266
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,440
when the bright mirror hung high up
in the hall reflects the gray hair?

267
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,560
It was silk-black at dawn,

268
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,360
-Not bad.
-but turned snow-white at dusk.

269
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,440
-Yes. Let's drink.
-Please drink up! Don't put down your cup!

270
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,400
Drink it.

271
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,720
-Great.
-Great.

272
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,040
Great.

273
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,320
Ah Shen, what are you doing?

274
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,520
SHEN SHEN

275
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,760
Feng'er, forgive me.

276
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,920
Feng'er, let him go.

277
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,120
-That's right.
-Ah Shen, it's your fault.

278
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,000
Why did you break the cup?

279
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,560
There is a saying
in the martial arts world.

280
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,160
-Come.
-"Two beauties in the Healer Valley

281
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,040
are the incarnation
of the valley's aura and enchantment."

282
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,480
So Ruyu,

283
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,320
you are the one who absorbs

284
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,520
all the foolishness and filthiness.

285
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,400
Ah Shen.

286
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,440
Ruyu stood up for you.
Why do you tease him?

287
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,480
Rong Xuan, am I wrong?

288
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,520
You're not wrong.

289
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,720
That's just a custom

290
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,880
in the martial arts world.

291
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,599
The martial arts world?

292
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,160
Interesting.

293
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,280
ZHAO JING

294
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,319
Ah Jing, what are you doing?

295
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,960
-Come and drink.
-Ah Jing.

296
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,520
-Come and drink.
-Come on now.

297
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,000
-Come here, Ah Jing.
-Don't just sit there. Come on.

298
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,119
Which dumbass gave himself away
when stealing books from Mount Tai?

299
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,760
No one saw me.

300
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,920
No one saw you.

301
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,880
GAO CHONG

302
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,120
The elder of Mount Tai came to Father
asking for an explanation!

303
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,680
Father has asked all disciples
of the Five Lakes Alliance

304
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,840
fitting the description to go
to Mount Tai Sect for investigation.

305
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,840
Ah Jing.

306
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,640
You just can't do anything right!

307
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Useless!

308
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,360
Ah Chong.

309
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,880
Sit.

310
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,040
Don't worry.
Let's think of a solution together.

311
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,520
If the cat is out of the bag,

312
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,920
I'll admit it to Chief
and ask for punishment.

313
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,240
I won't get you involved.

314
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,720
Calm down.

315
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,800
You can't plead guilty.

316
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,720
Being expelled from the sect
is already mercy.

317
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,040
What if the master takes away
your martial arts?

318
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,880
Rong Xuan.

319
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,640
Please do something about it!

320
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,080
Ah Jing.

321
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,320
We can't even scold you now?

322
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,880
Don't you deserve it?

323
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,320
One should answer for what he does.

324
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,440
The World's Armory is my idea,

325
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,600
so it's me
who should take the responsibility.

326
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,960
Don't panic.

327
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,960
Take it easy.

328
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,840
The sky wouldn't fall
as the taller will withstand it.

329
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,840
Rong Xuan

330
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,560
lit a fire in our hearts,

331
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,280
burning every one of us into a devil.

332
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,440
He always said the sectarian bias

333
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,480
and the rules of the martial arts world

334
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,760
are all formalities!

335
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,000
Real martial artists
should act openly and honestly.

336
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,520
In those days,

337
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,800
we were committed to collecting
books of unique martial skills.

338
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,320
Stupid!

339
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,160
Unique martial skills
are created by humans.

340
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,920
Fighting over a secret book
written by someone else…

341
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,600
Do you think that they had two brains
or have you guys lost your mind?

342
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,960
You just learn whatever you are taught.

343
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,200
What's the difference between you
and the trained monkeys?

344
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,880
You even caused so much trouble
and people died for this.

345
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,320
Luckily, that little brat
left the sect himself.

346
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,240
Otherwise, I would kill myself
out of shame

347
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,520
for having such a stupid disciple!

348
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,960
Old Monster, shut up!

349
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,080
Master Ye, if you keep interrupting,

350
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,960
Mr. Long could never get to the point.

351
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,680
Master Ye's words make sense.

352
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,920
Zishu,

353
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,840
your master expostulated us

354
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,680
almost in the same way.

355
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
My master?

356
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,600
We went through so much trouble
to look for the site of the armory.

357
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,720
We changed a few places

358
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,240
and none of them were satisfactory.

359
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,280
Finally, your master

360
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,360
told us about the underground palace
of the former dynasty that he found.

361
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,000
Later on,
I took care of its transformation.

362
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,160
So Mr. Long,

363
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,480
it was you who invented
the Glazed Armor lock?

364
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,840
No. When your master
and his friends traveled around,

365
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,600
they got the Glazed Armor lock
and its key.

366
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,680
Both of them were made with ingenuity.

367
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,880
It wasn't easy for Huaizhang
to collect them all.

368
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
However, when he opened the palace,

369
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,680
he found nothing in it.

370
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,040
So he gave it to us

371
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,920
and that's what the armory was built upon.

372
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,520
Get back to the point!

373
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,840
How did Rong Xuan die?

374
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,040
His death has puzzled me

375
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,760
for years.

376
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,480
I really don't know

377
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,960
who is to blame for Rong Xuan's tragedy.

378
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,520
That's a deal. One round only.

379
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,000
If you lose,

380
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,880
stop bringing that up again.

381
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,200
Rong Xuan, if you lose,

382
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,000
you can't regret it.

383
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,600
Pardon me, Rong Xuan.

384
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,640
Rong Xuan, are you really going
to challenge five at the same time?

385
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,200
That's too arrogant. Don't you think?

386
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,920
It's time-saving for me.

387
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,840
If all of you together can't defeat me,

388
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,440
I dare you not to argue
for practicing the martial arts

389
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,240
which even I can't master.

390
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,720
Cut the cackle.

391
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Form the sword array!

392
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,800
I'm sorry, Rong Xuan.

393
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,200
Ah Chong, great job. No mercy, right?

394
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,400
Rong Xuan, enough.
Accidents happen in fights.

395
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,720
It's just a wound, no big deal. Come on!

396
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,600
Look.

397
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,040
They really like fighting.

398
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,800
Are you going to admit defeat?

399
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,400
I've told you that you're not good enough
to be my opponent.

400
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,440
-I admit it.
-Rong Xuan, I admire you.

401
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,280
I sincerely and heartily admit it.

402
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,520
-Rong Xuan!
-Rong Xuan!

403
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,440
-My dear!
-Rong Xuan!

404
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,960
-Rong Xuan!
-My dear.

405
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,000
-Rong Xuan.
-My dear.

406
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,200
-Rong Xuan.
-My dear.

407
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,520
My dear.

408
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,880
It's the Triple Corpse Poison.

409
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,160
What?

410
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,840
How did the Triple Corpse Poison get here?

411
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,480
What?

412
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,400
Who?

413
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,280
Who is it?

414
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,440
Who?

415
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,040
Who harmed my husband?

416
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,800
Gao Chong.

417
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,800
Is it you?

418
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,640
Why did you harm my husband?

419
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,160
I didn't do anything.

420
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,640
His blood is on your sword.

421
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Nonsense. It wasn't me!

422
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,840
Gao Chong!

423
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,680
Why?

424
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,880
Why did you do that?

425
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,800
-Gao Chong.
-Gao Chong.

426
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,440
It's not me.

427
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,960
It's not me!

428
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,240
I would never do that!

429
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,320
Master Long.

430
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,200
So they were just competing

431
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,800
and not trying to kill each other?

432
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,760
We were so close back then.

433
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,680
Why would we kill each other?

434
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,600
Then was it Gao Chong who poisoned him?

435
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,880
I've asked myself

436
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,120
hundreds of times about that.

437
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,960
But I believe him.

438
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,480
He wouldn't hurt Rong Xuan,
no matter what.

439
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,440
He had no reason to kill him.

440
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,000
Mr. Long,
please excuse me for being blunt.

441
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,600
Gao Chong did have a reason
for poisoning him.

442
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,120
For a long time, he longed
for the Combined Six Cultivation Method.

443
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,560
But no one got it.

444
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,720
After Rong Xuan was poisoned,

445
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,520
his wife drove all five of them out

446
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,000
as she hated them.

447
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,800
The armory could only be opened
with the six of them.

448
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,760
Six of them?

449
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,320
Yes, five of them kept one piece
of the Glazed Armor respectively.

450
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,080
Rong Xuan kept the key himself.

451
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,640
After they split up,

452
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,240
the armory was never opened again.

453
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,040
And the Combined Six Cultivation Method

454
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,040
has been left in the armory since then.

455
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,040
Putting aside their close friendship,

456
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,720
why did Gao Chong
have to harm others for no reason?

457
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,640
If not him, then who?

458
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,520
Lao Wen.

459
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,680
What's wrong?

460
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,000
Lao Wen.

461
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,200
Triple Corpse Poison can only
turn people into walking corpses.

462
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
Who drove him crazy then?

463
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,200
Just tell us.

464
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,560
Even if it's the King of Heaven
or the Jade Emperor,

465
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,040
I will not spare him.

466
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,280
If you have to find someone
to be responsible for it, it's Lady Rong.

467
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,320
How could that be?

468
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,960
My father once told me that
Lady Rong was a very nice person.

469
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,480
They were a very loving couple.

470
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,920
Yes, that's the reason.

471
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,600
To save her loved one,

472
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,040
Lady Rong finally decided
to use the forbidden technique.

473
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,680
That was an act against nature
that ended up in a disaster.

474
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,240
The Yin Yang Book?

475
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,360
Its miraculous power can even save people
with poison circulating in the heart.

476
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,320
-How about those with wilted meridians?
-He…

477
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,640
-I've said this before.
-He remembers it.

478
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,520
If that book really has
such a miraculous effect,

479
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,560
why did the Healer Valley
not use it to save lives?

480
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,680
Instead, they banned it
as it's a forbidden technique.

481
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,040
It's claimed to be able to raise the dead
and reverse yin and yang.

482
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,960
But it can only work by reviving one
at the cost of the life of another.

483
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
If you want to fix
someone's heart meridians,

484
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,680
you have to take the heart

485
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,000
from another living man.

486
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,680
Who knew that Rong Xuan

487
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,040
would grow more insane after that.

488
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,080
He accidentally killed his wife.

489
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,360
That's impossible!

490
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,840
Rong Xuan killed his own wife?

491
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,720
If Rong Xuan had not made
such a big mistake

492
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,920
and lost his last shred of sanity

493
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,440
because of his remorse,

494
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,000
he wouldn't have completely gone mad

495
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,880
and chased by all heroes in the world.

496
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,000
How about Yue Feng'er's junior disciples?

497
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,640
Why didn't they stop them?

498
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,120
The Yin Yang Book
is forbidden in the Healer Valley.

499
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,720
Since Lady Rong used it
without permission,

500
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,880
she couldn't go back to the Healer Valley
for the rest of her life.

501
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,440
So the Divine Hand couple
went back to the Healer Valley

502
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,640
to look for the cure for her.

503
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,920
The key of the armory was then

504
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,080
brought back to the Healer Valley
by the Zhen family.

505
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,920
Fate fools us all.

506
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
When Ruyu heard about the tragedy,

507
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:16,800
the battle on Mount Qingya
was soon to come.

508
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,480
He went there, riding without stopping,

509
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,280
only to see…

510
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,560
MOUNT QINGYA

511
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Who's there?

512
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,480
Come on!

513
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,160
-Bring it on!
-Wait.

514
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,200
I'll kill you!

515
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,680
I'll kill you!

516
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,240
Rong Xuan!

517
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,920
-He…
-Rong Xuan.

518
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,400
-No!
-Rong Xuan!

519
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,040
Rong Xuan.

520
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,440
No.

521
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,560
Everyone.

522
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,240
-What are you doing?
-Why are you protecting him? Go!

523
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm Zhen Ruyu from the Healer Valley.

524
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,960
We may be somewhat related.

525
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,400
Healer Valley has saved lives for decades.

526
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,920
I believe we've done a lot of good deeds.

527
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,280
Your family and friends

528
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,240
have more or less received favors
from Healer Valley and me.

529
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,840
So today, considering all that,

530
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,880
please listen to me this one time.

531
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,280
We'd better settle conflicts
than make enemies.

532
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,520
Rong Xuan went mad for a reason
that cannot be revealed.

533
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,480
It's not in his nature.

534
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,440
Don't talk big!

535
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,240
-Yes! Why should we believe you?
-Yes.

536
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,400
-Please be quiet, everyone.
-Why should we believe you?

537
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,160
The wrong has been done.

538
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,480
What good would come from endless revenge?

539
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,920
I'm willing to spend the rest of my life

540
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,400
to make up for Rong Xuan's sin.

541
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,040
If he killed anyone from any sect,

542
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,320
I will pay back
by saving hundreds of people!

543
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,360
I will take Rong Xuan back
to the Healer Valley to cure him

544
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,480
and won't let him cause any more trouble.

545
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,200
-This…
-What's happening?

546
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,320
During the battle in Mount Qingya,

547
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,640
they hunted down Rong Xuan

548
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,560
in the name of hunting the demon.

549
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,560
But actually, they probably did it
for the key to the armory.

550
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,960
Since they got nothing
after the death of Master Rong,

551
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,760
they went after Master Zhen

552
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,040
even if they had to confront
the Healer Valley.

553
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,040
They thought he would surrender
because of that.

554
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,240
In the dilemma of protecting
his family and being righteous,

555
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,440
Zhen Ruyu would rather die

556
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,120
than give away the secret of the armory.

557
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,280
These so-called righteous clans
in the world of martial arts

558
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,360
said that good and evil
were at daggers drawn

559
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,560
and forced the then valley chief to place
righteousness above family loyalty.

560
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,040
But they were actually
threatening the Zhen family

561
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,720
by using the Healer Valley.

562
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,640
Rumor has it

563
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,600
that the second disciple couple
of the Healer Valley degenerated

564
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,840
and colluded with bandits.

565
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,760
That was why the old valley chief
took away their martial arts

566
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,680
and kicked them out of the sect.

567
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,440
The old valley chief
passed away soon after.

568
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,160
From then on, the far-famed
Healer Valley has fallen into decline.

569
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,240
So that explains it.

570
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,400
"Degenerated"?

571
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,000
Divine Hand Zhen Ruyu
dedicated his whole life to saving people.

572
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,800
Thousands of people survived
thanks to him.

573
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,520
No one in this world

574
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,480
dares to claim to be

575
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,360
nobler than Zhen Ruyu.

576
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,720
It's exactly because of
his nobility and kindness

577
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,440
that he's incompatible
with this filthy world.

578
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,120
When this news reached Longyuan Cabinet,

579
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,680
Lady Zhen had disappeared

580
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,560
with her wounded husband and her child.

581
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Then Mr. Long,

582
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,960
there is a rumor saying that

583
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,200
the Longyuan Cabinet
could open the armory in another way.

584
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,080
You spread the rumor, didn't you?

585
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,600
You were afraid that they wouldn't give up

586
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,360
and kept targeting the Zhen family,

587
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,800
so you took all the trouble to do that.

588
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,520
You gave up the promising future
of the Longyan Cabinet

589
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,680
and moved here.

590
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,640
You are suffering now from this as well.

591
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,160
The situation didn't get worse
but it changed nothing!

592
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,600
This was the best way I could think of.

593
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Other than this,

594
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,080
I could do nothing for them.

595
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,680
I haven't heard from them ever again.

596
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,880
I used a lot of methods to find them
but failed eventually.

597
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,280
I wish for nothing else
but them safely hidden somewhere

598
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,960
and lived a peaceful life

599
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,480
without getting involved
in all those chaos and turmoil.

600
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,480
Mr. Long,

601
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,600
for your friends,

602
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,360
you have sacrificed

603
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,480
so much.

604
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,000
Your faithfulness to your friends
could be compared

605
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,640
to the saints, Zuo Botao and Yang Jiao'ai,

606
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,840
who are known
for their loyalty to each other.

607
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,240
Having a friend like you in life,

608
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,000
one can have no regrets even in

609
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,040
the dwelling place of the dead.

610
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,120
Master Ye,

611
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,120
I didn't hide the truth
from you intentionally.

612
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,240
It's just that I'm not sure
where the key is.

613
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,080
Although I promised Rong Xuan

614
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,560
to send back the key to the armory,

615
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,840
I was strong in will but weak in power.

616
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,520
Please forgive me, Master Ye.

617
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,960
There's no need to apologize.

618
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,920
Rong Xuan was an idiot, so are you!

619
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,080
Armory?

620
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,280
Key?

621
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,120
Secret book?

622
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,120
Do you think I really care about those?

623
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,520
Master Ye, you are incredible
in martial arts,

624
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,840
so the armory means nothing to you.

625
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,080
However, this is just

626
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,199
a feeling of regret in Rong Xuan's heart.

627
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,199
Long Que,

628
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,280
you are a good person.

629
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,400
It's Rong Xuan who dragged you down.

630
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,679
Tell me your wish.

631
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,199
I will fulfill it for you.

632
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,199
I have nothing to wish for now.

633
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,719
I owe many people many things.

634
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,160
Only death can pay.

635
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,080
Master Ye.

636
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,320
I have a question.

637
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,080
Rong Xuan was so gifted
and you were his master.

638
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,240
And you are so adept at
the Combined Six Cultivation Power,

639
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,680
but why didn't you teach him?

640
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,320
It was wrong

641
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,320
for Rong Xuan to steal
the secret book and leave,

642
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,880
but it's understandable.

643
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,840
Considering the fact that Rong Xuan
was obsessed with martial arts.

644
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,520
No martial artists

645
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,160
could resist the temptation
of the unity of man and nature.

646
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,440
Nature and man in one.

647
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,320
It won't help escape from fate.

648
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,560
On top of Mount Changming,

649
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,880
it was so cold and lonely.

650
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,120
In order to please him,

651
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,720
I taught him all the martial arts
without reservation

652
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,200
except the Combined
Six Cultivation Method.

653
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Because of this,
that brat argued with me a few times.

654
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,480
In the end, he stole the secret book
and went off the mountain.

655
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,040
"Combined Six Cultivation Method
of the Broken Sky and the Earth Split."

656
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,440
The name of this wicked martial art

657
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,800
has given a hint of warning

658
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,320
for the successors.

659
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,160
If it were anything good,

660
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,080
I wouldn't have hidden it from him.

661
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,600
It's all our fault.

662
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,960
Both his father and I
pampered him too much.

663
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,840
This little brat

664
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,840
might think it wasn't a big deal

665
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,160
and planned to come back after a few years

666
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,040
when we were no longer angry.

667
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,680
In the first several years,

668
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,560
we bore the same thought.

669
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Who knows…

670
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,960
"If it were anything good,

671
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,560
I wouldn't have hidden it from him."

672
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,880
Not just this
Combined Six Cultivation Method,

673
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,960
even if all the secret books of all ages
were placed before me,

674
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,040
I wouldn't…

675
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,840
Never mind. Forget about it.

676
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,200
I only regret that I hesitated

677
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,520
and didn't tear up that secret book.

678
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,440
Master Ye!
