00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,120
TIANYA INN

2
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,120
YONG'AN STREET

3
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,160
Hey, you are awake?

4
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,800
Would you like some amber walnuts?

5
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,200
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

6
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,200
Ah Xu.

7
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,360
At least, we had adventures together,

8
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,840
had dinner together,

9
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,920
and spent the night together
in a dilapidated temple.

10
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,640
Why do you still call me "Mr. Wen"?

11
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
Am I so much of an outsider?

12
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,440
These two horses are for you.

13
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Hurry to Tai Lake

14
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,320
to avoid any complications.

15
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,320
Mr. Wen, thank you.

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,440
We met by chance--

17
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,360
Have you not heard that

18
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,040
"feelings are not measured
by the length of time"?

19
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,560
Mr. Zhou and I

20
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,000
got along well from the start.

21
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,440
The depth of friendship
does not depend on the length of time.

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,560
Your father has been in the Five Lakes
World Alliance all his life.

23
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,480
-Master Zhang.
-You--

24
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Are you Master Zhang Chengling?

25
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,440
CRIPPLED BEGGAR

26
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,760
My friend, don't get me wrong.

27
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,040
We are not bad guys.

28
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,200
I am the vice-captain
of the Dazhi Gang of Beggar Gangs.

29
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,800
We were ordered
by Discipline Elder Huang He

30
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,680
and entrusted by Five Lakes World Alliance

31
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,360
to find the Mirror Lake Sect's orphan,

32
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,960
Master Zhang Chengling.

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,600
Yesterday, a disciple saw
that Young Master Zhang

34
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,880
was very similar
to the portrait we received.

35
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,400
-So we came here today to make sure.
-Do you know him?

36
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,640
TIANYA INN

37
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,480
He doesn't know you.

38
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,920
"Make sure"?

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,960
Do you need to bring
so many thugs to confirm that?

40
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,600
If he's the person you are searching for,

41
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,960
are you going to take him away by force?

42
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,160
No.

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,480
Master Zhang.

44
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,400
It was Shen Shen,
Chief of Mount Dagu Sect,

45
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,960
who asked us to find you.

46
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,560
You must know Chief Shen, right?

47
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,440
He's your father's sworn brother.

48
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,720
I don't know him. I'll follow Mr. Zhou.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,360
I'm sorry, I don't know him either.

50
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,560
I think Young Master Zhang
must have been too scared

51
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,760
and seem a little out of his mind.

52
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,240
It wasn't because

53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,760
the abductor drugged him, was it?

54
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,280
You are really good
at confusing right and wrong.

55
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Being a beggar is wasting your talent.

56
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Why don't you become a lawyer?

57
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,880
Get in position!

58
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,760
If you hand over Young Master Zhang,

59
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,920
I will let you go.

60
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,840
Keep an eye on him.

61
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,360
This way.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,040
Come on!

63
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,200
Stop him.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,280
Ah Xu's waist skills

65
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,400
must have been trained since childhood.

66
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,600
Mr. Wen, you have to help him.

67
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,760
Silly boy.

68
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,560
How can these beggars beat him?

69
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,520
Come on, eat a walnut.

70
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
It nourishes the brain.

71
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,320
Young Master Zhang, come with us.

72
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,080
Let's go!

73
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,800
Wen Kexing.

74
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,760
I'm here.
You asked me to keep an eye on him.

75
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,680
I'm watching him.

76
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,400
Although he is not as good-looking as you,

77
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,000
he won't hurt my eyes.

78
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,720
Do you want my help?

79
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,320
If you want my help, just tell me.

80
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,920
How can I know it if you don't tell me?

81
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,480
Your soft sword is too soft.

82
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,880
Ah Xu.

83
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
-Master Zhang.
-These people are really not kind.

84
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,200
Don't be lenient.

85
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,360
Get your weapon out.

86
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,520
-Follow me.
-Mr. Zhou!

87
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,640
Come with me.

88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Mr. Zhou.

89
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,280
Mr. Zhou, are you all right?

90
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,640
Mr. Zhou.

91
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,160
Either die

92
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,200
or scram.

93
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,040
Mr. Zhou.

94
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,520
I'm really going to be useless.

95
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,360
Mr. Zhou, what's wrong with you?

96
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,800
It's all right. I'm not going to die.

97
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,240
TIANYA INN

98
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,360
TIANYA INN

99
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,640
Master.

100
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,040
-In broad daylight, you--
-I gave them a choice.

101
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,680
They wanted to die, not live.

102
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,560
I'm so hospitable.

103
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,440
It would be impolite to not oblige them.

104
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,440
But Philanthropist Wen,

105
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,640
it's all right if you kill them,

106
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,880
but why did you
make this place so disgusting?

107
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,480
That's why it looks ostentatious.

108
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,640
YUE

109
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,760
Girls,

110
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,040
I'm going to untie both of you.

111
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,720
However,

112
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,120
please don't cry.

113
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,160
I'm usually

114
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,560
a gentleman,

115
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,560
but I can't stand women crying.

116
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,240
If a woman cries in front of me,

117
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,800
I won't remember…

118
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,800
LUSTFUL GHOST

119
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,200
…anything that will happen.

120
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,360
You cried.

121
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,080
You seduced me first.

122
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,440
Pervert, how dare you!

123
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,840
Stinky girl, you're disturbing me again.

124
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,720
Madam Luo asked you
to stop kidnapping women.

125
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,960
How dare you?

126
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,120
Did I kidnap?

127
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,800
I bought these two women
from the brothel with money.

128
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,400
If you don't believe me,
I'll show you the deed.

129
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,680
I don't care about that.

130
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,200
If I tell Madam Luo
that you bullied girls again,

131
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,720
will she check on the deed

132
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,240
or dig out your eyes?

133
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,120
My dear Ah Xiang.

134
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,440
Don't tell on me.

135
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,120
I'll leave these two girls

136
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
to you.

137
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,240
Just pretend nothing happened today.

138
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,760
You bought them to serve you.

139
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
Keep it a secret, please.

140
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,000
I can help you.

141
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,160
But if you owe me one,

142
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,560
you have to do three things for me.

143
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,480
Stinky girl, don't push me too far.

144
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,200
Why should I pick a time to bully you?

145
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,080
Master ordered you

146
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,920
to summon all the people outside

147
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
to wait for duty
at Sanbai Manor in Tai Lake.

148
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,600
Hurry up!

149
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,600
Should I still run errands for you
with such anti-gravity skills?

150
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,440
All right. I'll go.

151
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,480
Just in time to ask Master if we can stay.

152
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,440
Here.

153
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,720
Are you hungry?

154
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Taste it.

155
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,560
It's undercooked?

156
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,840
It is cooked this time,
but it is very bitter.

157
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,400
Come. Give it to me.

158
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,680
Stop eating.

159
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,560
Maybe the fish

160
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,040
itself is bitter.

161
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,240
My goodness,

162
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,080
two idiots!

163
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,960
Don't you know you have to remove

164
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,840
the internal organs
before grilling the fish?

165
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,800
If the gall of a fish breaks,
the fish must be bitter.

166
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,880
I'm speechless.

167
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,560
You have always been waited on,
haven't you?

168
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,240
Where is your master?

169
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,960
He's there.

170
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,080
It's quick for people
to follow bad examples.

171
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,360
Ah Xu.

172
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,200
Such a beautiful night

173
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,720
is suitable for drinking and singing.

174
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,920
How can you just eat this junk food?

175
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,120
Tai Lake is famous
for its fish and shrimp.

176
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,160
I happen to have a famous chef on board.

177
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,080
Why don't we ask him
to make us some delicious food?

178
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,680
Young Master Zhang,
I haven't seen you for just one day,

179
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,640
and you seem

180
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,000
to have grown taller.

181
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Ah Xiang.

182
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,840
You should learn how to serve others
from those two sisters when you are free.

183
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,280
This is also a discipline.

184
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,880
Wasn't I awe-inspiring

185
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,160
when I appeared today?

186
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,000
Master, I am stupid,

187
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,320
you know it.

188
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,360
If you think those two sisters serve well,

189
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,840
just go to them.

190
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,440
The clouds in the sky
Are like white clothes

191
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,720
After a while, it seems to be a dog

192
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,599
It has been the same since ancient times

193
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,280
All kinds of things
Will happen in the world

194
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,760
Rumor has it that Rong Changqing,
the former Magic Craftsman,

195
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,480
created three masterpieces all his life.

196
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,680
Namely, the Great Wild Land,

197
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,200
the Dragon Back,

198
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,520
and the White Cloth.

199
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,880
Back then, Qin Huaizhang,
the last lord of Four Seasons Manor,

200
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,320
galloped around with the sword,
White Cloth, in the martial arts world.

201
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,320
After the annihilation
of Four Seasons Manor,

202
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
this famous sword disappeared.

203
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,280
Ah Xu, let me tell you.

204
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,640
I saw that your sword
is very similar to the White Cloth.

205
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,160
I thought the beggars of Beggar Gangs

206
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,880
were rubbish
and vulnerable to a single blow.

207
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,240
I wanted to wait for you
to draw your sword and confirm it.

208
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,520
But to my surprise,

209
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,200
you would rather take risks
than draw swords.

210
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,080
Don't you

211
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,720
want to kill those beggars?

212
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,160
I thought about it.

213
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,800
There are only two reasons.

214
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,000
First,

215
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,280
this sword is not yours.

216
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,560
Of course.

217
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,280
How could you do such a dirty thing?

218
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,520
Then there is only the second explanation.

219
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,280
Why are you afraid

220
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,640
to reveal your whereabouts?

221
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,520
Mr. Wen.

222
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,920
Our relationship

223
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,640
is like this fish.

224
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,920
Do you know why?

225
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,960
It's raw.

226
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,000
Ever since we met,

227
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't even know

228
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,600
who I am,

229
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,040
where I'm from,

230
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,080
and where I'm going.

231
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Who are you?

232
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,080
Where do you come from?

233
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,360
Where are you going?

234
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,480
I'm not interested in that.

235
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,880
You helped me many times.

236
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,640
Thank you very much.

237
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,800
If you are insatiable

238
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,360
and want to see the White Cloth Sword,

239
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,120
you don't have to waste your words.

240
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,080
Ah Xu.

241
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,720
Why are you so grumpy today?

242
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,080
It's all my fault.

243
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,800
I shouldn't have deliberately tested you

244
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,080
and hurt your feelings.

245
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,360
It hurts me too.

246
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,520
Just forgive me this time.

247
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,640
It won't happen again.

248
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,440
I should have asked you

249
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,200
what I wanted to know.

250
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,200
You won't lie to me, right?

251
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,120
Yun Zai! Hong Lu!

252
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,320
Phantom Musician Qin Song.

253
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,280
One of the Four Assassins.

254
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,280
It is surprising that this man
can order this evil.

255
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,600
That's pretty good.

256
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,360
No matter who he is,

257
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,120
it's enough for him
to suffer from this backfire.

258
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,360
Ah Xu.

259
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,000
You are getting more and more
to my liking.

260
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,120
I'm sorry to get your flute dirty.

261
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,080
I'll find a new one
for you some other time.

262
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,360
Never mind.

263
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,080
But Ah Xu, you are good at martial arts,

264
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,600
but you are tone-deaf.

265
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,520
Shall I teach you sometime?

266
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,480
There's no need.

267
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,840
Do you feel better?

268
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,080
Let's go. Sit down for a while.

269
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
Mr. Zhou.

270
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,960
I still feel terrible.

271
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,000
Chengling.

272
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,160
How old are you?

273
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,480
I'm 14 years old.

274
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,680
The disciples of the martial arts family

275
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,160
begin to study
at the age of five to seven.

276
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,760
Even if you begin to practice
internal skills at the age of seven,

277
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,960
you have been practicing for seven years.

278
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,560
Why are you like this?

279
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,280
Don't cry.

280
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,520
All right, that's enough.

281
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,920
Children are fond of playing.

282
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,040
When I was a child,
my parents taught me to practice hard,

283
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,520
but I was also lazy all day.

284
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,280
Why am I never fond of playing?

285
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,640
Silly boy.

286
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,280
Have you ever heard that

287
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,080
the one who dislikes you
is the one who is really good to you?

288
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,400
Mr. Zhou scolded you for not working hard

289
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,280
just to enlighten you.

290
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,040
Be smart.

291
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,480
Mr. Zhou.

292
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,720
Master, please accept me as a disciple.

293
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,720
I will work hard.

294
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,160
I'll absolutely live up
to your kindness to me.

295
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,120
Stand up.

296
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,120
You are the Mirror Lake Sect's orphan.

297
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,120
You shoulder the important task
of inheriting your sect.

298
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,320
How can I teach you?

299
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,120
I haven't joined a sect yet.

300
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,960
My eldest brother is good at martial arts.

301
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,360
My second brother is a good reader.

302
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,360
I thought

303
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,640
I was only responsible for staying filial
to my parents all my life.

304
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,760
So I never learned martial arts well.

305
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,600
I haven't learned much

306
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,640
about the martial arts
of the Mirror Lake Sect.

307
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,640
"The tree wants to be still,
but the wind keeps blowing.

308
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,160
When the children want to be filial,
their parents have died."

309
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,680
Most things in the world are like this.

310
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,120
Even so,

311
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,080
you should join the Five Lakes Alliance.

312
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,440
No, Master. I just want to turn to you.

313
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,720
Please accept me as a disciple.

314
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,160
Stand up.

315
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,400
I'll say it for the last time. Stand up!

316
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,000
You have missed the best time
to learn the basics.

317
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,480
I'm afraid

318
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,040
it's hard for you to learn
the best martial arts in your life.

319
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,640
Don't talk nonsense.

320
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,920
Silly boy, you have to understand
what Mr. Zhou meant.

321
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,320
The best martial arts he meant

322
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,480
are like the martial arts of Bodhidharma
and Changming Sword Immortal.

323
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,920
A few people can reach that state.

324
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,960
It won't be a problem for you

325
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,960
to work hard from now on
to reach the same level as mine.

326
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,320
Although you are right,

327
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,720
there are two ways
to learn martial arts well.

328
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,520
One is to practice since childhood.

329
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,960
Another is to practice hard from today on.

330
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,080
Your martial arts
will get better day by day.

331
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,720
Today, you were bewitched by Magic Sound

332
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,400
and suffered some internal injuries.

333
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,120
I'll teach you some basic skills.

334
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,960
If you adjust your breath
according to my method,

335
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,880
it can treat the injury.

336
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,880
Ah Xu, I already know

337
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,560
that you are firm in speech,
but you're softhearted.

338
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,880
Here.

339
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,720
Are you all right?

340
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,880
Mr. Wen,

341
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,760
aren't you going to have a look?

342
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,720
It's all right.

343
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,240
Ah Xiang can handle it herself.

344
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,760
I can handle it myself too.

345
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,360
Don't bother.

346
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,440
Goodbye.

347
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,400
No.

348
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,960
PRETTY ARHAT
SCORPION SECT FOUR ASSASSINS

349
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,880
EVIL BODHISATTVA
SCORPION SECT FOUR ASSASSINS

350
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,880
BLOND MONSTER JIANG
SCORPION SECT FOUR ASSASSINS

351
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,720
Sir,

352
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,000
what are you afraid of?

353
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,440
Are you afraid

354
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,000
that I'll eat you up?

355
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,040
If so, you should be afraid.

356
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,800
Young man,

357
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,400
this young lady could really eat you up.

358
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,240
Be careful.

359
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,600
What? Monster Jiang.

360
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,240
Do you want me to eat you?

361
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,640
I think your meat is rough.

362
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,960
Evil Bodhisattva.

363
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,680
Can't you live

364
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,400
without hooking up with a man?

365
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,400
Listen.

366
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,040
He is my prey.

367
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,320
Don't even think about him.

368
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,960
Of course I do.

369
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,760
I want

370
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,160
to play with you.

371
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,200
No!

372
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,400
No!

373
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,920
No!

374
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,640
No!

375
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,440
I'm sick of it.

376
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,920
There's nothing to play with now.

377
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,800
PHANTOM MUSICIAN QIN SONG
SCORPION SECT FOUR ASSASSINS

378
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,600
Who hurt you like this?

379
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,040
-Magic Sound Backfire.
-Who?

380
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,640
If he could command Magic Sound Backfire,

381
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,440
his martial arts
must be stronger than yours.

382
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,000
Is there such a master around this guy?

383
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
I don't know.

384
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,680
I couldn't risk fighting him head-on.

385
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,200
You are a wimp.

386
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,760
It's all right to be beaten.

387
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,000
You don't even know
who you were beaten by.

388
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,200
I want to see

389
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,760
what you would say

390
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,680
when Master blames you.

391
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,520
I'll meet him.

392
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,560
Master ordered us
to hurry back to Yueyang.

393
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,240
Qin Song made a mistake.

394
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,680
Master will deal with him.

395
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,160
Pretty Arhat, don't get into trouble.

396
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,000
I'll kill the man who hurt Qin Song

397
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,120
-before going back to Yueyang.
-You!

398
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,600
Anyway, you all know Master's orders.

399
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,280
I would like to see

400
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,920
what you can do to disobey him.

401
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,640
I will be very happy

402
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,880
to kill you

403
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,840
for Master.

404
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,080
Meditate.

405
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,920
Didn't anyone teach you how to meditate?

406
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,560
Look at your nose and be calm.

407
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,720
Palms facing the sky.
Focus your energy on the suprapubic area.

408
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,880
It's normal to feel cold at first.

409
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,560
Remember, everything you see
is an illusion.

410
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,160
Don't worry.

411
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,240
Focus on your internal breath.

412
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,000
Use your breath

413
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,160
to dissolve internal injuries.

414
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,120
This is

415
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,720
the "Bodhi Meditation Song."

416
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,640
This song is very useful
for practicing internal skills.

417
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,080
The song sounds crisp and tough.
It's very smooth.

418
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,720
Only those who do not have evil
in their hearts can do so.

419
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,720
I didn't expect this man
to blow such a flute.

420
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,840
Ever since I was a child,
I wanted you to play the flute.

421
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,720
I had to beg and flatter you many times.

422
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,400
And now, you played all night

423
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,520
for a beggar.

424
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,080
You're not in danger,

425
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,640
and you're not hurt internally.

426
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,160
Your internal force is shallower
than the water in this cup.

427
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,640
And you want me to play?

428
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,320
The internal force I consumed
is more than what you gained.

429
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,280
Are you stupid?

430
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,880
Stop the nonsense.
Go on with your meditation.

431
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,800
What are you going to do

432
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,360
with the sisters you saved?

433
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,280
Well…

434
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
Do you remember

435
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,800
that you saved a dog
when you were a child?

436
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,840
I forced you to throw it away,
but you didn't.

437
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
Then the dog was stewed and eaten.

438
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,400
You cried for three months.

439
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,360
I still have the same attitude.

440
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,400
If you have made a promise to it,

441
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,680
but you can't take care of it
for the rest of your life,

442
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,320
you might as well finish it ahead of time.

443
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,280
Can it be the same?

444
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,960
They're living people.

445
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,920
Master.

446
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,120
You said you followed Young Master Zhang

447
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,240
because you thought
there was something wrong with him.

448
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,600
Now, you wear out your internal force
to play the flute for others.

449
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,520
I don't know if the beggar is grateful.

450
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,000
It's none of your business.

451
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,240
Can't I just like him

452
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
and want to make friends with him?

453
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,000
Once you get into it,

454
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,760
you know the consequences.

455
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,600
I haven't slept so well for a long time.

456
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,880
You're awake, Ah Xu.

457
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,440
Did you sleep well?

458
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,560
After playing the flute all night,

459
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,880
my breath

460
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,040
was a little slow.

461
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,720
Forgive me.

462
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,840
Why were you playing the flute all night?

463
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,400
I deliberately tested you yesterday

464
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,080
and caused your internal injuries.

465
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,000
After one night,

466
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,600
you should feel much better.

467
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,920
I'm making up for my error.

468
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,800
Don't be mad at me.

469
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,280
Come.

470
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,560
Let me feel your pulse.

471
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,800
Master.

472
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,680
Please teach me martial arts.

473
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,440
Who are you calling "Master"?

474
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,840
Yesterday, I just taught you
some internal skills

475
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,080
to resolve your internal injuries.

476
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,040
It's not the martial arts of my sect.

477
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,680
We are not master-and-disciple.

478
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,640
After I send you to Sanbai Manor,

479
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,400
our fate ends there.

480
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,720
If you want to learn martial arts,
find someone else.

481
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,960
Silly boy, did that scare you?

482
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,680
Don't you know that

483
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,960
your master is a man
who's firm in speech but is softhearted?

484
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,680
Cling on him.

485
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,440
Haven't you heard
that tough women can't resist clingy men?

486
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,920
I mean,
"Where there is a will, there is a way."

487
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,840
Go on.

488
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,040
Master.

489
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,920
Please accept me as a disciple.

490
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,520
Are you going or not?

491
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,720
What are you doing?

492
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,000
Ah Xu, you're so cruel.

493
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,120
Will you leave me alone in the wilderness?

494
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,520
Are you short of servants?

495
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,680
No one cares about me now.

496
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,520
Ah Xiang is bent on finding a man.

497
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,080
She finds me annoying
and drove me off the boat.

498
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,920
I don't believe you.

499
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,880
Actually, Ah Xiang blamed me
for not taking care of my own body

500
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,480
and playing the flute all night.

501
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,040
So she drove me off the boat.

502
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,880
I feel a little pain
in my suprapubic area right now.

503
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,520
Is it a loss of energy?

504
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,680
Ah Xu.

505
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,200
Just give me a lift.

506
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,240
Steady.

507
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,120
Mr. Zhou.

508
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,320
Lie down well.

509
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,000
You're a good driver.

510
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,760
Ah Xu,

511
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,440
you are good at everything,

512
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,400
but you don't know how to enjoy life.

513
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,640
Eating and drinking
are the happiest things in life.

514
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,440
Why do you always do them so casually?

515
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,680
It is up to you.

516
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,360
The Hu prefecture is just ahead.

517
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,840
If you are not satisfied, you can leave.

518
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,280
How could I not be satisfied with you?

519
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,840
I'm just worried.

520
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,920
I'm worried about Chengling

521
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,040
who can't eat nor sleep well these days.

522
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,120
Look at his face.

523
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,360
When you were a master, you looked fair.

524
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,040
It has only been a few days.

525
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,560
We are approaching Hu.

526
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,200
Let's find a restaurant

527
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,640
and have a good meal.

528
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,680
It's my treat. All right?

529
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,120
Since you have fought
with the Beggar Gangs,

530
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,960
I'm sure a lot of people
are looking for you

531
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,160
because they are well-informed.

532
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,880
In order to avoid complications,

533
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,560
you'd better put up with it.

534
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,520
You'll be fine at Zhao Jing's mansion.

535
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,120
Master, please accept me as a disciple.

536
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,720
Little Chengling.

537
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,760
I didn't expect

538
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,280
that you'd be so tough.

539
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,400
If only I could pester people like you.

540
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,040
Mr. Wen,

541
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,160
I don't want to leave you.

542
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,880
Don't worry.

543
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,880
I watched
the celestial phenomena at night,

544
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
pinching and counting,

545
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,840
and found that our fate

546
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,040
has not ended.

547
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,360
-Master!
-Master!

548
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,560
Ao Laizi, stop running!

549
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,640
At such an old age,

550
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,280
don't you understand?

551
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,240
Lu Taichong is unkind.

552
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,600
If he dies, he'll take you too.

553
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,040
I'm telling you, stay out of this.

554
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,560
You can't do it.

555
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,120
Can you?

556
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,920
What a joke.

557
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,200
Even though our Mount Tai Sect is weak,

558
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,200
I won't be afraid of you.

559
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,160
Children, don't delay.

560
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,320
Go and find Hero Zhao.

561
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,720
You got involved in trouble
for our Danyang Sect,

562
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,680
so we can't abandon you and leave.

563
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,520
We are in this together.

564
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,720
-Together!
-Together!

565
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,840
Ao Laizi.

566
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,000
Your internal force is exhausted now
and you are very weak.

567
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,280
What else can you do?

568
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,240
We are bound to win the Glazed Armor.

569
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,120
Why don't you keep abreast with the times?

570
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,080
Tao Hong and Lu Liu.

571
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,560
Opponents always meet.

572
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,360
Mr. Shen.

573
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,200
Ao Laizi is also an expert.

574
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,240
Why were you so scared all the way?

575
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,680
It turned out
that it was the chief of Mount Dagu

576
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,720
who was chasing Mount Tai Sect.

577
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,560
Master Shen.

578
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,600
If today's story spreads out,

579
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,920
I don't think your Five Lakes Alliance
will be respected.

580
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,120
Let's see if you can stay alive

581
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,800
to spread the story.

582
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,480
Qing Bai, let's go.

583
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,280
SANBAI MANOR

584
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,520
I heard a long time ago that Hero Sanbai
is the richest in the world.

585
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,080
It is really magnificent

586
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,320
and even a little elegant.

587
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,440
Master, these are the two righteous men

588
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,760
who found Chengling.

589
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,480
ZHAO JING
TAI LAKE SECT OF FIVE LAKES ALLIANCE

590
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,960
You have grown up.

591
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,400
Chengling.

592
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,280
I'm your father's best brother.

593
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,160
I am Zhao Jing.

594
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,640
Just call me Mr. Zhao.

595
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,440
You…

596
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,120
Are you Mr. Zhao?

597
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,000
Chengling, you have suffered.

598
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,040
From now on, make this place your home.

599
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,440
Just tell me

600
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,560
what you want to eat

601
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,520
and use.

602
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,120
Masters, I was rude.

603
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,200
Thank you for escorting Chengling back.

604
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,200
I won't forget your great kindness.

605
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,360
Please accept my respects.

606
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,680
You're welcome.

607
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,280
After hearing about
your elegant demeanor for a long time,

608
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,120
it is better for me to see for myself.

609
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,120
Hero Zhao.

610
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,960
My master, the chief of Mount Tai Sect,

611
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,160
is being chased.

612
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,320
Please go and help them
as soon as possible.
