1
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,320
Twenty years ago,

2
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,720
when the evil Rong Xuan
was killed at Mount Qingya

3
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,600
by the Five Lakes Alliance
and other heroes,

4
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,120
he left behind

5
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,120
an armory that could let someone
become invincible overnight.

6
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,800
In order to open the armory,

7
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,480
one must find the Glazed Armor.

8
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,840
Afterward, as a nursery rhyme spread,

9
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,840
many forces began

10
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,440
to secretly search for the Glazed Armor

11
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,480
in order to control the armory.

12
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,520
Prince Jin in the north

13
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,040
is also starting to make his move.

14
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:40,400
MILITARY GOVERNOR'S MANSION

15
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,600
-What happened?
-Look.

16
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,880
Over there too!

17
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,080
Archers, get ready!

18
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,560
Shoot!

19
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,680
CHANGSHA PREFECTURE CHIEF
NANNING PREFECTURE CHIEF

20
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,360
Prince Jin is secretly training assassins
in the Window of Heaven

21
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,760
to kill the officials of the Court.

22
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,200
He has intentions to revolt.

23
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,200
OFFICER LI

24
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,800
SWORDSMAN IN GREEN

25
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,280
Master, the assassins are here.

26
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,720
Hurry and come with me!

27
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,960
JINGYI RESIDENCE

28
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,840
Who are you?

29
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,440
Hand over the confidential letter.

30
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,160
No way!

31
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
ZHOU ZISHU
CHIEF OF THE WINDOW OF HEAVEN

32
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
Officer Zhou.

33
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,600
You--

34
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,320
you are from the Window of Heaven?

35
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,280
I'm here to see Officer Li off.

36
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,920
Zhou Zishu.

37
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,160
What you do to others
will be inflicted on you later.

38
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,640
You are helping the bad guys.

39
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,680
The disaster in the future

40
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,080
begins today.

41
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,880
I die without regret.

42
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,040
Officer Li,

43
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,040
I'm sorry.

44
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,520
PRINCESS JING AN
THE MILITARY GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER

45
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,920
Zhou Zishu.

46
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Princess Jing An.

47
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,400
This is--

48
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,800
The Military Governor
conspired with corrupt officials

49
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,440
in an attempt to revolt.

50
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,880
He has been killed.

51
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,200
It's impossible.

52
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
It's impossible.

53
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,480
My father gave everything to the country!

54
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,720
It's a pity,

55
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,240
but his actions must be punished.

56
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,080
I came to visit today

57
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,480
to give you a choice.

58
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,600
I want to thank you for bringing back

59
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,920
my junior Qin Jiuxiao's body to me

60
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,760
in chaotic circumstances.

61
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,520
I will never forget your kindness.

62
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,640
Your Highness, you have a high status.

63
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,080
Committing suicide

64
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,760
will save you from humiliation.

65
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,960
Am I supposed to thank you?

66
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,960
You killed my entire family.

67
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,560
And you are letting me die with dignity.

68
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,640
Where did you

69
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,600
bury Jiuxiao?

70
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,400
Four Seasons Manor.

71
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,440
He was laid next to our master.

72
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,120
The flowers blossom in all four seasons,

73
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,400
knowing everything in the world.

74
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,000
QIN JIUXIAO
YOUNG LORD OF FOUR SEASONS MANOR

75
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,920
It's so ugly.

76
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
Give it to me.

77
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,560
Give it to me!

78
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
You are so annoying.

79
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,680
Jiuxiao.

80
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,920
If you find a girl you like,

81
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
I will be happy for you.

82
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,640
He told me

83
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,240
that after he retired from his position,

84
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,120
he would

85
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,960
live with me there.

86
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,400
I--

87
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,960
Everything is taken care of.

88
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,160
Only a few stubborn generals

89
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,400
tried to resist.

90
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,000
I've killed them all.

91
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,520
Chief, Bi Changfeng
made a huge mistake in the mission

92
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,040
to assassinate the Military Governor.

93
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,760
And he wants to leave
the Window of Heaven.

94
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,120
It infuriated Prince Jin.

95
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,080
Prince Jin ordered you
to deal with it in person.

96
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,200
Mr. Bi.

97
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,080
BI CHANGFENG
GUARD OF THE WINDOW OF HEAVEN,

98
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,520
FORMER MEMBER OF FOUR SEASONS MANOR

99
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,680
My lord, you are here.

100
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Mr. Bi.

101
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,520
Four Seasons Manor

102
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,360
only has you and me left.

103
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,400
Eighty-one of our brothers
came to Jin with you.

104
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,480
Now, it's just you and me.

105
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,480
Even Jiuxiao is dead.

106
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,000
What Four Seasons Manor can there be?

107
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,280
Why haven't your wounds healed?

108
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,120
"Shadows without traces.

109
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,760
Entry without exit.

110
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,520
Know everything.

111
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,480
Be everywhere."

112
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,040
Prince Jin requested me

113
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,720
to accomplish these four things

114
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,440
when I created the Window of Heaven.

115
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,920
Once you enter

116
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,840
the Window of Heaven,

117
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,200
you can't leave.

118
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,800
You know that.

119
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,120
I know

120
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,160
that I can't walk out.

121
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,200
Can I not be carried out?

122
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,240
Even if I can only live freely
for one day,

123
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,560
it's still better
than being Prince Jin's dog.

124
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,360
You would rather become a cripple

125
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,840
than continue working for me?

126
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,480
Over the years,
we have been through thick and thin.

127
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,400
I did everything you asked me to.

128
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,600
But our people from Four Seasons Manor
were continuously persecuted.

129
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,120
So I began to question
Prince Jin's intentions.

130
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,760
Now,

131
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,440
I really can't do it anymore.

132
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,320
Not to mention seven nails,

133
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,080
I'm willing to take a thousand cuts
in order to quit!

134
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,240
I know you can't help it,

135
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,920
and I don't blame you.

136
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,480
If our relationship over the years

137
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,560
still matters to you,

138
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,440
please give me the nails.

139
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,920
That's true.

140
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,360
All I can do is send you off

141
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,800
with my own hands.

142
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,880
Don't worry.

143
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,400
I will take care of your family.

144
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,680
Whether it is worry

145
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,480
or relief,

146
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,200
I won't know about it.

147
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,960
My lord, please go ahead.

148
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,480
HAN YING
COMMANDER OF THE WINDOW OF HEAVEN

149
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,400
DUAN PENGJU
DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE WINDOW OF HEAVEN

150
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,520
Mr. Bi

151
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,040
is really a tough man.

152
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,800
No ordinary person

153
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,160
can endure the Nails of Seven Torments.

154
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,720
Mr. Zhang.

155
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,280
What are the Nails of Seven Torments?

156
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,960
Nails of Seven Torments,

157
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,200
death in three years.

158
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,760
Once you've taken the nails,

159
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,480
not only will you lose
your martial arts skills,

160
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,880
but you'll also begin to lose your senses.

161
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,600
In the beginning, you can't speak.

162
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,840
Then you can't hear, smell, or see.

163
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,440
You'll turn into a vegetative state.

164
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,000
This is the only way

165
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,400
that you won't expose
the secrets of the Window of Heaven.

166
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,320
Although you become a cripple,

167
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,040
you'll still remember what happened.

168
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,920
You'll live in torment for three years

169
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,880
before you actually get to die.

170
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,920
Why would anyone want to take it?

171
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,680
Isn't it better to just die?

172
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,600
Well.

173
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,600
Will they let you die so easily?

174
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,240
This is the rule of the Window of Heaven.

175
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,480
They scare you

176
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,880
so that you won't consider leaving.

177
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,120
If one day,

178
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,640
you don't want to stay here anymore,

179
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,280
pretend to accidentally fall

180
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,800
on your blade during the mission.

181
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,680
You'll die quickly without torment.

182
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,640
If you die during a mission,

183
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
our lord

184
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,720
will even take care of your family.

185
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,440
No, I dare not.

186
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,040
I will be loyal to the Window of Heaven

187
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,560
and our lord for the rest of my life.

188
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,800
What did you call me?

189
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,960
My lord.

190
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,000
No, Chief.

191
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,320
I'm sorry.

192
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,640
I thought the elders called you that.

193
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,440
The last person
from Four Seasons Manor is gone.

194
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,320
Don't ever say

195
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,720
"my lord" again.

196
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,480
GUIYUN PAVILION

197
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,840
It has been ten years.

198
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,720
Ten years on this path of no return.

199
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,640
I remember each face of the people
from Four Seasons Manor who died.

200
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,480
They're all dead.

201
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,480
Except me.

202
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,880
Why?

203
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,440
Because I don't even deserve to die.

204
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,080
It serves me right to keep living.

205
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,080
Chief of the Window of Heaven.

206
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,240
I am above hundreds and thousands of men
and only below one

207
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,360
and yet I live like this,
boastful of this power,

208
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,800
but I can't even save
a single person I want to protect.

209
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,600
LICHUN PALACE

210
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,320
Why isn't Zishu coming to see me?

211
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,440
Has he still not recovered?

212
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,320
Your Highness.

213
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,720
The traitor has rallied many people

214
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,600
who are skilled at martial arts.

215
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,480
The chief hasn't fought anyone
for a long time.

216
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,600
It must have aggravated
his injuries this time.

217
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,440
He has been resting
in isolation these days.

218
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,480
Ever since he spat blood and fainted

219
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,520
at the news of Qin Jiuxiao's death,

220
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,760
how long have his injuries lasted?

221
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,680
About a year, right?

222
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,800
Your Highness.

223
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Yes.

224
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,440
He became like this just for Qin Jiuxiao.

225
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,600
He won't be of great use.

226
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,960
Tell him to come to see me
as soon as possible.

227
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,120
Yes, Your Highness.

228
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,080
CHONGMING COURT

229
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,400
THE FLOWERS BLOSSOM
IN ALL FOUR SEASONS

230
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,600
"The flowers blossom in all four seasons,

231
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,440
knowing everything in the world."

232
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,520
Eighty-one of our brothers
came to Jin with you.

233
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,600
Now, it's just you and me.

234
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,600
Even Jiuxiao is dead.

235
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,880
What Four Seasons Manor can there be?

236
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,760
In order to leave the Window of Heaven,

237
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,720
I spent a year and a half

238
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,920
putting the Nails of Seven Torments
in my body.

239
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,440
There are actually two ways
to put in the nails.

240
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,960
If you put all seven nails in at once,

241
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,720
the person being tortured
will quickly lose his senses,

242
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,240
and he can only live
for three years as a cripple.

243
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,200
But if you put in one nail
every three months

244
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,240
to let the nail
get into your body gradually

245
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,000
and become part of your body,

246
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,040
although you will still have
three years left,

247
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
you will retain half of your martial arts

248
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,720
and your senses
will only disappear in turn slowly

249
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,320
until death.

250
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,200
You just have to endure the extreme pain

251
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,520
that will last for 3 years and 18 months.

252
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,280
Zhou Zishu.

253
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,680
Don't do that.

254
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,080
Jiuxiao?

255
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,120
Why are you crying?

256
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,280
What's there to cry about?

257
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,640
It's what I deserve.

258
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,080
The 81 brothers

259
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,600
from Four Seasons Manor

260
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,040
all died

261
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,520
in my hands.

262
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,200
Our heritage has been terminated.

263
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,960
I couldn't protect any of you.

264
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,680
I even killed

265
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,480
your lover.

266
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,160
I--

267
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,160
After I die,

268
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,400
how can I face you?

269
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,640
I wonder

270
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,960
if you've met Princess Jing An

271
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,080
over at your side.

272
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,440
She must be telling on me, right?

273
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,400
How could there be
such a cruel senior like me?

274
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,680
How could I give
a bottle of poison to my sister-in-law

275
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,040
as a first gift?

276
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,120
The guard Zhou Zishu is here!

277
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,240
Come in.

278
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

279
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,320
Please rise.

280
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,720
You really

281
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,400
don't look well.

282
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,440
Take a rest.

283
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,000
You are a pillar of this country.

284
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,400
I need your help to achieve my goals.

285
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,840
I am an ordinary man,

286
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,200
only fit to be your weapon.

287
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,800
Now that Hedong is peaceful,

288
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,200
you need people who know
about governing a country.

289
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,960
I can only fight

290
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,760
and can't be of great help to you.

291
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,640
Zishu,

292
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,600
what do you mean by that?

293
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,680
Zishu!

294
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,080
My spirit is broken.

295
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,360
My wounds are not recovering
and I can't do much now.

296
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,320
I want to return to my hometown.

297
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,000
I've already left the Window of Heaven.

298
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I asked for the punishment
of the Nails of Seven Torments

299
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,520
and allowed it myself.

300
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,040
I've already

301
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,720
put six nails in.

302
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,520
If I put in one more,

303
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,520
I'm afraid that I won't get
to say goodbye to you.

304
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,320
I hope you can consider my hard work,
even without any achievements,

305
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,880
and fulfill my wishes.

306
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,760
Good.

307
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,800
That's very good.

308
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,520
Zhou Zishu.

309
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,040
No wonder you are
the chief of the Window of Heaven.

310
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,440
You are cruel and decisive,

311
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,760
even willing to hurt yourself like this.

312
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,480
Your Highness, please calm down.

313
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,560
If you don't want to live,

314
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,880
I can let you die!

315
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,880
Why go through all this trouble?

316
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,360
You saved my life.

317
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,480
If you allow it,

318
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,040
I can then drag this crippled body along
for two more years.

319
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,640
If you don't,

320
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,240
then take my life.

321
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,200
You all lied to me!

322
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,200
Yunxing left.

323
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,720
Beiyuan.

324
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,440
Beiyuan is gone too.

325
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,240
I'm really alone in this world now.

326
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,840
Zishu,

327
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,240
you were lying to me, right?

328
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,800
If I spare you,

329
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,600
are you willing to help me

330
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,800
achieve my goals?

331
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,080
Please give me

332
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,760
the last nail.

333
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,480
You would rather be a cripple

334
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,200
than be my trusted official?

335
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,320
Fine!

336
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,640
I understand your intention.

337
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,040
Nails of Seven Torments,

338
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,720
death in three years.

339
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,720
Zhou Zishu,

340
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,280
you have to stay alive.

341
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,600
Three years.

342
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,320
Within three years,

343
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,880
I will definitely go there
and ascend the throne!

344
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,760
I'm going to show you

345
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,680
that I am the chosen one,

346
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,520
and I will be successful no matter what!

347
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,480
I will try my best.

348
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,960
Pengju.

349
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,240
Do as he says.

350
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,520
From now on,

351
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,160
you are the chief of the Window of Heaven.

352
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,040
Chief.

353
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,360
His Highness means…

354
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,880
congratulations to us both.

355
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,400
Both of us got what we wanted today.

356
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,120
"The rivers flow.

357
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,880
The window leads to the underworld.

358
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
Rumors endanger justice.

359
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,200
The clouds hide the sun."

360
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,200
You just wait, Zhou Zishu.

361
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,080
I will let you go for now.

362
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,760
HANGED GHOST
ONE OF THE TEN DEVILS OF GHOST VALLEY

363
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,720
GHOST VALLEY

364
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,440
That treacherous Hanged Ghost

365
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,320
suddenly jumped off the cliff with a vine.

366
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,240
We weren't quick enough

367
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,200
to stop him.

368
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Useless!

369
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,120
We need to see him if he is alive
and his body if he is dead.

370
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,240
Where is his body?

371
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,480
There wasn't a body under the cliff.

372
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,400
CHANGING GHOST
ONE OF THE TEN DEVILS OF GHOST VALLEY

373
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,040
Good.

374
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,280
Very good!

375
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,560
It's my fault.

376
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,880
Chief, please forgive me!

377
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,160
Please spare my life!

378
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,600
Chief, please forgive us. Kneel down.

379
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,200
-Chief, please forgive us.
-Chief, please forgive us.

380
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,680
Hanged Ghost stole my Glazed Armor!

381
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,400
Glazed--

382
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,600
-Glazed Armor?
-Order all 3,000 ghosts in Mount Qingya.

383
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,960
From now on,

384
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
I want everyone to go out

385
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,920
and kill the traitor.

386
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,960
Whoever can get

387
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,760
the Glazed Armor back for me

388
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,200
will be the head of Ten Devils!

389
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,360
-Kill Hanged Ghost!
-Kill Hanged Ghost!

390
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,960
-Retrieve the Glazed Armor!
-Retrieve the Glazed Armor!

391
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,560
-Kill Hanged Ghost!
-Kill Hanged Ghost!

392
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,360
-Retrieve the Glazed Armor!
-Retrieve the Glazed Armor!

393
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,040
THREE MONTHS LATER, YUE

394
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,480
FUDING PAVILION

395
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,480
Whoever has been a beggar for three years

396
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,120
won't want to exchange his place
even with an emperor.

397
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,680
Master, look!

398
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,400
That beggar is pretty optimistic.

399
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,200
WEN KEXING

400
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,840
GU XIANG

401
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,240
He doesn't even have a bowl before him.

402
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,320
He didn't get any money
and is still happy.

403
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,360
Maybe he is a fool.

404
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,400
He is enjoying the sunshine.

405
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,040
Enjoying the sunshine?

406
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,600
What's there to enjoy in the sun?

407
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,400
He is already so skinny.

408
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,520
If he keeps sitting in the sun,
he will really dry up!

409
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,280
Master,

410
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,880
don't look down on me
for not having as much experience in life.

411
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,320
He looks like

412
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,160
he hasn't had a full meal for three years.

413
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,880
He may die anytime.

414
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,480
Am I wrong?

415
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,440
I bet that he is definitely a beggar.

416
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,800
What's the stake?

417
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,680
If I win, you have to play cards
with me for three days!

418
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,480
What if you lose?

419
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,200
Then I'll play cards with you
for three days.

420
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Little girl,

421
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,680
are you trying to trick me?

422
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,720
ZHANG CHENGLING

423
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,400
Wu, give him some money.

424
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,600
Master, look! Someone gave him money!

425
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,760
I won.

426
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,160
Why doesn't he want the money?

427
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,280
Young Master, look at him.

428
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,680
He didn't even thank us.

429
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,880
No wonder he is a beggar.

430
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,280
Who told you to throw it on him?

431
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,680
FUDING PAVILION

432
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,680
Hey, you!

433
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,920
I'll treat you to a meal, all right?

434
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,000
Kind lady.

435
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,720
How about

436
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,920
you treat me to a drink?

437
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,760
Master, he called me a kind lady.

438
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,680
A kind lady!

439
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,480
Let's bet.

440
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,040
All right.

441
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,040
I'll treat you to a drink.

442
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,520
Here.

443
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,800
Are you not afraid that it's poisoned

444
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,600
and you'll spill your guts
after drinking it?

445
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,480
This is good wine.

446
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,160
It's worth it even if I die from poison.

447
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,960
A toast to you!

448
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,720
Thank you, kind lady.

449
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,760
"Kind lady."

450
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,200
Here.

451
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,280
Miss, your martial arts are really good!

452
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,640
Let me ask you.

453
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,800
Why don't you want their money?

454
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,800
You want wine but not money.

455
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,480
You are so picky for a beggar.

456
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,760
Who says I'm a beggar?

457
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,040
I'm just here to enjoy the sunshine.

458
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,440
You tricked me into giving you wine?

459
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,560
Give it back!

460
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,720
I can't give you back the wine,
but you can have my life.

461
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,760
Do you think
I don't dare to take your life?

462
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,880
Miss, how could you bully a sick person

463
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,200
with your good martial arts?

464
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,440
Martial artists
should help the poor and the weak.

465
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,520
-You should be righteous and just!
-Little idiot.

466
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,480
Are you lecturing me right now?

467
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,160
Be careful. I might cut off your tongue!

468
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,840
-She has such good skills.
-Kind lady.

469
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,560
You look sweet,

470
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,160
but you're fierce.

471
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,360
I don't believe you!
