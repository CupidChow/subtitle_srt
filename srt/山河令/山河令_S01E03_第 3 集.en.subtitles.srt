1
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
Mr. Wen.

2
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,480
I've been helping you kill
and bury bodies all night,

3
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,200
why are you still calling me "Mr. Wen"?

4
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,840
Aren't you being a bit too formal?

5
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,440
You shouldn't drink cold liquor
with that injury.

6
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,480
Ah Xiang. Warm it up.

7
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,640
I'm fine with waiting on you,

8
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,320
but now, I have to wait
on these two idiots too?

9
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,040
Gu Xiang, let me do it.

10
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,680
Take it.

11
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,960
Mr. Wen.

12
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,120
How strange.

13
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,520
It has a skin and flesh feel to it,

14
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,160
but why does it feel
like you grew it yourself?

15
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,000
I did try to grow it myself.

16
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,480
Who is this guy?

17
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,280
How could he recognize
the Swift Moving Steps

18
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,320
and see through my disguise too?

19
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,120
I've never made a mistake
in my judgment of people.

20
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,600
Your figure speaks of
honesty and uprightness,

21
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,880
you must be extraordinary.

22
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,800
Why…

23
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,920
Master!

24
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,040
Last time, you pointed
at the back of a village girl

25
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,920
and praised her for having
fair shoulder blades,

26
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,640
saying she must be a beauty.

27
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,480
But when she turned around,

28
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,040
she couldn't look more homely.

29
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,200
You don't understand.

30
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,600
That girl is inherently beautiful,

31
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,040
but the poor environment
gave her a plain appearance.

32
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,640
It wasn't my mistake.

33
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,279
As for Mr. Zhou…

34
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,519
Mr. Zhou.

35
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,840
I can't see anything obvious yet,

36
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,320
but I'm sure
you've changed your appearance.

37
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,960
Is it pretty?

38
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
It's perfect.

39
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,760
Master Zhang,

40
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,560
the masks of those people
who were chasing you

41
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,240
had symbols
of Mount Qingya's Ghost Valley.

42
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,560
This group of devils
has disappeared for many years.

43
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,040
How did the Mirror Lake Sect
get into trouble with them?

44
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,680
I don't know.

45
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,040
You don't know?

46
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,520
Mr. Zhou,

47
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,360
you must know
how strong Ghost Valley is, right?

48
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,360
You got involved
in such a major issue for no reason.

49
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,720
Don't you want to know
what's behind all of it?

50
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,800
I don't know

51
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,000
and I'm not interested.

52
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,960
But I can get a good picture
just by guessing.

53
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,720
Mr. Zhou.

54
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,040
The matters of the martial arts world

55
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,720
are all about three things.

56
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,840
Greed, hatred, and ignorance.

57
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,880
Ghost Valley disappeared for many years,

58
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,800
so there's no hatred to speak of.

59
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,960
Autumn Moon Sword

60
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,200
has always preserved moral integrity
and been at peace with all.

61
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,200
There's no ignorance to speak of either.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,440
So the only thing left is greed.

63
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,760
The ghosts on Mount Qingya
must have destroyed the Mirror Lake Sect

64
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,560
out of greed for something.

65
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,480
I wonder if Mr. Zhou
has heard of this nursery rhyme.

66
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,880
The water from the Five Lakes
Gathers around the world

67
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,320
Who else deserves the supremacy
In the martial arts world?

68
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,760
That's right.

69
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,040
This song has spread
throughout Jiangnan these past few months.

70
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,240
Everyone knows this is
the Five Lakes Alliance's campaign

71
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,040
to compete for leadership
over the martial arts world.

72
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,720
But a few days ago,

73
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,360
a strange second half of the song

74
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,720
spread from Yue.

75
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,680
Master, what is it?

76
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,040
The Iridescent Clouds are scattered

77
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,520
And the Glaze is shattered

78
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,360
Who will cry

79
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,040
With the Ghosts on Mount Qingya?

80
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,880
What's so sad about
the Ghosts on Mount Qingya?

81
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,320
Each one of them is full of evil

82
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,560
and ended up in Ghost Valley
for they had nowhere to escape.

83
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,720
You're right.

84
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,480
But the words "the Ghosts on Mount Qingya"

85
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,800
don't stand for a group of ghosts,

86
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,120
but for Rong Xuan,

87
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,400
the great demon who was executed
at Mount Qingya 20 years ago.

88
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,240
It's said that this demon
with the surname Rong

89
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,640
left behind a martial arts treasure
called "World's Armory."

90
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,840
It contains the long-lost

91
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,440
supreme techniques
of various martial arts sects.

92
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,880
It can make any ordinary man invincible.

93
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,040
The key to this armory

94
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,800
is called the "Glazed Armor."

95
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,920
A treasure that makes people invincible?

96
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,640
You can only trick an ignorant rustic

97
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,480
into believing this kind of foolish talk.

98
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,200
Mr. Wen, do you believe it?

99
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,920
Why? Don't you believe it?

100
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,120
Treasures, divine weapons,

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,880
secret martial arts scrolls, and panaceas.

102
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,600
Every few years,

103
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,800
something of the kind gets made up

104
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,800
and causes the people
of the martial arts world

105
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,200
to scramble for it,
leading to countless deaths.

106
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,640
Only then will everyone be happy.

107
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,280
It's ridiculous.

108
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,000
How is it ridiculous?

109
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,600
Isn't it?

110
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,960
All these treasures

111
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,560
have a name.

112
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,600
They're called "reaping without sowing."

113
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,440
Simply put,

114
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,400
it's just greed.

115
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,440
I'm surprised
that you have the same opinion as me.

116
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,280
Though peace reigns over the land,

117
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,320
ignorant people create trouble
for themselves.

118
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,280
I finally figured out what you just said.

119
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,440
That's right.

120
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,840
In fact, it's because
the people fighting over it know

121
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,640
that their martial arts skills are poor,

122
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,120
so they try to reap them without sowing.

123
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,240
They already know they are weak,
but they still fight with others over it.

124
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,640
Do they have a death wish?

125
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,560
Master.

126
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,200
Looks like there are loads of people
more stupid than me!

127
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,640
Ms. Gu is quite smart.

128
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,440
What do you think, Master Zhang?

129
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,280
We should take a nap.

130
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,400
It's almost dawn.

131
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,240
Indeed,

132
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,040
it's almost dawn.

133
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,000
Move quickly.

134
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,920
Get more men.

135
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,360
MIRROR LAKE MANOR

136
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,960
MIRROR LAKE MANOR

137
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,520
SHEN SHEN, CHIEF OF MOUNT DAGU SECT,
FIVE LAKES ALLIANCE

138
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,400
Cover the bodies.

139
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,720
Don't expose them to the sun.

140
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,280
-Put it here.
-All right.

141
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,000
Kuan'er!

142
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,800
MIRROR LAKE MANOR

143
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,800
Master Shen.

144
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,160
-Greetings, Chief.
-Greetings, Chief.

145
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,160
What happened?

146
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,120
Master Shen…

147
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,320
Where is Master Zhang?

148
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,280
Master Shen.

149
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,960
When we arrived last night,

150
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,960
every one of the Mirror Lake Sect
had already been killed.

151
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,480
These are the remains of Master Zhang
and our two juniors.

152
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
Yusen.…

153
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,280
Master Shen.

154
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,280
Step aside.

155
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,480
-Master Shen.
-Step aside!

156
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,040
Master Shen.

157
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,040
You'd better not look.

158
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,440
Master Zhang and the two juniors
were tortured before they died.

159
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,080
Their remains are in a poor state.

160
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,760
Master Shen!

161
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,720
-Hero Shen!
-Master Shen, you…

162
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,320
It's all my fault.

163
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,160
I failed to save them in time.

164
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,720
As the first disciple of the Yueyang Sect,
I am to blame.

165
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,480
Please punish me, Master!

166
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,680
Weren't you ordered here
to hand over the invitation?

167
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,400
Why weren't you here in time
to rescue them either?

168
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,320
When we saw the fire
while in Yue last night,

169
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,920
we rushed to the lake immediately,

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,120
but someone

171
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,920
destroyed all the boats
early that morning.

172
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,640
What a cruel scheme.

173
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,960
If I find them,

174
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,720
I will pay them back a hundredfold!

175
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,920
In all my years,

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,320
I've never heard anyone
boast so outrageously,

177
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,440
talking so loudly and irresponsibly.

178
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,200
Tao Hong and Lu Liu, what do you mean?

179
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,040
Hero Shen.

180
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,640
When you became sworn brothers,

181
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,920
didn't you swear to die at the same time?

182
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,920
Now that your sworn brother
died such a cruel death,

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,400
why don't you end your life
and follow him?

184
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,160
A few tears are all you have?

185
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,040
Nonsense!

186
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,200
Old woman, you don't understand.

187
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,160
The Five Lakes Alliance's
understanding of honor

188
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,960
has always stood out among others.

189
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,800
When they were alive,
they didn't meet for decades.

190
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,040
Once they died,
he came as soon as possible,

191
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,680
crying like it was his mother who died.

192
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,400
This kind of deep friendship
is quite special.

193
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,320
You insult the friendship
between us five brothers.

194
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,080
Are you deliberately trying to provoke me?

195
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,240
Brothers?

196
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,040
Hero Shen.

197
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,480
Aren't you blowing
your own trumpet too much?

198
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,360
Who knows if Zhang Yusen
even recognizes you as his brother?

199
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,920
Anyone with a discerning eye

200
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,880
can see whether you, Chief Shen,

201
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,880
are a brother or a lackey!

202
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,080
-You have gone too far!
-Chief Shen!

203
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,720
Elder Huang!

204
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,240
HUANG HE
ELDER OF BEGGAR GANGS

205
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,520
Chief Shen.

206
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,920
I asked Tao Hong and Lu Liu to be here

207
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
to help us.

208
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,120
Please hold back your squabbles

209
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,200
for my sake.

210
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,000
We should stick together
when facing our enemies.

211
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,840
Let us forget
about our past grievances for now.

212
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,760
For now.

213
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,040
Chief Shen.

214
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,760
Is it more important
to avenge Mirror Lake Sect,

215
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,120
or to hold this momentary argument?

216
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,040
But Elder Huang,

217
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
who…

218
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,360
Who really did this?

219
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,640
Follow me.

220
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,680
LUOHAN TEMPLE

221
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,120
Have you stared enough?

222
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm just wondering

223
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,760
what kind of countenance

224
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,840
lies beneath your disguise.

225
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,240
It's dawn. Thank you.

226
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,440
Fate let us meet.

227
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,520
And fate will reunite us.

228
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,320
Mr. Zhou.

229
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,760
Actually, why wait
for another day to reunite?

230
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,560
You want to send this child to Tai Lake.

231
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,680
It's a long journey.

232
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,200
I happen to have a boat.

233
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,440
I would also like to appreciate
the scenery of Tai Lake.

234
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,600
We might as well take my boat together.

235
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,640
Wouldn't that be great?

236
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,800
I've always hated

237
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,680
to see my fated friends
brave the wind and dew

238
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,400
on their journeys.

239
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,440
This is interesting.

240
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,600
I'm looking forward
to finding out who you are.

241
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,920
Fated people?

242
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,320
Master,

243
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,160
that Sick Man breathes out
more air than he takes in.

244
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,640
He may keel over at any moment.

245
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,040
Why would you take him with you?

246
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,680
Do you find your life too comfortable?

247
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,520
You haven't met enough people yet.

248
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,400
That person's voice sounds fabulous

249
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,200
and his appearance is comely.

250
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,640
Especially those shoulder blades.

251
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,120
They are one-of-a-kind.

252
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,120
You made him sound like Apollo.

253
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,040
He's just a man, isn't he?

254
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,080
Of course.

255
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,520
Do you think I don't know
that he is a man?

256
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,800
What I mean is

257
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,160
this person's appearance and phrenology
are completely inconsistent.

258
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,800
Yet I can't see any trace of disguise.

259
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,720
How skilled must he be

260
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,200
for this little trick?

261
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,560
Even I can't see any flaws.

262
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,960
And that flexible sword of his…

263
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,240
Master,

264
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,160
why were those people
so mysterious last night?

265
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,440
That leader even called himself
"Hanged Ghost."

266
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,640
Did they think we were stupid?

267
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,319
Master, where are you going?

268
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,520
Fate will

269
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,560
reunite us.

270
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,800
LUOHAN TEMPLE

271
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,720
Master Shen,

272
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,880
the only remains we haven't found
is Chengling's.

273
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,320
And the others?

274
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,280
I found the remains in this yard.

275
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,600
Hero Shen, be careful.

276
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,480
What an insidious trap!

277
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,240
Master, these materials
are extremely sharp.

278
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,040
You can hardly see them
with the naked eye.

279
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,680
We only cleaned them roughly.

280
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,960
They're not fully cleaned up yet.

281
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,960
This yellow paper…

282
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,040
Ghost Valley?

283
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,000
Yes.

284
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,520
All of us old people know,

285
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,560
Ghost Valley always creates a scene
before it carries out its evil deeds.

286
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,240
I was worried that someone would do evil
under the guise of Ghost Valley.

287
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,000
That was why I asked my two old friends,

288
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,480
Tao Hong and Lu Liu, to come here.

289
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,920
-There is no one left in this world--
-Yes.

290
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,320
No one in this world understands

291
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,240
these damn things better than us.

292
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,880
These things caused the two of us

293
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,520
to become the way we are today!

294
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,480
These are Soul Winding Threads
of the Hanged Ghost.

295
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,240
The Ten Devils of Ghost Valley.

296
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,040
It's time to get rid of this evil.

297
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,360
I'm going to destroy Ghost Valley.

298
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,600
Chief Shen,

299
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,200
don't you overestimate yourself.

300
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,200
It's Ghost Valley that will destroy
your Five Lakes Alliance.

301
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,080
Stop exaggerating.

302
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,120
Madam Tao Hong.

303
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,280
You repeatedly provoke me.

304
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,320
Do you think I wouldn't dare to kill you?

305
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,640
The water from the Five Lakes
Gathers around the world

306
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,200
Who else deserves the supremacy
In the martial arts world?

307
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,560
The Iridescent Clouds are scattered
And the Glaze is shattered

308
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,080
Who will cry
With the Ghosts on Mount Qingya?

309
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,520
What nonsense is that?

310
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,960
Who says this is nonsense, Chief Shen?

311
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,760
If you haven't done evil,

312
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,480
you needn't fear
that ghosts would knock on your door.

313
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Ghost Valley has knocked
on the door of Mirror Lake Sect.

314
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,040
Who can be sure that
they won't knock on your door tonight?

315
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,040
Hurry up.

316
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
Send your master a message immediately.

317
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,320
Be sure to tell him
the second half of the song.

318
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,800
I'm giving you
the Alliance's Chiefship Token.

319
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,960
With this token,
it's as if the chief is present.

320
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,480
Gather your men and do whatever it takes

321
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,400
to find Chengling's whereabouts.

322
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Yes.

323
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,760
Hero Shen.

324
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,360
If the child of your alliance's
Zhang family survived,

325
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,440
I will do my part

326
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,520
and take on the great responsibility

327
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,440
to assist your alliance
in finding the orphan.

328
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,560
You can count on me.

329
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,800
Thank you, Elder Huang.

330
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,320
Don't mention it.

331
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,640
It is all about the duty
of righteous people.

332
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,440
Everyone at the Five Lakes Alliance

333
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,720
is indebted to you.

334
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,680
You are very welcome.

335
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,800
I'm tired.

336
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,600
Kid.

337
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,120
Let's find a shady place
up ahead and take a rest.

338
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,920
Master.

339
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,840
Mr. Zhou!

340
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,800
What a pleasant surprise
to meet you again.

341
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,400
Let's drink some tea

342
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,800
to cool down on this hot day.

343
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,840
This Wen Kexing just wouldn't leave us.

344
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,640
He must be after the Glazed Armor too.

345
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,640
Why are you leaving?

346
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,680
Here is a lake.

347
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,240
Drink some water and quench your thirst.

348
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,360
If the Canglang River is clean

349
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,840
I can wash my ribbon in it

350
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,400
If the Canglang River is dirty

351
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,040
I can wash my foot in it

352
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,600
Mr. Zhou.

353
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,640
We meet everywhere.

354
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,440
Did this person

355
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,040
put a tracking item on us?

356
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,280
Is there really a tracking technique
I do not know about?

357
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,000
Let's go.

358
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,960
Where are you going, Mr. Zhou?

359
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,480
Aren't you going to rest a bit longer?

360
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,160
Seeing Shen Shen
frightened out of his wits

361
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,600
was truly satisfying.

362
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,040
The Five Lakes Alliance

363
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,440
has been unbridled for so many years.

364
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,200
Finally, someone is putting them
in their place.

365
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,720
Madam Tao Hong,
you should restrain yourself.

366
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,280
If Ghost Valley appears,

367
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,120
it's not just
the Five Lakes Alliance that will suffer.

368
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,360
I don't care.

369
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,280
I'm almost dead anyway.

370
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,360
As long as I can watch the fall
of the Five Lakes Alliance,

371
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,960
I can die in peace.

372
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
Mr. Lu Liu,

373
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,640
what do you think?

374
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,760
Back then,

375
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,080
so many people were driven to death

376
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,280
for that damned Glazed Armor.

377
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,520
In the end,

378
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,200
the Five Lakes Alliance
received all the benefits.

379
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,160
Now,

380
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,840
the Danyang Sect's bloodline
was cut first,

381
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,840
then the Mirror Lake Sect was destroyed.

382
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,480
I feel like the time has come
for Five Lakes Alliance's retribution.

383
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,880
Lu Taichong left behind
two young disciples.

384
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,320
They ran over
to Ao Laizi's Mount Tai Sect.

385
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,800
He must have obtained
Lu Taichong's Glazed Armor.

386
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,840
We have to find Ao Laizi quickly.

387
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,760
We can't let another piece
of the Glazed Armor

388
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,320
fall into the hands of the Ghost Valley.

389
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,600
TIANYA INN

390
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,320
A single room would be enough too.

391
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,040
Please, can't you work something out?

392
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,440
If we had a room,

393
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,120
we would let you stay here.

394
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,760
A gentleman

395
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,640
reserved the entire place.

396
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,800
Please forgive me.

397
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,800
Why don't you go and look elsewhere?

398
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,760
Are there other inns elsewhere?

399
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,800
I'm sorry. That would be a no.

400
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,520
Where do you want us to go then?

401
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,640
It's none of my business

402
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,480
where you go once you leave our inn.

403
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,600
Hey!

404
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,080
What about your woodshed? That will do.

405
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,200
We are tired from our journey.

406
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,920
We would like a place to stay overnight.

407
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,080
Isn't this Mr. Zhou?

408
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,680
What woodshed?

409
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,760
How can you let Mr. Zhou
sleep in a woodshed?

410
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,680
Sir,

411
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,840
have my first-class room cleaned up

412
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,080
for this beautiful…

413
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,520
This gallant man.

414
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,480
Of course.

415
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,320
You, go and clean it up!

416
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,240
All right!

417
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,520
Mr. Zhou,

418
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,640
I gave you my own room.

419
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,600
I even prepared two new outfits for you.

420
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,360
Are you just going
to take over my room so brusquely?

421
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,440
You should at least
invite me inside for a while.

422
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,240
It seems to me

423
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,120
that there are many empty rooms left.

424
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,680
Just find another room to relax in.

425
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,080
But there's only one first-class room.

426
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,480
Mr. Zhou.

427
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,480
Mr. Zhou!

428
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,040
Mr. Zhou, what are you doing?

429
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,320
We must always be on guard.

430
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,720
Mr. Wen doesn't look like a bad person.

431
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,680
You think everyone is a good person.

432
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,720
You stayed up all night.

433
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,680
Come here and take a nap.

434
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,120
Mr. Zhou, you stayed up all night too.

435
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,880
I'll just take a nap in the chair.

436
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,560
You should use the bed.

437
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,760
Just do what I say.

438
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,880
Yes.

439
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,360
You brat.

440
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,920
You don't even take off
your clothes when you sleep?

441
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,680
It's inconvenient for you
when I'm here, right?

442
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,080
All right.

443
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,000
By the way,

444
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,560
how is your injury?

445
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,680
You don't have to say it
if you don't want to.

446
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,240
This is a hemostatic cream.

447
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,480
Apply it yourself.

448
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,960
Mr. Zhou.

449
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,600
Thank you.

450
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,160
TIANYA INN

451
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,120
Mr. Zhou,

452
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,880
we have a deep bond through fate.

453
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,560
Could it be the doomed fate of karma?

454
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,880
More like a wretched soul
that keeps haunting around.

455
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,440
I wonder why you keep following me

456
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,400
all this time.

457
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,640
Why don't you just tell me?

458
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,960
What I want is simple.

459
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Show me your true face

460
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,920
and I'll tell you.

461
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,440
Why don't you let me see
your true face first?

462
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,400
Your true face must be very handsome.

463
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,600
As for my true face…

464
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,000
It may not necessarily be that appealing.

465
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,440
Perhaps it's covered in scars.

466
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,320
Perhaps it's a terrifying appearance.

467
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,920
I don't care either way.

468
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,520
However, I will give you
a piece of advice.

469
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,320
Don't be so interested

470
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,600
in things that don't concern you.

471
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,800
Then tell me, Mr. Zhou,

472
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,360
what is your relationship
with that Master Zhang upstairs?

473
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,800
Do you really want
to get sucked into this trouble

474
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,680
without knowing what it is?

475
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,080
I do my best to accomplish
what was entrusted to me.

476
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,480
I only need to bring Master Zhang

477
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,200
to Zhao Jing safely.

478
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,600
Anything else

479
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,920
has nothing to do with me.

480
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,440
Master.

481
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,480
Why didn't you invite me
to drink with you?

482
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,680
Ah Xiang, tell me,

483
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,600
what is the second cutest person

484
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,800
in the world like?

485
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,680
Someone who treats me to dinner.

486
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,320
It's a person who looks tough
but is softhearted.

487
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,360
Who is the cutest person
in the world then?

488
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,800
A person with a slim waist, long legs,

489
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,080
looks tough, but is softhearted.

490
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,920
This child is the descendant
of an eminent family.

491
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,080
We, the Beggar Gangs,

492
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,040
shall spare no efforts to find the child.

493
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
-Yes.
-Yes.

494
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
We will follow your orders.

495
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,400
What should we do
if we find his whereabouts?

496
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,880
Bring the child directly to me,

497
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,120
no matter what it costs.

498
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,960
Don't let anyone know

499
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,280
that the child is brought to us.

500
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,320
Yes.

501
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
Mr. Zhou.

502
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,800
Young Master Zhang, you're finally awake.

503
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,040
We've been waiting for you.

504
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,120
Mr. Zhou wouldn't start eating
without you.

505
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,240
So we couldn't start either.

506
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,320
Wash your hands and eat.

507
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,800
I'm hungry!

508
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Why wash your hands?
We're not eating with our bare hands!

509
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,680
Little girl,
since we are traveling the world,

510
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,840
please behave yourself.

511
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,320
Look at how the other girls
conduct themselves.

512
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,760
TIANYA INN

513
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,720
Kind sirs, please have mercy on us.

514
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,160
Is that him?

515
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,040
Have mercy on us, sir!

516
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,560
Have mercy on us.

517
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,640
-Sir, please do a good deed.
-Let's go.

518
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,440
Young Master Zhang,

519
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,240
why aren't you eating?

520
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,080
Is the food not to your taste?

521
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,520
No, that's not it.

522
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,640
Thank you for the hospitality, Mr. Wen.

523
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,280
If you know you should say "thank you,"

524
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,760
why aren't you eating?

525
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,880
Don't you know
that having someone like you at the table

526
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,080
affects our appetite?

527
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,720
But…

528
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,200
I really don't have an appetite.

529
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,040
I really dislike spoiled people like you

530
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,280
who have never experienced any hardships.

531
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,000
You're neither good in literacy
nor in martial arts.

532
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,720
When something happens,
your world falls apart.

533
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,360
If you don't eat,
you'll be starved to death.

534
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,000
Do you think
that God could be moved by you

535
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
so that he will punish
your enemies for you?

536
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,640
Ah Xiang, don't bully him.

537
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
Just eat.

538
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,880
Master, am I wrong?

539
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,720
Look at that silly boy,
his head is only there for decoration.

540
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,159
Listen,

541
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,560
if you don't eat

542
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,320
to gain strength and skills,

543
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,679
are you really
just counting on us outsiders

544
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,480
to avenge you?

545
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
Yes.

546
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,600
"We rely on our parents at home,
but depend on our friends outside."

547
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,520
But that's just wishful thinking.

548
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,920
Even this Sick--

549
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,520
Even Mr. Zhou

550
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,560
won't want
to be taken advantage of this much.

551
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,320
Take your time to eat,
no one is trying to steal it from you.

552
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,720
Be careful not to choke, you idiot.

553
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,000
Why did you start crying?

554
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,800
Ah Xiang!

555
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,480
It's as if I bullied you.

556
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,120
CHONGWU PALACE

557
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,680
FIVE LAKES WORLD ALLIANCE

558
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,800
Everybody.

559
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,400
During my time as the chief
of the world's highest alliance,

560
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,400
ZHU YAOZHI, GAO SHAN

561
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,800
Ghost Valley

562
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,680
attacked the Five Lakes Alliance's
Mirror Lake Sect in cruel ways.

563
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,080
They annihilated my fourth brother,
Zhang Yusen's whole family.

564
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,520
The Five Lakes Alliance has experienced
unprecedented shame and humiliation.

565
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,280
This debt of blood
must be paid back with blood!

566
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,120
Chief is right!

567
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,800
-Repay blood with blood!
-Repay blood with blood!

568
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,240
-Repay blood with blood!
-Everybody!

569
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,400
Since the Battle of Mount Qingya,

570
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,200
the martial arts world and Ghost Valley

571
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,360
have been in peace for over 20 years.

572
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,840
It's because
the righteous people back then

573
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,720
made an agreement with the masters
who formed Ghost Valley.

574
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,360
As long as Ghost Valley doesn't harm
the people of the martial arts world,

575
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,960
the righteous people

576
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,240
will not step inside Ghost Valley!

577
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,200
But now,

578
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,080
it's Ghost Valley
who harmed our world first!

579
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,000
Therefore,

580
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,640
I'll be holding a Heroes Conference
on the 15th of the 7th month.

581
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,560
It's time for us

582
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,360
to attack Mount Qingya together

583
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,320
and eradicate this cancerous evil!

584
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,720
Repay blood with blood!
Eradicate the cancerous evil!

585
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,480
Repay blood with blood!
Eradicate the cancerous evil!

586
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,840
AO LAIZI
CHIEF OF THE MOUNT TAI SECT

587
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,760
Master, how is it?

588
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,640
Fortunately,

589
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,280
we didn't find anyone suspicious.

590
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,440
How is Qing Hua?

591
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,040
He only caught a cold.

592
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,040
QING BAI

593
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,560
He has a little fever from time to time.

594
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,160
Master, can we set a fire?

595
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,200
Wait a bit longer.

596
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,560
It will be all right
once we get to Mount Wudang.

597
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,720
Let me keep watch.

598
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,000
You are tired from the journey,
please rest.

599
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,160
I'm fine.

600
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,640
Because of the fire in Mirror Lake Manor,

601
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,040
Shen Shen let us get away.

602
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,960
But if he catches up with us again,

603
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,080
you kids won't be able to deal with him.

604
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,560
We'll just have to battle to the death.

605
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,120
-Master--
-You're too reckless!

606
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,000
Master Ao Laizi.

607
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,200
How about

608
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
you…

609
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,040
You just hand us over?

610
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,720
After all, Master Shen
is my uncle's sworn brother.

611
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,400
We are Danyang Sect's
last two descendants.

612
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,320
I think

613
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,200
the Five Lakes Alliance
won't do anything to us.

614
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,240
Silly child.

615
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,160
Shen Shen is chasing
after you relentlessly

616
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,760
to steal

617
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,240
the Glazed Armor that your master left.

618
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,000
But don't worry.

619
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,520
Since I promised

620
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,680
to fulfill your master's last wish,

621
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,800
I will

622
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,800
do anything in my power

623
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,240
to prevent the Glazed Armor

624
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,440
from falling into the hands
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

625
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,160
Help!

626
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,760
Help!

627
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,560
Help!

628
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,440
Help!

629
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,320
Help!

630
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,120
Help!

631
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,640
Father!

632
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,520
Father?

633
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,560
Mr. Zhou?

634
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,680
It's fine now.

635
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,240
Get some sleep.

636
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,520
BRIGHT AND BLESSED

637
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,520
Mr. Zhou, are you looking
for these two people?

638
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,240
I've handled everything for you.

639
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,920
Go back to sleep.

640
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,560
It's Ghost Valley again.

641
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,480
They followed me quite closely.

642
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,040
It's difficult to tell a ghost
from a human.

643
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,800
Someone who wears a ghost mask
is not necessarily a ghost.

644
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,640
Someone who looks like a human

645
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,560
may not necessarily be a human.

646
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,560
Who knows?

647
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,320
You're a true connoisseur.

648
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,360
This is the 30-year-old
yellow seal liquor.

649
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,320
Can I call you Ah Xu?

650
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,880
You are quite skilled
in judging wine, Ah Xu.

651
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,440
It's on par
with my ability to judge people.

652
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,600
How about a sip of it?

653
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,920
With that judgment of yours?

654
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,360
Just forget it.

655
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,520
My judgment of people is perfect.

656
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,160
I'm sure

657
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,560
that a really big surprise

658
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,280
lies underneath your outermost skin.

659
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,200
You might as well rip it off
and take a look.

660
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,640
I'm in no hurry.

661
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,080
It's just a matter of time.
