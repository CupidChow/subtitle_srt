1
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,160
Let me out.

2
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,520
Help.

3
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,640
Let me out.

4
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,080
-The coffin really can't lock him up.
-Help.

5
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,920
I told you not to talk
about ghosts at night.

6
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,120
The scent is indeed useful.

7
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,080
Servants! Why aren't you killing them?

8
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,360
They're smelly and dirty. They're so ugly!

9
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,720
ZHAO COFFIN HOME

10
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,080
Mother, carry me.

11
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,000
Your shoulder blades are the prettiest.

12
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,320
Lao Wen, wake up.

13
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,480
Go!

14
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,360
Kill them!

15
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,080
I didn't expect
that I would die so terribly.

16
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,280
What a good thing it is.

17
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,240
Wen Kexing!

18
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,560
I'm here.

19
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,880
Why did you call my name so sweetly?

20
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,400
You jerk.

21
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,080
Ah Xu, you are poisoned.

22
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Stop being angry.

23
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,240
I was really affected by the scent.
I wasn't pretending.

24
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,520
I can still walk on my own
even if I'm poisoned.

25
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,040
Stop pretending
to be tough in front of me.

26
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,480
It's not embarrassing to be carried by me.

27
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm not pretending at all.

28
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,000
What's wrong?

29
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,920
The Drug Men are poisonous.

30
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,400
Take one of these, just in case.

31
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,760
Ah Xu,

32
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,080
did you come from the Healer Valley?

33
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,880
Why do you have so many antidotes?

34
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,240
Do I look like someone
who practices medicine?

35
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
No.

36
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,560
You look like

37
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,520
a professional killer.

38
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,200
You were cruel in the abandoned temple.

39
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,400
You frightened me,

40
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,560
Philanthropist Wen,

41
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,280
who can't even kill a chicken.

42
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,000
Philanthropist?

43
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,240
Though I don't look like one,

44
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,240
I'm really a good guy.

45
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,360
All right.

46
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,440
You're a philanthropist.

47
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,280
I'm a killer. Are you happy now?

48
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,800
You call those disgusting things

49
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,640
"Drug Men"?

50
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,040
I have only read about them in a book.

51
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,920
I heard that a gold needle could be used

52
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
to control a person's mind and feelings.

53
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,520
Then a concocted poison would be used
to strengthen his skin and bones.

54
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,080
As a result, a living person

55
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,280
would be turned into a powerful monster

56
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,960
that can be controlled by someone.

57
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,360
Do you have a dagger?

58
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,960
Are you trying to clear your wound?

59
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,440
I can help you.

60
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,080
Are you afraid of pain, Ah Xu?

61
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,280
If you are, you can bite my arm.

62
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,440
-What are you doing?
-Stop pretending to be tough.

63
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,280
What's wrong with your injuries?

64
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,440
It's none of your business.

65
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,600
Again?

66
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,360
Mr. Zhou,

67
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,920
even if your martial arts are good,

68
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
you don't have eyes on your back, right?

69
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,400
Sit quietly if you can't see it.

70
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,040
Don't move!

71
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,679
It's done.

72
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,360
-What are you doing?
-Ah Xu.

73
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,360
You're bad at disguising yourself.

74
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
It covers your head, face, and neck,

75
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,240
but it doesn't cover your body.

76
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,160
Do you still refuse to admit it?

77
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,280
My skin was tanned, all right?

78
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,960
Ah Xu,

79
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,280
who are you hiding from?

80
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,400
I want to hide from you the most.

81
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,960
Me?

82
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,640
You can't hide from me.

83
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,160
But if you're disguising yourself

84
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,840
in order to hide from someone,

85
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,280
you can save your effort.

86
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,920
As long as I'm by your side,

87
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,440
even if your enemy

88
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,160
is an immortal or a monster,

89
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,400
-I can--
-Why?

90
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Do you even have the capability
to kill a god?

91
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
I'm sorry.

92
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,360
I care about all the lives in the world.

93
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,440
Why would I kill anyone unreasonably?

94
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,800
I mean

95
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,160
no matter who your enemy is,

96
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,680
I can convince him with reason.

97
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,200
With ingenious arguments
and citations from classical references,

98
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,080
I can stop his violence

99
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,320
and let him drop his weapon.

100
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Ah Xu.

101
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,040
Now,

102
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,280
we are friends who have been through
life and death together.

103
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
Can you show me your real appearance?

104
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,920
Trust should be mutual.

105
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,560
This is truly what I look like,

106
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,440
without any deception.

107
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,480
If you don't believe me, you can touch it.

108
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,520
Almost everyone
who had seen my real appearance

109
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160
has died.

110
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,760
What a coincidence.

111
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,920
I'm afraid of many things,

112
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,840
but death is not one of them.

113
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,440
Your injuries are quite serious.
Let me have a look.

114
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,400
Don't think that you can suppress them

115
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,880
with your profound internal strength.

116
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,840
It may seriously undermine
your health in the future.

117
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,400
I know my illness.

118
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,560
It's none of your business.

119
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,720
If you leave,

120
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,360
I'll be alone in this wilderness.

121
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,800
Who should I go to?

122
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,000
Go to whoever you like.

123
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,680
Ah Xu.

124
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,080
Are you still refusing to admit
that you're in disguise?

125
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,040
Ah Xu, do you admit it now?

126
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,800
You only lost at one point.

127
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,680
Are you this embarrassed?

128
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,040
It's normal to lose.

129
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,360
Ah Xu.

130
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,440
Ah Xu?

131
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,360
Ah Xu, stop joking.

132
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,480
Come out!

133
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,120
Ah Xu!

134
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,320
Ah Xu!

135
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,040
What are you looking at?

136
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,800
Enough, Ah Xu. Stop it.

137
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,680
I won't tease you anymore.

138
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,360
Do you have wine?

139
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,520
Ah Xiang is not here

140
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,960
and we have no one to heat the wine.

141
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,320
I heated it up with my internal force.

142
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,280
Put up with it.

143
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,840
It's better than drinking it cold.

144
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,920
Lao Wen.

145
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,280
Is your surname really Wen?

146
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,600
I really didn't lie to you.

147
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,240
"A gentleman as warm and gentle as jade."

148
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,880
Doesn't this name suit me well?

149
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,120
This must be the Soul Winding Box.

150
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,520
Back then,

151
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,160
Hanged Ghost ran wild
in the martial arts world

152
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,000
with this mysterious Soul Winding Box.

153
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,480
I didn't expect that he would
really become a ghost today

154
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,840
and we got this precious item.

155
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,960
He wasn't Hanged Ghost.

156
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,880
Ah Xu,

157
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,720
you know a lot about the Ghost Valley.

158
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,920
Not really.

159
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,080
However, that guy was too young.

160
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,120
When Hanged Ghost became famous,

161
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,359
he might be just a kid.

162
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,839
Where is the real Hanged Ghost?

163
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,079
Whether or not he's the real one,

164
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,560
this treasure is real.

165
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,119
If Hanged Ghost were still alive,

166
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,359
why would his treasure go to someone else?

167
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,440
Be careful.

168
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,880
This thing needs to be opened
in a special way.

169
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
Or else,
it might destroy itself and hurt you.

170
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,840
Since you were awake,

171
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,200
why did you kill the fake Hanged Ghost?

172
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,280
We need him

173
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,960
to answer our questions.

174
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,840
My mistakes were
due to my concern for you.

175
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,560
Don't you know?

176
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,200
I'm hungry.

177
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,840
Lao Wen,

178
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
get some food for me.

179
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,840
Why don't you get it yourself?

180
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,920
All right, I'll go.

181
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,760
Get some rest.

182
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,280
Zhou Zishu.

183
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,400
He's indeed…

184
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,600
Zhou Zishu.

185
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,320
ZHAO COFFIN HOME

186
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
SCORPION KING
CHIEF OF THE SCORPION SECT

187
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,880
It's really wonderful.

188
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,120
I thought

189
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,720
Qin Song's Magic Sound was
the best in the world,

190
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,840
but I didn't expect

191
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,920
that the real expert was here.

192
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,000
Long-Tongued Ghost is so lucky.

193
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,680
He got to learn how to use the Magic Sound

194
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,240
to control the Drug Men from you.

195
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,920
I really envy him.

196
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,280
It's just right.

197
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,840
He's dead.

198
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,080
He's dead?

199
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,600
Is he really dead?

200
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,880
No. Who did it?

201
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,400
-Where's the Soul Winding Box?
-How dare you to ask me that?

202
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,920
I wanted to ask you.

203
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,560
-Where's the Glazed Armor?
-No.

204
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,040
I've obtained the Glazed Armor,

205
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,520
but didn't I go to Sanbai Manor

206
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,920
to get rid of Ao Laizi's body?

207
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,720
I wanted to make no mistake.

208
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,720
So I asked Long-Tongued Ghost

209
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,760
to bring the Glazed Armor here.

210
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,000
There are so many Drug Men here.

211
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,000
It's also filled with the hypnotic scent
and Soul Winding Spell.

212
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,080
There should be no problem.

213
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,560
Scorpion King.

214
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,920
Shouldn't you come
and get the Glazed Armor earlier?

215
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,520
-Shouldn't you--
-Changing Ghost.

216
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,480
Are you blaming me for my late arrival?

217
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,160
I don't dare to.

218
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,400
Forget it.

219
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,160
I didn't expect

220
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,080
someone could break through
these obstacles

221
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,280
and come in.

222
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,240
This is…

223
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,440
getting interesting.

224
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,360
The Glazed Armor?

225
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,000
Why is it hidden in the Soul Winding Box?

226
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,920
Who knows?

227
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,120
You may take it.

228
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
This thing

229
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,080
is related to the secret
of opening the World's Armory.

230
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,920
So many people

231
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,880
have been fighting so hard for this.

232
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,680
You just exchange it

233
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,200
for two rabbits from me?

234
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,000
At least I can fill my stomach
with the rabbits.

235
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,960
They're better than this thing.

236
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,520
Ah Xu.

237
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,920
Are you really not interested in it?

238
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,080
Nonsense.

239
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,080
"The Iridescent Clouds are scattered
and the Glaze is shattered."

240
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,240
This sounds so unlucky.

241
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,360
Why would I keep such an unlucky thing?

242
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,960
Ah Xu.

243
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,480
I thought you were cold,
but you have a warm heart.

244
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,960
I didn't expect you
to have such a sharp tongue.

245
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,600
You don't know a lot of things about me.

246
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,760
I'm not only sharp-tongued,

247
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,600
but I'm also ruthless.

248
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,720
You'd better be careful.

249
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,720
You're ruthless indeed.

250
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,920
You knew that this is unlucky,
but you still gave it to me.

251
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,680
Aren't you afraid

252
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,880
that I will be in trouble?

253
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,320
You're already a trouble yourself.

254
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,640
Why would you be afraid of this thing?

255
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,960
If you don't want it,
you may throw it away.

256
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,360
No way.

257
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,000
This is my first gift from you.

258
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,600
I will never throw it away.

259
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,920
I will get a string

260
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,280
and hang it on my body.

261
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,480
I will appreciate it every day.

262
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,400
By the way, Ah Xu.

263
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,760
Do you think this Glazed Armor

264
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
belonged to Zhao Jing

265
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,520
or Zhang Chengling?

266
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,880
If the Ghost Valley obtained
Chengling's Glazed Armor,

267
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,400
why would they try to abduct Chengling?

268
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,120
I suspected Ao Laizi

269
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,800
and Shen Shen in the morning.

270
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,440
After that, his body

271
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,640
appeared at the entrance
of Sanbai Manor at night.

272
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,840
Ah Xu.

273
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,440
Don't you think
there is something strange?

274
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,480
The Ghost Valley was instigating him.

275
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,400
Before Lu Taichong died,

276
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,200
he handed over everything to Ao Laizi,

277
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,520
but not his brothers.

278
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,880
This has already embarrassed
the Five Lakes Alliance.

279
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
The Ghost Valley purposely stained
the Five Lakes Alliance

280
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,120
with the blood of Mount Tai Sect

281
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,400
to provoke rumors.

282
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Let's stop talking about this.

283
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,520
If you're bored,

284
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,800
help me out with cleaning these rabbits.

285
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,120
I hunted these rabbits.

286
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,960
Do I still have to clean them?

287
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,160
Do whatever you want.

288
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,120
You can't eat if you don't clean them.

289
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,080
Ah Xu.

290
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,640
I'll clean them, all right?

291
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,480
You're so childish.

292
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,200
Ah Xu!

293
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,240
Chengling, how was your sleep yesterday?

294
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,560
Are you not having a good appetite?

295
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,840
You've suffered along the way.

296
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,280
Chengling, Gao Chong is worried about you.

297
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,200
So we can't rest.

298
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,000
We have to go on
with our journey immediately.

299
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,640
But now, we are here.

300
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,480
We will take care of you.

301
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,040
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

302
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,320
Why are your eyes swollen?

303
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,600
Did you cry?

304
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,840
No.

305
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,040
Chengling, the two heroes yesterday
left without a word this morning.

306
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,400
I'm not sure if we served them well.

307
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,600
I didn't get to talk to them.

308
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,440
Are they friends of your father?

309
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,160
I don't know.

310
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,360
Why did you follow them
without knowing their identity?

311
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,440
Yesterday, you were exhausted
and there were many people.

312
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,240
It's good that they left today.

313
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,400
Tell us.

314
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,120
What happened
in Mirror Lake Manor that night?

315
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,760
I don't remember.

316
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,160
That's absurd.

317
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,560
We are your father's sworn brothers.

318
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,960
Why can't you tell us?

319
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,760
I was frightened that day.

320
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,640
Later, I had a fever for a few days.

321
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,160
When I woke up,
I was with Mr. Zhou and Mr. Wen.

322
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,800
I don't remember

323
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,280
what happened next.

324
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,560
Shen Shen, enough.

325
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,360
How did your parents die then?

326
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Don't you remember the 300 over lives
in Mirror Lake Manor?

327
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,560
Shen Shen.

328
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,840
You can't remember anything.

329
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,160
Then, do you mean

330
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,240
that we can forget our duty
to take revenge?

331
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,720
Don't talk to a child like this.

332
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,120
Chengling, it's all right.

333
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,560
Mr. Shen is just anxious.

334
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,160
We will definitely take revenge.

335
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,640
Mr. Shen and I
are your father's sworn brothers.

336
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,760
Though there were some misunderstandings,

337
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,800
nothing can break our relationship.

338
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,360
Your father's problems are our problems.

339
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,760
From now on, you're my son.

340
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,280
Zhao Jing, it's urgent now.

341
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,880
Three out of the five parts
of the Glazed Armor are gone.

342
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,600
Yours and Taichong's Armor
must have been taken by the Ghost Valley.

343
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,720
How can we relax
without making things clear?

344
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,840
This child is obviously--

345
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,880
He's a child. What does he know?

346
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,320
Once we arrive at Yueyang,
we shall let Gao Chong decide.

347
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,160
Chengling, I'm here.

348
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,400
Don't be afraid.

349
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,200
We are late.

350
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,000
-Mr. Zhao.
-Hero Shen.

351
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,960
I'm sorry.

352
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,520
-Hero Shen.
-Mr. Zhao.

353
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,920
I heard you are departing
for Yueyang today.

354
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,080
Yes.

355
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,440
There is still some time
before the Heroes Conference,

356
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,240
but I would like to go back earlier
to see if I can help.

357
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
My eldest brother
wants to see Chengling too.

358
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,480
Do you have any plans after this?

359
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,720
If you don't, why don't you go with us?

360
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,480
We can take care of each other on our way.

361
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,760
It's fine.

362
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,640
Mr. Yu,

363
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,520
where is Tianjie?

364
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,080
My disciple, He Ruicai,
has been missing for a few days.

365
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,720
So Tianjie went to search for him.

366
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,520
But a lot of things
have been happening lately.

367
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,000
You should restrain your disciples.

368
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,680
Don't let them go out frequently.

369
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,840
Zhao Jing.

370
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,680
Stop boosting others' morale
while undermining our courage.

371
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,000
Those devils

372
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,480
only hide in the dark

373
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,400
and harm people with their dirty tricks.

374
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,280
I will suppress whoever dares
to come out and cause trouble!

375
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,600
Shen Shen, never let your guard down.

376
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,760
Think about it.

377
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,040
The world has been peaceful.

378
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,360
When did people get so anxious
like they do now?

379
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,680
So I still hope that Gao Chong

380
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,440
can lead all the heroes

381
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,960
to suppress the Ghost Valley
and make the world peaceful again.

382
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,320
Yes.

383
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,480
Yes.

384
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,360
ZHAO COFFIN HOME

385
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,600
ZHAO COFFIN HOME

386
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,240
This is strange.

387
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,120
Was what happened yesterday just a dream?

388
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,120
It has only been a couple of hours.

389
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,000
They've gotten rid
of the traces from yesterday.

390
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,040
This can't be done by normal people.

391
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,640
WOOD CARVINGS
IN MEMORY AND FILIAL PIETY

392
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,160
THOUSANDS OF YEARS
OF ANCESTORS ARE HERE

393
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,280
Ah Xu.

394
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,960
What was the strange scent yesterday?

395
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,200
It's all right if you don't want to tell.

396
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,640
I'm not forcing you.

397
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,080
Stop running away!

398
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,880
Ah Xu, walk slower.

399
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,000
Wait for me.

400
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,800
This is the place. Am I right?

401
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,680
Yes, the cured meat
was hung here last night.

402
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,160
At least tell me the name of that scent.

403
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,440
The scent is called Drunk Like a Dream.

404
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,120
Why did you have the antidote?

405
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,200
Why did Drunk Like a Dream appear in Hu?

406
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,680
Is the Window of Heaven
working with the Ghost Valley?

407
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,560
Ah Xu, why are you ignoring me?

408
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,840
Since you have its antidote,

409
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,640
you should know its origin too.

410
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,520
Can you get me two boxes of it?

411
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,720
No way.

412
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,840
Don't refuse me right away.

413
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,440
I'll pay a good price.

414
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,240
You can get whatever you want.

415
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,920
In the illusion caused by the scent,

416
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
people will see what they desire most.

417
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,200
Mr. Wen.

418
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,480
You kept calling a person's name
at that time.

419
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,280
What did you see?

420
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,400
Ah Xu.

421
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,800
I thought you were a decent man.

422
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,320
It's too obtrusive

423
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,840
for you to ask me

424
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,680
about such a private matter.

425
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,160
This man is mysterious.

426
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
He knows about
Four Seasons Manor very well.

427
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,440
What relationship does he have
with my sect?

428
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,720
All right.

429
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,960
I'll tell you.

430
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,040
In the illusion, I saw…

431
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,640
When I was young, I threw a dead rat

432
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,080
into my mother's bed.

433
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,200
She found it

434
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,800
and chased me across three streets.

435
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,960
Ah Xu, I won't joke with you anymore.

436
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,200
I joked around

437
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,400
because I didn't want to lie to you.

438
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,960
The main ingredient

439
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,200
of the mysterious Drunk Like a Dream
is orange daylily.

440
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,000
Once a man takes in a little of it,

441
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,040
he would sleep for six to seven days

442
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,400
and have a good dream.

443
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,160
The fuel used in the coffin home

444
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,040
was similar to this.

445
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,960
But it's much stronger
than the one I've developed.

446
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,440
So people would see illusions.

447
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,520
You made this scent?

448
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,280
Drunk Like a Dream came
from an ancient recipe.

449
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,520
I only turned it into incense

450
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,880
and reduced its effect
to improve one's sleep.

451
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,920
Since ancient times, there haven't been
orange daylilies in the Central Plain.

452
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,280
I don't know where he got them.

453
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,240
Drunk Like a Dream.

454
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,160
What a good name.

455
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,880
The world is dangerous
and men can be evil.

456
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,639
What is there in the world

457
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,159
that makes you stay awake?

458
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,840
What's wrong with staying in a dream?

459
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,679
You may keep dreaming then.

460
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,520
Ah Xu!

461
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,159
SANBAI MANOR

462
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,080
Guard Geng, why are you here?

463
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,400
Let's get to the point.

464
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,080
Call your master out.

465
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,920
An official from the Northwest
is in the carriage.

466
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,120
If we don't serve him well,

467
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,800
we will be in big trouble.

468
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,920
Unfortunately,

469
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,719
my master has gone to a distant place.

470
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,480
Sir, I'm sorry.

471
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,639
My master and Hero Shen

472
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,600
have departed to Yueyang.

473
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,000
Five Lakes Alliance is holding

474
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080
the Heroes Conference in Mount Jun
in the middle of the 7th month

475
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,960
to discuss the war
against the Ghost Valley.

476
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,840
Did the orphan
of the Zhang family follow them too?

477
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,840
-Yes, Master. Young Master Zhang
-Han Ying has come to Jiangnan too.

478
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,160
-has followed them to Yueyang.
-It seems like the Window of Heaven

479
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,440
is really involved in the matter
of the Glazed Armor.

480
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,280
Heroes Conference?

481
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,920
It sounds interesting.

482
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Ah Xu, why are you hiding?

483
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,160
Why? Are you afraid to see the guard?

484
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,560
Or…

485
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,640
Are you a fugitive?

486
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,240
Yes, I murdered people, set them on fire,
and committed many crimes.

487
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,000
Philanthropist Wen, stay away from me.

488
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,640
Do you pluck flowers then?

489
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,600
All right. I'll stop joking.

490
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,000
How is it?

491
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,320
The Heroes Conference.
It'll be an interesting drama.

492
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,480
Are you going?

493
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,200
Are you following me there to kill people

494
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,280
or set the fire?

495
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,240
We are going there
to enjoy the drama, of course.

496
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,240
What in the world is
more interesting than drama?

497
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,720
Moreover,

498
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,360
it's a drama about a dogfight.

499
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,280
We have to go even if it's far away.

500
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,640
The Heroes Conference
with a group of barking dogs.

501
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,360
The Five Lakes Alliance is eager
to take control of Zhang Chengling.

502
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,200
A lonely chick
that has nothing to rely on.

503
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,920
He's surrounded by hounds
that are smarter than foxes.

504
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,480
What a pity.

505
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,960
No one would think that you're a mute
even if you keep quiet.

506
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,520
I'll go and look for Ah Xiang
to settle something.

507
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,120
I'll be there right away, Ah Xu.

508
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,400
Mr. Zhao, you really know
how to enjoy yourself.

509
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,240
I've enjoyed myself on the way

510
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,720
with you, Mr. Zhao.

511
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,880
Zhao Jing

512
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,720
is the son-in-law
of West Zhejiang's Observer.

513
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,880
He's a nobleman.

514
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,200
He's worried that we would laugh at him

515
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,800
as he's traveling
with a bunch of rough men.

516
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,360
He's so quiet now.

517
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,000
You always tease me.

518
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,000
It's all because of Chengling.

519
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,440
He often stops on his way.

520
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,200
When can he bring Chengling to Yueyang?

521
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,360
Master.

522
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,760
Come. What are you looking for?

523
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,160
A hairpin or a ring?
Pearl, jade, gold, or silver?

524
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,560
We have everything.

525
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,240
Can you make glazed glass?

526
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,000
You're at the right place.

527
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,280
In this region,
no other shop is better than us

528
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,600
in making glazed glass.

529
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,640
Make 30 copies of this.

530
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm in a hurry.

531
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,200
Can I get them tomorrow?

532
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,320
Master, you sound like an outsider.

533
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,440
Customized glazed ware

534
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,160
takes at least ten days
to half a month to make.

535
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,240
Your treasure was made by some expert.

536
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,600
It's crystal clear.

537
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,640
I think my furnace can only…

538
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,400
All right.

539
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,080
Master, three days.

540
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,960
Give me three days.

541
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,800
I'll get them ready.

542
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,680
In three days,

543
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,720
I'll come to get my goods.

544
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,400
If not, I'll burn your shop.

545
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,360
All right. Don't worry.

546
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,920
I'll get them ready in time.

547
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,520
WOLONG

548
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,440
I won again.

549
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,800
I lost again.

550
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,960
I give up.

551
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,640
I'll lose my dress if I continue playing.

552
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,760
Gu Xiang, you give up once you lose.

553
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,680
That's not good.

554
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,880
Hong Lu, am I right?

555
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,840
You're right.

556
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,760
Gu Xiang, you can't do this.

557
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,800
Let me tell you.

558
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,320
It's just that I don't know
how to play this game.

559
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,800
If we play pai gow,

560
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,040
I'll make you pay

561
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,480
with your dress and underwear.

562
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,000
But we still need one more player.

563
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,480
Gu Xiang, when will Master be back?

564
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,160
Are you already missing Master?

565
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,800
Don't laugh at me.

566
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,240
I just think that

567
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,400
since you've saved our lives,

568
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,960
so we should try our best

569
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,840
to serve you and Master.

570
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,520
But we've only been
playing around these days.

571
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,120
I feel guilty.

572
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,240
Stop it.

573
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,160
You're just trying to say
that you're missing Master.

574
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,840
It's useless.

575
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,480
Why is it useless?

576
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,400
Master?

577
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,320
-Master
-Master.

578
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,240
Master, we need one more player. It's you.

579
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,160
Ungrateful.

580
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,600
Little girl, why did you miss me?

581
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,400
Do you see it?

582
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,280
They are loyal servants.

583
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,800
Unlike you.

584
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,440
You've been like a reinless horse
once you left the valley.

585
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,840
You only think about playing.

586
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,680
It's not easy to have you both
as my servants.

587
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,440
Ah Xiang.

588
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,960
Give them a hundred taels of silver later.

589
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,360
You may return to your home.

590
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,480
Using them wisely,

591
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,440
you should be at ease
for the rest of your lives.

592
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,680
Master.

593
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,520
Please do not dislike us.

594
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,880
We survived due to

595
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,520
your and Gu Xiang's help.

596
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,640
We are willing to follow you
for the rest of our lives.

597
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,080
We will continue to repay you
in our next lives.

598
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,560
Follow us for the rest of your lives?

599
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,160
It's easy to say that.

600
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,960
Gu Xiang.

601
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,800
What did I tell you previously?

602
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,960
Master.

603
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,680
I've prepared this especially for you.

604
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,000
Wolong's famous nuts.

605
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,920
They are big, crispy, and delicious.

606
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,600
I queued for them. Have a taste.

607
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,920
Did you get paid?

608
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,520
You're praising them so blatantly.

609
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,760
No.

610
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,680
I just wanted to offer my master
the best things.

611
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,000
How is it? It's not bad, right?

612
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,400
You have a good taste.

613
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,400
We will get our nuts
from this store next time.

614
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,160
Master, I didn't buy them.

615
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,400
Yun Zai and Hong Lu bought them.

616
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,040
They queued purposely for these.

617
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,880
My good master.

618
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,320
They are orphans.

619
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,160
They don't have anyone to rely on.

620
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,920
The world is in a mess.

621
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,600
I'm afraid they can't survive
even with the money.

622
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,400
Master, please let them stay.

623
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,040
Please, Master.

624
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,840
It's hard to survive outside.

625
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,640
Throughout our lives,

626
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,000
we were sold around
like kittens or puppies.

627
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,440
Only Gu Xiang treats us as humans.

628
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,000
Master, please let us stay and serve you.

629
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,400
Yes, Master.

630
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,400
We are willing to do it.

631
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,120
All right.

632
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,280
Thank you, Master.

633
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,880
Since you're willing to do it,

634
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,800
these two girls
will be your servants from now on.

635
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,200
It's your own choice,

636
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,400
so you are responsible
for the outcome later.

637
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,840
I won't interfere.

638
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,360
Yes. Thank you, Master.

639
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,000
Since I'm taking them in,

640
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,440
I'll protect them.

641
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,680
We'll see if you have the capability.

642
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,480
You two may leave first.

643
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,520
-Yes.
-Yes.

644
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,560
Come here. I need you to do two things.

645
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,880
You must complete the first task

646
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,960
as soon as possible.

647
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,120
We need to plan carefully

648
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,120
for the second task.
