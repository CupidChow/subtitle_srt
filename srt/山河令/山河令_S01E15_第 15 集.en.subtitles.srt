1
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,280
Deng Kuan,

2
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,000
tomorrow is the Heroes Conference.

3
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,160
Father said

4
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,880
he would announce

5
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,240
my marriage to Chengling
at the conference.

6
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,160
I can't disobey my father.

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,520
If you wake up one day,

8
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,440
will you blame me?

9
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Who is it?

10
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,320
Gu Xiang, it's you?

11
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,880
What happened to you?

12
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,920
What happened?

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,400
Why are your hands so hot?

14
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,840
Hurry up and lie down.

15
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,200
Why were you so careless?

16
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,840
Be careful.

17
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,360
Slowly.

18
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,080
Silly Ah Xiang.

19
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,240
You should be more careful.

20
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,760
At this distance,

21
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
I can surely freeze her
with the Unfaithful Nail

22
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,440
that Qianqiao gave me.

23
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,520
It does feel a bit hot.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,320
Don't go.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,880
All right, let me check your pulse.

26
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,200
Gu Xiang.

27
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,400
Don't panic.
I have to freeze her in one move.

28
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,840
Only then will I have the chance
to exchange her for Madam Luo.

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,840
Ah Xiang!

30
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,280
Ah Xiang!

31
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,280
Ah Xiang!

32
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,320
They said you are sick
and came to see the doctor.

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,360
What's wrong?

34
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,520
How did you get sick all of a sudden?

35
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,720
Xiaolian, is it serious?

36
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,960
Not particularly.

37
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,240
I'll fetch her some medicine.

38
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,880
Ah Xiang.

39
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,080
Go away. Don't touch me.

40
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
What are you doing, Cao Weining?

41
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,320
Iâ€¦

42
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,480
I wasn't doing anything.

43
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,000
I bought you some snacks.

44
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
Gosh, he's so clingy.

45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,600
Why did he have to choose

46
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,440
this moment to barge in?

47
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,200
Ah Xiang, the medicine will be bitter.

48
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,880
Here, have something sweet.

49
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,800
No.

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,080
-I don't want it!
-It's delicious.

51
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,080
Try it.

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,040
Really, look.

53
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,520
It's delicious.

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,440
From now on,

55
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,600
if Mount Tai Sect has any demands,

56
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,079
the Five Lakes Alliance

57
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,440
will do our best to comply,
even if we have to risk our lives.

58
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,600
Very well.

59
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,000
Mount Tai Sect's only request

60
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,280
is for the Five Lakes Alliance
to punish the murderer immediately!

61
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,600
Punish the murderer!

62
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,160
-Yes!
-Yes! Punish the murderer!

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,200
-Punish the murderer!
-Punish the murderer!

64
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,440
Of course the murderer must be punished.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,600
As long as everyone works together,

66
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,280
we'll catch the demon of Ghost Valley
and cut him into a thousand pieces

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,120
to comfort the spirit of Master Ao Laizi.

68
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,200
You are messing around!

69
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,720
He killed my master!

70
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,920
Did you see Chief Shen kill him
with your own eyes?

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,440
Or did you see Chief Shen
order his murder with your own eyes?

72
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,600
So you saw neither, did you?

73
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,560
Everyone knows

74
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,880
that Master Ao Laizi was killed
by Ghost Valley.

75
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,480
Many friends and families

76
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,240
of the martial arts world

77
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,640
were murdered by the Ghost Valley.

78
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,520
The reason I arranged
the Heroes Conference here

79
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,640
is to avenge the dead!

80
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,680
But everyone, you must remember,

81
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,800
don't fall for the instigation of others!

82
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,560
Don't fall into chaos!

83
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,240
Or else, you will step
right into the trap of the evildoers!

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,320
Elder Huang, what do you think?

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're right.

86
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,360
The most important thing right now

87
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,840
is to crusade against Ghost Valley.

88
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,320
The lost Glazed Armor of Master Ao Laizi

89
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,480
has most likely fallen into the hands
of the murderer from Ghost Valley.

90
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,000
As the saying goes,
evil does not suppress righteousness.

91
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,080
The Five Lakes Alliance
will destroy the Ghost Valley

92
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,760
and return peace
to the martial arts world!

93
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,800
Crusade against Ghost Valley.
Restore peace in the martial arts world!

94
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Crusade against Ghost Valley.
Restore peace in the martial arts world!

95
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Crusade against Ghost Valley.
Restore peace in the martial arts world!

96
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,720
Gao Chong is quite eloquent.

97
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,480
Crusade against Ghost Valley.
Restore peace in the martial arts world!

98
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,200
Crusade against Ghost Valley.
Restore peace in the martial arts world!

99
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,560
Crusade against Ghost Valley.
Restore peace in the martial arts world!

100
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,120
Chief Gao.

101
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,080
A few days ago at Renyi Hall,

102
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,600
you promised to explain

103
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,040
the whole story behind the Glazed Armor

104
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,680
to everyone at the Heroes Conference.

105
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,920
Over half of the heroes
who are joining the conference are here.

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,200
When are you going to tell us the truth?

107
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,240
Huang He.

108
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,440
Do you want to know the truth
about the Glazed Armor

109
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,080
or do you want to know
the whereabouts of it?

110
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,960
So what if I do?

111
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,560
Don't the present heroes

112
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,960
deserve to know the truth?

113
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,120
That's right!

114
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,520
That is the reason
why the Iron Fist Clan came here today!

115
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,720
The Iron Fist Clan bore the brunt
of the Battle of Mount Qingya.

116
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,120
We suffered heavy casualties.

117
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,920
Chief Gao.

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,240
You still owe us an explanation!

119
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,280
Chief Gao!

120
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,720
I lost an eye on Mount Qingya

121
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,240
and my son!

122
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,520
I paid such a high price,

123
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,240
yet I didn't garner the lost secrets
of my Eagle Claw Clan.

124
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,120
Isn't that enough reason to ask
the Five Lakes Alliance for the truth?

125
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,040
-Chief Gao! Explain it to us!
-Explain it to us!

126
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,680
-Explain it to us!
-Explain it to us!

127
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,360
-Hurry up, answer us!
-Answer us!

128
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,000
-Hurry up, explain yourself!
-Explain yourself! Answer us!

129
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,560
-Hurry up, answer us!
-Answer us!

130
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,480
Hey, friend.

131
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,000
It's getting exciting.
Where are you going?

132
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,520
It's you?

133
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,720
Scorpion Sect?

134
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,440
Fine. I shall tell you the truth today.

135
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,440
The Glazed Armor

136
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,200
is in the possession
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

137
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,559
Gao Chong!

138
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,600
The Five Lakes Alliance did everything

139
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,240
only for the peace and tranquility

140
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,640
of the martial arts world.

141
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,440
As the martial arts world suffered heavily
after the Battle of Mount Qingya

142
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,000
and couldn't withstand
an even bigger calamity,

143
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,400
we five brothers divided
the Glazed Armor between us

144
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
to secretly protect them

145
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,520
and wait for the right moment.

146
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,440
Chief Gao!

147
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,840
You make it sound so reasonable
as if that was your only choice!

148
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,920
The World's Armory contains secret records
of martial arts from all over the world.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,080
What right does the Alliance have
to keep all heroes in the dark?

150
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,200
Chief Gao!

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,160
Every one of us contributed
to defeating Rong Xuan!

152
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,840
How could you keep
the Glazed Armor a secret?

153
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
-What rights do you have?
-That's right!

154
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,040
Hand over the Glazed Armor!

155
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,400
We will redistribute it!

156
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,400
-Yes. Hand over the Glazed Armor!
-Hand it over!

157
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,360
-Redistribute it!
-Hand it over!

158
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,560
-Hand it over!
-Redistribute it!

159
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,520
-Hand it over!
-Hand it over!

160
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,080
-Dear heroes,
-Hand it over!

161
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,080
Please listen to what I have to say.

162
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,520
Years ago, the Glazed Armor
caused great bloodshed

163
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,560
among the martial arts world!

164
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,440
It almost caused a catastrophe.

165
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,120
Right now in Yueyang City,

166
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,920
the fake pieces of Glazed Armor
are being spread by the wicked.

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,040
It once again caused countless deaths
and injuries in our world.

168
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,280
This item is a curse
to the martial arts world!

169
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Chief Gao, stop being a hypocrite!

170
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,800
The turmoil within
the martial arts world 20 years ago

171
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,480
and the dispute caused by
the fake Glazed Armor right now

172
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,000
were both planned
by the Five Lakes Alliance, weren't they?

173
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,760
Only someone who is
very familiar with the Glazed Armor

174
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,760
could have made
such real-looking fake ones, right?

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,960
What are you trying to say?

176
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,400
Why do you keep slandering Chief Gao?

177
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,360
What is your purpose?

178
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,880
What do you mean?

179
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,920
Did the Five Lakes Alliance
make fake Glazed Armor pieces?

180
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,600
How vicious!

181
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,920
Feng Xiaofeng! You're full of nonsense!

182
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,320
Feng Xiaofeng, shut your mouth!

183
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,280
If you dare spread any more rumors,

184
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,160
I will kill you!

185
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,880
Feng Xiaofeng!
You'll be the first one I kill!

186
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,320
Get down here.

187
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,280
Ah Xu.

188
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,600
Just say come down,
you didn't need to hit me.

189
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,440
Would I dare to disobey you?

190
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,320
Ah Xu, it's good you came.

191
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,560
Drink.

192
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,440
Where did you run off to?

193
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,960
I saw Pretty Arhat just now.

194
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,240
With Scorpion Sect involved in this,

195
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,920
nothing good will come of it.

196
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,480
Things are bad

197
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,720
whether Scorpion Sect is involved or not.

198
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,080
As long as the fire
doesn't reach our Chengling,

199
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,760
what does it matter to us?

200
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,280
I was thinking about how Scorpion Sect

201
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,720
abducted Chengling back then.

202
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,520
There's something strange about it.

203
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,400
Wasn't that for the Glazed Armor?

204
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,320
Ah Xu, don't worry about it.
Just relax and watch the show.

205
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,720
If you ask me,

206
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,920
this big show of Chief Gao
fighting the heroes with his words

207
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,040
will entail a shocking twist.

208
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,760
Let's wait for the highlight.

209
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,120
I saw him build a big building

210
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,520
I saw him feast with his guests

211
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,400
I saw his building collapse

212
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,360
Gao Chong, the Beggar Gangs,
the Ghost Valley, the Window of Heaven,

213
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,480
and the Scorpion Sect.

214
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,720
From beginning to end,

215
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,440
in this fight for the Glazed Armor,

216
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,960
the shadow of the Scorpion Sect
lingered around.

217
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,720
What role does
the Scorpion Sect play in this?

218
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,760
"When you know where to stop,
you have stability.

219
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,520
When you have stability,
you can be tranquil."

220
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,920
Godfather.

221
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,360
Everything you've planned
has been arranged.

222
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,560
It's your turn now.

223
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,960
It's time to end it.

224
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,920
If I'm right,

225
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,360
the Ghost Valley and the Scorpion Sect
must have joined hands.

226
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,960
The incident of the theater corpses

227
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,880
harbors the shadow
of Scorpion's assassin Qin Song.

228
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,520
And the strange Drug Men
driven by evil spirits

229
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,280
at the Zhao family's coffin home

230
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,440
also appeared in large numbers
at the base of the Scorpion Sect.

231
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,920
Lao Wen.

232
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,680
Someone is manipulating the show
behind the scenes.

233
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,720
This person is scheming
with malicious intent.

234
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,360
Is that not good?

235
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,160
It's precisely because there are

236
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
so many twists and turns
created by conceited people

237
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,520
that you and I have such a wonderful time
watching it play out.

238
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,760
What you call a wonderful time

239
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,560
entails the blood of innocent people.

240
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,840
Is that what you wish to see?

241
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,400
"Innocent"?

242
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,880
Which of these people
dare call themselves innocent?

243
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,400
But Ah Xu, you are right.

244
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,440
This kind of exciting blood-filled play
of starving animals fighting over food

245
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,120
is exactly what I want to see.

246
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,200
You go on and on about the Ghost Valley.

247
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,440
Stop beating around the bush.

248
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,480
Chief Gao,
please take out the Glazed Armor.

249
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,840
Open the armory!

250
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,280
Every sect will retrieve
their secret records that were lost.

251
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,440
Then we shall fight
against the Ghost Valley.

252
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,320
Wouldn't that be perfect?

253
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,960
-Yes. Open the armory!
-Hand over the Glazed Armor!

254
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,160
-Open the armory!
-Open the armory!

255
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,960
-Hand over the Glazed Armor!
-Hand over the Glazed Armor!

256
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
-Open the armory!
-Hand over the Glazed Armor!

257
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,960
Everyone!

258
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,160
It's not that I am unwilling
to hand over the Glazed Armor.

259
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,480
Even if I hand it over,

260
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,320
you can't open the gate to the armory.

261
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,640
Enough!

262
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,720
Stop telling us one lie after another.

263
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,040
We've heard enough.

264
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,240
Just hand over the Glazed Armor!

265
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,720
Chief Gao is quite clever and fickle.

266
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,960
There's someone who can testify for me.

267
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,080
Let me see

268
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,720
what tricks you have left.

269
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,000
Put her down!

270
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,520
Whatever it is,
let's take this woman away first!

271
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,760
-Master.
-Go!

272
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,760
Let's go.

273
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,440
How strange.

274
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,280
Why haven't I seen anyone on the way?

275
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,000
Where are the disciples on patrol?

276
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,920
WORSHIP OF LITERATURE

277
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,400
How strange.
Why are all the people here gone?

278
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,400
Where did the doctor and pharmacist go?

279
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,280
Ms. Gao, come with me!

280
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,280
You both should go first, I'll stop them!

281
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,600
As if you could!

282
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,600
Cao Weining!

283
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,720
You old witch! How dare you hurt him!

284
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,320
Watch out!

285
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,599
Cao Weining!

286
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
Weining!

287
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,839
Cao Weining!

288
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,880
Don't die!

289
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,160
I don't want
to owe you my life for nothing!

290
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,839
Right.

291
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,800
Why did I choose you in the first place?

292
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,960
If I knew, I would have found another way

293
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,120
to get inside Yueyang Sect.

294
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,960
Why did you treat me so well?

295
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,920
Silly girl.

296
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
Will you waste the life-saving tablet
I gave you this way?

297
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,960
Madam Luo?

298
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,160
LONG XIAO
YOUNG CHIEF OF LONGYUAN CABINET

299
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,920
-Who is this person?
-He isâ€¦

300
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,720
Didn't you see the carriage's mechanism?

301
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,560
That must be the legendary
Chief of the Longyuan Cabinet.

302
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,080
He is the only one

303
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,560
who can create

304
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,840
such brilliant mechanics.

305
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,600
In the old days, even the emperor
showed Longyuan Cabinet his respect.

306
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,080
There were rumors 20 years ago

307
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
in the martial arts world

308
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,480
that the Longyuan Cabinet
could open the armory.

309
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,800
Open the armory?

310
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,560
The chief of the Longyuan Cabinet
is an old man!

311
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,240
Who is this kid?

312
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,920
I think you all recognize him now.

313
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,800
This is Long Xiao,
the Young Chief of Longyuan Cabinet,

314
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,240
the one and only Master of Mechanics.

315
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,560
I invited him here today

316
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,640
so he can tell everyone

317
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,480
the whole story behind the armory!

318
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,920
Chief Gao is right.

319
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,920
No one knows the story behind the armory

320
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,480
better than my father,

321
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,800
the half-genius Long Que.

322
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,040
-The demon Rong Xuan used clever means
-The half-genius Long Que?

323
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,200
to steal countless secret records

324
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,480
of martial arts from various sects.

325
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,440
He knew he had committed many wrongdoings.

326
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,240
For fear that others will steal from him,

327
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,880
he deceived my father and tricked him

328
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,360
into designing the World's Armory for him.

329
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,560
Young Chief Long.

330
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,000
Gao Chong just said

331
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,680
that even with the Glazed Armor,
the armory cannot be opened.

332
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,440
What the hell is this nonsense?

333
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,240
Chief Gao is right.

334
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,440
The armory is highly complex.

335
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,920
It is indeed impossible to open it safely
with the Glazed Armor alone.

336
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,440
Just tell us,
can you open the armory or not?

337
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,880
-Yes, can you open the armory?
-Can you open it?

338
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,000
-Can you?
-I am sorry to disappoint you.

339
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,400
I did not inherit
the true teachings of my father.

340
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,160
I cannot open the armory.

341
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,560
-Can't open it? Stop wasting our time!
-Why say all this if you can't open it?

342
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,600
However, the mechanics
were designed by my father.

343
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,080
He must know how to open it.

344
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,360
Chief Gao.

345
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,520
I came here in person today

346
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,200
to convey my father's attitude to you

347
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,240
with everyone as my witness.

348
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,880
No matter how much you bribe us

349
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,840
or coerce us,

350
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,160
we will never help you open the armory

351
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,880
and satisfy your selfishness!

352
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,200
Young Chief Long.

353
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,800
The armory is the armory of the people!

354
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,640
No one can claim it for themselves!

355
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,160
-That's right!
-Well said!

356
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,480
The armory is the armory of the people!

357
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,320
-That's right! Well said!
-Well said!

358
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,880
I knew you wanted
to make the armory your own!

359
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,080
-No one can claim it for themselves.
-You all heard it, didn't you?

360
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Gao Chong wants to take
all the treasures in the armory!

361
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
How despicable!

362
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,560
Long Xiao!

363
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,480
When has my brother
ever bribed or coerced your father?

364
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,560
Spewing such nonsense

365
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,680
in front of so many people,

366
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,080
do you think I won't kill you?

367
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,600
What the hell are you saying?

368
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,800
Why did you lie to me?

369
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,600
What are you scheming?

370
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,800
Everyone, please don't believe him!

371
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,400
My brother has never harassed
the Longyuan Cabinet!

372
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,440
Gao Chong, haven't you played us enough?

373
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,760
Your witness already told us the truth.

374
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,760
How much longer
do you still want to deny it?

375
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,280
Hand over the Glazed Armor quickly!

376
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,480
-Hand it over! Hand over the Glazed Armor!
-Hand over the Glazed Armor!

377
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,920
-Hurry up and hand over the Glazed Armor!
-Hurry up and hand over the Glazed Armor!

378
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,080
Gao Chong, I'm sorry!

379
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,000
I couldn't find the Longyuan Cabinet,
no matter how hard I tried.

380
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,120
He found me instead.

381
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,440
He said he would testify for me.

382
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,400
It's all my fault.
I got you into this mess.

383
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
Zhao Xuande?

384
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,240
How did such a weak and stupid fool

385
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,520
become one of the five sons
of the Five Lakes Alliance?

386
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,000
Shen Shen was not an idiot then.

387
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,200
Aren't your apprenticeâ€™s father
and Lu Taichong not much better?

388
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,200
What a Five Lakes Alliance.

389
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,000
Lao Wen,
why do you hold such extreme views?

390
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,320
Don't let hatred blind your eyes

391
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,120
and affect your judgment
on the Five Lakes Alliance.

392
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,040
Can't you see it with your talent?

393
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,320
Someone deliberately set Gao Chong up.

394
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,400
I know that of course.

395
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,080
That's why I canâ€™t wait
to applaud this guy.

396
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,480
Ah Xu, don't speak.

397
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,960
Let's see how Hero Gao
will manage to turn the tide

398
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,120
and respond to this scheme.

399
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,280
Quiet down!

400
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,840
Hurry up and hand it over!

401
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,120
Everyone, quiet down!

402
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,200
There may be some misunderstanding
between Young Chief Long's father and me.

403
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,360
But I can promise you this,

404
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,520
I do not hold

405
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,320
any selfish motives regarding the armory!

406
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,160
What misunderstanding?

407
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,520
Don't confuse the crowd anymore!

408
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,800
-Hurry up and hand over the Glazed Armor!
-Yes, hand it over!

409
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,040
I swear to Heaven!

410
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,120
Once Ghost Valley is wiped out,

411
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,920
Young Chief Long and I

412
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,680
will distribute the secrets
of the armory among all sects.

413
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,720
If I am insincere,

414
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,760
I shall be cut into thousands of pieces!

415
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,680
If there is no objection,
this matter has thus been decided.

416
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,360
Young Chief Long,
you've had a long journey.

417
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,280
You may go to rest now.

418
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,880
Yes!

419
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,240
Get up.

420
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,040
Get up!

421
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,640
Chengling.

422
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,320
Don't be afraid.

423
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,720
Come.

424
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,560
Mr. Gao.

425
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,160
There's one more thing

426
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,720
I have to tell everyone.

427
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,800
This is Zhang Chengling,

428
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,880
son of my fourth brother, Zhang Yusen.

429
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,040
He is the last descendant
of the Mirror Lake Sect.

430
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,440
I have decided

431
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,040
to betroth my daughter

432
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,320
to him!

433
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,960
In the future, he will be my son-in-law,

434
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,440
and together with my daughter,

435
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,440
they will lead Mirror Lake Sect
and Yueyang Sect.

436
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,480
After that,

437
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,040
I shall become a monk

438
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,480
and walk my path with Buddha.

439
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,040
I will no longer

440
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,800
handle the matters
of the mortal world again.

441
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,480
Gao Chong, don't do this!

442
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,120
I have made my decision.

443
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,880
You don't need to stop me.

444
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,160
You brats!

445
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,000
How dare you force my leader
into becoming a monk!

446
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,880
Are you satisfied now?

447
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,760
Ah Xu.

448
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,000
Gao Chong dragged
your apprentice down with him.

449
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,320
Do you still think I was wrong about him?

450
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,320
No.

451
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,560
Doing this

452
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,240
doesn't benefit him at all.

453
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,040
Ah Xu,
why do you insist on contradicting me?

454
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,360
Gao Chong has always pretended to be
the paragon of virtue.

455
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,120
He must be using Chengling

456
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,680
for some tricks of his!

457
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,360
Gao Chong announced this in public.

458
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,880
There is no return for him.

459
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,600
Chengling has handed over
the Glazed Armor.

460
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,360
What would be his value to Gao Chong?

461
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,440
Everyone, please look.

462
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,400
What is this?

463
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,600
This is the Token of Honor!

464
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,360
-What? What is the Token of Honor?
-What is that?

465
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,400
This is the token
of Mount Changming Sword Immortal.

466
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,920
The Sword Immortal once swore an oath,

467
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,960
if the Ghost Valley harms
the martial arts world,

468
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,920
the holder of this token

469
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,680
can order the world to eradicate
that cancerous evil

470
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,240
in his name!

471
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,680
TOKEN OF HONOR

472
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,000
With this token,

473
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,960
what doubt could you possess?

474
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,200
I'm willing

475
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,480
to return the armory to the people!

476
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,360
I don't need power and might!

477
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,440
I only have one wish!

478
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,760
Which isâ€¦

479
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,920
to destroy Ghost Valley,

480
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,000
to avenge the deceased brothers,

481
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,200
and to return peace
to the martial arts world!

482
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,240
Our Five Lakes Alliance

483
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,400
and the Ghost Valley can't mutually exist!

484
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,840
It is imperative to attack Mount Qingya!

485
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,360
What else do you have to say?

486
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,880
Bring the wine.

487
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,720
LONE ARE THE TAIYUE AND DANYANG SECTS
EMPTINESS THE WORLD REMAINS

488
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,160
Those who are willing to work with me
to wipe out Ghost Valley

489
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
may have your blood mixed in it.

490
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,840
Whether we were friends or foes,

491
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,320
after drinking this wine,

492
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,120
we will be brothers
who can die for each other.

493
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,360
Before Ghost Valley is destroyed,

494
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,320
this oath will not be broken.

495
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,200
Those who take the oath may stay,

496
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,880
those who wish to leave,

497
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,720
I will not stop you.

498
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,120
Hero Gao.

499
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,680
You really know how to fool people--

500
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,760
Chief Gao.

501
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,240
The Gentle Wind Sword Sect
and Ghost Valley have a blood feud.

502
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,400
Today I, Fan Huaikong,
entrust my life to you.

503
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,360
I shall follow your orders.

504
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,800
Thank you.

505
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,720
Chief Gao!

506
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,400
My Jujing Gang looks forward
to your leadership.

507
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,360
What Chief Gao said was good.

508
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,760
My men and I swear to follow Chief Gao.

509
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,840
Cao Gang will also follow you!

510
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,360
Chief Gao, I didn't listen clearly.

511
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,960
I wish to confirm something with you.

512
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,320
You said that
after Ghost Valley is destroyed,

513
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,800
you'll open the armory

514
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,720
and give the secret records
to each sect, right?

515
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,680
I will not go back on my word.

516
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,880
Good. Chief Gao is an upright man.

517
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,360
There's something I'm curious about.

518
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,680
The Combined Six Cultivation Method
and the Yin Yang Book

519
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,120
belong to no one.

520
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,520
How do you plan on settling that?

521
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,680
That's right!

522
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,680
Who will get

523
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,880
the Combined Six Cultivation Method

524
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,000
and the Yin Yang Book?

525
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,760
Will these unowned items

526
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,000
end up in your pocket?

527
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,080
You people!

528
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,000
You haven't even cleared up
the most critical issue yet

529
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,000
before anxiously pledging your allegiance.

530
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,360
This is Hero Gao's usual trick!

531
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,240
Who says
the Combined Six Cultivation Method

532
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,920
and the Yin Yang Book

533
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,240
don't belong to anyone?

534
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,560
Rong Xuan had his own sect.

535
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,880
Once I open the armory,

536
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,800
we will return
the Combined Six Cultivation Method

537
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,520
to his sect!

538
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,360
As for the Yin Yang Book,

539
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,040
it belongs to the Healer Valley!

540
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,840
It will naturally be returned.

541
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,880
Chief Gao, stop joking around.

542
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
They are all dead, how will you return it?

543
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,880
The chief of our Feisha Gang is
a close friend of the Healer Valley.

544
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,240
This Yin Yang Book should be given to us.

545
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,360
You brat!

546
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,160
Stop kidding!

547
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,960
What kind of friendship would that be?

548
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,640
Why don't you say that your leader

549
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,800
is the long-lost grandson
of the chief of the Healer Valley?

550
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,960
That's right!

551
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,920
Dear heroes,

552
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,320
if you ask me,
our Five Tigers Broken Knives Clan

553
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,880
suffered the worst casualties

554
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,440
in the Battle of Mount Qingya.

555
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,960
Speaking of meritorious deeds,

556
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,160
our Peng family should be awarded
the Combined Six Cultivation Method

557
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,480
as compensation.

558
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,320
Is it that glorious
to have a high death count?

559
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,520
You call that meritorious?

560
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
You!

561
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,120
Feng Xiaofeng is right.

562
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,480
We should distribute according to merit.

563
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,400
Our Twelve Chain Cove
rendered the most merit.

564
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,640
The strategy of besieging Mount Qingya

565
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,000
was our leader's idea.

566
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,520
You bunch of robbers

567
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,160
are just idiots!

568
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,080
What idea?

569
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,120
Youâ€¦

570
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,720
Chief, are you guys
from the cove even literate?

571
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,160
Even if you get the book,

572
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,360
can you read it?

573
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,080
He is right.

574
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,200
Everyone,

575
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,200
our Funiu Sect has a long history
and long heritage!

576
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,360
This Yin Yang Book should be ours!

577
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,640
Fight.

578
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,160
Why aren't they fighting?

579
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
Lao Wen,

580
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,080
who are you exactly?

581
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,920
Do you want to test

582
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,520
my martial arts skills?

583
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,880
Why not? I'm not afraid! Come on!

584
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,200
Come!

585
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,960
They want to fight but don't dare to.

586
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Cowards.

587
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
Lao Wen.

588
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,800
Do you hate the Five Lakes Alliance

589
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,200
or the whole martial arts world?

590
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,760
You're still trying to tell me
you aren't Rong Xuan's son?

591
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,600
Ah Xu.

592
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,280
Whether you believe me or not,

593
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,600
I have never lied to you

594
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,840
from the first day we met.

595
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,360
In that case,

596
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,240
why bother with these ignorant people?

597
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,360
"People"?

598
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,280
How are they even human?

599
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,360
The righteous clans
of the martial arts world?

600
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,880
The difference between them
and the Ghost Valley

601
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,080
is that one is blatantly evil,

602
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,880
while the other is wearing a cover
of benevolence, justice, and morality.

603
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,800
Yet as soon as they see flesh,

604
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,840
they can't wait
to tear off their human skin

605
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,320
and start barking and biting!

606
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,639
Exciting.

607
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,760
How exciting.

608
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,600
All right.

609
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,400
We walk different paths.

610
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,800
I can't persuade you.

611
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,280
Do whatever you want.

612
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,320
Let's go our separate ways.

613
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,040
Everyone's gone. I'm all alone now.

614
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,040
There are only so few people locked up.

615
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,360
What's the point of watching them?

616
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,200
Deng Kuan, you're awake!

617
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,200
That's great!

618
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,120
YUE

619
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,240
I'm Deng Kuan,
the first disciple of the Yueyang Sect.

620
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,600
Rewarding the evil and punishing the good,

621
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,800
such is the impermanence of nature.

622
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,240
It's my turn to appear.

623
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,560
Everything shall be done
according to Master's arrangement.

624
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,960
Ghost Valley came at the right time.

625
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,760
Let's work together.

626
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,440
Let's destroy these ghosts.

627
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,920
Their blood shall be
the sacrifice for our banner!

628
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,480
Chief Gao, no true man is without cruelty.

629
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,760
What a cruel mind you have.

630
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,200
That idiot Long-Tongued Ghost has just
destroyed the Mirror Lake Sect for you.

631
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,160
Now, you turn around and kill him?

632
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,560
Tragicomic Ghost trapped
and killed Danyang Sect's disciples.

633
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,800
Happy Ghost killed Ao Laizi.

634
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,480
Weren't all those instructed by you?

635
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,600
Gao Chong, it really was you!

636
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,360
You bastard!

637
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,520
We agreed on dividing up

638
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,880
the armory's treasure equally
after collecting the Glazed Armor.

639
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,040
After you got three pieces of it,

640
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,400
you immediately turned around
and betrayed us.

641
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,480
You want to destroy Ghost Valley?

642
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,040
Who are you?

643
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,560
Stop slandering me!

644
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,160
"A wise man won't believe rumors."
There's no use in saying more!

645
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
Do you think Ghost Valley

646
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,360
will let you do whatever you want?

647
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,600
Kuan'er?

648
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,800
Yueyang Sect's first disciple, Deng Kuan?

649
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,320
Isn't he dead?

650
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,040
-Enough, Master.
-He is still alive.

651
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
Kuan'er.

652
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,520
Everyone.

653
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,920
-What's going on?
-I am Deng Kuan,

654
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,680
the first disciple of the Yueyang Sect.

655
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,360
I'm not dead!

656
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,600
I was kept imprisoned by Gao Chong.

657
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,120
It was him

658
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,400
who instructed me
to sneak into the Mirror Lake Sect

659
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,040
and help Long-Tongued Ghost sneak inside

660
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,800
to extinguish the Zhang family.

661
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,680
Kuan'er,

662
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,800
what are you talking about?

663
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,000
Gao Chong!

664
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,400
You abandoned the Five Lakes Alliance!

665
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,760
Such disloyalty!

666
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,040
You murdered your own brothers!

667
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,600
Such disrespect!

668
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,880
You harmed the lost orphan
of the Mirror Lake Sect.

669
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,960
Such inhumanity!

670
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,720
You colluded with Ghost Valley
to disrupt the martial arts world.

671
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,680
Such injustice!

672
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,880
I assisted you in your cruel ways,

673
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,680
I am too ashamed to live!

674
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,400
I shall end my life to maintain justice!

675
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,400
I will die with you!

676
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,360
Kuan'er!

677
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,320
Deng Kuan!

678
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,160
Deng Kuan!

679
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,760
Deng Kuan!

680
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,440
Deng Kuan!

681
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,120
You can't believe him!

682
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,040
This kid is crazy!

683
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,040
Kuan'er.

684
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,720
Who wants me to be dead

685
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,960
by controlling you?

686
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,200
Changing Ghost.

687
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,480
So this is where you're making your move.

688
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,600
Sure enough,
a dog that can bite doesn't bark.

689
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,120
Congratulations, you abandoned the dark

690
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,760
and cast a bright future.
