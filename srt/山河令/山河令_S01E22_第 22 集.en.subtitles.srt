1
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,760
Miss, take a look at this umbrella.

2
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,440
Master, let's eat in this restaurant.
The food here is delicious.

3
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,280
Kindhearted young master
and pretty young lady,

4
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,480
please give me something to eat.

5
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,600
Please.

6
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,040
Thank you, sir.

7
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,120
I wish you two lifelong happiness
and have a baby soon.

8
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,960
Nonsense!

9
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,920
Here you go.

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,120
-Birds of a feather flock together.
-Thank you…

11
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,120
Ah Xiang, didn't you say

12
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,240
that those who do good deeds
are great fools?

13
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,520
Who has influenced you then?

14
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,600
You're not a good guy.

15
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,600
Master, let's go.

16
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,280
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhou.

17
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
Ah Xiang's words are harsh,
but she's kind at heart.

18
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,640
Mr. Zhou, don't make fun of her.

19
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,200
Weining, you…

20
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,400
You and Gu Xiang…

21
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,080
Don't be too optimistic about it.

22
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,000
Did you see Mr. Wen?

23
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,640
He's so serious.

24
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Mr. Cao,

25
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,200
there's a fierce battle ahead of you.

26
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,680
PENGLAI INN

27
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,920
How tasty!

28
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,040
Why are you still hanging around
this idiot?

29
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,480
Aren't you still hanging around
those two idiots too?

30
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,280
Mr. Cao,

31
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,400
judging from how you look,

32
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,360
you haven't recovered
from your injury yet.

33
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,760
Please just call me Weining.

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,680
I was hurt by Tao Hong and Lu Liu's
concealed weapon

35
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,640
and the residual poison
is still in my body.

36
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,640
Fortunately, Ah Xiang
took very good care of me

37
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
and I'm all right now.

38
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,040
I just need to go back to Mount Qingfeng
and clear the residual poison.

39
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,400
Gu Xiang.

40
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,960
I've known you for a long time.

41
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,320
Why didn't I know

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,280
that you can take good care of people?

43
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,880
Lao Wen.

44
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,560
Come on, give me your hands.

45
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,320
Hurry up.

46
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,320
Mr. Wen has good medical skills.

47
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,960
He can help you.

48
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,240
Tao Hong and Lu Liu
are involved with both good and evil.

49
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,440
How did you get into conflicts with them?

50
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,840
Those two old monsters broke
into the Yueyang Sect

51
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,040
and took Gao Xiaolian away
on the day of the Heroes Conference.

52
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,680
A lot of things happened later,
but you didn't know.

53
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,560
I don't know how Xiaolian is now.

54
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,000
I heard that she's still missing.

55
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,880
Didn't Mr. Zhao and Mr. Shen look for her?

56
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,120
Don't worry.

57
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,280
They won't hurt Ms. Gao

58
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,840
before they get the Glazed Armor.

59
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,520
Chengling,

60
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,120
Gao Xiaolian nearly became your wife.

61
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,760
You won't leave her alone, right?

62
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,000
Gu Xiang.

63
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,360
Why are you blushing?

64
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,400
Deng Kuan is gone.
No one could take her away.

65
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,760
Deng Kuan?

66
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,960
Gao Chong's disciple?

67
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,600
Yes, as I told you before.

68
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,400
Deng Kuan originally had
a marriage engagement with Xiaolian.

69
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,520
But then, Hero Gold Bean appeared

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,680
-and took her away.
-Gu Xiang!

71
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,600
Do you mean he's gone?

72
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,040
Yes, he disappeared
after the Heroes Conference.

73
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,400
Maybe he's dead.

74
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,240
It's going to take some work
to remove the poison residue.

75
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,080
Ah Xu, let's go to a herbal medicine shop.

76
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,520
It's all right, sir!

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,240
-Sit down.
-Just give me the prescription.

78
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,840
Ah Xiang.

79
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,120
It's all right.

80
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,920
You will gradually know
how to get along with them.

81
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,160
Ah Xu,

82
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,280
we are thinking about
the same thing, right?

83
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,960
Deng Kuan was the guy who accused
the collusion of Gao Chong

84
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,240
and the Ghost Valley
at the Martial Arts Conference.

85
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,680
At first,
I thought he was just a disciple.

86
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,920
But I didn't know

87
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,360
that he was engaged
to Gao Chong's only daughter.

88
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,920
He would have inherited
Gao Chong's wealth in the future

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,840
and become the supreme leader
of the martial arts world.

90
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,280
I can't figure out

91
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,840
the one behind him

92
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,040
and the tricks the person used

93
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,320
to subvert him.

94
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Maybe we are wrong.

95
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,840
He might tell the truth.

96
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,360
He really wants to place
righteousness above family loyalty.

97
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
No way.

98
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,120
When Chengling handed over
the Glazed Armor,

99
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,320
he became useless to Gao Chong.

100
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,480
He wouldn't use his only daughter

101
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,320
to win an orphan over.

102
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,600
Since he has announced this
at the Martial Arts Conference,

103
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,080
he wouldn't break his promise.

104
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,760
It's quite easy to break the promise.

105
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,160
After winning people over

106
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,920
and if Chengling is dead,

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,760
Gao Xiaolian won't be married
to a memorial tablet.

108
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,520
Masters, judging from your outfits,

109
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
you must be rich.

110
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,400
Please give me something to eat.

111
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,920
I am starving.

112
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,840
This beggar

113
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
is so foolish.

114
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,040
He chose the wrong guy to cheat.

115
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,480
Don't you know

116
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,360
that he does the same as you once did?

117
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,360
Hero Shen.

118
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,760
What a small world!

119
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,760
Watch out!

120
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,840
Ah Xiang, have one more piece.

121
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,400
Gu Xiang,

122
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,960
are you going to live
in the Gentle Wind Sword Sect?

123
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,320
I'm going back to the Four Seasons Manor
with Master and Mr. Wen.

124
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Where is your hometown?

125
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,560
Hey, Stinky Gold Bean!

126
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,840
You have no right to ask here.

127
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,720
Answer me when I ask you.

128
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,960
Listen.

129
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,720
When I was not with you,
where did you go and what did you do?

130
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,000
Answer me.

131
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,600
-There's a lot to tell about that.
-What?

132
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,840
Young Master Zhang,
are you busy with anything important?

133
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,840
Ah Xiang.

134
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,840
Before Master comes back,
we are stuck with each other.

135
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,720
Answer me. I'm listening.

136
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,480
-I didn't go to the Heroes Conference.
-Here it comes!

137
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,400
Wait.

138
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,520
We haven't ordered anything yet.
What's this?

139
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,480
Free side dish from our restaurant.

140
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,400
Really?

141
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,920
You don't believe me?

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,960
I'll open it for you then.

143
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,720
Who are they?

144
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,920
-Take him away. Hurry up.
-I won't leave you alone.

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,680
If he died, Master would kill me!

146
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,400
No one can leave. Go!

147
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,480
Watch out, Ah Xiang!

148
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,560
Three to the left. Seven to the right.

149
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,280
Two and four for the shoulder.

150
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,440
Six and eight for the foot.

151
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,960
Idiot, you've improved a lot!

152
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,840
Keep using Swift Moving Steps
and don't get caught by them!

153
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,800
-Watch out!
-Watch out!

154
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,560
Are you stupid? Why are you going inside?

155
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,080
It's not me!

156
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,840
Master told me to do it!

157
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,840
Who asked for your help?

158
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,360
You're weak and not helpful at all.

159
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,680
Chief Shen.

160
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,680
That's a Scorpion Tail Thorn
and it's poisonous.

161
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,320
If you trust me,

162
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,320
take this medicine orally
and apply it externally.

163
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,960
If you don't, it's all right.

164
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Thank you.

165
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,360
At the Heroes Conference,

166
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,040
you two helped Gao Chong

167
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,480
and saved Chengling.

168
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,200
You've helped me a lot.

169
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,680
And now you gave me some medicine.

170
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,440
I will definitely
return the favor one day.

171
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
How strange.

172
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,880
You still remember
your sworn brother, Gao Chong?

173
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,240
Lao Wen!

174
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,840
He was once my brother,

175
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,240
and he'll always be my brother.

176
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,680
Mr. Wen.

177
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,360
Mr. Zhou, where is Chengling?

178
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Chengling is nearby.

179
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,160
The Scorpion Sect's assassins
are so ruthless.

180
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,480
They might be in danger too.

181
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,000
Let's check on them first.

182
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,920
-Someone was killed!
-Run!

183
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,240
-Run!
-Run!

184
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,880
PENGLAI INN

185
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,920
Someone was killed!

186
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,280
Sir, move!

187
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,560
-Run!
-Please don't kill me. Please!

188
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,640
Please don't kill me. Please.

189
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,600
Help, young man!

190
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,960
Ah Xiang!

191
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,560
He was just an old beggar.

192
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,680
-Why did you kill him?
-So what?

193
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,680
Over there!

194
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,920
Let's go!

195
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,840
Go.

196
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,760
-Master!
-Master!

197
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,960
ZHAOJI PRIVATE BANK

198
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,200
Take him!

199
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,480
Master!

200
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,200
Lao Wen, keep one alive!

201
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,360
It's too late.

202
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,040
Chengling.

203
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,320
Silly girl, I was the one who killed them.

204
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,840
Why are you stained with blood?

205
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,320
It was someone else's.

206
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,080
Chengling.

207
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,360
Mr. Shen, why are you here?

208
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,840
It's a long story.

209
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,800
Weining, you…

210
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,960
Why are you here with them?

211
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,120
Master Shen, it's a long story too.

212
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,800
Here.

213
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,720
Don't be so annoying.

214
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,440
Ah Xiang, why are you so angry?

215
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,120
Go. Just go!

216
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,080
Go!

217
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,480
Answer my question.

218
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,280
Was it wrong for me to kill the beggar?

219
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,200
If I didn't kill him, he would kill me.

220
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,400
But he might not--

221
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,800
He might not kill you.

222
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,160
But what if he did?

223
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,640
Hero Cao,

224
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,960
I'm not like you

225
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,000
who have all those masters

226
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,680
and senior disciples around you.

227
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,160
In the place where I grew up,

228
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,120
there were people
always killing each other.

229
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,800
Even if there's only a 1% chance,

230
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,280
it's better to kill the wrong guy
instead of letting him go.

231
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,480
If I don't do that,

232
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,080
I wouldn't be able to be alive.

233
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,240
Ah Xiang,

234
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,120
I'm not blaming you.

235
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,600
I don't think you were wrong.

236
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,240
I'm just afraid if that old beggar

237
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,920
is just a normal person,

238
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
you will feel bad
because you killed the wrong guy.

239
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,720
That's nonsense!

240
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,440
I'm not hypocritical like you.

241
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,640
There is nothing for me to feel sorry for.

242
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,840
If he's the wrong guy, that's all right.

243
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,640
Ah Xiang, you will definitely feel sorry.

244
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,000
You will.

245
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,600
You are so kind.

246
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,520
How can you not be sad, right?

247
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,000
How do you know that?

248
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,480
Ah Xiang,

249
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,960
I know you best.

250
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,880
You never told me

251
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,000
about your childhood.

252
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,080
You mentioned the place
where you grew up just now.

253
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,680
Ah Xiang, why is the place
you grew up at so harsh?

254
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,480
You know nothing!

255
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Ah Xiang!

256
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,080
Chengling,

257
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,840
since you came to the Five Lakes Alliance,
I haven't treated you well.

258
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,560
Are you angry with me?

259
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,520
No.

260
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,720
If you are really angry with me,
I won't blame you.

261
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,960
It's useless for me to explain now.

262
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,160
But I still want you to know

263
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,520
that I don't hate you.

264
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,960
It's just that
when your brothers were young,

265
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,840
my brothers and I were quite close.

266
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,920
I held and played with your brothers.

267
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,120
Every time I see you,

268
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,480
I always think about them.

269
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,680
I kind of wish

270
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,839
they were still alive.

271
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,560
There was nothing wrong with that.

272
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,480
If God let me die for my brothers,

273
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,839
I would be very grateful.

274
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,319
But I, the most useless one, survived.

275
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,680
Chengling, sit down.

276
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,160
Do you know that

277
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,400
you look like your father the most?

278
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,480
You have a similar
appearance and personality.

279
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,080
Your father was really
innocent and filial.

280
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,080
Among the five of us,

281
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,720
he was the kindest
and the most honest one.

282
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,760
Really?

283
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
My father was not as foolish as me, right?

284
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,640
He was a hero.

285
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,160
People say that I'm weak

286
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,640
and will never make it big.

287
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,200
Not like the saying,
"like father like son."

288
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,880
Master.

289
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,080
Chengling, when did you
start learning from Mr. Zhou?

290
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,320
Mr. Zhou.

291
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,840
Thank you for helping my nephew
again and again.

292
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,200
You are a major benefactor
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

293
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,120
I really don't know how to reward you.

294
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,400
No need to thank me.

295
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,960
I'd like you to honestly answer
a few questions.

296
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,720
Why do you say that?

297
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,960
If you have any questions,
I'll definitely tell you all that I know.

298
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,840
Chengling, go ahead.

299
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,680
All right.

300
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,440
Mr. Shen, let's make a deal first.

301
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,560
You can choose
to answer the question or not.

302
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
But don't lie to me.

303
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You and my father seemed
to have some misunderstanding.

304
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,520
Deng Kuan said that Mr. Gao
worked together with the Ghost Valley

305
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,640
to murder my father.

306
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,920
What exactly is going on?

307
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,320
Kid, I swear to God.

308
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,720
Gao Chong would rather kill himself
than kill your father.

309
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,800
Whatever misunderstanding we had,

310
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,440
Gao Chong loved your father the most.

311
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,440
Do you know

312
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,040
that he wanted you to marry Xiaolian

313
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,200
so that you would be the master
of the martial arts of both families

314
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,520
to revive the Mirror Lake Sword Sect
and become a great hero someday?

315
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,480
Then naturally,

316
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,760
you will be the leader
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

317
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,200
But I don't want all those things.

318
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,240
Chief Shen,

319
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,200
do you know Deng Kuan?

320
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,560
I've known him since he was young.

321
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,920
At the Heroes Conference,

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,640
is Deng Kuan's accusation
against his master true?

323
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,560
No, it's not.

324
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,040
You can't see through people's hearts.
How do you know that?

325
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,640
Twenty years ago,

326
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,760
Gao Chong suggested that
we should destroy the Glazed Armor

327
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,640
or expose everything
to the public to accept the sanction

328
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,760
by the people of the martial arts world.

329
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,240
All of us strongly opposed it.

330
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,200
Furthermore,

331
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,520
if Gao Chong wanted to take Lu Taichong
and Zhang Yusen's Glazed Armor,

332
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,120
there was no need for him to hold back

333
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,720
from doing it for so many years.

334
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,840
And I, if he asked for it,

335
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,640
would give the Glazed Armor to him
without hesitation.

336
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,240
As for Zhao Jing,

337
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
he is weak.

338
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,080
Chief Shen,

339
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,200
I have another question.

340
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,680
There's a saying,

341
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,920
"The water from the Five Lakes
gathers around the world.

342
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,480
Who else deserves supremacy
in the martial arts world?"

343
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,640
Everyone thought it was
Chief Gao who spread the word

344
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,600
to grab the position of the supreme leader
of the martial arts world.

345
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,560
It wasn't Gao Chong.

346
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,320
Although he is a man of few words,

347
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,600
he values brotherhood more than anything.

348
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,520
The only thing that transcends brotherhood

349
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,760
is the prestige
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

350
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,200
Have you figured out

351
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,040
why Deng Kuan framed his master?

352
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,080
I have been thinking about this
these days.

353
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,160
Knowing Kuan'er,

354
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,840
he would rather die a thousand times

355
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,680
than cause harm to Gao Chong.

356
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,480
I really don't know
what he was bewitched with

357
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,880
to destroy his master like that.

358
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,800
Chengling, have a chat with Chief Shen.

359
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,680
I'm going to check on your Mr. Wen.

360
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,640
Mr. Zhou, I also have one question.

361
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,920
Can you give me the answer?

362
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,840
I find that Mr. Wen looks like

363
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,840
an old friend of ours.

364
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,720
Is his surname…

365
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,520
Zhen?

366
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
Chief Shen,

367
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,040
I don't think
I have to answer your question.

368
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
That's right.

369
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,080
-But my--
-You're injured.

370
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,640
Have a good rest first.

371
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,200
Don't try to scare me.

372
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
What's on your mind?

373
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,320
I've figured it out.

374
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,880
What?

375
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,280
For Deng Kuan's behavior,

376
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,880
there might be another explanation.

377
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,320
Do you remember the weirdo

378
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,960
who took the disgusting
Drug Men as his kids?

379
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,600
The method in controlling Drug Men

380
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,080
might be related to
the legendary Soul-Hunting Poison.

381
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,880
Yes, we've seen the Drug Men
in the coffin home,

382
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,520
Scorpion Sect,

383
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,920
and Longyuan Valley.

384
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,040
The Drug Men in the coffin home
was also driven by Long-Tongued Ghost.

385
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,240
Scorpion Sect is somehow involved
in these strange happenings.

386
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,640
Ah Xu, during your stay
in the Window of Heaven,

387
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,640
have you ever seen
the chief of the Scorpion Sect?

388
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,520
He is quite mysterious,

389
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,960
so he never shows up.

390
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,720
Shen Shen doesn't seem to be lying.

391
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,080
That means Zhao Xuande,
who pretends to be stupid

392
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,960
to kill more powerful opponents,
is the real leader.

393
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,560
That's possible too.

394
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,040
But there are still a few things

395
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,320
that I can't figure out.

396
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,520
And there's another thing.

397
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,960
What is it?

398
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,920
Now, it's not just one thing,

399
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,680
but two.

400
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,760
Firstly,

401
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,800
if the chief of the Scorpion Sect
is Zhao Jing,

402
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,400
then the one
who put the Triple Corpse Poison

403
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,040
on Gao Chong's sword to indirectly kill
Rong Xuan and his wife

404
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,480
was Zhao Jing.

405
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,320
What's the second one?

406
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,200
Who is Long-Tongued Ghost?

407
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,120
Is it the man

408
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,600
who used the Soul Winding Box
to drive the Drug Men in the coffin home?

409
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,760
Long-Tongued Ghost.

410
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,720
I only know that
he's one of the Ten Devils.

411
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,360
Yes, he's the henchman of Hanged Ghost.

412
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,520
Hanged Ghost later advanced
in martial arts

413
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,920
and then gave him the Soul Winding Box.

414
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,080
The extermination of the Mirror Lake Sect
was led by him.

415
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,200
I see.

416
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,880
You're really well-informed, Lao Wen.

417
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,840
Mr. Wen, call me if you need more water.

418
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,880
I can take care of my master.

419
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,880
It's none of your business!

420
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,440
-I just want to--
-Don't flatter my master!

421
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,080
-Go!
-Ah Xiang.

422
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,840
-Go. Now!
-Ah Xiang!

423
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,200
Master, the hot water is ready.
Let me know if you need anything.

424
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,800
I almost spilled the beans just now.

425
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,000
My acquaintance with Long-Tongued Ghost
was almost exposed.

426
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,720
Luckily, Ah Xu didn't seem to notice.

427
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,080
If he knew who I am…

428
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Humans and ghosts are destined
to go different ways.

429
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,720
I have good news and bad news.

430
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,800
Don't let me guess.

431
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,320
The good news is

432
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,000
the spies I sent to the Longyuan Cabinet

433
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,680
found Zhang Chengling by accident.

434
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,880
He's with
the chief of the Window of Heaven

435
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
and the chief of the Ghost Valley.

436
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,400
What's odd is that

437
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,880
the descendant
of the Sword Immortal was there too.

438
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,680
What about the bad news?

439
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
Long Que and Long Xiao are both dead.

440
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,000
I thought it would be something important.

441
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,160
I kept Long Que alive

442
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,200
just in case I might need him.

443
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,400
But now all those
who deserved to die are dead,

444
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,480
this "shield" is dispensable.

445
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,400
Long Xiao is dead.

446
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,160
This is great news.

447
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,160
I don't need to do it myself then.

448
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,160
But once he died,
the key to the armory would…

449
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,800
How can you believe the words
that I lied to Long Xiao?

450
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,120
Actually, for the last 20 years,

451
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,160
the key to the armory

452
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,400
has been kept at the most dangerous place

453
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,760
and also the safest place.

454
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,720
It's in the Ghost Valley?

455
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,080
This is why I always want

456
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,440
to wipe out the Ghost Valley.

457
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,800
Xie'er, do you know
what is "interlocking"?

458
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,240
The extermination
of the Mirror Lake Sword Sect,

459
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,280
the things stolen in the Sanbai Manor,

460
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,040
and the murder of Ao Laizi…

461
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,600
All of which were arranged by me

462
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,920
to let people know

463
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,600
that the Ghost Valley
took the Glazed Armor.

464
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,920
But the plans can't keep up with changes.

465
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
The one making the fake Glazed Armor

466
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,480
ruined all your plans.

467
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,240
But luckily,

468
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,880
I don't need
to frame Gao Chong until it's done

469
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,240
to make him into a loser

470
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,960
and die with a ruined reputation.

471
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,640
Godfather,

472
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
why do you hate Gao Chong so much?

473
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,240
Xie'er, why do you ask me this?

474
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,440
I was just curious.

475
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,960
Really?

476
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,680
Curious.

477
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,000
Then why aren't you curious

478
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,800
that as sworn brothers,

479
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,320
some people are high above others
and domineering,

480
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,480
while others are underprivileged
and undignified?

481
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,280
Why aren't you curious

482
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,400
that some can be leaders and lead people,

483
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,720
while some can only work for them

484
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,520
and stoop to compromise?

485
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,000
Do you think I am

486
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,040
such a selfish guy

487
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,760
that I killed Gao Chong
just for personal gain?

488
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,680
Listen to me.

489
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,320
Only under my guidance

490
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,760
can the Five Lakes Alliance be stronger

491
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,720
and dominate the martial arts world!

492
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,160
Godfather, I'm sorry.

493
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,280
I was wrong.

494
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,760
Don't be angry with me.

495
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,200
This is the only thing you can do!

496
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,600
You said that

497
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,080
Zhang Chengling had been found.

498
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,520
Then?

499
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,120
Those men are good at martial arts
and very mysterious.

500
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,040
The spies did not dare
to follow too close.

501
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,000
But as he sends me messages by pigeons,
he has arranged hidden spies all around.

502
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,720
They're following them in a distance
and waiting for a chance to make a move.

503
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,240
Those three are excellent at martial arts.

504
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,240
Common Scorpion Sect members
can do nothing but get themselves killed!

505
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,080
With your permission,

506
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,480
I'll set off right away.

507
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
Don't forget

508
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,800
that both of them
escaped unscathed from you before.

509
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,160
I got something to worry about back then.

510
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,640
It's fine.

511
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,400
I have my plans.

512
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,440
Xie'er.

513
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,840
When are you going to be
less impulsive and reckless?

514
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,400
Please grow up.

515
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,520
Zhou Xu, you…

516
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,360
It's midnight. What are you doing here?

517
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,320
-You scared the hell out of me!
-Are you feeling guilty?

518
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,560
What are you afraid of?

519
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,840
It's so late at night.

520
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,880
Why didn't you go to bed?

521
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,200
On such a starry night,

522
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,640
for whom do you stand here?

523
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,800
Don't be so cryptic.

524
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,680
I really don't know

525
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,320
what's good about the liqueur except
for the bitter and astringent taste.

526
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,800
Don't spoil the good stuff
if you don't drink.

527
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,240
Master often drinks when he's unhappy.

528
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,560
I thought it was something amazing,

529
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,400
but turns out
it changes nothing after all.

530
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,360
You don't know this, do you?

531
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,360
A liqueur is also called
"Sorrow Reliving Medicine."

532
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,520
If one bottle can't relieve your sorrow,

533
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,960
two bottles can.

534
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,160
If that doesn't work either,
try three or four bottles.

535
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,200
It's a pity that we are out here,

536
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,280
and there is only one left.

537
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,520
What's wrong? You're unhappy again?

538
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,160
Did that Young Hero Cao

539
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,840
-piss you off again?
-If he dares to, I'll castrate him.

540
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,400
You're a girl

541
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,480
with a good appearance,

542
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,840
but why do you always speak so vulgarly?

543
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,400
Lao Wen said that
he was the one who raised you.

544
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,320
No wonder.

545
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,640
Sick Man, you are up at midnight.

546
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,560
What's wrong? Are you sick again?

547
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,560
Yes.

548
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,240
I heard from my master

549
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,160
that you won't live for long.

550
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,640
It was all your own doing.

551
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,520
Really?

552
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,160
Darn it!

553
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,680
Why don't you stay healthy?

554
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,120
If you die,

555
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,720
Master will be very sad.

556
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,840
I have never

557
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,600
seen him as sad as he was that day.

558
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,480
He has finally made a friend.

559
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,800
You have to live!

560
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,840
You…

561
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,520
If you die suddenly

562
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,760
and leave my master behind
to grieve alone,

563
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,160
I will revive you from the netherworld
and then kill you again.

564
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,920
If you weren't a girl,
I would beat you several times a day.

565
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,880
Your way of speaking
reminds me of someone.

566
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,080
Who?

567
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,640
An eavesdropper.

568
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,400
Hey, girl.

569
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,160
What nonsense are you talking about?

570
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,120
Master, here you go.

571
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,880
What are you doing?

572
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,760
Don't pull me by my ear.
I've grown up. Don't.

573
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,120
Grown up? How old are you?

574
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,440
Even if you are married
and become a mother,

575
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,360
I can still
pull you by your ears as I like.

576
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,800
Liqueur.

577
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,920
There is nothing inside.
Why do you give it to me?

578
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,719
This place looks like a cellar.

579
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,000
Get me some liqueur.

580
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,920
Hurry up.

581
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,960
Go!

582
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,679
Mr. Wen.

583
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,719
You brat,

584
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,520
you told him.

585
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,840
No, I didn't.

586
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,840
He asked me if your surname was Zhen.

587
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,320
I just said I wouldn't tell him.

588
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,679
But Mr. Shen guessed it right.

589
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,120
Idiot!

590
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,240
Calm down, Lao Wen.

591
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,720
Mr. Wen,

592
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,440
are you Yan'er?

593
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,360
Yan'er, how are your parents?

594
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,040
A man with his hamstrings all torn

595
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,040
without the protection of his master,

596
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,480
having to bear the oppression
from the world of martial arts

597
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,880
and at the same time,
hiding from the revenge of the evil!

598
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,640
Even though he was under the attack
of both good and evil,

599
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,000
he still stood up for the brotherhood

600
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,440
and covered the truth
for his so-called brothers!

601
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,440
How well do you think he could be?

602
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,280
I'm sorry.

603
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,560
It's too late.

604
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,800
They couldn't hear your apologies anymore.

605
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,520
Lao Wen!

606
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,560
What's wrong?

607
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,360
Yan'er!

608
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,680
Don't call me that.
You're unqualified to call me that!

609
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,800
Wen Kexing.

610
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,120
Why are you helping him?

611
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,680
I'm helping you!

612
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,360
It's too late.

613
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,440
They are all dead!

614
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,680
Together with Zhen Yan!

615
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Ah Xu.

616
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,160
Yan'er.

617
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,520
How did your parents die?

618
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,480
It's too late.

619
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,600
It's too late!

620
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,800
Lao Wen!

621
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,600
Come here.

622
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,480
Lao Wen.

623
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,080
I'm sorry.

624
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,160
LI RESIDENCE

625
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,120
Master, how is he?

626
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,200
Don't worry.
There's nothing wrong with his pulse.

627
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,840
He is just unconscious for some reason.

628
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
Mr. Zhou,

629
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,560
do you mean Yan'er is sick?

630
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,800
Chief Shen,

631
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,200
my junior's name is Wen Kexing.

632
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,200
He chose this name.

633
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,440
Please respect his decision.

634
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,720
Call him by that name.

635
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,440
When did he become your junior?

636
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,440
Who is your master?

637
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,080
He was the lord of the Four Seasons Manor.

638
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,400
His surname is Qin
and his given name is Huaizhang.

639
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,920
Huaizhang saved Yan…

640
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,080
I mean, Kexing.

641
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,280
That is great!

642
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,080
God is watching.

643
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,200
If Gao Chong knew that Kexing was raised
by Huaizhang all these years,

644
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,720
he would be very happy.

645
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,120
So you are

646
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,600
my master's friend.

647
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,000
But why have I never heard
about you from him?

648
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,040
It's not really odd.

649
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,200
Since the Battle in Mount Qingya,

650
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,200
Huaizhang decided to cut off

651
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,640
all contact with us.

652
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,080
So all these years,

653
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,080
we didn't know Ruyu's son

654
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,760
had been in the Four Seasons Manor.

655
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,960
That's weird.

656
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,640
Master always values his friends.

657
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,520
How could he break off all relations
with you for no reason?

658
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,160
Is there any misunderstanding?

659
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,720
Actually, it's not a misunderstanding.

660
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,960
Your master hates us

661
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,120
for some reason.

662
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,920
But it's a long story.

663
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,000
If so,

664
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,200
I dare not know
about the fault of my master.

665
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,120
Chief Shen, you don't need to tell me
anything anymore.

666
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,480
He blamed us for crossing the line
for something big

667
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,880
and for being disloyal.

668
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,120
He was right.

669
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,280
He was right.

670
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,640
I'm a coward.

671
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,560
I wronged my brother.

672
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,440
I have no right to defend myself.

673
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,400
I, Shen Shen,

674
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,240
am an unfaithful, incompetent,

675
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,640
and weak coward.

676
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,760
It was you?

677
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,280
You poisoned Mr. Rong?

678
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,440
What did you say?

679
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,640
My disciple asked you

680
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,280
whether you were the one
who put poison on Gao Chong's sword

681
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,520
that led to Master Rong Xuan's death.

682
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,680
I turned a blind eye to
Rong Xuan's death and Ruyu's suffering

683
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,320
and I said nothing for 20 years.

684
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,640
I am shameless!

685
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,640
I admit it!

686
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,120
But slaying my brother
like you accused me of?

687
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,760
That's something I would never do!

688
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,280
Besides, because of this grievance,

689
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,280
Gao Chong rued for the rest of his life.

690
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,800
If I knew who did it,

691
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,400
I'd kill him at the expense of my life!

692
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,800
You don't know?

693
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,800
Who is the current chief
of the Five Lakes Alliance?

694
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,200
Are you talking about…

695
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,720
Are you talking about Hero Zhao?

696
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,280
Speak truthfully.

697
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
The one who used the poison was Zhao Jing?

698
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,240
Who told you that?

699
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,240
Is it Yan'er?

700
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,840
Does he have any evidence?

701
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,720
Wake him up and let him explain it to me.

702
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,480
No.

703
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,200
Of course, if my junior wakes up

704
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,520
and is willing to talk to you,

705
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,840
I won't stand in the way.

706
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,000
No, I have to make it clear to him!

707
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,600
Chief Shen, with all due respect,

708
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,600
you just watched
Master Rong Xuan die before.

709
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,640
Human nature is evil.
I dare not expect otherwise from you.

710
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,920
If you brothers of five different surnames
had been a bit more merciful,

711
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,360
my junior wouldn't have suffered
for the rest of his life.

712
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,520
We were all badly injured in Mount Qingya.

713
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,320
-We didn't have time for other things!
-You don't need to explain it to me!

714
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,520
At midnight,

715
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,920
if you can convince your conscience…

716
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,040
What goes around comes around.

717
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,320
You guys will eventually end up…

718
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,600
It's in the past already.

719
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,800
Ashes to ashes.

720
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,280
I don't want my junior

721
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,600
to keep suffering from hatred.

722
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,360
Chief Shen, please leave.

723
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,400
You can close your eyes and ears

724
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,080
or do evil from now on.

725
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,280
I just hope that my junior
won't take revenge on you

726
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,280
and we will never see you again.

727
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,120
Chengling,

728
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,760
see him out for me.

729
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,520
All right.
