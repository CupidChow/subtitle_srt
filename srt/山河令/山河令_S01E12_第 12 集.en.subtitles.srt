1
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,560
Do you want to have some?

2
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,240
Of course. Why not?

3
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,960
Save me some wine.

4
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,520
What a good wine.

5
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,480
You're just like a kid.

6
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,920
Master Zhou,
congratulations on your disciple.

7
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
Do you know
why I accepted Chengling as my disciple?

8
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,720
No. Tell me why.

9
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,680
This child is stupid,
his basics are not good,

10
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,880
and he is too old
to practice martial arts.

11
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,920
Why do you care so much about him?

12
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,400
As a child,

13
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,320
my master taught me this.

14
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,480
There are two rarest qualities in people,

15
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,080
benevolence and courage.

16
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,680
The ancient sages classified brave people
into these types.

17
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,240
Brave in energy, blood,
backbone, and spirit.

18
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,240
These are the bravery of youngsters.

19
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,480
My master promoted the bravery
of "going on your own way."

20
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,520
What does it mean?

21
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,600
To do something
even though it's impossible

22
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,920
and to trust people
even though they are unpredictable.

23
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,880
Lao Wen.

24
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
It is difficult

25
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,160
for us at our age

26
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,360
to show our hearts to others.

27
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,520
I can't do this myself

28
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,440
and I can't ask you to do so.

29
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
That's why…

30
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,080
I decided to be the first to try

31
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,240
and take a gamble.

32
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,200
You are

33
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,680
the one that I know.

34
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,640
Hey.

35
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,520
That nasty woman

36
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,960
hit me so hard.

37
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,040
I will kill her the next time I see her.

38
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,920
It hurts.

39
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,480
You,

40
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
what are you doing here?

41
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,320
Ah Xiang, what's wrong with your arm?

42
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,480
Also, you look terrible.

43
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,360
Where did you go last night?

44
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,840
The assassins sneaked into Yueyang Sect
and kidnapped Chengling.

45
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,680
Why are you asking me
where I went last night?

46
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,160
You weren't in the house last night,
were you?

47
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,560
How…

48
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,720
How do you know that?
Did you see it yourself?

49
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,680
But you really were not in the house.

50
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,840
I heard that the assassins sneaked
into the Yueyang Sect

51
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,280
and triggered a full-scale manhunt.

52
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,400
I was worried that you might feel scared,
so I came to see you.

53
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
Who told you to come to me?

54
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,000
Did you get caught that late?

55
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,160
No.

56
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,400
I swear.

57
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,360
I certainly know
how important reputation is to girls.

58
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,520
I came here quietly.

59
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,320
All of them were looking
for the assassins,

60
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,160
so don't worry, nobody saw me.

61
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Ah Xiang, were you also
looking for Chengling?

62
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,480
That's dangerous.

63
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,640
Let us do it.

64
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
You're just a girl.

65
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,320
I know.

66
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,520
Leave now. I'll talk to you later.

67
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,720
Well, Ah Xiang, don't worry.

68
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,960
-Chengling will be fine--
-Hurry up and go,

69
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,360
or people will see us together
early in the morning.

70
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,120
-Okay.
-Just go.

71
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,720
It is said
that the human heart is sinister,

72
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,520
but after I came out of the valley,

73
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,240
I met Zhou Xu, Chengling, and Mr. Cao.

74
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,440
They are all so silly.

75
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,520
Who are you?

76
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,360
It's me, sir.

77
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,800
Ms. Gu, you got up so early.

78
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,240
I'm doing my morning exercise.

79
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,760
You guys go on. I'm out of here.

80
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,160
Please wait, Ms. Gu.

81
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,160
My master wants to see you.

82
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,680
Master.

83
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
Are you all right now?

84
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,200
I'm fine.

85
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,640
Where is Mr. Wen, Master?

86
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,280
I'm glad to hear you asking for me
once you wake up.

87
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,320
You are much better than your master.

88
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,400
Let's go.

89
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,720
Where are we going?

90
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,360
In such a big world,

91
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
we can go wherever we want to go.

92
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,480
But before we leave,

93
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,080
we need to find a secluded place

94
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,320
to take out what's inside Chengling.

95
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,880
It's not a good thing to keep something
in the body for a long time.

96
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,600
What will we do with it then?

97
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,960
I don't care if we throw it,
bury it, or smash it up.

98
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,040
It's not a good thing anyway.

99
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,440
But Master,
the Glazed Armor is why the Ghost Valley

100
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,840
wanted to kill my whole family.

101
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,960
This proves that it's not good.

102
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
My father died
because of the Glazed Armor.

103
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,120
The Heroes Conference is about to start.

104
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,120
It is said
that Mr. Gao will tell the world

105
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,640
the origin of the Glazed Armor then.

106
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,640
You don't have to wait
for the Heroes Conference

107
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,280
if you want to know its origin.

108
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,440
I can tell you about that.

109
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,840
No one knows

110
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,800
about this mess better than I do.

111
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,080
Twenty years ago,

112
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,720
there was a mysterious master
who came out of nowhere

113
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,920
and made a big name
in the martial arts world.

114
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,440
He was Rong Xuan
from the Mountain Closing Sword.

115
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,760
He had a strange theory of his own.

116
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,440
He said that all martial arts in the world
came from the same source,

117
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,680
so if they all can
discard their selfishness

118
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,400
and learn from one another,

119
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,560
an unprecedented mastery can be created.

120
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,080
He impressed a group of people

121
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,000
who didn't know any better
than this speech.

122
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,600
The martial arts world 20 years ago

123
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,680
was not as stagnant as it is today.

124
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,600
Instead, there were people
who saw eye to eye

125
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,160
and stories of sincerity.

126
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,680
People gradually regarded Rong Xuan
as the core.

127
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,000
Following his passion,

128
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,799
they wanted to change the traditions

129
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,080
of the martial arts for thousands of years

130
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,400
to create a completely new world.

131
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,920
However, Rong Xuan fell deeper
into his dream.

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,080
He began to search for the secret scrolls
in various ways,

133
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,080
whether by trickery, violence,

134
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,320
or even by deception.

135
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,200
He was an outstanding young man
of his generation,

136
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,600
but gradually,

137
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,360
he became the bad guy
that everyone shouted at.

138
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,680
Fortunately, his wife was
the great disciple of the Healer Valley,

139
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,280
Yue Feng'er, the Fairy Ganoderma.

140
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,600
Although he was injured several times
by ambushes,

141
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,880
she saved him from the jaws of death.

142
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,400
The heavens were blind.

143
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,720
After several years,

144
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,120
this group of ignorant people

145
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
managed to collect
countless secret scrolls

146
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,000
and created the World's Armory

147
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,960
in a hidden place.

148
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,520
He set up many traps outside the armory

149
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,160
and divided the key into five parts,

150
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,440
given respectively
to the five strongest friends

151
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,600
for safekeeping.

152
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,960
Only by collecting five parts of the key

153
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,720
can one open the World's Armory.

154
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,960
What happened after that?

155
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,080
What happened after

156
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,280
became a well-known story.

157
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,000
At that time, the Five Lakes Alliance
held a Martial Arts Conference,

158
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
calling on all heroes to kill this madman.

159
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,440
Rong Xuan had no other choice,

160
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,480
but to be forced out of Mount Qingya.

161
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,960
After killing countless people,

162
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,960
he was finally exhausted

163
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,480
and committed suicide by
the demarcation stone in the Ghost Valley.

164
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,160
A well-known story?

165
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,400
Why is it different
from the story I heard?

166
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,400
Because it's the end of Rong Xuan's story,

167
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,840
not that of the martial arts world.

168
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,640
After his suicide,

169
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,520
the ghosts in Mount Qingya swarmed out

170
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,320
and started a huge battle
with the martial arts heroes.

171
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,000
It was a nightmare with many deaths

172
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,160
and injuries on both sides.

173
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,000
The martial arts heroes
were greatly reduced,

174
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,720
and the power of the Ghost Valley
was greatly weakened.

175
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,040
But the great battle has brought peace
for 20 years in the martial arts world.

176
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,960
Nearly every survivor

177
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,480
had a loved one who died in the battle.

178
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,960
After all, the battle was started

179
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,400
for ignominious reasons

180
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
and ended with disrepute.

181
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,840
That's why people don't want
to talk about it.

182
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,640
Do you mean that all these people who died

183
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,120
were greedy for the treasures
in the armory?

184
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,720
If 20 years ago, the Five Lakes Alliance

185
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,360
had opened the armory as hoped,

186
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,760
then the Mirror Lake Sword Sect

187
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
wouldn't have come to an end.

188
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,240
The Glazed Armor…

189
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,880
The Glazed Armor is the key.

190
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,240
My father was

191
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,800
one of Mr. Rong's five friends.

192
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,760
It's fine. Let bygones be bygones.

193
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,320
Bygones?

194
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,960
I don't think so.

195
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,600
CHONGWU PALACE

196
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,160
The assassins

197
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,280
sneaked into
our Five Lakes Alliance last night.

198
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,840
They took away Zhang Chengling,
Zhang Yusen's orphan.

199
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,000
This is a major accident.

200
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,840
We may have a mole here.

201
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,720
At this time of urgency,

202
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,160
please allow me to be rude.

203
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,680
According to the disciples
of the Five Lakes Alliance,

204
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,040
you were not in your rooms

205
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,160
at the time of the incident yesterday.

206
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,920
So here,

207
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,560
I would like to ask everyone
to say where they went last night

208
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,680
to clear suspicions.

209
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,520
This is also to avoid any hard feelings.

210
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,560
Master, I have made my decision.

211
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,800
I can't leave now.

212
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,040
I should go back.

213
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,280
You little idiot.

214
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,120
I said so much,
but you didn't catch anything.

215
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,840
Since you already know
the origin of the Glazed Armor

216
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,640
and the bad intentions of these people,

217
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,400
why do you still want to go back?

218
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,400
Because guarding the Glazed Armor
is my father's last wish.

219
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Also, I know that many people
are involved in this matter.

220
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,280
Even if I'm useless,

221
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,040
I can't stay away for my own safety.

222
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,080
What's more,
the Heroes Conference is about to start.

223
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,040
I'm the only representative
of the Mirror Lake Sword Sect.

224
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,440
If I am absent,
then the Mirror Lake Sword Sect

225
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,600
will really be removed
from the martial arts world.

226
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,120
Chengling, you're quite responsible.

227
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,120
That's great.

228
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,880
If you have decided to go back,

229
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,040
then listen to my advice

230
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,080
and return the Glazed Armor
to the Five Lakes Alliance.

231
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,200
Why?

232
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,000
My father stalemated
with the alliance for 20 years

233
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,280
just because of the Armor.

234
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,880
Chengling,

235
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,240
which is more important,
your safety or the Glazed Armor?

236
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,120
The Glazed Armor, of course.

237
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,040
No.

238
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,080
There is nothing more important than life.

239
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,360
There wasn't any trouble,

240
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,200
yet you're asking for it.

241
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,680
Chengling,

242
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,960
what do you think
of my martial arts skills?

243
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,320
Your skills are definitely the best.

244
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,920
My martial arts skills aren't bad.

245
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,120
It can be considered first-class.

246
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,280
But I am only proficient
in a few martial arts

247
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,560
of my clan.

248
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,760
There is an end to life,
but never to learning.

249
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,760
Ordinary people can't study

250
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,160
a single martial art skill thoroughly
even if they spend their whole life.

251
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,320
Even if the armory is opened

252
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,440
and each person is given
a kind of martial art, what can be done?

253
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,920
That's just human greed.

254
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,640
But Master, my father told me…

255
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,600
Chengling, it was not the armory

256
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,080
that Hero Zhang clung to,

257
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,440
but the brotherhood instead.

258
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,440
If your father wanted to open the armory,

259
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,840
he would have done so 20 years ago,
not wait until now.

260
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,920
Master Rong Xuan has passed away.

261
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,360
So has your father.

262
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,880
If they can see you,

263
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,600
they would hope that

264
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,520
you can be free
from what happened 20 years ago

265
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,480
and live your own life.

266
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,680
They wouldn't want you
to keep carrying this trouble

267
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,600
and getting coveted and robbed constantly.

268
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,240
Those who live their lives around greed,

269
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,040
I would leave them alone.

270
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,680
But I can't leave you alone.

271
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,760
Take my advice,

272
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,480
throw this trouble out,

273
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,680
and let them scramble.

274
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,480
Excuse me, miss.

275
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,040
I don't recognize you.

276
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,400
May I know which sect are you from?

277
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,400
Me?

278
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,360
I am nobody
and I do not belong to any sect.

279
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,080
I'm just a girl from the countryside.

280
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,280
Everyone in our area says

281
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,440
Hero Gao is highly skilled in martial arts
with an extraordinary spirit.

282
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,480
I am honored to meet you today.

283
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,080
I find what they say to be true.

284
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,600
Father.

285
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,400
She's Gu Xiang, a friend of Weining.

286
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,680
He gave me a heads up on her.
I arranged for her to stay.

287
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,160
By the way,
she's also an old friend of Chengling.

288
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
She's not a bad guy.

289
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,080
Xiaolian, you're not smart.

290
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,800
Why did you mention this?

291
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,920
Ms. Gu.

292
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,640
How did you meet Chengling?

293
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,680
It's pretty obvious, right?

294
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,680
Young Master Zhang

295
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,760
is handsome with a good heart

296
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,240
and comes from a noted family.

297
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,560
Is there anyone who doesn't know him?

298
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,640
All of us in Yue know him.

299
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,320
Ms. Gu, where were you last night?

300
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,080
Hero Gao.

301
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,320
Sorry, Chief Gao.

302
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,520
Why are you so harsh?

303
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm a girl from the countryside
without worldly experience.

304
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,080
Your dominance

305
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,960
scares me a little.

306
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,240
-Father.
-Shut up.

307
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,360
You are glib-tongued

308
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,880
and seem rather wicked.

309
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
You are definitely not a good girl.

310
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,400
Why did you let her stay?

311
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,000
Why did you say I'm not a good girl?
Should I deliberately put on a soft voice?

312
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
You!

313
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,600
Mr. Gao.

314
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,920
Mr. Gao, please don't blame Xiaolian

315
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,880
and Ah Xiang.

316
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,560
It's all my fault.

317
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,319
Don't take the blame on yourself, Weining.

318
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,599
Tell me.

319
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,599
Where were you last night?

320
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,520
You'd better be honest

321
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,000
or I'll punish you.

322
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,319
-I--
-She was with me the whole night.

323
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,120
YUEYANG SECT

324
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,960
Chengling, remember.

325
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,000
Let others know that
the Glazed Armor is no longer with you.

326
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,600
I'll pick you up
when the Heroes Conference ends.

327
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,920
Little idiot.

328
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,240
Don't talk about things
that don't concern you.

329
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,520
Just say you don't know
if they ask, all right?

330
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,200
The chiefs of
the Five Lakes Alliance are cunning.

331
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,640
You don't need to care
what kind of tricks they're playing.

332
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,680
Just keep silent.

333
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,280
You only need to show up
at the Heroes Conference.

334
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,400
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

335
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,280
Will you join us afterward?

336
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,600
I want to stay with you forever.

337
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,280
-And Gu Xiang, we'll--
-Enough, Chengling.

338
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,600
Don't be so sentimental like him.

339
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,200
If you need anything, go to Gu Xiang.

340
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,880
-Don't worry. We'll be with you.
-Hurry up and go.

341
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,520
Young Master Zhang, you're finally back.

342
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,880
We've been waiting for you
this whole time.

343
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,480
Luckily, you're back now
or Master will get angry.

344
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,520
Hurry up.

345
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,640
YUEYANG SECT

346
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,680
What's wrong?

347
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,920
There is no one good
in the Five Lakes Alliance.

348
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,240
Your disciple insisted on going back
which makes me worry about him.

349
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,520
The note that tempted Chengling out

350
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,760
reads "Xu."

351
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,600
How did they know
about your relationship with Chengling

352
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,800
and the name "Zhou Xu"?

353
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,480
I never said this name when I fought

354
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,440
with either the Window of Heaven
or the Scorpion Sect.

355
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,160
You're the only one

356
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
who knows this name.

357
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,960
Did you reveal it?

358
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,440
When we sent Chengling
to the Five Lakes Alliance,

359
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,240
you mentioned the name "Zhou Xu."

360
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,640
Don't throw dirt on me.

361
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,440
Never mind.

362
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,120
Treasures bring disasters.

363
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,080
The one who hired the Four Assassins
was just trying to get the Glazed Armor.

364
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,680
Now that Chengling gave it away,

365
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,320
he's just an orphan.

366
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,560
I'll take him out of here

367
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,680
after the Heroes Conference.

368
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,840
Let's go.

369
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,360
You're acting like a mother
who sent her son away.

370
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,000
Where are we going?

371
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,200
Let's drink and enjoy the sunshine.
Anything will do.

372
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,720
YUEYANG SECT, BLESSED TIMING

373
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,280
Master.

374
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,160
Master, Young Master Zhang is back.

375
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,240
Hey, Young Master Cao.

376
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,320
I didn't expect that.

377
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,840
I already knew you liked this girl,

378
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,800
but I didn't expect
your relationship to develop so quickly.

379
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,720
Candied hawthorns!

380
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,840
"To do something
even though it's impossible

381
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,840
and to trust people
even though they are unpredictable."

382
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,400
Ah Xu,

383
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,320
do you dare to bet

384
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,200
that I am the one you know?

385
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,200
What kind of person do you think I am?

386
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,320
A good guy or a bad guy?

387
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,360
Save your words.

388
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Are those tongue twisters?

389
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,240
CALLIGRAPHY AND PAINTINGS

390
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,360
Tell me. I'm curious about this.

391
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,440
In addition to being good-looking
at first glance,

392
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,120
what do I look like in others' eyes?

393
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,400
A stupid guy.

394
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,280
I've been experiencing a lot
in the mixed crowd.

395
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,640
If I can't even tell the good guys
from the bad guys,

396
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,520
my life would be a waste.

397
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,200
So you think

398
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,920
I'm a good guy?

399
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,320
A bad guy can be forgiven
if he puts down the sword.

400
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,640
So why should a good guy be sent to hell
if he only did something bad once?

401
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,560
That doesn't make sense.

402
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,600
So I'm a good guy.

403
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,320
No, you're wrong.

404
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,360
I'm more than a good guy.

405
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,840
I'm Philanthropist Wen.

406
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,800
Come on, Philanthropist Wen.

407
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,080
Ah Xu.

408
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,000
What?

409
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,920
Ah Xu.

410
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,120
Will you stop calling me?

411
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,320
Ah Xu.

412
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,680
Enough, Philanthropist Wen.

413
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,040
Shut up. Stop calling my name.

414
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,840
You're making me scared.

415
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,640
I just feel

416
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,320
that it's good

417
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,760
to be alive,

418
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,080
to have the sun shining,

419
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,800
and to have someone

420
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,160
for me to call.

421
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,640
Yes, you're right.

422
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,360
Lao Wen.

423
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,840
Lao Wen.

424
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,800
Lao Wen.

425
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,720
What?

426
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,200
Let's drink.

427
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,200
Cheers.

428
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,800
Ah Xu.

429
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,040
What do you usually do to spend your time?

430
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,000
What do you mean?

431
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,880
Even if you are
the chief of the Window of Heaven,

432
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,800
you must have free time.

433
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,480
Lower your voice.

434
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,160
Can't I ask you that,

435
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,160
dear Chief Zhou?

436
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,520
I will break your teeth
if you call me that again.

437
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,600
You haven't answered my question.

438
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,320
What do you usually do when you're free?

439
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,680
When I'm free,

440
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,400
I will practice.

441
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,560
Are you kidding me?

442
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,560
That's probably what I do.

443
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,960
You are the kind of excellent child
who only lives in a story.

444
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,160
When I was a child,

445
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,360
my parents criticized me many times

446
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,640
for not practicing martial arts properly.

447
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,800
But that's all right.

448
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,480
My master kept teaching me

449
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,840
that children should do
what children should do.

450
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,000
So he took me fishing
and catching birds every day.

451
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,800
We played on the grass in the spring
and fought in the snow in the winter.

452
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,880
I wanted to practice martial arts
when I was a child.

453
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,480
Sometimes, when my master
forced me to play,

454
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,520
I would seek help from his wife.

455
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,320
She always stood by my side

456
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,320
and criticized my master.

457
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,200
Now I see.

458
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,200
What?

459
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,120
I was wondering how can there be
such a good master in this world.

460
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,240
Obviously,

461
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,960
your master wanted to play outside.

462
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,360
He took you with him

463
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,680
so that he wouldn't be scolded
by his wife.

464
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,800
Why didn't I think of it?

465
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,960
It makes sense now.

466
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,520
It turns out that

467
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,320
I am not the only one
who lives out of time in this world.

468
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,960
When I was a child,

469
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,960
I couldn't play well when I wanted to

470
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,400
and no one taught me martial arts
when I wanted to learn.

471
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,200
Ah Xu, so you are just like me.

472
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,320
Chengling must be all right now.

473
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,640
We don't need to worry about him.

474
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,880
Let's find something else to enjoy
before the Heroes Conference.

475
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,120
We can't just stay here.

476
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,040
Lao Wen.

477
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,960
Have you ever suffered a loss?

478
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,480
Why do you ask that?

479
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,120
I have no great ability
and often suffer losses.

480
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,320
But once I have suffered a loss,

481
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,760
I'll be sure
to claim back the loss the next time.

482
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,160
This is the first time

483
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,560
I have suffered repeatedly

484
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,440
in the same matter.

485
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,920
The Scorpion Sect?

486
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,800
That's right. His nest was hard to find.

487
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,520
But how did you get there before me?

488
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,840
It's not a nest, but a small base.

489
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Back then, when the Window of Heaven
expanded its power to Jiangnan,

490
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,280
we fought
with the Scorpion Sect several times.

491
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,800
First, the coffin home,

492
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,280
then the accident last night.

493
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,080
If these losses are not brought back…

494
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,440
Lao Wen,

495
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,840
how about going
to the Scorpion Sect's base

496
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,120
and making a big mess?

497
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,320
Ah Xu, don't you know

498
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,040
what kind of person I am?

499
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,720
I enjoy making trouble.

500
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,560
Let's go.

501
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,160
There's nothing more enjoyable

502
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,320
than having fun.

503
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,560
CHONGWU PALACE

504
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,520
Chengling.

505
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,160
Xiaolian, why are you here?

506
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Are you all right?

507
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Don't cry, Xiaolian.

508
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,040
I'm fine.

509
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
Does it hurt?

510
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,200
Not at all.

511
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,240
It was an external wound.

512
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,520
That must be painful.

513
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,160
With the Glazed Armor stuffed
in your wound,

514
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,640
you still journeyed for miles
in that condition.

515
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,400
Don't worry.

516
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,800
The wound healed quickly
so I didn't feel the pain.

517
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,360
Chengling,

518
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,920
on behalf of my father, thank you.

519
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,080
I mean it.

520
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,680
My father is unyielding and inarticulate,

521
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,320
but I, as his daughter, know him best.

522
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,320
All these years,

523
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,040
he spent a lot of thought day and night

524
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,000
to get the five brothers back together

525
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,160
and to maintain the glory
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

526
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,440
Thank you for your trust.

527
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,640
-Xiaolian.
-I know what you're going to say.

528
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,120
That's what I thought.

529
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,600
I would rather have you as my brother

530
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,520
so that I can protect you forever.

531
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,120
But this matter is

532
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,280
an essential step for my father
to restore the Five Lakes Alliance.

533
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,600
Otherwise,

534
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,520
how could he tell the world
about his determination?

535
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,200
Xiaolian,

536
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,160
how could you see your marriage
as a chess move?

537
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,640
I have no other way
of helping to share my father's burden.

538
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,920
Let the misunderstandings
and grudges of the past

539
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,240
end in our generation.

540
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,120
Yueyang Sect will be your home
in the future.

541
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,440
Why is this dumb girl so confused?

542
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,440
Gu Xiang.

543
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I'm glad to see that you're safe.

544
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,680
So you've heard our words just now?

545
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,760
I came at the right time. I heard them.
How about you? Are you all right?

546
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,600
Is it my master who saved you?

547
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,480
Why did you come back now?

548
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,320
It was Master and Mr. Wen
who persuaded me to come back.

549
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,680
Master?

550
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,440
Did Zhou Xu take you as his disciple?

551
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,600
Congratulations! You're so lucky.

552
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,120
You finally have a strong backing
like Zhou Xu.

553
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,760
There are so many nice things.

554
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,160
Gao Chong is really generous to you.

555
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
For that little Glazed Armor?

556
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,240
It's almost like you gave birth to a child
for the Five Lakes Alliance.

557
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,360
Gu Xiang, don't make fun of me.

558
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,920
In fact, I want to save
all these supplements for you.

559
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,320
Have you recovered from the injuries

560
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,200
you sustained that night?

561
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,920
Thank you for protecting me.

562
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,920
So you still remember.

563
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,240
Don't worry. I'm fine.

564
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,920
SONGZHU COURTYARD

565
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,280
What does Master want?

566
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,000
He came out of the valley
in search of the Glazed Armor.

567
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,080
Why did he not care about anything
after meeting that Sick Man?

568
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,720
He only hangs out with him all day.

569
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,040
Maybe Zhou Xu drugged him?

570
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,320
How could he leave me in such a place
and not take care of me?

571
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,720
Even that fool named Cao
is better than him.

572
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,800
Why did I think of him?

573
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,600
That's bad.

574
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:12,240
PINE HALL

575
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,920
FIVE LAKES WORLD ALLIANCE

576
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,080
Gao Chong,

577
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,480
we've retrieved the Glazed Armor
of the Zhang family,

578
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,040
why are you still unhappy?

579
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,560
I'm wondering

580
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,160
who saved Chengling.

581
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,680
Is it an enemy or an ally?

582
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,400
Why won't he come to see me?

583
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,280
Since he sent back Chengling
and the Glazed Armor,

584
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,680
he must not be an enemy.

585
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,720
The two pieces of the Glazed Armor
of Zhao Jing and Taichong

586
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,040
must have been snatched away
by the Ghost Valley.

587
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,200
Where is your Glazed Armor, Shen Shen?

588
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,000
I've been carrying it with me
as you instructed.

589
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,000
From today onward,

590
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,400
let me keep it.

591
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
What's wrong?

592
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,680
No.

593
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,199
I'm thinking

594
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,199
whether it would be dangerous for you

595
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,880
to carry three pieces of it.

596
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,639
Even if the danger falls on me,

597
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:20,080
it is better than letting you face danger.

598
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,520
Give it to me.

599
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,199
Gao Chong. Shen Shen.

600
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,840
Zhao Jing, you're back.

601
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,280
Thank you for your hard work.

602
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,560
I'm sorry for worrying you.

603
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,880
But everything went well.

604
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,679
Although Mr. Long did not want to see me,

605
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,080
he promised to send someone
to the Heroes Conference

606
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,360
to explain the origin of the Glazed Armor.

607
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,280
It's good that
the Longyuan Cabinet will come.

608
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,720
Thank you, Zhao Jing.

609
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,280
Shen Shen, look at you.

610
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,400
If you had invited
Changming Sword Immortal,

611
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,520
Zhao Jing would not have
to go to the Longyuan Cabinet.

612
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,880
Gao Chong,

613
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,560
I took the Token of Honor
and shouted for days

614
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,400
in the Sword Hall of Mount Changming,

615
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,880
but no one responded to me.

616
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,560
There is no trace of human life
on that mountain.

617
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,320
I guess the Sword Immortal

618
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,400
would have died a long time ago.

619
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,360
Think about it,

620
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,720
how old would Rong Xuan be
if he were still alive?

621
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
Zhao Jing,

622
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,080
here is a piece of good news.

623
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,280
We found the Glazed Armor
of the Zhang family.

624
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,600
Congratulations!

625
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,400
Good things indeed come in pairs.

626
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,400
LICHUN PALACE

627
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,680
NOBLE REPUTATION

628
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,760
It's destroyed?

629
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,120
Right.

630
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,680
Is this the work
of the Five Lakes Alliance

631
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,000
or the Ghost Valley?

632
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,160
Don't overestimate them.

633
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,160
We've only been gone for a few hours.

634
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,320
How can either of them have the ability

635
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,520
to destroy a Scorpion Sect base instantly?

636
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,840
It looks like

637
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,200
someone is worried about the secret
of the Scorpion Sect being revealed.

638
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,880
They must have discovered
that the base was exposed,

639
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,800
so they destroyed
the place overnight themselves.

640
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,080
By themselves?

641
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,880
Although Changing Ghost is not smart,

642
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,120
his ambition is not small.

643
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,240
He has been working around me
all these years,

644
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,280
yet he could still collude
with the Scorpion Sect.

645
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,200
However, these idiots would never know

646
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,680
that the more they mess around,

647
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,560
the closer I am to my goal.

648
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,600
QINGYUN RESTAURANT

649
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,640
Ah Xu.

650
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,040
Master!

651
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,960
Master, are you looking for me?

652
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,760
Sick Man? Why are you still here?

653
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,280
What?

654
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,680
You don't approve of him

655
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,120
staying with me?

656
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
No.

657
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,200
Why would I?

658
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,800
It would be fine.

659
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,440
The Scorpion Sect woman hit you last time.

660
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,720
How are you doing now?

661
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,720
I'm fine.

662
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,320
Chengling was grateful

663
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,680
and gave me the supplements
that Gao Chong gave him.

664
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,000
I'll be fine after some rest.

665
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,600
I really didn't expect

666
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,120
the Scorpion Sect to blatantly sneak
into the Yueyang Sect to kidnap people.

667
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,760
That's really weird.

668
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,400
Maybe there's a spy.

669
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,440
Luckily,

670
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,760
after Chengling took the Glazed Armor
out of his body,

671
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,280
he's safe now.

672
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,200
Ah Xiang,

673
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,080
maybe you should not risk staying
in Yueyang Sect.

674
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,480
Make up a lie and leave.

675
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:55,440
Master, do you want me to go back
and serve you?

676
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,800
Ah Xu, do you mind her

677
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,440
following us?

678
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Of course not.

679
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,960
I'd love to have a beauty

680
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,960
with us.

681
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,040
No, I disagree.

682
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,960
I'll give you a break, Ah Xiang.

683
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,560
Just go anywhere you want to go.

684
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,720
I…

685
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,600
I don't want to go anywhere.

686
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,600
Master, I just want to stay
in the Yueyang Sect to protect Chengling.

687
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,240
You're going to pick up Chengling

688
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,960
after the Hero Conference, right?

689
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,920
So just in case,

690
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,480
please allow me to protect him.

691
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,840
He's stupid.

692
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,960
Who's there?

693
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,080
-Get out.
-Mr. Zhou,

694
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,720
it's me.

695
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,160
Cao Weining,
from the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

696
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,320
You…

697
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,600
Ah Xiang.

698
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,760
How can you not even know
there was someone following you?

699
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,760
-Cao Weining, are you following me?
-No, I don't dare.

700
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,720
I just heard from Zhu Yaozhi

701
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,680
that someone wrote to meet you here.

702
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,920
I thought it must be Mr. Wen,

703
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,640
so I felt a bit nervous and came with you.

704
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,760
Why are you nervous
about my master looking for me?

705
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,360
I'm afraid you'll leave.

706
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,120
So that's why she's not willing

707
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,520
to leave the Yueyang Sect.

708
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,280
Ah Xiang, so you decided to stay for me?

709
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,560
-Her words don't count.
-You--

710
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,120
I'll decide
whether she should leave or not.

711
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,320
Mr. Zhou,

712
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,720
Ah Xiang said you are seriously ill

713
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,600
and Mr. Wen is looking
for many doctors for you.

714
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,920
My master knows a lot of people.

715
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,680
There must be
competent doctors among them.

716
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,760
He'll be here in a few days
for the Heroes Conference.

717
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,240
I will introduce you two to him.

718
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,200
With his extensive knowledge,
he must have a solution.

719
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,440
I'll take care of Ah Xu,

720
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,800
so don't bother.

721
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,600
Thank you, Mr. Cao.

722
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,400
But to be honest,

723
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,160
I'm terminally ill
and don't have many days to live.

724
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,680
Thank you for your good intentions.

725
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,040
Mr. Zhou, I didn't expect you
to have such a serious illness.

726
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,560
It's a trick of fate.

727
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,600
A trick of fate.

728
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,840
But Mr. Zhou, there must be a way.

729
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,320
My master and Chief Gao are bosom friends.

730
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,240
I heard that
Chief Gao has a good relationship

731
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,040
with the three sages of the Healer Valley.

732
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,880
I can beg my master

733
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,000
to let him help you enter Healer Valley.

734
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,560
Things may still turn around.

735
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,720
You are such a warmhearted man.

736
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,080
You are a hero indeed.

737
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,320
I'm moved by your concern.

738
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,240
It's just that I'm a paranoid person.

739
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,960
Instead of wasting my time
seeking medical treatment,

740
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,120
I would rather carry a jug of wine

741
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,760
to travel around the world

742
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,160
with my soul mate while I am still healthy

743
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,320
and do whatever I want to do

744
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,520
without regret.

745
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,640
However,

746
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,880
since Ah Xiang is a girl,

747
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,280
it's inconvenient for her
to follow us around.

748
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,560
Today, we both happened to be discussing

749
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,720
if we could find
a trustworthy partner for her

750
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,200
so that she can settle down,

751
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,440
we will be relieved.

752
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,120
Mr. Zhou and Mr. Wen,

753
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,520
do you think

754
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,360
I'm trustworthy?
