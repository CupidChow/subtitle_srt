1
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,000
Master.

2
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,000
The repairs for
the Five Lakes Monument are going well.

3
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,320
When the Heroes Conference begins here,

4
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,560
the Five Lakes Monument will witness you

5
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,440
become the chief
of the martial arts world again.

6
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,720
It's true that "there's a legend
in the martial arts world."

7
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,920
Chief of the martial arts world?

8
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,640
I put in all this effort

9
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,640
just to protect
what our ancestors left us.

10
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,440
I don't care about what I gained or lost.

11
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,040
Yes.

12
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,200
Wen Kexing.

13
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,640
Why are you going crazy again?

14
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,040
I'm always crazy.

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,880
You're probably

16
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,440
more scared when I'm not.

17
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,960
Why did you suddenly kill

18
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
White Grim Reaper?

19
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,480
Why did you ask my girls

20
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,760
to spread half of the song
about Mount Qingya's Ghosts?

21
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,360
What are you planning actually?

22
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,120
Don't take tolerance as forgiveness.

23
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,000
Wen Kexing!

24
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,560
Chief, please don't be angry.

25
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,520
Master is mad because she cares.

26
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,760
We all care about you

27
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,920
and want to do our work better for you.

28
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,880
Qianqiao, get up.

29
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,920
You're scared of him, right?

30
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm not!

31
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,240
Tragicomic Ghost, leave.

32
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,600
I have orders
to give Beauty Ghost in private.

33
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,800
Wen Kexing.

34
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,400
Do you think you're powerful now?

35
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,160
Master.

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,960
Get up.

37
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,640
Chief.

38
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,760
I'd like to ask you
to forgive my master's rudeness.

39
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,960
All of your actions
have deeper intentions.

40
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,360
We just need to follow orders.

41
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,600
"Deeper intentions"?

42
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,920
I just suddenly wanted to kill someone.

43
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,000
What deeper intentions do I have?

44
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,280
Changing Ghost was unsatisfied
and was planning to revolt.

45
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,200
Killing his trusted subordinate,
White Grim Reaper,

46
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,440
is a warning to him.

47
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,200
Beauty Ghost.

48
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you know the outcome

49
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,840
of trying to guess
your master's intentions?

50
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,200
One only guesses a master's intentions
for one's own gain.

51
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,880
I am loyal

52
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,440
and only want to work
for you and my master.

53
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,560
I have nothing to hide.

54
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,920
Don't worry.

55
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,280
Everything is in my control.

56
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,080
I have something else for you to do.

57
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Yes, please go ahead.

58
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,960
Did you learn your transformation skills
from the Four Seasons Manor?

59
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,680
Yes.

60
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,200
Have you been there?

61
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,760
Never.

62
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,520
When I was little, I had an opportunity

63
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,680
to meet a martial arts master

64
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,080
and did him a little favor.

65
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,120
The senior pitied me for being disfigured,

66
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,920
so he taught me transformation skills.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,480
That's all.

68
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,440
That senior must've been the leader
of the Four Seasons Manor, Qin Huaizhang.

69
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,400
It was.

70
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,200
I heard that the Four Seasons Manor
has flowers that blossom year-round

71
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,360
and is very beautiful.

72
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,440
Since you and Qin Huaizhang
knew each other,

73
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,360
why didn't you go visit?

74
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
Since I am now part of the ghosts,

75
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,720
I won't reminisce about the prosperity
of the living world anymore.

76
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,920
I only want to be loyal to Ghost Valley

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,400
and you.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,080
That's right.

79
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,600
We are ghosts.

80
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,440
Ghosts disappear in the light.

81
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,960
YUEYANG SECT

82
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,520
The world is so vast.

83
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,400
I am now all alone

84
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,920
and can go anywhere.

85
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,760
Why would I stay here

86
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,480
and watch these fools put on an act?

87
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,240
Have I not seen enough before?

88
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,080
What did I spend

89
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
all these years for?

90
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,320
AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT,
COME TO THE NORTHERN GARDEN. FROM XU

91
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,080
Why are you sneaking around?

92
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,520
Iâ€¦

93
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,920
I was hungry and couldn't sleep,

94
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
so I went to look for food.

95
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,640
Is that not all right?

96
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,840
Yes, of course it is.

97
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,560
When you become
the chief of the Yueyang Sect,

98
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,520
you can do whatever you want.

99
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,960
But that's for the future.

100
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,280
What would you like to eat?

101
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,960
I'll tell the kitchen,

102
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,360
and you just wait in your room.

103
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,640
Don't trouble yourself.

104
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,320
I'll go and find some leftovers
in the kitchen.

105
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,160
If you don't go back,

106
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,200
I'll have to tell Master.

107
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,560
Gu Xiang? You are here too?

108
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,000
Why are you out
in the middle of the night?

109
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,360
Where are my master and Mr. Wen?

110
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,080
Didn't Master ask you to come to get me?

111
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,280
Get you?

112
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,880
Gu Xiang, I've seen him before.

113
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,920
He's an internal servant.

114
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,600
So he works for my master!

115
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,920
I'm here. Where is my master?

116
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,680
-How are you related to Beauty Ghost?
-None of your business!

117
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,160
Little idiot, hurry up and leave!

118
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,560
-Gu Xiang.
-Leave!

119
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,040
You little brat.

120
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,640
Gu Xiang!

121
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,000
DIECUI PAVILION

122
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,160
Chengling!

123
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,560
Qin Song, cover me!

124
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,480
CHONGWU PALACE

125
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,240
After all this time,
I ended up with nothing.

126
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,000
Zhou Zishu.

127
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,880
You always thought you were smart.

128
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,840
Did you try everything
to leave the Window of Heaven

129
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,720
just to drown to death in wine?

130
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,960
There are so many morons in this world.

131
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,080
Who could be more foolish than you?

132
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,040
Let go of me!

133
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,320
Chengling?

134
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,200
-How did it go? Find anything?
-No.

135
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,600
-Search over there.
-All right.

136
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,600
-You guys, go over there.
-The rest over here.

137
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,760
All right!

138
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,640
Mr. Wen.

139
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,840
We are searching for a thief.

141
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,600
Have you seen a man

142
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,720
holding a pi-pa?

143
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,560
He might not be holding it either.

144
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,160
You mean Phantom Musician Qin Song?

145
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Great! You know him.

146
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,720
This is what happened.

147
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,840
He and another thief

148
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,560
kidnapped our Young Master
Zhang Chengling.

149
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,440
We have asked the castellan
to lock the city.

150
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,320
Mr. Wen, please help us.

151
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,360
I advise you to read the situation

152
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,160
and tell me where the Glazed Armor is,

153
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,160
so you can stop getting tortured.

154
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,560
You tomboy.

155
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,960
Why can't you be more tender?

156
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,480
If a cute little boy like him

157
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,880
gets tortured,

158
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,320
he won't be handsome anymore.

159
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,600
Little boy, does it hurt?

160
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,960
Do you want me to blow on it?

161
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,360
You disgusting woman, don't touch me!

162
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,560
But I want to touch you.

163
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,720
Damn it.
Those dogs are following so closely.

164
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,840
Why aren't the three of them
coming to my aid?

165
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,400
Where did your friends take him?

166
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,520
Are you going to tell me,

167
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,320
or do you want me to squeeze
the answer out of you?

168
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,400
Little boy, can you tell us now?

169
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,760
Just kill me!

170
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,600
You want to die before telling us
where the Glazed Armor is?

171
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,160
Baby, killing you
would be doing you a favor.

172
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,680
I have over 100 ways

173
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,120
to make you feel worse than death.

174
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,160
Are you done?

175
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,040
You frivolous woman.

176
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,200
Master doesn't have the patience

177
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,680
for you to use all 100 methods.

178
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,240
This boy looks weak,

179
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,960
but he's quite stubborn.

180
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,960
Are you forcing me to use my real powers?

181
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,120
He's such a little brat.

182
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,440
If you accidentally kill him,
we're both going to die.

183
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,400
Leave him.

184
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,480
Let me do it.

185
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,280
Go and see why it's taking so long
for Monster Jiang

186
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,200
to meet with Qin Song.

187
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,840
I'm not going.

188
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,120
I don't care what happens to those two.

189
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,760
I want to see

190
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,960
what kind of skills you have.

191
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,840
Bring me a pail of water

192
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,040
and a stack of Xuan paper.

193
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,240
Your hand for playing pi-pa

194
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,480
is now destroyed.

195
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,760
I met another tough man before

196
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,280
and asked him the same question.

197
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,480
He also wouldn't answer.

198
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,400
I had no choice,

199
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,760
but to crush

200
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,400
his bones inch by inch

201
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,200
and slowly squeeze the answer out of him.

202
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,920
My father told me

203
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,520
that the human body contains 206 bones.

204
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,319
When I got to the 80th bone,

205
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,920
that tough man answered.

206
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,400
Qin Song.

207
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,440
Tell me right now

208
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,839
where your friends took the boy!

209
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,560
How is it?

210
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,440
I don't need your delicate
and weak torture skills.

211
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,960
A pail of water and a stack of paper.

212
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,160
I have yet to meet a man

213
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,160
who can withstand this water torture!

214
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,280
I admire you,

215
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,760
Tomboy.

216
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,120
No wonder one has to be cruel
to be successful.

217
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,640
Compared to you,

218
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,520
I'm truly not as skilled.

219
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,720
Do you want to tell us now?

220
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,240
I'll tell you.

221
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,640
The Glazed Armorâ€¦

222
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,760
The Glazed Armorâ€¦

223
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,040
What did you say?

224
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,480
Use all of your other torture methods.

225
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,240
Let's see if I can bear them.

226
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,640
My father is the Hero of Mirror Lake,
Zhang Yusen.

227
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,840
None of his sons is a coward!

228
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,840
Who are you?

229
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,480
How dare you attack the Four Assassins?

230
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,920
A bunch of stinky scorpions
doesn't deserve to know my name.

231
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,160
You know about the Scorpion Sect?

232
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,400
I do.

233
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,240
I am your ancestor!

234
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,640
Master!

235
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,280
Why did you come back alone?
Where is Qin Song?

236
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,680
I couldn't find Qin Song!

237
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,360
These stupid nail wounds.

238
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,800
I can't drag out this battle.

239
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,200
I need to finish it fast.

240
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,840
-Why is this bastard here?
-Stop talking. Kill him first!

241
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,040
Master!

242
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,680
Who are you?

243
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,680
Since you know about the Scorpion Sect,

244
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,840
you must also know

245
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,360
that no one can stop the Scorpion King
from killing whoever he wants

246
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,200
and getting whatever he wants.

247
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,240
What a coincidence.

248
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,720
No one can stop me from killing who I want

249
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,440
and getting what I want either.

250
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,360
Monster Jiang!

251
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Master!

252
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,920
Don't worry, I'm here.

253
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,120
He is almost tired out.

254
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,400
Let's attack together!

255
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Capture him alive.

256
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,120
I'm going to get my sweet revenge

257
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,720
for Qin Song and Monster Jiang.

258
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,160
Handsome boy.

259
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,800
Let me show you

260
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,560
what it feels like
to want to die more than to live.

261
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,760
Mr. Wen!

262
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,120
Who hurt you?

263
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,040
Mr. Wen, they kidnapped me

264
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,080
and hurt my master.

265
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,400
Don't follow them.

266
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,640
-We have to get Chengling out of here.
-No.

267
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,720
I will destroy whoever hurt you!

268
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,880
Let's go.

269
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,880
Master.

270
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
What are those?

271
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,920
Don't be scared.

272
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,080
Take Chengling and go.

273
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,480
It's fine if you don't go.

274
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,280
Dying together with you

275
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,040
is also a fine ending.

276
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,600
Who wants to die with you?

277
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,640
In life and death will you never part.

278
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,520
What a touching moment.

279
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,680
I'm glad to have you.

280
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,600
I'm sorry for not welcoming you earlier.

281
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,080
These two bastards

282
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,320
were the ones that killed
Monster Jiang and Qin Song!

283
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,880
You lost and disgraced me,

284
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,800
yet you're not embarrassed to complain?

285
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,680
Chief Zhou.

286
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,520
Are you not going to introduce

287
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,600
your best friend?

288
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,960
Who are you?

289
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,920
Why did you kidnap Chengling?

290
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,120
I can tell you

291
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,960
who I am,

292
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,680
but you have to tell me who you are first.

293
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,120
Let's wager a bet.

294
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,760
The person who loses
should tell the person who wins

295
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,360
his true identity.

296
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,480
He's even more talkative than you.

297
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,880
Your Majesty, who are they?

298
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,640
A leader of the Window of Heaven

299
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,800
and a leader of the Devils.

300
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,040
Ghost Chief?

301
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,120
How did those two devils

302
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,240
end up together?

303
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,640
PROFOUND EXPECTATIONS

304
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,560
Gao Chong.

305
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,400
Everything's fine. Don't be too anxious.

306
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,080
The Four Assassins

307
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,080
definitely took a risk to kidnap Chengling

308
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,280
in order to find out
where the Glazed Armor is.

309
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,920
As long as he keeps quiet,

310
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,720
his life won't be in danger.

311
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,000
Enough.

312
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,560
Master and Mr. Wen.

313
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,880
You both came to save me.

314
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,960
Gu Xiang was right.

315
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,160
You didn't leave me behind!

316
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,840
Little idiot.

317
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,880
You call me Mr. Wen

318
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,080
and him Master.

319
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,200
You make it sound like
I'm younger than him.

320
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,000
Am I not older than you?

321
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,040
The Four Assassins tortured you,
but you didn't even cry.

322
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,800
Why are you crying after seeing us?

323
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,720
All right, act like a man.

324
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,560
They tortured me,
but I'd rather die than give in.

325
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,440
Only when I saw you, Iâ€¦

326
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,160
Master. Mr. Wen.

327
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,640
I have so many things to tell you.

328
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,080
It smells delicious.

329
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,000
Ah Xu.

330
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,880
Chengling, you're hungry, right?

331
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,600
You should eat first.

332
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,920
Master, I know

333
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,320
that only you guys
are sincerely kind to me.

334
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,360
Little idiot.

335
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,120
Don't your uncles treat you well too?

336
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,000
I heard that Gao Chong even wanted
to betroth his only daughter to you.

337
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,160
I don't have any daughters,

338
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,200
just Ah Xiang.

339
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,480
I don't really care,

340
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,920
but I'm afraid
you won't be able to handle her.

341
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,760
They just want the Glazed Armor,

342
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,600
and never actually cared about me

343
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,520
or my family's revenge.

344
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,080
In the beginning,

345
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,560
I thought they truly saw me
as their nephew.

346
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,320
But I realized later

347
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,360
that they never even treated
my father as a real brother,

348
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,800
much less me.

349
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,440
Little idiot, what do you mean?

350
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,560
Mr. Gao isn't worried
about getting revenge at all.

351
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,040
Instead, he's using that as an excuse
to carry on with his Heroes Conference.

352
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,280
Ever since I came to the Yueyang Sect,

353
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,880
nobody has truly cared about me

354
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,840
or asked what I wanted.

355
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,360
What do you want then?

356
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,640
I want to learn martial arts.

357
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,440
I want to get revenge.

358
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,360
I don't want
to be a useless child anymore,

359
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,600
waiting for others
to sacrifice themselves to protect me.

360
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,720
I also want to continue
the Mirror Lake Sect's heritage.

361
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,640
That is the wish
of my father and brothers.

362
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Chengling,

363
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,240
did something happen that caused

364
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,000
your strong suspicions
of the Five Lakes Alliance?

365
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,160
Do you want to tell us?

366
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,480
Eat first. There's no rush to tell us.

367
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
No.

368
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,960
Master and Mr. Wen.

369
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,880
The day my family was killed,

370
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,280
my father didn't have time to tell me much

371
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,360
except for one thing.

372
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,800
"Never trust anyone,

373
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,080
no one is trustworthy."

374
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,680
But Master and Mr. Wen,

375
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,800
I trust you.

376
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,960
Foolish child.

377
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,920
Don't rush to trust anyone.

378
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,440
Master, I should've trusted you
from the beginning.

379
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,000
Back then, the fisherman didn't know

380
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,720
what happened
between my father and the alliance,

381
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,160
so he wanted to take me to Mr. Zhao.

382
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,400
I didn't know what to do
and whom to believe.

383
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,800
Master, I'm sorry.

384
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,520
I should've trusted you
from the beginning.

385
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,920
I have the Glazed Armor with me.

386
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,760
My father was in a rush,

387
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,840
and thus he cut my stomach

388
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,080
to hide it in there.

389
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,480
The wound healed

390
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,120
and it has been with me since.

391
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,360
I'll take it out for you now!

392
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,800
Little idiot.

393
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,920
Did I say I wanted it?

394
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,280
Little idiot, why are you in a rush?

395
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,520
You should talk slower
and take time to get to know someone.

396
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,040
Your father must've been careful

397
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,240
because he guessed

398
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,360
that even if Mr. Li brought you safely

399
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,080
to his brothers
in the Five Lakes Alliance,

400
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,560
they would still carefully search you.

401
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,320
It seems like

402
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,320
he lost trust in his brothers
a long time ago.

403
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,800
Yes.

404
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,120
Other people don't know,

405
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,320
but they've been at odds for many years.

406
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,560
Do you know
why their relationship turned sour?

407
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,080
I know. He gave me a letter.

408
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,240
Where is the letter?

409
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,800
I hid it under the Buddha statue
in the abandoned temple.

410
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,200
I thought you were an idiot,

411
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,360
but who knew you're quite crafty?

412
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,000
You even managed to hide it
in that situation?

413
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,000
My father said

414
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,320
that besides the receiver,

415
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,280
no one else can have the letter.

416
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,720
I didn't know what to do,

417
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,120
so I hid it when I went to the restroom.

418
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,640
I figured

419
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,720
that worst comes to worst,

420
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,520
I can at least
tell the receiver in person.

421
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,520
Who is the receiver?

422
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,400
Do you remember what it said?

423
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,280
The letter is for
the Changming Sword Immortal.

424
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,720
The letter mostly said

425
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,320
that the Five Lakes brothers,
Gao, Zhao, Lu, Zhang, and Shen

426
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,920
were all friends with Mr. Rong Xuan.

427
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,080
Mr. Rong became evil

428
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,280
because of a mistake
the five of them made.

429
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,720
Once, the six of them
had a sword battle after arguing over

430
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,000
the Combined Six Cultivation Method.

431
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,320
Mr. Rong won the battle,
but was heavily poisoned

432
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,480
and went crazy.

433
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Someone had put poison on the sword.

434
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,400
And then?

435
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,520
Mr. Rong became possessed and went crazy.

436
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,880
The five of them
should have been responsible,

437
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,560
but no one stood up for Mr. Rong

438
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,240
when he was attacked
by other martial artists.

439
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,040
My father was going to go to Mount Qingya
and fight to the death with Mr. Rong,

440
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,800
but his master broke his legs

441
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,960
and locked him up

442
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,600
until it was too late.

443
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,680
He could only regret living.

444
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,240
Who was the one
that put poison on his sword?

445
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,480
I don't know.

446
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,040
But the sword belonged to Mr. Gao.

450
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,080
I lost your son.

451
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,720
I waited for 20 years

452
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,120
to uncover the truth,

453
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,080
but I only heard

454
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,240
about death after death.

457
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,600
Chief of the Five Lakes Alliance,
Supreme Chief of the Martial Arts World?

458
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,960
Those are just titles!

459
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,360
I explained to them,

460
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,600
but who truly understands

461
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,880
what I'm thinking?

462
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,960
It's fine if they don't believe me,

463
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,240
but why didn't you believe me?

but you are all dead.

You must've met again

477
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,160
in the netherworld by now.

478
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,120
You're scolding me now, right?

479
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,440
Go ahead

480
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,360
and scold me then.

481
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
Ah Xu.

482
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,480
Let me have some wine.

483
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,840
Give it to him.

484
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,320
Master.

485
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,280
Mr. Wen.

486
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,960
Did both of you argue?

487
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Don't be mad anymore.

488
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,440
There's nothing
that friends can't resolve.

489
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,520
Mr. Wen, hurry up and comfort my master.

490
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,040
He looks cold on the surface,

491
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,760
but his heart is softer than others.

492
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,480
He'll be fine after you comfort him.

493
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,840
Didn't you teach me,

494
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,840
-"Tough women can't resist clingy men"?
-Shut up.

495
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,040
What nonsense did you teach him?

496
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,120
Who's softhearted?

497
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,160
You brat. You are speaking nonsense.

498
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,600
Master, I know.

499
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,640
You are the most softhearted.

500
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,000
Tell me. How did Mr. Wen upset you?

501
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,000
I'll apologize on his behalf.
Don't be mad at each other anymore.

502
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,280
All right.

503
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,240
Yueyang Sect is heavily guarded.

504
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,800
How did the Four Assassins kidnap you?

505
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,720
Iâ€¦

506
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,040
I received a letter telling me

507
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,880
to go for a chat at the lotus pond
at midnight.

508
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,080
Gu Xiang helped me
avoid the guards along the way.

509
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,720
Master.

510
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,080
The letter was signed with "Xu,"
so I believed it.

511
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,960
Was it not from you?

512
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,880
Of course not.

513
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,880
The world is dangerous right now.

514
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,520
The Yueyang Sect
is the safest place for you to stay.

515
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,720
Is your internal injury acting up again?

516
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,640
Internal injury? What injury?

517
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,480
Master, what's wrong?

518
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,680
Right.

519
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,640
If it wasn't for this internal injury,
how would I get a chance

520
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,440
to help a master like Ah Xu?

521
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,440
Chengling.

522
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,320
Did you know
that when I first saw your master,

523
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,720
I could tell
he had transformed his appearance

524
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,800
by his exceptional build?

525
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
There must be a world-class master

526
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,200
under the mask of a sick man.

527
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,880
Stop boasting.

528
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,680
How am I boasting?

529
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,640
My skill at recognizing people
by their build

530
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,360
is truly amazing.

531
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,160
Mr. Wen, you're so cool.

532
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,000
I never knew that Master
transformed his appearance.

533
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,800
In my entire life,

534
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,120
I've never made a mistake.

535
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,680
Many years ago,

536
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,840
I saw a dead body.

537
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,120
The hair was a mess

538
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,480
and the face was covered in blood.

539
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,120
A long spear was stuck
from the front of its chest to its back.

540
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,160
By looking

541
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,040
at the shoulder blades in detail,

542
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,080
I realized that this person
was a rare beauty when she was alive.

543
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,480
Guess what happened after?

544
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,000
We should let the past stay in the past.

545
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,680
My condolences.

546
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,120
Lao Wen,

547
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,080
who are you actually?

548
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,800
Who am I?

549
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,680
I am Philanthropist Wen,

550
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,320
doing kind deeds for good karma,
and helping the poor and the weak.

551
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,560
I'm kind and wealthy,
with many beauties around

552
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,320
which I shall never reject.

553
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,280
Master.

554
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,560
Please drink some.

555
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,120
Chengling.

556
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,840
Do you sincerely want me
to be your master?

557
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,160
Yes, Master.

558
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,200
You and I barely know each other,

559
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,520
but you trust me fully.

560
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,360
I can only repay you with sincerity.

561
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,360
But let me tell you who I really am first,

562
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,640
and then you can decide.

563
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,960
My real name is Zhou Zishu.

564
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,840
I am the current leader
of the Four Seasons Manor,

565
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,000
and also the last.

566
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,720
The previous leader, Qin Huaizhang,

567
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,160
was my beloved master.

568
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,320
Our clan used to be well-known

569
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,200
for our flowers
that blossomed in all seasons

570
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,160
and knowing everything in the world.

571
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,040
But now, there are not many left
in the martial arts world

572
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,760
that know about Four Seasons Manor.

573
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,520
It's all because of my one mistake

574
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,080
and helplessness.

575
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,800
When I was 16,

576
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,280
my master suddenly passed away.

577
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,960
I couldn't save the reputation
of the Four Seasons Manor,

578
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,040
so I took the skilled disciples
of our clan

579
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,160
to follow Jin's Military Governor,

580
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,080
whom the Zhou family
had served for generations

581
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,360
and founded the Window of Heaven.

582
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,560
I didn't expect

583
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,840
that all of the fellow disciples
from the Manor

584
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,240
would become slaves to power.

585
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,360
All 81 previous followers of the Manor

586
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,440
slowly died one by one,

587
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,040
until I was the only one left.

588
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,720
So "Chief Zhou" refers to the leader
of the Window of Heaven?

589
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,520
Yes.

590
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,600
This is why the Scorpion Sect knows me

591
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,080
and how I know where their base is.

592
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,720
Master.

593
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,800
Scorpion Sect?

594
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,280
What's the Scorpion Sect?

595
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,920
It's an assassin organization.

596
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,760
They are rooted in Jiangnan

597
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,320
and are highly secretive.

598
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,120
The Four Assassins that kidnapped you

599
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,880
are one of Scorpion Sect's trump cards.

600
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,280
But they have much more power than that.

601
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,280
Previously, the Window of Heaven
wanted to spread our presence to Jiangnan

602
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,440
and had a few conflicts with them.

603
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,480
The Scorpion Sect's power
in Jiangnan is no less

604
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,800
than the Window of Heaven's power
in the Northwest.

605
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,560
So is your Window of Heaven
also an assassin organization?

606
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,800
It's not my Window of Heaven anymore.

607
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,960
Right now,

608
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,680
I am just a normal person.

609
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,800
I spent half of my life alone,

610
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,760
doing things against my will

611
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,400
and killing people I didn't want to.

612
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,360
I wanted to wander the world until I die,

613
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,880
but it seems like the heavens
have other plans

614
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,440
for my destiny.

615
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,200
Now that you know who I am,

616
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,080
do you still want me as your master?

617
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,280
I do. Of course I do!

618
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,560
Master, regardless of
whether or not you accept me,

619
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,920
I've thought of you as my master
since long ago.

620
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,560
Little idiot.

621
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,080
Since you have decided,
hurry up and finish the formalities.

622
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
Kowtow. Hurry up.

623
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,200
Master, please accept my bow.

624
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,760
All right.

625
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,600
Now that you are in the clan,

626
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,400
you are the first disciple
of the sixth generation.

627
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,720
With a superb disciple like you,

628
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,320
the Manor's heritage will live on.

629
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,840
Iâ€¦

630
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,480
I am very happy.

631
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,160
Thank you, Master.

632
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,280
Master, I'm very happy too.

633
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,360
I'm extremely happy.
