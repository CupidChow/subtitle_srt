Excuse me. Is your manager there?

Hi, I'm the manager.

36
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,750
How can I help you?

37
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,030
Hi,

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,470
I'm Mr. Gu An's

39
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,440
lawyer.

40
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,630
Mr. Gu An?

41
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,190
Gu Xiao's father.

42
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,960
Gu Xiao has

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,080
pledged the shop

44
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,830
due to capital chain break.

45
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,080
I'm here to take it back.

46
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,390
Gu Xiao has pledged the shop?

47
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,830
That's right.

48
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,160
Here is the document.

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,550
It has Mr. Gu Xiao's signature on it.

50
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,910
Please take a look.

51
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,080
So what?

52
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,720
I'm also the owner of this shop.

53
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,630
You haven't asked me yet.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,800
Lawyer, right?

55
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,720
I have a lawyer, too!

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,390
If you have any questions,

57
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,520
please talk to my lawyer.

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,190
Thanks.

59
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,190
Miss Xiao,

60
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,270
you didn't invest in this shop.

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,720
Legally,

62
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,230
this shop doesn't belong to you.

63
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,640
Where is Gu Xiao?

64
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,040
Ask him to see me in person.

65
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,350
Gu Xiao has gone abroad.

66
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Gone abroad?

67
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,230
Yes.

68
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,550
But don't worry,

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,480
he has got you

70
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,790
a well-paid job.

71
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,780
(Huaqing University Library)

72
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,320
Oh right.

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,040
I heard that

74
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,480
there will be an exhibition

75
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
of Hayao Miyazaki in two days.

76
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,070
Okay.

77
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,790
Let's go see it together.

78
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,440
Yin Xi.

79
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,640
I've been

80
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,640
looking for a chance to tell you.

81
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,110
I have applied for an internship

82
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,880
in Shanghai.

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,720
I'll go to work

84
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,110
in Shanghai after graduation.

85
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,070
What does this have to do with me?

86
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,880
No.

87
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,320
No.

88
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,350
I just

89
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,230
want you to know.

90
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,510
I know it now.

91
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,820
(Push)

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,790
What's wrong, Shao Jiang?

93
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,200
An Fei wants to know,

94
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,070
if you have finished

95
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,070
your visa application.

96
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,230
Working on it.

97
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,270
Zhixiao,

98
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,790
you don't want to go to Germany, do you?

99
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,390
Is there any other reason?

100
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,070
Shao Jiang,

101
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,230
did An Fei come to China

102
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,320
because of you?

103
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,950
Yes.

104
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,200
I came back for a tour,

105
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,070
so she came with me.

106
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,830
Then why does she

107
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,830
speak Chinese so well?

108
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,640
Why do you suddenly ask this?

109
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,230
I'm just curious.

110
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,000
I asked her

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,230
the same question before.

112
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,440
She said she studied Chinese for me

113
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,600
when she was in Germany.

114
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
She used to go to my concerts

115
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,160
when she was in school.

116
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,510
So she wanted to be

117
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,510
my agent.

118
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,000
Love at first sight.

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So romantic.

120
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,760
But she followed you

121
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,550
all the way to a foreign country,

122
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,920
doesn't she miss home?

123
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,760
She does.

124
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,580
(I like you.)

125
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,040
(An Fei once told me)

126
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,110
(a German poem.)

127
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,230
(My Heart Is Lost.)

128
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,440
(In Chinese it means,)

129
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,920
(my heart is lost.)

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,470
(Since her heart is lost here,)

131
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,000
(Me too.)
(what's the point of going back?)

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,540
(Me too.)

133
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,670
(Me too.)
(Why be so hard on herself?)

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,670
Hello.

135
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,230
An Fei.

136
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,760
You have finished the document?

137
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,590
Give it to me.

138
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,400
Sorry.

139
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,880
I'm here to tell you that

140
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,640
I can't go to Germany.

141
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,150
Why?

142
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,400
Just like you.

143
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,150
Body is gone,

144
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,470
but heart is still here.

145
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,760
I understand.

146
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,520
Good luck.

147
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,670
Thanks for understanding.

148
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,160
(Doctor-patient disputes
continue to ferment…)

149
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,980
(in Huaqing University
First Affiliated Hospital.)

150
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,610
(As the discussion continues,
social attention has been attracted.)

151
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,260
(It's said that the doctor involved
may lose his medical license.)

152
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,820
(In-patient)

153
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,620
(Huaqing University
First Affiliated Hospital)

154
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,440
Du,

155
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,030
where is Gu Wei's

156
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,880
(Nurse Station)
car accident patient?

157
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,030
Here.

158
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,760
Zhixiao…

159
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,230
It wasn't easy.

160
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,230
Excuse me.

161
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,400
Can I have

162
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,520
a few minutes with you?

163
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,000
Who are you?

164
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:16,760
I'm here

165
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,000
because of Dr. Gu.

166
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,150
I know.

167
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,000
Since when it happened,

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,150
you've heard a lot of

169
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,760
what I'm about to say from others,

170
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,760
and you might have been tired of it.

171
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,910
Good if you know.

172
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,000
Then what are you doing here?

173
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,350
Because I'm a family member

174
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,960
of a patient just like you.

175
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,230
Don't worry,

176
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,230
I'm not here to play tricks

177
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,520
with you.

178
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,200
I won't change

179
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,710
any of your thoughts.

180
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,400
It's just that I'm stuck

181
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,110
with some words.

182
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,640
If I don't say it,

183
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,910
I'll regret it

184
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,670
for the rest of my life.

185
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,150
Miss,

186
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,150
what do you want to say?

187
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,400
Actually in the beginning,

188
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,470
like you,

189
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,640
I had a deep

190
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,790
misunderstanding of Dr. Gu.

191
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,710
Forgot to tell you,

192
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,350
Dr. Gu is my father's

193
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,280
chief surgeon.

194
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,280
My father was diagnosed of
stomach cancer.

195
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,670
When we first came to the hospital,

196
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,200
he did all the tests

197
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,590
and results have shown that

198
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,910
he just had a stomach ulcer.

199
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,760
But only Dr. Gu insisted

200
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,230
that he had cancer.

201
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,150
I didn't believe this result.

202
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,400
I felt the same

203
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,030
as you.

204
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,030
I hated him.

205
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,470
I called him a quack,

206
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,590
a liar.

207
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,520
I was bad at him.

208
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,230
I gave him a hard time.

209
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,200
As if

210
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,760
my father could be saved

211
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,200
only if Dr. Gu changed his diagnosis.

212
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,200
Under all of this pressure,

213
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,670
he was still

214
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,400
persistent to his conclusion.

215
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,760
It was just because of his persistence

216
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,710
that my father was finally diagnosed

217
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,880
with stomach cancer.

218
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,000
It was Dr. Gu

219
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,080
who saved my father.

220
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,470
He saved my father's life.

221
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,470
I learned later

222
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,640
that as a surgeon,

223
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,520
it's not

224
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,150
his responsibility

225
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,910
to diagnose the patient.

226
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,110
At that time,

227
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,400
he not only had to face

228
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,960
the doubts from all of us outsiders,

229
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,030
but also the pressure

230
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,000
from the hospital.

231
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,880
Dr. Gu is

232
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,440
not a perfect person.

233
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,030
He is weak sometimes.

234
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,670
He runs away.

235
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,880
And sometimes,

236
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,110
he is very proud.

237
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,110
He keeps everything

238
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,550
to himself and doesn't say it.

239
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,670
He hurts himself

240
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,440
as well as others.

241
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,640
But as a doctor,

242
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,520
he is the best

243
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,710
in my heart.

244
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,350
Not because of

245
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,760
his superb medical skills,

246
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,000
but his wholehearted dedication

247
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,760
to his patients,

248
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,960
even at the cost of his interests.

249
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,710
It was Dr. Gu who taught me,

250
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,280
and who taught

251
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
many other people,

252
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,000
what is staying true
to the original heart.

253
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,400
Have you ever thought that

254
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,790
maybe for many other people,

255
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,470
or other young doctors,

256
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,150
Dr. Gu is their belief.

257
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,350
If because of this,

258
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,960
Dr. Gu can no longer

259
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,910
be a doctor,

260
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,760
I think…

261
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,640
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,880
Sorry for the interruption.

263
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,400
Lin Zhixiao, come with me.

264
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,150
No.

265
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,150
What are you doing?

266
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,000
I haven't finished yet.

267
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,670
I have heard of it.

268
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,520
It's enough.

269
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,960
It's no use,

270
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,790
bro.

271
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,670
I want them to hear it,

272
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,320
okay?

273
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,000
I want to make it clear.

274
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,670
Zhixiao.

275
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,440
Do you know

276
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,320
what's going on right now?

277
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,840
I do.

278
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,400
Do you know

279
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,520
this is your last chance?

280
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:48,880
I do.

281
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,520
Do you know

282
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,550
what the consequences are?

283
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,280
I do.

284
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,760
No, you don't.

285
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,670
If you do,

286
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,880
you wouldn't be standing here.

287
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,150
You come with me

288
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,960
and make it clear with them.

289
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,000
Zhixiao.

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,030
What now?

291
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,590
You're done asking, right?

292
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,230
Now it's my turn.

293
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,280
Whether I can be a doctor

294
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,230
is my business.

295
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,640
You are already going abroad,

296
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,710
why are you here today?

297
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,150
You care about me, don't you?

298
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,760
No.

299
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,150
You're worried about me, aren't you?

300
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,150
I said no.

301
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,280
Don't feel so good about yourself.

302
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,110
Okay?

303
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,350
You can't leave me, can you?

304
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,200
Like I said,

305
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,030
no, no, no!

306
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,440
I don't want you to be wronged,

307
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,080
okay?

308
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,670
Are you happy with this answer?

309
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,400
Can you come with me now?

310
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,440
No need.

311
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,790
What do you mean?

312
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
I don't know

313
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,350
where you heard the news.

314
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,910
They've dropped the case.

315
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,320
The results of the investigation

316
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,520
also showed that it was not my fault.

317
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Don't you know it?

318
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,110
What should I do, Zhixiao?

319
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,000
I think I have a cold

320
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,110
this time.

321
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,670
Still pretending?

322
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,670
No, I'm not.

323
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,670
You have to take care of me.

324
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,320
I hate you!

325
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,640
Still working?

326
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,840
Dr. Gao.

327
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,710
Thanks to you this time.

328
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,230
No, um…

329
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,840
It was Gu Wei's

330
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,350
bad luck this time.

331
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,710
Any one of us

332
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,950
can be in bad luck next time, right?

333
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,760
I just think,

334
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,830
we're

335
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,950
a team.

336
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,350
So

337
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,350
we have to stick together.

338
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,110
Right?

339
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,880
Do…do you have anything else?

340
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,040
No. See you.

341
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Do you think I can forgive you

342
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,590
if you pretend to be sick?

343
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,680
You're sick,

344
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,950
why didn't you tell me earlier?

345
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,640
You're happy seeing me

346
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
worry about you, right?

347
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,520
Sorry.

348
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,640
What?

349
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,230
Zhixiao,

350
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,040
you lose weight, don't you.

351
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,710
Stop flattering me.

352
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,470
I don't lose weight.

353
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,590
I've gained a few pounds.

354
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,680
Really.

355
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,070
Your knees are bony.

356
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,430
Everyone's knees

357
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,430
are bony.

358
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,710
So are yours.

359
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,920
What about your hip bone?

360
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,190
Are you touching a human

361
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,230
skeleton model?

362
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,470
What?

363
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,400
It wasn't easy for you these days.

364
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,470
Good if you know.

365
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,520
Zhixiao.

366
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,520
I used to think that

367
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,680
if I love someone, I must protect her.

368
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,310
I should not let her

369
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,950
suffer, even a little bit.

370
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,350
When I saw what you did

371
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,760
for me today,

372
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,680
I understand that,

373
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,430
two people have to

374
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,310
support each other

375
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,190
so they can move on.

376
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,430
Do you still remember

377
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,590
I told you that

378
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,400
how I envy Mr. Lin

379
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,310
and Auntie Li,

380
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,680
how they support each other.

381
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,310
No one in my family has ever

382
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,190
taught me this.

383
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,160
Since my childhood,

384
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,560
my parents only asked me to learn

385
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,590
to take responsibility

386
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,070
and not to cause trouble
for someone else.

387
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,710
But today I found out that…

388
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,760
there are exceptions, too.

389
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,470
Because…

390
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,350
Because I

391
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,800
haven't taken you as someone else.

392
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:20,880
Zhixiao,

393
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,310
you are my family.

394
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,230
I thought about what you

395
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,070
said to me that day.

396
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,230
You said we don't know

397
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,160
each other very well,

398
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,590
we are not able to…

399
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,590
What did you just say?

400
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,640
You said we are family, right?

401
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,160
How could you take

402
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,400
family quarrel so seriously?

403
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,830
Let me ask you a question.

404
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,400
How did you feel

405
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,040
during breakup?

406
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,800
Couldn't feel too good, okay?

407
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,430
I'm teasing you.

408
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,710
I don't want to experience

409
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,160
this again.

410
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,640
So you mean…

411
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,520
We're good now?

412
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,800
It depends.

413
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,800
What about Germany?

414
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,280
I'm not going.

415
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,350
Don't be proud.

416
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:40,920
I'm not going to Germany

417
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,070
not because of you.

418
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,110
It's because

419
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,830
of Mr. Lin,

420
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,000
okay?

421
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,070
I promise

422
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,920
I won't feel good about myself again.

423
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,040
I won't think

424
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,830
you stay at home because of me,

425
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,800
okay?

426
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,160
But seriously,

427
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,040
even if…

428
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,190
I mean if

429
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,950
you can't be a doctor,

430
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,920
I'll always be there

431
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,800
by your side.

432
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,100
(Huaqing University
First Affiliated Hospital)

433
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,860
(Statement on Dr. Gu Wei's
Doctor-patient Dispute)

434
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,760
So this is now

435
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,430
completely resolved?

436
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,950
There is no problem at all.

437
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Really?

438
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,070
My dear Dr. Gu.

439
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,430
So you can continue

440
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,230
to be a doctor, right?

441
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,520
I'm so happy for you!

442
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,880
Lin Zhixiao,

443
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,110
I'm going to faint if you
shake like this.

444
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,950
Like this?

445
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,160
What about this?

446
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,680
Morning.

447
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,160
Good morning.

448
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,950
Good morning.

449
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,070
I remember your sleeping posture

450
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,400
was quite normal before.

451
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,190
What's wrong with you now?

452
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,430
What's wrong with this posture?

453
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,310
You're like holding a pillow.

454
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,800
You're my girlfriend.

455
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,430
I can hold however I like.

456
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,680
Okay, okay.

457
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,070
What's up?

458
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,880
It doesn't feel real.

459
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,400
Holding you

460
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
and waking up with you,

461
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,880
it's like a dream.

462
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,920
Before I'm

463
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,000
with you,

464
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,160
I dreamed it

465
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,520
when you are asleep.

466
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,590
And then?

467
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,040
Then I woke up.

468
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,070
Why?

469
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,950
You didn't belong to me at that time.

470
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,040
The better I dreamed of it,

471
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,640
the more upset I will be
when I wake up.

472
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,710
How could I have thought that

473
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,280
you would be lying beside me now?

474
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,070
No, I'm done.

475
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,190
I have to go back.

476
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,950
If Mr. Lin and Ms. Li

477
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,520
find out,

478
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,560
I'll be dead.

479
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,880
I have to go.

480
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,040
Why are you

481
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,950
a little bit like

482
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,070
those rhetoric liars

483
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,280
in TV shows?

484
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,880
What are you saying?

485
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,560
Stop it, okay?

486
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,760
I have to go.

487
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,640
I don't allow it.

488
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,800
If Ms. Li and Mr. Lin

489
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,040
find me here,

490
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,040
it would be too late

491
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,280
if I'm not going home.

492
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,040
No.

493
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,400
The fever is gone.

494
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,880
Why are you still so clingy?

495
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,640
Lin Zhixiao,

496
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,070
it's your birthday tomorrow.

497
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,520
This is your first birthday

498
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,830
since we were together.

499
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,310
I ordered a restaurant.

500
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,590
We'll celebrate it together.

501
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,280
Are you sure you won't be

502
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,430
working overtime tomorrow?

503
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,070
I promise you.

504
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,950
I'll show up on time.

505
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,110
Even if I got the most urgent surgery…

506
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,040
I'll ask Yan Bingjun for help.

507
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,190
Then Dr. Yan would be so pathetic.

508
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,280
I really have to go.

509
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,590
By the way,

510
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,920
I put the key on the table.

511
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:32,830
You take it.

512
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,880
Come whenever you miss me.

513
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:42,880
See you.

514
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,520
Hello?

515
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,470
Hello.

516
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,920
I'm all set.

517
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,760
Ready to go.

518
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,520
How about you?

519
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,280
I said

520
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,560
I won't work overtime today.

521
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,880
And I'm

522
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,160
already in the restaurant.

523
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,070
Good.

524
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,280
You have kept your promise.

525
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,190
Be careful on the way. No need to hurry.

526
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,000
I'll wait for you.

527
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,110
See you later.

528
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,470
See you later.

529
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,760
The cake I ordered, is it ready?

530
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,160
Yes, it is.

531
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,640
It will be served as a dessert.

532
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,800
Besides,

533
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,070
the birthday music

534
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,040
is also ready.

535
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,560
It's the cello piece specified by you.

536
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,280
Thanks.

537
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,710
Zhixiao.

538
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,760
Come and sit.

539
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,190
This is…

540
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,040
How are there so many

541
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,310
delicious dishes today?

542
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,760
What do you think?

543
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,920
Have you forgotten your birthday?

544
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Little birthday girl.

545
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,040
We remember it.

546
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,800
Are you going out?

547
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,710
I'm going to have dinner

548
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,880
with friends.

549
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,070
With whom?

550
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,110
Sansan and Yin Xi.

551
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,800
They want to celebrate my birthday.

552
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,310
Good.

553
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,280
Here are so many dishes,

554
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,590
why don't you ask them over?

555
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,590
No need.

556
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,190
Sansan is so afraid of Mr. Lin,

557
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,350
how dare she come?

558
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,400
Still afraid of me?

559
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,920
Okay.

560
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,800
Now that you have an appointment,
go then.

561
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,040
Ms. Li has made

562
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,000
so many dishes,

563
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,230
how can I just leave?

564
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,520
I'll eat.

565
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,280
I'll stay and eat.

566
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,830
But you said you were going to

567
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,760
meet up with friends.

568
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,880
What about Sansan and Yin Xi?

569
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,590
It's okay,

570
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,800
I'll send them a message.

571
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,710
I'll tell them.

572
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,230
- Okay.
- Come.

573
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,230
Let's eat.

574
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,230
Have some soup.

575
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,230
Let me do it.

576
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,460
(I'm sorry, I'll be late. My parents
suddenly want to celebrate my birthday.)

577
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,900
(It's okay, stay with your family.
I'll wait for you.)

578
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:56,920
Ms. Li,

579
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,830
today's soup

580
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,920
is really good.

581
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,270
(It's okay, stay with your family.
I'll wait for you.)

582
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,190
I'm so happy.

583
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,110
Come, dear.

584
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,310
So many delicious.

585
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,560
They are all your favorite.

586
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,950
Happy Birthday.

587
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,230
My precious.

588
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,800
- Come.
- Thank you, Ms. Li.

589
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,830
Two kinds of meat dishes.

590
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,110
Stop explaining, let's just eat.

591
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,230
You're getting more professional.

592
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,000
Really.

593
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,590
This fish is delicious.

594
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,640
I can't eat anymore. I'm stuffed.

595
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm full.

596
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,070
Um…

597
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,560
Wait a minute, one more surprise.

598
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,830
What surprise?

599
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,560
No hurry.

600
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,920
No hurry.

601
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,680
♪Happy birthday to you!♪

602
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,430
♪Happy birthday to you!♪

603
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,280
You've got me

604
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,040
a cake?

605
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,430
Yeah.

606
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,070
- Your dad…
- Birthday cake.

607
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,590
…bought it for you.

608
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:33,920
Come.

609
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
This cake is popular

610
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,520
on the Internet.

611
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,350
Oh yeah?

612
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,640
My little princess.

613
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,070
So beautiful.

614
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,350
Make a wish. Make a wish.

615
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,070
Okay, okay.

616
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,680
No, no.

617
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,520
What is the lighter?

618
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,430
Go get the lighter.

619
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,160
Light it up first.

620
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,000
You have thrown

621
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
all the lighters.

622
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,680
I'll go buy it downstairs.

623
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,430
No need.

624
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,110
Don't bother.

625
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,160
No need for a lighter.

626
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
I've grown up.

627
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
I don't need that anymore.

628
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,280
I just want the two of you

629
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,160
to stay with me.

630
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,000
Okay.

631
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,800
Then make a wish.

632
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Well,

633
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,590
how to make a wish without candles?

634
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
We don't need candles

635
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,400
to make a wish.

636
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
It's okay.

637
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,400
We don't need candles.

638
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,350
I'm making a wish now.

639
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,230
I'm done.

640
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,560
I wish that

641
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,430
all of us

642
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,160
be healthy

643
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,350
and be together forever.

644
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,680
All right.

645
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,400
Let's eat the cake. I'll cut it.

646
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,000
Okay, here.

647
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,310
The first piece is for Ms. Li.

648
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,680
Today is my birthday,

649
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,000
but also Ms. Li's suffering day.

650
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,280
I want to cut a big piece

651
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,070
for our Ms. Li.

652
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,230
Good girl.

653
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,160
Is it okay? This big?

654
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,350
Yes, yes.

655
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,680
Come.

656
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,760
Here you go.

657
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,920
Thanks.

658
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,400
Mr. Lin,

659
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,760
you can't eat too much.

660
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,400
Just have a taste.

661
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
A small piece for you, okay?

662
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,350
Why?

663
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,760
Your stomach is not good.

664
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,160
This is it.

665
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,070
You can't eat more.

666
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,160
Tasty.

667
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,070
The rest is all mine.

668
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,640
Can you eat up?

669
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,350

Yes.

772
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,950

what happened last time.

773
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,360
Dr. Gu is not that kind of person.

774

777
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,190
I have thought it through.

778
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,390
I didn't make up with him

779

Why are you sleeping here?

798
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,280
I was downstairs just now

799
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,760
and saw no light in the house.

800
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,230
I thought no one was here.

801
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,190
I waited for you

802
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,470
and then I fell asleep.

803
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,080
What's wrong?

804
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,470
I used to think

805
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,630
this house isn't my home
because it was rented,

806
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,360
but now I finally feel at home.

807
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,870

808
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,080
I miss you.

809
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,710
I know.

810
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,910
You know?

811
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,760
Why don't you say

812
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,600
you miss me, too?

813
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,430
I miss you so much.

814
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
Did you hear it?

815
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,040
Hear what?

816
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,280
My heartbeat just

817
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,430
stopped for a second.

818
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,230
Then you may have

819
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,040
second-degree atrioventricular block.

820
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,390
Or

821
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,840
premature cardiac beats.

822
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,040
Look,

823
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,000
I'll take you to the hospital

824
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,950
tomorrow morning to test.

825
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,950
I'll prescribe you

826
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,040
some heart rate stabilizer.

827
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,120
You're still my Dr. Gu,

828

833

It's me who should say sorry.

835
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,670
since the two of us are together,

836
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,390
but I can't

837

838
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,360
No.

839
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,710

It's still my birthday.

841
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,230
Tell me,

842
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,150
how do you want to celebrate it?

843
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,710
I think,

844
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:16,190
just like this, the two of us,

845

848
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,190

852
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:52,910
I used to think

853
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,150
you looked very handsome

854
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,190
in white gown.

855
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,430
Never thought

856
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:57,950
you are more handsome in an apron.

857
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,040
This handsome man

858
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,320
is yours.

859
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,460
What is most important

860
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,540
=The Oath of Love=
for a couple?

861

862
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,580
Trust.

863
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,260
Don't pretend to play cute.

864
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,980
You know what I mean.

865
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:28,500
Okay.

866
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,260
You look beautiful.

867
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,700
No ugly perspective.
