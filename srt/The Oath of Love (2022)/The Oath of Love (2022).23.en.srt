18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
Sansan, you've grown up.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,040
This is the first time

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,830
I've heard you say

21
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,230
you like someone.

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,550
Hush, keep it down.

23
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,190
He will get cocky

24
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,040
if he hears it.

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,510
Okay, I won't say it.

26
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,510
I won't say it.

27
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,480
Two million is a lot of money.

28
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,000
It's about a lifetime savings

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,040
for an ordinary family.

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,230
Why should I compare with them?

31
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,870
And I'm gonna

32
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,760
pay back him the two million

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,400
next week.

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,040
This cafe will have nothing

35
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,080
to do with him.

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,680
I'm giving it all to Sansan.

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,590
It's none of his business.

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,360
How much do you make

39
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,830
a month in this cafe?

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Can you make the ends meet?

41
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,310
I've got other ways to make money.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,680
I mean,

43
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,160
my dad looks down upon me,

44
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,520
I can't let

45
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,600
my girlfriend do it too.

46
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,800
And Sansan told me,

47
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,550
something is going wrong
with their business.

48
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,670
I told her I'll support her.

49
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,080
This cafe

50
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,270
is all hers.

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,030
Including the money she earned.

52
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,360
She would be thrilled.

53
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,520
Other ways?

54
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,110
Uncle found you

55
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,030
other business?

56
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,440
Let it go, Gu Wei.

57
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,030
You should make a plan

58
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,240
about your life in Germany.

59
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,630
Um…

60
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,750
Don't let Lin Zhixiao

61
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,110
tie you down.

62
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,800
Stop talking nonsense.

63
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,080
Just mind your own business.
Let's go back.

64
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,830
Let's go.

65
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,830
I just think that

66
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,270
I'm so happy

67
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,830
to meet

68
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,360
my dear Dr. Gu.

69
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,520
You really should

70
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,670
thank me for it.

71
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,440
Yeah.

72
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,630
It was the spring extravaganza.

73
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,830
Mr. Lin and Ms. Li did not come.

74
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,270
I was upset and

75
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,800
went to the bar with you.

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,390
Then Mr. Lin

77
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,360
came in anger

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,520
to grab you back.

79
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,390
And he…

80
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,720
He called Gu Wei...

81
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,270
- lecher.
- Lecher.

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,910
Here comes the lecher.

83
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,110
What are you

84
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,880
so happy about?

85
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,000
Not you.

86
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,470
We were talking about

87
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,830
the funny story of your brother

88
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,110
meeting Mr. Lin in the bar
for the first time.

89
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,720
Funny story?

90
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,670
Lecher.

91
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,520
Lecher.

92
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,440
Speaking of this,

93
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,750
are you taking him

94
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,270
to see Mr. Lin

95
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,160
this weekend?

96
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,880
Yes.

97
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,670
No dad loves

98
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,240
his son-in-law.

99
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,520
Good luck, Gu Wei.

100
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,800
Don't scare him.

101
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,110
Don't gloat over it.

102
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,720
That day would come to you

103
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,910
sooner or later.

104
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,390
I can't wait for it.

105
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,110
I don't know when

106
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,750
someone would give me

107
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,750
this chance.

108
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,910
Nice try.

109
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
Are you nervous?

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,270
A little bit, actually.

111
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,550
A little bit?

112
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,360
Can you tell me

113
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,440
what does Mr. Lin like

114
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,470
and what he doesn't?

115
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,000
I can tell you that.

116
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,470
Mr. Lin doesn't have much to like.

117
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,030
But I

118
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,910
can tell you

119
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,830
some no-nos.

120
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,270
Sansan,

121
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,470
stop bragging.

122
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,750
You can talk about it till tomorrow.

123
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,000
There are too many.

124
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,670
No.

125
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,880
First of all, he needs to memorize

126
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,600
our high school rules.

127
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,110
If he can't,

128
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,110
he will have to run 20 laps

129
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,510
in the community.

130
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,950
20 laps!

131
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,510
Yeah, this is it!

132
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,070
Wei.

133
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,640
Are you scared?

134
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,950
Can you memorize it or not?

135
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,640
Are you kidding?

136
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,070
I have good physical strength,

137
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,670
and better memory.

138
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,390
Right?

139
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,040
Give him a break.

140
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,600
It's okay. It's okay.

141
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,000
Who…

142
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,790
- All right.
- How could you scare me?

143
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,670
Okay, here's to

144
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,160
my brother's good luck...

145
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,830
In seeing...

146
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,670
...his father-in-law.

147
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,790
Shall we?

148
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,510
Sure.

149
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,160
Thanks, Gu Xiao.

150
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,670
Give me some.

151
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,350
Not too much.

152
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,160
I know.

153
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,830
Cheers!

154
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,230
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

155
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,070
Go for it!

156
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,160
Aren't you coming in?

157
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,760
Mr. Lin has been

158
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,110
merciful to you,

159
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,230
but if he finds out

160
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,390
that I go home with you at night,

161
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,830
he will not spare us.

162
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,790
Come in.

163
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
I have something to show you.

164
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,420
(World Map)

165
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,100
(Germany)

166
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,440
You have really

167
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,230
surprised me being so girly.

168
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
I'll pin you here.

169
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,480
So you won't be

170
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,640
going anywhere.

171
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,880
But,

172
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,320
I also want to go to

173
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,790
Europe,

174
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,160
Africa,

175
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,160
Antarctica,

176
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,390
Oceania.

177
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,920
There are a lot of places I want to go.

178
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,640
I know,

179
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,950
you have that

180
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,880
in your cello shell.

181
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,720
Tokyo, Paris,

182
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,040
and Mexico.

183
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,950
Do you have any plans to go anywhere?

184
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,350
No plans.

185
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,920
It's busy being a doctor.

186
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,350
I have no time or chances

187
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,230
to travel.

188
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,830
But wherever you want to go,

189
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,270
I want to go with you.

190
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,550
Well,

191
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,230
let's make Germany our first stop,

192
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,480
shall we?

193
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,820
(Mr. Lin)

194
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,390
It's Mr. Lin.

195
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,040
You know

196
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,070
what he will do

197
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,000
if I go back late.

198
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,320
See you then?

199
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,760
Okay.

200
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,270
You have to miss me.

201
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,760
Just go.

202
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,440
Bye.

203
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,540
(Africa)

204
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,940
(Antarctica)

205
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,540
(North America)

206
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,060
(World Map)

207
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,030
Hello? What is it?

208
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,840
(What kind of doctor is he?)

209
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,790
(Not professional at all.)

210
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,840
(We have been so many places)

211
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,550
(for so many years.)

212
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,590
(We have seen too many)

213
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,670
(hospitals and doctors.)

214
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,030
(This is murder!)

215
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,670
(Okay?)

216
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,200
(Please calm down.)

217
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,280
(Have some water.)

218
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,200
He is here.

219
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,910
Come.

220
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,710
This is the patient's

221
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,840
chief surgeon,

222
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,470
Gu Wei.

223
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,280
You did the surgery, didn't you?

224
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,790
Good.

225
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,880
Can you explain

226
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,030
why did you cut

227
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,150
my son's organ

228
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,790
without our permission?

229
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,110
Please calm down.

230
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,470
This was the only way

231
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,910
to keep him alive.

232
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,150
He couldn't wait.

233
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,350
He needed immediate operation.

234
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,200
Don't get so excited.
Sit down and talk slowly.

235
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,110
I have explained it to you.

236
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,320
The pancreatic tail and

237
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,320
splenectomy surgery

238
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,230
was the only way

239
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,550
to save his life

240
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,400
at that moment.

241
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,550
There was no other way.

242
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,440
Dr. Gu had lost

243
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,200
contact with you

244
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,150
before the surgery.

245
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,320
But he did the operations

246
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,790
in accordance with the relevant

247
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,640
provisions of the Medical Law.

248
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,000
Dr. Gu also reported to the medical

249
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,760
department at the first time.

250
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,550
So programmatically,

251
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,400
there is no problem.

252
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,080
Excuse!

253
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,280
You are together!

254
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,280
You are the president,
and he is the doctor.

255
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,320
You're just covering for him.

256
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,640
Please watch your tongue.

257
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,110
We have a complete

258
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,110
disease record.

259
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,960
Okay.

260
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,880
Tell me,

261
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,150
why is my son

262
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,280
still in danger?

263
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,110
Why is he still in the ICU?

264
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,320
Pancreatic tail and
splenectomy surgery

265
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,670
is a major surgery.

266
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,150
The patient also suffered

267
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,280
other organ damages

268
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,550
caused by the car accident.

269
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,110
It all takes time

270
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,110
to recover.

271
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,590
He's right, Mr. Tang.

272
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,910
The patients'

273
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,280
recovery time

274
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,670
after major surgery

275
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,590
varies from

276
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,710
person to person.

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,640
So, don't worry about it.

278
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,590
I'm telling you,

279
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,280
I came here today

280
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,640
to give you a warning.

281
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,200
If my son is fine,

282
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,280
we will be good.

283
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,670
If…

284
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,280
If anything

285
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,590
happens to him,

286
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,150
you're not going away with it!

287
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,280
You can't do this!

288
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,110
Just wait and see!

289
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,670
Let's go.

290
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,440
Gu Wei.

291
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,670
Don't feel bad

292
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,640
about this.

293
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,280
I can understand

294
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,670
their feelings.

295
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,760
I just…

296
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,280
I know.

297
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,080
It's a high-risk occupation

298
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
being a doctor.

299
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,910
Good if you think so.

300
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,470
It will be fine.

301
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,230
Zhixiao.

302
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,760
Hey.

303
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,110
Sorry, I'm late.

304
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,280
I've got caught up by things

305
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,080
at work.

306
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,670
That's all right.
I just got here myself.

307
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,760
Have you figured out

308
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,880
what to buy for them?

309
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,280
Ms. Li likes you.

310
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,880
A silk scarf will be just fine.

311
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,760
What about Mr. Lin?

312
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,280
I have thought about it.

313
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,880
Mr. Lin likes to drink tea.

314
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,670
Let's buy him some good tea.

315
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,520
What do you think?

316
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Okay. You decide.

317
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,760
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

318
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,960
What?

319
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,280
Do you think Mr. Lin would like

320
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,760
this set of teapots?

321
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,080
No.

322
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,710
Let's check on others.

323
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,760
Good taste, Miss.

324
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,760
This set of teapots

325
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,400
was specially chosen

326
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,000
and bought from Yixing by our boss.

327
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,080
It was made by a master.

328
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,230
The best quality.

329
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,030
(Purple clay teapots: 5,200 Yuan)
It's the perfect gift

330
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,030
(Purple clay teapots: 5,200 Yuan)
for the elders.

331
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,110
I think it's good.

332
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,640
Please pack it up.

333
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,640
Will do immediately.

334
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,760
No need.

335
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,080
This is too expensive.

336
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:34,960
It's fine.

337
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,550
Doctors are not well paid,

338
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,910
but I do have some savings.

339
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,550
And,

340
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,880
considering Mr. Lin's special status,

341
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,280
I'm worried that

342
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,960
this is not enough.

343
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,640
Don't worry.

344
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,080
He would love

345
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,440
this gift.

346
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,110
Good.

347
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,280
Your phone.

348
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,710
Zhixiao, look.

349
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,760
Can you go pay for it?

350
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,960
The password is your birthday.

351
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,910
I need to take this call.

352
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,470
Hi, Du.

353
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,230
(Dr. Gu, the patient
has got complications.)

354
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,790
(You need to come back quickly.)

355
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,280
What?

356
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,400
Don't hurry.

357
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,280
Tell me slowly.

358
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,760
I see.

359
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,400
I'll be right back.

360
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,400
Whatever it is,

361
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,280
wait for me to come back.

362
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,150
What is it?

363
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,590
Did anything happen in the hospital?

364
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,080
Nothing.

365
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,030
Just daily emergencies.

366
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,030
You know it.

367
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,000
But Zhixiao,

368
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,030
I can't have dinner

369
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,030
with you tonight.

370
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,550
It's okay.

371
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,280
Work matters most.

372
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,710
Just go back.

373
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,960
Good girl.

374
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,760
- Give it to me.
- It's done.

375
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,110
I have to go.

376
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,440
And these two.

377
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Be careful.

378
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,660
(In-patient)

379
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,670
Now the patient's family are

380
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,640
extremely unstable.

381
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,640
We have to stop it

382
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,710
before it gets worse.

383
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,520
Or it will affect your work and future.

384
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
So I'm thinking,

385
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,880
I should ask Yan
to take care of this patient.

386
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,400
You don't need to
worry about it anymore.

387
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,550
I know there is

388
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,790
nothing wrong with my surgery.

389
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,710
But…

390
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,550
But seeing these complications,

391
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,320
I…

392
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,230
You don't have to blame yourself.

393
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,520
You have done

394
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,790
your best.

395
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,790
It's normal that the patient's family

396
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,110
don't understand.

397
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,590
I will

398
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,440
explain to the Committee.

399
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,110
Thanks, Mr. Gao.

400
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,030
By the way, Mr. Gao.

401
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,880
There is one more thing

402
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,960
I'd like to ask.

403
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,710
Go ahead.

404
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,230
I need a certificate
issued by the hospital

405
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,960
to apply for a visa to Germany.

406
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,280
But I have not

407
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
received it yet.

408
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,200
About this,

409
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,910
I planned to wait for a few more days

410
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,910
to tell you.

411
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,710
Looks like I can't go.

412
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,200
But it doesn't matter.

413
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,110
You are still young.

414
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,550
Once this issue

415
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,440
is resolved,

416
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,110
you will have a lot of chances.

417
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,520
Gu,

418
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,230
there are things

419
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,440
that I can do nothing about.

420
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,200
Please understand.

421
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,910
I understand.

422
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,640
Hi, Mom.

423
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,760
You said you're

424
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,280
sending back the stuff

425
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,280
that you are not bringing

426
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
to Germany today.

427
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,470
(At what time?)

428
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,160
(There are emergencies
in the hospital.)

429
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,520
(I have to go this afternoon.)

430
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,280
I canceled it.

431
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,400
Canceled?

432
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,760
I'm not going to Germany.

433
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,040
Mom,

434
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,000
I'll explain you later.

435
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,830
I have to go.

436
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,760
Your little cutie

437
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,110
suddenly appears in front of you.

438
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,920
Are you happy?

439
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,310
So cold.

440
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,920
What's that face?

441
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,590
You look horrified seeing me.

442
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,070
Don't worry.

443
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,880
Mr. Lin is strict on me,

444
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,760
but I have rich experience

445
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,230
fighting against him.

446
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,310
It will be fine.

447
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,350
Tonight is

448
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,590
important to you.

449
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,520
I need to come over

450
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,430
to cheer you on.

451
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,430
Cheer up! My dear Dr. Gu.

452
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,310
Dr. Gu.

453
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,640
Cheer up!

454
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,590
How is your packing?

455
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,230
Show me.

456
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,590
What's wrong?

457
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,070
We're going to have

458
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,350
our own life in Germany, are we?

459
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,710
Why haven't you packed
your books yet?

460
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,230
I see.

461
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,560
You're leaving this chance to me.

462
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,070
Are you?

463
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,560
No problem.

464
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,560
I'll help you.

465
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,430
Pack all of them,

466
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,110
right?

467
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,350
Stay there.

468
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,760
Leave it to me.

469
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,230
I'll handle all these.

470
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,830
These books are so thick.

471
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,880
Even thicker than
my Oxford Dictionary.

472
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,950
But I'm a capable wife.

473
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,070
Are you gonna move

474
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,760
the whole house to Germany?

475
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,110
I'll finish soon.

476
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,280
One more left.

477
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,950
One minute.

478
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,950
Does it hurt?

479
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,680
Yes.

480
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,880
Very much.

481
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,400
I feel dizzy, too.

482
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,350
I'm done.

483
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,070
I guess

484
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,000
I've got a concussion.

485
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,310
One plus one equals?

486
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,640
Three.

487
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,880
Oh no. You become stupid.

488
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,400
I can't be stupid.

489
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,160
If I'm stupid,

490
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,640
you will like other little girls.

491
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,110
When we get to Germany,

492
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,640
I'll take all your books

493
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,880
and put them beneath the table legs,

494
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,520
sink or something, okay?

495
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,760
Zhixiao,

496
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,000
about Germany…

497
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,160
I set an alarm.

498
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,760
I'm going to sign the contract
this afternoon.

499
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,640
In case I'll be late.

500
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,680
I really have to go.

501
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,950
Or I'll be late.

502
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,430
See you.

503
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,040
You just said Germany,

504
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,310
what about it?

505
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,070
What about Germany?

506
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,070
Nothing.

507
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,520
I'll tell you next time.

508
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:33,800
By the way,

509
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,040
read all the terms carefully

510
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,710
when you sign the contract.

511
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,640
Got it, my dear.

512
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,640
Wish you good luck tonight.

513
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,680
(Now the patient's family are)

514
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,760
(extremely unstable.)

515
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,640
(We have to stop it)

516
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,760
(before it gets worse.)

517
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,590
(Or it will affect your work
and future.)

518
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
The medical department has
approved it.

519
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,520
Anesthesiologist, get prepared.

520
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,760
Start the surgery.

521
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,590
(Don't blame yourself.)

522
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,880
(You have done)

523
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,000
(your best.)

524
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,160
(I will explain to the Committee.)

525
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,590
(By the way, Mr. Gao.)

526
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,400
(I need a certificate
issued by the hospital)

527
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,880
(to apply for a visa to Germany.)

528
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,830
(But I have not received it yet.)

529
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,020
(Germany)

530
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,190
Hi, Du. What's going on?

531
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,830
Dr. Gu, come back, quickly.

532
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,640
Tell me slowly. What happened?

533
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,710
The medical affairs department

534
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,590
has set up an investigation team

535
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,680
for the patient's

536
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,000
medical record.

537
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,590
They have questioned
Vice President Gao too.

538
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,040
It's getting out of hand.

539
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,760
Just check Weibo.

540
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,680
Okay, I'll check.

541
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,640
Call you later.

542
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,310
Don't worry.

543
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,310
Congratulations!

544
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,590
Thanks.

545
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,880
We are all very optimistic

546
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,070
about your potential.

547
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,830
We will grow together.

548
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,230
Thanks.

549
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,430
I will not

550
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,710
let you down.

551
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,800
Good.

552
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,280
Can we have dinner later

553
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,000
with Shao Jiang?

554
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,470
He will tell you about

555
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,070
the precautions living in Germany.

556
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,640
Sorry,

557
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,190
I have other arrangements.

558
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,710
I'm afraid I can't

559
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,880
have dinner with you tonight.

560
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,230
It's okay. Let's find another time.

561
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,280
Of course.

562
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,740
(The unscrupulous doctor was exposed.)

563
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,690
(The patient's family claimed that
Dr. Gu had medical accidents history)

564
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,980
(and had his mentor killed.)

565
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,110
(What kind of doctor is that?)

566
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,950
(How did he get)

567
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,760
(his doctor's license?)

568
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,590
(He's not qualified to be a doctor!)

569
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,430
(He's not even qualified)

570
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,000
(to be a human!)

571
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,230
(What medical skills
has he got to save people?)

572
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:34,950
(Give us an explanation!)

573
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:35,230
(Agreed!)

574
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,190
(How can there be someone like this?)

575
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,110
(How can he become a doctor?)

576
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,920
(We need an explanation!)

577
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,950
(Give us an explanation!)

578
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,920
(Yeah!)

579
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,000
(Give us an explanation!)

580
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,010
(Murder by an unscrupulous doctor!)
(The doctor is fully responsible!)

581
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,010
(Did he do this to revenge?)
(What kind of unscrupulous hospital is this?)

582
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,010
(Evil doctor. So scary!)
(Evil-minded doctor murdered good people.)

583
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,020
(They have to pay!)
(They had medical malpractices before?)

584
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,300
(Send him to the court!)

585
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,740
(In-patient)

586
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,470
Believe it or not,

587
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,920
I'll make you disappear
in the medical industry!

588
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,920
I know everything about you.

589
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,190
I spread those news

590
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,590
on the Internet.

591
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,710
You're a quack.

592
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,070
You even killed your

593
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,800
own mentor!

594
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,110
How dare you

595
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,280
be a doctor here?

596
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,400
Why hasn't my son

597
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,110
woken up yet?

598
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,520
Say something!

599
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,040
So you've admitted it.

600
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,680
I know

601
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,680
you have someone back you up

602
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,640
in this hospital.

603
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,830
So you can do

604
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,760
whatever you want.

605
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,190
You don't have to take responsibility

606
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,680
even people die from your operation!

607
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,430
Am I right?

608
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,430
Admit it,

609
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,400
Vice President Gao
is your father-in-law.

610
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,920
You can do whatever you want!

611
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,350
Can you tell me,

612
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,230
what do you want?

613
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,310
Who are you?

614
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,310
I am Gao Xi,

615
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,950
the daughter of Vice President
Gao Boyang.

616
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,800
What?

617
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,070
Nothing is going on

618
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,760
between me and Dr. Gu.

619
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,800
We're just colleagues.

620
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,040
You two spread rumors in the hospital.

621
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,230
I can sue you if I want.

622
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,000
Go to the meeting.

623
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,640
Don't go!

624
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,400
Okay.

625
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,430
I believe you are

626
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,590
the daughter of Vice President Gao.

627
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:30,830
Dr. Gao,

628
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,710
we will wait for

629
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,350
an explanation.

630
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,110
Don't try to bluff me.

631
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,470
Let's go.

632
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,340
(Benevolent and Kindhearted)

633
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,590
This conversation is only between us.

634
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,310
We can't rule out

635
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,230
the other plans they're up to.

636
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,160
They don't understand it

637
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,830
medically.

638
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,190
No matter what we say,

639
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,880
they won't trust us anymore.

640
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,680
Now the headache is,

641
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,760
they spread this

642
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,710
all over the Internet.

643
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,880
It has attracted publicity,

644
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,710
causing a very bad social impact.

645
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,920
A special investigation team

646
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,110
has been set up in the hospital.

647
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,710
I've just been told that

648
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,040
the health commission
is sending someone

649
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,920
to investigate this matter.

650
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,880
So now the most

651
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,070
sensitive and scary thing

652
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,110
is the influence of public opinion.

653
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,020
(Unknown number)
(How did you become a doctor?)

654
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,420
(Aren't you afraid of retribution?
For patients who trusted you so much...)

655
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:40,940
(What were you thinking?
How can you do such a thing?)

656
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,500
(Where is your conscience?)

657
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,010
(Are you raised to do such a thing?)

658
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,000
Gu, how about,

659
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,800
you stop surgeries and

660
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,470
clinical practice for a while?

661
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,520
So you're suspending me?

662
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,430
We have no choice.

663
00:27:59,230 --> 00:27:59,950
This is

664
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,470
for your own good.

665
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,800
For how long?

666
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,760
So this seems to be indefinite?

667
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,350
Until the investigation is finished.

668
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,950
I have an operation tomorrow

669
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,830
for bed No.25.

670
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,880
At least let me finish

671
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,640
this operation.

672
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,230
Okay.

673
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,230
Dr. Gu.

674
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,400
Um…

675
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,880
I have heard about it.

676
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,070
Are you okay?

677
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,920
Is everything all right?

678
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,000
Don't worry.

679
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,680
Tomorrow's operation will

680
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,590
be proceeded as usual.

681
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,560
Here is the thing, Dr. Gu.

682
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,560
You must be in a bad mood

683
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,350
for so many things during this time,

684
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,470
and you need to rest, right?

685
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,230
Don't worry about this.

686
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,640
I'll do my best

687
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,950
for the operation.

688
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,110
That's not what I meant.

689
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,560
Let me get this straight.

690
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,920
We had thought about it.

691
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,070
We want to change the surgeon.

692
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,040
I… I see.

693
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,280
If so,

694
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,000
I will talk

695
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,400
to the hospital.

696
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,950
Thanks.

697
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,000
Thank you.

698
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,590
Gu Wei.

699
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,000
What can I do for you?

700
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,830
What can you do for me?

701
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,230
You've heard of it.

702
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,230
What can you do?

703
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,680
We will figure this out.

704
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,520
There's nothing wrong
with your surgery.

705
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,560
They want to investigate it, so be it.

706
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,950
I'll help you find evidence.

707
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,160
Gao Xi.

708
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,160
What do you think

709
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,830
are we trying to persist

710
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,160
for so long?

711
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,950
I feel like what we're sticking to

712
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,280
is like a joke.

713
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,190
What are you saying?

714
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,400
Trust me,

715
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,830
this won't

716
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,430
go to the worst in the end.

717
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,680
Don't lose heart.

718
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,190
Go to the worst.

719
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,520
Do you remember

720
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,710
what our mentor once told us?

721
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,950
For a doctor,

722
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,920
professional reputation
and medical career

723
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,310
are more important than his life.

724
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,640
My patient doesn't

725
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,880
trust me anymore.

726
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,310
You told me it won't go to the worst?

727
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,800
Isn't this the worst?

728
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,640
I'm sorry.

729
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,400
I want to be alone.

730
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,900
(A doctor's life is for others,
not for himself.)

731
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,570
(Don't think about ease, nor care about
fame and fortune. Save lives always.)

732
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,900
(Keep marching forward. Stay true to
the original self. By Liang Zhou)

733
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,040
(Family has filed a lawsuit.)

734
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,190
(The hospital's lawyer is
under negotiation with them.)

735
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,520
(You should stop operations and)

736
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,920
(clinical practice for the moment.)

737
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,830
(We have no choice.)

738
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,880
(This is)

739
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,160
(for your own good.)

740
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,520
(The subscriber you dialed)

741
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,230
(cannot be connected
for the moment.)

742
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,110
(Please redial later.)

743
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,070
Just you?

744
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:41,760
Where is Gu Wei?

745
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,520
Gu Wei should be busy at the hospital.

746
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,160
He'll be here soon.

747
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,920
What…

748
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,400
What is this about?

749
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,280
What?

750
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,590
Is it really necessary to be so formal?

751
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,350
What's bad to be formal?

752
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,400
I mean,

753
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,590
you look funny in this.

754
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,350
Really.

755
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,880
Take it off.

756
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,160
Take the suit off.

757
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,230
Just the shirt inside is fine.

758
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,400
You…

759
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,520
I don't care it's funny or not.

760
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,190
I mean it.

761
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,520
The contract.

762
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,920
I've got it today.

763
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,560
Congratulations.

764
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,830
Congratulations?

765
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,470
You're really like my boss

766
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,520
wearing this to congratulate me.

767
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,520
Of course.

768
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,470
Zhixiao,

769
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,000
you're back.

770
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,640
Yeah.

771
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,560
Come and help me.

772
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,880
Okay. Coming!

773
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,560
Trust me.

774
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,280
Take off the suit.

775
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,880
Please, take it off.

776
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,830
I'm coming.

777
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,040
Did you see what he's wearing?

778
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,280
Are you stupid?

779
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,710
You're making your dad unhappy.

780
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,110
Do you forget who is coming later?

781
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,470
Oh, right.

782
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,560
If Mr. Lin gives Dr. Gu

783
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,710
a hard time at night,

784
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,000
you must help Dr. Gu.

785
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,350
I'll think about it.

786
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,560
You'll think about it?

787
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,680
You like Dr. Gu,

788
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,400
don't you?

789
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,470
Dr. Gu has

790
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,310
prepared a big gift

791
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,520
for you.

792
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,800
It doesn't matter

793
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,520
what he buys,

794
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,640
what matters is his sincerity.

795
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,350
Gifts are important too, okay?

796
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,920
He selected the gift especially,

797
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,470
perfectly fits your temperament.

798
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,640
One hundred percent

799
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,640
sincerity.

800
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,760
Really?

801
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,520
Really.

802
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,280
You really

803
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,390
should look forward to it.

804
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:13,840
How is it?

805
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,470
You gotta take his side

806
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,470
this time, will you?

807
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,760
I know.

808
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,320
Let me check on the soup.

809
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,760
Don't touch it.

810
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,150
It's not ready yet.

811
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,840
There is no coriander

812
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,390
in all the dishes today, is there?

813
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,630
Oh, I totally forgot about it.

814
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,840
Look how nervous you are.

815
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,760
No coriander at all.

816
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,280
I made it exactly

817
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,600
according to the list you gave me.

818
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,910
These are all his favorites.

819
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,320
You scared me.

820
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,230
Dr. Gu

821
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,470
not only doesn't eat coriander,

822
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,150
but also can't stand the smell.

823
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:48,040
I'm afraid

824
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,320
if you did put it in the dishes,

825
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,760
he won't be able
to eat anything tonight.

826
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:51,870
Mr. Lin would think that

827
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,870
he is difficult to serve.

828
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,390
I just want him to get

829
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,320
a good impression from Mr. Lin.

830
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
I have to get

831
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,520
all the details right.

832
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,600
Clever little girl.

833
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,950
I have to remind him

834
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,840
to come earlier.

835
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,360
Exactly.

836
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,430
Ask him to come quickly.

837
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,150
Your dad hates people being late.

838
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:36,380
(Lin Zhixiao)

839
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:43,540
(Sorry, Zhixiao.
I have an emergent operation.)

840
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:55,820
(I might not be able to be there today.)

841
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,980
(Lin Zhixiao)
(Zhixiao, sorry.)

842
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,620
(Dr. Gu, have you finished work?)

843
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,740
(Are you on your way?
Look all these dishes we prepared!)

844
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,220
(Lin Zhixiao)
(Sorry, Zhixiao.)

845
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,430
Mr. Lin.

846
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,600
Dr. Gu will be here in a minute.

847
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,760
I'll go down to pick him up.

848
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,520
Okay.

849
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,520
Get ready.

850
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,000
What took you so long?

851
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,150
I thought you were going to be late.

852
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,360
If you're late,

853
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,840
Mr. Lin will pick on you again.

854
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,670
- Zhixiao.
- Let me check.

855
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,230
Why aren't you wearing that suit?

856
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,760
But it doesn't matter.

857
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,600
Mr. Lin isn't

858
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,430
wearing suit either.

859
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
It's just a dinner.

860
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Being casual is good.

861
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,430
What's wrong?

862
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,670
Nothing.

863
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,840
What is all that stuff? In the car?

864
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,040
I'll go take a look.

865
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,120
Zhixiao.

866
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,950
What are you doing?

867
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,000
Take this.

868
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,150
Give it to Mr. Lin later,

869
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:01,710
okay?

870
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,910
And this.

871
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,760
Zhixiao, I have something to tell you.

872
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,150
What happened to you?

873
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:11,670
He's here.

874
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,280
Yeah.

875
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,080
Don't just stand there.

876
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,870
Go upstairs.

877
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,670
Okay, you go up first.

878
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,150
Be quick.

879
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
Dinner is ready.

880
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,000
Very good.

881
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,390
Handsome as usual.

882
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,320
Don't be nervous.

883
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,870
Okay?

884
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,670
Cheer up!

885
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,080
Let's go.

886
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,230
Let's start.

887
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,390
Gu Wei, make yourself at home.

888
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,670
Like usual.

889
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,910
Eat as much as you can.

890
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,870
Ms. Li made these

891
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,910
especially for you.

892
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,600
Thanks, Auntie.

893
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,560
You're welcome.

894
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,430
We should thank you

895
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,600
for the gifts.

896
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,080
You must have spent time choosing them.

897
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,000
Especially the purple clay teapot.

898
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,840
It's so lovely.

899
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,080
Yeah, lovely.

900
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,840
Dr. Gu,

901
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,430
you came

902
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,870
here today as Zhixiao's

903
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:04,800
boyfriend,

904
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,360
so I will just call you Gu.

905
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,670
Gu.

906
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,040
Where are you from?

907
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,870
From local.

908
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:13,870
How old?

909
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,520
31.

910
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,280
Educational background?

911
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,150
Ph.D.

912
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,840
What do your parents do?

913
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,600
They are all doctors.

914
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,670
A medical family.

915
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,800
No wonder Gu Wei

916
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,910
is young and outstanding.

917
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,840
Our Zhixiao is not bad.

918
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,840
Although she is not top in school,

919
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,600
she loves art

920
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,430
and has studied cello since childhood.

921
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,360
She's been admitted to a famous

922
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,040
orchestra, hasn't she?

923
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,760
Mr. Lin, you never praised me

924
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,910
like today.

925
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,840
Just eat your meal.

926
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,080
Okay, I'll shut up.

927
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,910
No talking.

928
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,670
Come.

929
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,470
Let's eat.

930
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,230
Don't just sit.

931
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,040
Go on, eat.

932
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,040
Mr. Lin, Auntie Li,

933
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,600
I have something to say.

934
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,190
Gu, don't be nervous.

935
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,360
Everyone can talk sweet.

936
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,120
We don't need you to say

937
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,800
those meaningless stuff.

938
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,430
I only have one question for you.

939
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,840
What's your plan

940
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,360
for your future with Zhixiao?

941
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,390
When do you plan to get married?

942
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,630
Mr. Lin!

943
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,560
You are too anxious

944
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,600
about this.

945
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,080
Can you at least

946
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,120
let him eat something first?

947
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,950
Just casual talk.

948
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,520
I haven't said anything yet.

949
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,950
Now you're taking sides already.

950
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
I'm not.

951
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,910
Let Gu Wei speak.

952
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,150
Gu.

953
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,910
(Believe it or not,)

954
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,230
(I'll make you disappear
in the medical industry.)

955
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,630
Gu?

956
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,120
Mr. Lin,

957
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,230
I think getting married is a big deal.

958
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,470
Zhixiao is young,

959
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,760
and my job is not so stable.

960
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,430
So I think we can

961
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,190
plan things slowly

962
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,470
after… after everything is settled.

963
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,230
I think Gu is

964
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,600
actually thoughtful.

965
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,150
Family after career.

966
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:15,800
Right?

967
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,600
Once you have
the economic foundation,

968
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,360
you can have a stable life.

969
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,080
Besides, both of them

970
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,280
are going to Germany for a year.

971
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,840
They can seize this opportunity

972
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,800
to get a better understanding
of each other.

973
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,670
It's good.

974
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,470
Yeah, we're going to Germany.

975
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,150
Germany, and…

976
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,320
Oh, Dr. Du

977
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
asked us to bring

978
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,600
gifts for him.

979
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,520
I said, what can I bring?

980
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,150
I can't bring him beers.

981
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,760
I can't bring him cars.

982
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,040
And he said,

983
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,390
I can bring him

984
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,430
a 100 Euro note.

985
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,470
I'm not bringing it.

986
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,520
I'll exchange it

987
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,430
to coins,

988
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,120
and throw them at him.

989
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,360
Am I clever,

990
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,910
Dr. Gu?

991
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,120
If you're so clever,

992
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,190
why didn't you study cello so well?

993
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,320
Otherwise, you can go to

994
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,040
the Golden Hall

995
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,560
for a solo concert by now.

996
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,710
(When you arrive in Germany,)

997
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,760
(you can work hard with Gu)

998
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,560
(and make progress together.)

999
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,470
(People can stay together
for a lifelong time)

1000
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,760
(only if they are at the same pace.)

1001
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,230
Don't worry about us.

1002
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,360
We will work hard together.

1003
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,000
Gu,

1004
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:22,800
you are older and more mature
than Zhixiao,

1005
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,040
you must take good care of her.

1006
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,390
Gu… Gu Wei.

1007
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,840
Gu.

1008
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,760
Auntie.

1009
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,390
Gu,

1010
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
I just asked,

1011
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,390
can you take care of Zhixiao or not?

1012
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,280
He's been very busy

1013
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,760
at the hospital for operations.

1014
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,560
I guess he's a bit tired.

1015
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,390
Lin Zhixiao,

1016
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,150
you shut up.

1017
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:05,600
Dr. Gu,

1018
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:08,840
today we

1019
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,910
invited you here.

1020
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,710
You should know

1021
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,950
what do we want to ask.

1022
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:51,760
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

1023
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,630
Now I can't promise

1024
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:55,840
