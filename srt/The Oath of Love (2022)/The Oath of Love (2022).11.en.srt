It's getting late.

I should go back.

20
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,725
You have a healthy routine.

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,500
Go to bed early.
See you tomorrow morning.

22
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:09,440
Okay.

23
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,615
The cup...

24
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:15,200
I'll wash it myself.

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,039
I'll wash yours, too.

26
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,675
Um.

27
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:41,500
I'll put them here?

28
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,125
Um.

29
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,050
Well, bye.

30
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:55,050
Your bag.

31
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:32,199
Dr. Gu.

32
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:34,440
I think I left my phone here.

33
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,850
Can I come in to get it?

34
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,720
Thank you.

35
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,550
Your shoes...

36
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,919
I found it.

37
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,279
Bye-bye.

38
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,960
Well,

39
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,000
it's not that I think
you didn't clean them well.

40
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,960
Don't get me wrong.

41
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:09,520
I know.

42
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,039
You won't dislike my job.

43
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,320
You're just a really neat guy.

44
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,520
Goodbye.

45
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,325
Neat freak.

46
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,519
Although sweets can make people happy,

47
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,200
I still won't suggest

48
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,480
too much chocolate.

49
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,359
Come in.

50
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,359
What's the matter?

51
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,359
Aunt just called me

52
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:36,760
and said that you are moving out.

53
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.

54
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,559
Didn't you offer your house

55
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:41,799
as an alternative?

56
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,359
Are you blaming me?

57
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,799
Actually, when Aunt asked me
to talk you through it,

58
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,359
I didn't want to do it.

59
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,359
But you know

60
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,640
that Aunt sees me as her own daughter.

61
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,800
She asked me for help.

62
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,650
I couldn't say no to her.

63
00:06:58,075 --> 00:06:58,975
I understand.

64
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,480
I'm not blaming you.

65
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,000
My mom must have given you a hard time.

66
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,175
There's nothing hard about it.

67
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:07,675
I just don't get

68
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:09,000
why you have to move out.

69
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,640
Isn't it good now?

70
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:13,040
A change of environment,
a change of mood.

71
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,799
This is the admission I applied for you

72
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,279
to the academic conference.

73
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:24,720
Take a look.

74
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,880
I thought that you were off before,

75
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,119
so I didn't tell you.

76
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,559
It's a rare opportunity.

77
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,625
Have a try.

78
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,519
Thank you for this.

79
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,679
We've been friends for years.

80
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:35,000
You don't have

81
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
to say that.

82
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,200
Actually, I support you

83
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,300
to change the environment

84
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,480
and change the mood,

85
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,519
but you should talk

86
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,959
to your parents about it.

87
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,279
Don't make it a big deal.

88
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,119
Especially to Aunt.

89
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,925
I think she's pretty sad.

90
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,720
Rest assured.

91
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:54,239
I'll take care of it.

92
00:07:57,825 --> 00:07:59,279
Have you found a house?

93
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,279
Do you need help?

94
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,320
I've already found one.

95
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm still cleaning it up.

96
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,839
I'm thinking about

97
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,880
inviting your guys over after some time.

98
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,399
Okay.

99
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,920
If there is nothing else,

100
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,900
I'll leave.

101
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
Okay, go ahead.

102
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:22,760
I'm leaving.

103
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,425
Um.

104
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,325
Hello, Dr. Gao.

105
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,625
Dr. Gu.

106
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,050
Why are you standing
so far away from me?

107
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,239
Dr. Gao.

108
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,039
Do you know

109
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,925
that Dr. Gu is moving?

110
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:53,119
No.

111
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,400
You don't know?

112
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,280
I don't know.

113
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,125
He told me about it. Drop the act.

114
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:03,875
In this case,

115
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,039
let's throw him a housewarming party.

116
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,400
That's a good idea.

117
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,559
But Gu Wei...

118
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,039
We're giving him a surprise.

119
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,250
We're not going to hurt him.

120
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay.

121
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:16,239
Do you know

122
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,599
what a surprise means?

123
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,080
Don't worry, Dr. Gao.

124
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,200
It's a secret.

125
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,799
I'll keep it a secret.

126
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,150
Have you seen it enough?

127
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,359
Well done, you two.

128
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,239
You skipped all the steps

129
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:47,300
and went straight into an old couple.

130
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,675
Even you strolled
around the supermarket.

131
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,599
Don't tell me you're going

132
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,050
to pick up your kids
from school next time.

133
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,280
Don't be ridiculous.

134
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,800
There is nothing between me and Dr. Gu.

135
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,475
If there is nothing between you,

136
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:57,640
why are you so shy?

137
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,850
Who is shy?

138
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,520
Now that you're like this,

139
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,559
you should listen to me.

140
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,599
Make a move when you should.

141
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,359
- You mean...
- Who are you going to make a move on?

142
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,225
None of your business.

143
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:08,280
How about

144
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,520
I'll bear with it and...

145
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,025
Get back to work!

146
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Here's the point.

147
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,719
What does he mean?

148
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,520
You two don't feel right.

149
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,599
What's going on?

150
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,559
Are you worried about my love life?

151
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,880
I'm a master of love.

152
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,919
There is nothing!

153
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,679
Nothing at all!

154
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,960
There is nothing.

155
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,969
I can see it.

156
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,800
All right, I'm done.

157
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,925
I should go home.

158
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,950
Otherwise, Lin would be
talking about me.

159
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,726
You and Gu Xiao just...

160
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,200
If you don't go back,

161
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,975
your next-door neighbor
should be worried, too.

162
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,925
I told you there is nothing between us.

163
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,239
Good luck with you two!

164
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,840
I'll kill you!

165
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,559
Am I wrong?

166
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,280
I'm leaving!

167
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,760
Bye-bye!

168
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,675
Let's go.

169
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:35,375
♪Pass by the bustling scenery♪

170
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:36,479
Lin Zhixiao.

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,601
As regards that I washed the cups again,

172
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:39,640

252
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,300
Right.

253
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,679
Are they alone in the room

254
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,679

255

259
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,080
there are more than two of them there.

260
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,479
She came at night.

261
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,925
I don't think she is a friend.

immediately

I think our living room is too dirty.

272
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,900
I need to sweep the floor.

273
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:32,119
Go ahead. Clean it.

274
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,375
Okay, rest assured.

275
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,200
How's it going?

276
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,799
No one is out yet.

sweeping the floor at the door?

282
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,425
Okay!

283
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,725
I'll be right there!

284
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:58,479
I'll get the bag.

285
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh, right. Gu Wei.

286
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,799
It just occurred to me

287
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,800
that we do some preparation
in advance for the academic conference.

288
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,475
There is something
I want to discuss this with you.

289
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's talk inside.

290
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,359
Sorry

291
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,925
to disturb your rest so late.

292
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,000
It's okay.

293
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,775
What's the matter?

294
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,500
Nothing.

295
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,825
The broom is poor in quality.

296
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,839
We need to buy a new one tomorrow.

297
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,680
Clean every corner.

298
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,040
Don't be sloppy with it.

299
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,000
I know. I know.

300
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,400
I'm going to bed.

301
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,300
Go ahead.

302
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,760
Do you think the third paragraph

303
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,875
should be moved up a little bit?

304
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,825
You'll see it better this way.

305
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,040
Take a look. Is it

306
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,075
smoother than before?

307
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,280
Someone is playing the cello at night.

308
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,760
That lacks public spirit.

309
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,425
Can you rest well here?

310
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,275
I'll call my next-door neighbor.

311
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,175
Lin Zhixiao!

312
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,125
It's admirable to play the cello
in the middle of the night.

313
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,439
But what are you playing?

314
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,760
Stop it!

315
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,000
Does your head hurt?

316
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,800
It's not about a man anymore.

317
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
It's a matter of dignity.

318
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,520
You don't have to have a boyfriend,

319
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,160
but you can't lose your dignity!

320
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,319
Go over there right now

321
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,560
and get back your territory!

322
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:51,425
Gu Wei.

323
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,475
I'll see you at the hospital tomorrow.

324
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,479
Gu Wei, it's late.

325
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,640
It's still raining outside.

326
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,250
Could you send me home?

327
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,280
You knew it was late

328
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
and you still wouldn't go back early.

329
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,900
What a coincidence, Dr. Gao.

330
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,900
Are you leaving now?

331
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,880
I'm going downstairs

332
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,719
to take out the garbage.

333
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:40,880
Do you need me to walk you out?

334
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,280
No need.

335
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,839
Gu Wei will send me home.

336
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:48,439
Gao Xi, sorry.

337
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:49,839
I had a few drinks.

338
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:50,839
I can't drive.

339
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,825
How about this,
I'll walk you downstairs.

340
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,239
Since we're on the way,

341
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,175
let's go together.

342
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:57,400
I just moved in,

343
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,640
and don't know where to throw the trash.

344
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,400
You can show me the way.

345
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,439
Of course.

346
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:01,560
We're neighbors.

347
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,500
You're welcome.

348
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Let's go, Dr. Gao.

349
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,000
No need.

350
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,880
I'll go back on my own.

351
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,920
See you tomorrow
at the hospital, Gu Wei.

352
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,550
Um.

353
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,160
Let's go.

354
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,640
Where?

355
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,680
- Throw...
- It's raining

356
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,599
and dark outside.

357
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:28,250
I don't think we should be alone.

358
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,400
What's more,

359
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,199
aren't you going to see

360
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,079
Dr. Gao tomorrow at the hospital?

361
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,400
Go to bed early, Dr. Gu.

362
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,359
You won't take out the garbage?

363
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,439
Thank you.

364
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,525
You said you are just colleagues!

365
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:04,874
Good night.

366
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,719
Zhixiao.

367
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,239
Are you up yet?

368
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,880
Get up

369
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,280
and buy breakfast for your dad.

370
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,825
Got it.

371
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Dr. Gu.

372
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,025
Do you have a kid now?

373
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,400
Yeah.

374
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,375
I've been married for years.

375
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,479
The mother is also here.

376
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,825
Lin Zhixiao, you're doomed.

377
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,275
Zhixiao, are you up yet?

378
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:28,880
What's wrong?

379
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:30,680
Lin wants to have soybean milk
and fried dough sticks.

380
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,050
Go and buy some.

381
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,040
No way. Buy breakfast?

382
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,880
I don't want that dream to happen.

383
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:43,000
What are you doing? Hurry up!

384
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,950
Right away.

385
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,650
Good morning.

386
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,439
Good morning.

387
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:23,920
What a coincidence, Dr. Gu.

388
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,560
- You're going to...
- Well,

389
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,025
Ms. Li asked me
to buy breakfast for Mr. Lin.

390
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,625
Is it around here?

391
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:30,800
Just on that corner.

392
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
We often go there.

393
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:36,400
I still have some time.
Let's go together.

394
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,239
I don't think that place

395
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:40,575
suits your disposition.

396
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,160
I'm afraid you wouldn't like it.

397
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,439
I can try it.

398
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,000
Let's go.

399
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,400
Okay.

400
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,725
No. 33, yours is ready!

401
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,199
I'll get it.

402
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,050
(Pick-up Window)
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

403
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:51,350
The space between the tables
is too small.

404
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,725
I keep bumping
into the person behind me.

405
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,075
It's more convenient now.

406
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,680
Hello, your takeout is ready.

407
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,000
I'll pick it up when I leave.

408
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,800
Okay.

409
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,075
Did you order takeout?

410
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:04,775
Um.

411
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,199
Last night,
I was preparing the materials

412
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,850
for the academic conference with Gao Xi,

413
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,925
and I had to let Du
and Xiaowei leave first.

414
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:12,359
So I bought them breakfast
to make it up to them.

415
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:14,725
Oh.

416
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,325
Dr. Gao loves her job.

417
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,025
What's wrong?
Why do you look at me like that?

418
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,359
Nothing.

419
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,225
It just occurred to me

420
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:42,700
that I seldom eat with others.

421
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:45,800
How do you feel about this?

422
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,880
You're enjoying the food,

423
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,640
and I found myself
having a better appetite.

424
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,719
That doesn't sound like a compliment.

425
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,800
Of course, it's a compliment,

426
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,119
and it's a sincere compliment

427
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,359
from a gastroenterologist.

428
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,680
All right, I'll take it.

429
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,150
I'll consider keeping saving you.

430
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:10,439
Gao Xi.

431
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,479
Have you received the email
about the conference materials?

432
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,325
Yes.

433
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,280
I think the structure

434
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,640
and the frame are reasonable.

435
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,525
The next step is to add the details.

436
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,479
Actually, I think

437
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,650
there is more information
in the hospital reference room.

438
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,319
We can go there

439
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,479
when we have time.

440
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,199
I happen to finish my work now.

441
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,750
Why don't we go now?

442
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:31,040
Gao Xi.

443
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,520
Actually, I'm saying

444
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,575
working in a hospital
can be more productive.

445
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,250
And I don't

446
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
really like

447
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,839
mixing work and life,

448
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,075
so let's talk about work

449
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:43,319
just at the hospital from now on.

450
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,000
Okay.

451
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,800
Time is up.

452
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,675
I'll go on ward rounds.

453
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:52,800
- Du.
- Yeah.

454
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,000
- Time for ward rounds.
- Okay.

455
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:55,200
Let's go.

456
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,839
You finally realized
that you like Dr. Gu.

457
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,775
And then?

458
00:31:11,675 --> 00:31:13,075
What then?

459
00:31:13,075 --> 00:31:15,025
There is nothing then?

460
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,150
My girl.

461
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,680
Don't tell me you're only going

462
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,400
to watch the man you like.

463
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,550
What am I supposed to do?

464
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,040
Should I throw myself on him?

465
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,920
You should at least do something like,

466
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,239
"Dr. Gu, I have low blood sugar",

467
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:30,900
and then throw into his arms.

468
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:33,175
With your advancing speed,

469
00:31:33,175 --> 00:31:35,175
he won't know you like him
until he retires.

470
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,880
If I do what you said,

471
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,000
he'll probably take me
to the hospital for a checkup.

472
00:31:39,675 --> 00:31:40,439
And he will ask me

473
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:42,520
to wait in line
for registration on my own,

474
00:31:42,825 --> 00:31:45,199
because he is very busy with his work.

475
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:47,375
At least you should
ask him out for lunch,

476
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,920
or for dinner.

477
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,760
Dr. Gu is not immortal.

478
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,500
It's not that he eats nothing every day.

479
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,375
By the way, I need
to ask you something serious.

480
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,920
When will Jin Shi and Yin Xi

481
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,040
come back from the short-term exchange?

482
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,160
My cafe will open soon.

483
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,750
Should I send them an invitation?

484
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:02,400
I think they'll be back these two days.

485
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,680
Let me check the chat logs.

486
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,599
Their flight is tonight.

487
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,950
They'll arrive at the airport
tomorrow afternoon.

488
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,950
Okay, I see.

489
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,640
The workmen will come
to get paid for the project later.

490
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,880
I won't talk to you.

491
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
Let what I just said

492
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:18,719
sink in.

493
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,760
Remember.

494
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,719
You don't...

495
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:22,439
You don't just watch a man.

496
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:25,199
Make a move when you should.

497
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,640
That's right. Bye-bye.

498
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:27,560
Bye-bye.

499
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:42,400
(China Southern Airlines)

500
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,100
Have you called a cab?

501
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,725
I forgot. I'm calling it now.

502
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:54,079
Let's go home first to put our luggage.

503
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,599
Then I'll take you out for hot pot.

504
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,280
Okay.

505
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:57,750
Hold on, I'll call a cab.

506
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,160
Yin Xi?

507
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,079
Shao Jiang.

508
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:08,050
Jin Shi.

509
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:09,475
Shao Jiang!

510
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,920
What a coincidence.

511
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,280
You still remember us.

512
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,319
Of course I do.

513
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,079
You two were

514
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,959
a famous straight-A couple at school.

515
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,280
Everyone remembers you.

516
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,650
You're overrating us.

517
00:33:20,719 --> 00:33:21,680
You are the famous one.

518
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,520
We all know it.

519
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,880
We read the magazine.

520
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
You are now a famous

521
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,880
outstanding young violinist
in the world.

522
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,199
Not all that.

523
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,839
I'm just lucky,

524
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,560
and the agency sold me well.

525
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,800
So I...

526
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,439
Shao Jiang, you are too modest.

527
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:38,239
How is Lin Zhixiao doing?

528
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,520
She is doing great. She's

529
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,450
a cellist in the school orchestra now.

530
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,000
Shao Jiang, you didn't tell Zhixiao

531
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,475
that you're coming back?

532
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,160
Not yet. Because

533
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,575
I'm back going on a tour this time.

534
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,850
I haven't had a chance to tell her,

535
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:54,079
but don't tell her yet.

536
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,439
I want to give her a surprise.

537
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:56,959
Zhixiao will be thrilled

538
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,719
to know you're back.

539
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:01,599
There will also be cooperation

540
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,719
with the Huaqing University
School Orchestra.

541
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:04,700
So, I'll see her.

542
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:06,375
No wonder.

543
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:07,880
Our car has arrived.

544
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,639
The car has arrived.

545
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,040
Okay, we're leaving then.

546
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,120
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

547
00:34:32,475 --> 00:34:33,479
Ms. Li.

548
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,700
Little fairy.

549
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,750
What's for dinner?

550
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,125
I mean

551
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,645
what you are cooking tonight?

552
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,000
What would you like to eat?

553
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,325
If it's okay...

554
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,000
Thank you. Thank you.

555
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,900
You're welcome.

556
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,479
It's great.

557
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:56,600
Sautéed eggplant,

558
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,439
fry eggs with bitter melon,
three-delicacy soup,

559
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:00,775
and stir-fry...

560
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:03,320
Don't worry.

561
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,159
I won't let you
cook these dishes by yourself.

562
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,675
I'll cook with you.

563
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,199
But I can't cook with you.

564
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:11,239
Why?

565
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,959
I have to go to the school reunion
with your dad.

566
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,375
I won't be back
until tomorrow afternoon.

567
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:15,879
School reunion?

568
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,679
Lin, get to wash up.

569
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,475
We need to catch a bus later.

570
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:23,639
Okay.

571
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,450
♪School reunion School reunion♪

572
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:47,639
Sansan.

573
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,350
I've thought it through.

574
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,360
I want to invite Dr. Gu over tonight

575
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,439
and make him dinner.

576
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,879
What are you going to make?

577
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,520
I'm going to make

578
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,520
eggplant,

579
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,300
fry eggs with bitter melon,

580
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,425
and three-delicacy soup.

581
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,775
What do you know?

582
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,675
That's what Dr. Gu likes.

583
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:22,675
(In Operation)

584
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:25,239
This is making me

585
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,000
a little hungry.

586
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,040
Listen to me.

587
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,600
If you're hungry,

588
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,239
order takeout first.

589
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:31,959
Don't eat

590
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:33,479
too much in front of Dr. Gu

591
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:34,575
and scare him.

592
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,550
You're right.

593
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,600
I can eat more now.

594
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:40,679
Then I can

595
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,800
eat less at dinner.

596
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,959
I'll give him a perfect impression.

597
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:44,840
Of course,

598
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,479
it's your first dinner together.

599
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:48,300
Try to be demure.

Is it hotchpotch?

601

Hello, here is your takeout.

All right.

Please give us a 5-star review.

605
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,439
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

606
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:07,125
Goodbye.

607
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:21,025
What just happened?

608
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,350
Have some water.

609
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:30,919
There's no problem.
I've received the money.

All right, is everything okay?

614
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,560
It's all right. It's done.

00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,159
Have some water.

616
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,000

Thank you for your kind words.

621
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:46,360
All right, let's go.

622
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:46,959
Take care!

623
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:48,080
Thank you. Bye-bye!

624
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:55,800
To celebrate our perfect cooperation,

625
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,120
and that we did a big thing together,

626
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,000
I made a reservation at a restaurant.

627
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,375
Let's celebrate it tonight.

628
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,760
Sorry, I have an appointment.

629
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:05,959
With whom?

630
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:06,840
Male of female?

631
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,800
We are just working together.

632
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,080
I won't answer any personal questions.

633
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,800
See,

634
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,225
speak of the devil.

635
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:17,575
Bye-bye!

636
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:28,760
You forgot the key?

637
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,325
I think you forgot your brain!

638
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,100
Um.

639
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,175
Um.

640
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:35,239
You're right about it.

641
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,625
I'm stupid. I'm a fool.

642
00:38:38,475 --> 00:38:40,719
But I don't know what to do now.

643
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,360
I'm wearing pajamas

644
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,120
in the hallway.

645
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,250
I can't go out now.

646
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:47,000
Well, my phone

647
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,679
has only five percent of power left.

648
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,199
I called the company to unlock the door.

649
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,040
No one has shown up yet.

650
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,560
What if my phone dies off?

651
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
I don't care.

652
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,800
You have to save me now.

653
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,520
I'll wait for you in the hallway anyway.

654
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,479
I'll go to...

655
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,159
Wait.

656
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,600
I made an appointment with Gu Xiao

657
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,239
to see the plan of the opening event.

658
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,875
It's gonna be late.

659
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,225
I'll get someone to help you.

660
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,320
Wait there.

661
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,875
Hello, this is Gu Wei.

662
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,159
Dr. Gu.

663
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:25,475
It's almost time for surgery.

664
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:26,794
Director wants you to get ready.

665
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:30,320
Hello.

666
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:31,760
Yes.

667
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:39,679
Okay.

668
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,639
But I still have an operation to do.

669
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:42,600
Tell her to wait for me.

670
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,400
I'm okay.

671
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,725
I'm okay.

672
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:54,550
You should eat less of these things.

673
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,200
Get up if you're okay.

674
00:40:57,825 --> 00:40:58,719
It's okay.

675
00:40:58,719 --> 00:40:59,840
You can leave now.

676
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,075
Did Sansan tell you

677
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:02,575
that you will stay at my place tonight?

678
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:06,280
Why would I stay at your place?

679
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:10,760
Thank you.

680
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,159
Dr. Gu.

681
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:17,280
Can you let me use

682
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,639
your portable charger?

683
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,639
My phone is dead,

684
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:20,639
but I need to make

685
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,120
a very important call.

686
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,399
Thank you very much.

687
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,199
If there's nothing else,

688
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,239
how about you go in first?

689
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:43,250
I'll meet you there
when I get off the phone.

690
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,199
Bye-bye.

691
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:49,280
Thank you very much.

692
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:01,239
Sansan, I hate you.

693
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:03,159
You're dead.

694
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,040
What kind of portable charger is this?

695
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,639
It's lovely.

696
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,639
Sansan, do you want to die?

697
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,560
I asked you to save me.

698
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,919
Why did you send Dr. Gu over?

699
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:29,199
What's the hurry?

700
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:30,925
It's once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

701
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:32,639
You should be thanking me.

702
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:34,280
My delivery will be here any minute.

703
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:34,760
Bye-bye!

704
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,760
Like I would thank you!

705
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,000
What delivery?

706
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,175
Are you Miss Lin?

707
00:42:41,975 --> 00:42:42,700
Um.

708
00:42:42,879 --> 00:42:43,950
Here's your flash delivery.

709
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:45,850
Please show me the pickup code.

710
00:42:49,075 --> 00:42:50,320
6484.

711
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,199
6484.

712
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
All right. Thank you.

713
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,750
Please give us a five-star review.

714
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,959
Is the flash delivery from you?

715
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:03,850
Why do I have a bad feeling about it?

716
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,080
Don't mess with me.

717
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,320
Lin Zhixiao.

718
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,199
Are you coming in or not?

719
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:10,000
I'll clean the garbage up

720
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,925
and be there right away!

721
00:43:40,275 --> 00:43:41,120
Another drink.

722
00:43:41,225 --> 00:43:42,225
