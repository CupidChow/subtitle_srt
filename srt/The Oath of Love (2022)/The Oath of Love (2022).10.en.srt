18
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,800
Dr. Gu, are you caught in something?

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,120
Are you arriving soon?

20
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,590
The subscriber you dialed

21
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,190
is not answered for the moment.

22
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,750
He'll be right here.

23
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,600
Dad, I'm done with the tea.

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,550
May I leave?

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,900
No hurry.

26
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,520
You must be calm when enjoying some tea.

27
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,390
But Dad, I'm in a hurry.

28
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,970
You seldom enjoy some tea with me.

29
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,300
What's the hurry for?

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,120
Dr. Gu, the estate agent asked
for three months' rent and a deposit.

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,200
I don't have enough money.

32
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,120
Could you come quickly?

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,190
You...

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,020
You don't know how to taste the tea.

35
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,420
The tea can't be good

36
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,920
unless it has a long aftertaste

37
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,570
in your mouth.

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,300
Some tea tastes good at the first sip.

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,270
However,

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,720
its taste doesn't last long.

41
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,300
Please wait for one more moment.

42
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,500
Okay? Just a moment.

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,920
I'm sure he's arriving soon.

44
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,440
Miss Lin,

45
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,750
it's not up to me.

46
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,720
But the landlord said

47
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,190
someone wanted his apartment.

48
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,440
Your boyfriend is so late.

49
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,190
Yes, yes. I'm sorry.

50
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,500
What can I do

51
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,750
to get this apartment?

52
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,520
Shall I transfer the deposit
to you first?

53
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,630
Shall I transfer it through WeChat?

54
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,500
Okay?

55
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,470
I will move out,

56
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,100
but it doesn't mean
I'll drift apart from you.

57
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,350
It's because I am

58
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,750
already in my thirties.

59
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,320
I want more private space.

60
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,640
You have private space here, too.

61
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,470
Your mother and I
haven't restrained you, have we?

62
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,770
Why do you have to move out?

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,970
If you move out,

64
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,320
your mother and I will be disappointed.

65
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,450
Dad, it's not a serious thing

66
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,830
as you think it is.

67
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,520
I hope you can respect my decision.

68
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,520
Dad, I'm really in a hurry.

69
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,970
When I'm back, let's talk then.

70
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,050
Dr. Gu,

71
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,510
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,670
I tried my best to urge them

73
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,120
to keep the apartment for you.

74
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,670
But the landlord refused.

75
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,000
I told him to wait a minute

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,300
and you would come soon.

77
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,270
But I still failed
to get the apartment for you.

78
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,370
I'm really sorry.

79
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,160
I should apologize instead.

80
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,640
Sorry, I'm late.

81
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,300
Go. Let me take you to lunch.

82
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,440
Shall we get in

83
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,900
and ask the estate agent

84
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,600
if he's got any other resources?

85
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,820
We can look for apartments later.

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,950
But your health matters more.

87
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,040
Don't we need to check

88
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,070
any other agencies?

89
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,670
The more you try to help,
the more apologetic I feel.

90
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,600
Let's just go.

91
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,760
Dr. Gu,

92
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,020
what's wrong with you today?

93
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,670
You brought me to a hotpot restaurant.

94
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,720
Just for one lunch.

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,480
Make sure the ingredients are
thoroughly boiled.

96
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,350
I just wonder if you like it.

97
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,220
I won't stand on ceremony, then.

98
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,670
The hot pot tastes better
than the porridge, anyway.

99
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,620
I'm going to order.

100
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,220
Enjoy the food, Dr. Gu.

101
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,920
It's on you, anyway.

102
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,020
Have some more.

103
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,670
It's the yellow throat.
You don't want it?

104
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,330
Mm, yellow throat.

105
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,720
But it's not the real throat or gullet

106
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,600
of an animal,

107
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,070
but the aorta of the pig.

108
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,900
Namely, it's the thin film

109
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,410
covering the aorta.

110
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,480
Look at this.

111
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,600
It's the ileum

112
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,670
that digests food.

113
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,880
And this one with the haustra

114
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,870
turns out to be the colon.

115
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,030
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,160
I didn't mean to say this.

117
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,830
But when I see them,

118
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,650
I can't help thinking of the operations.

119
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,760
We...

120
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,670
We shouldn't have come here.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,350
You don't eat anything here.

122
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,800
You can't just drink water.

123
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,700
Do... do you never have the hot pot?

124
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,600
You'll miss a lot of fun, then.

125
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,850
Well, close your eyes.

126
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,670
Close your eyes. I won't trick you.

127
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,320
Hurry.

128
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,720
Good. Don't open your eyes.

129
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,150
Next,

130
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,920
let the magic happen.

131
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,920
Open your mouth.

132
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,880
Open it.

133
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,350
How does it taste?

134
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,440
Isn't it great?

135
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,300
Isn't it?

136
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,720
When you enjoy the hot pot
with your eyes closed,

137
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,200
you won't think of the operations.

138
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,390
Do you see

139
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,480
the gateway

140
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,510
to a brand new world?

141
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,880
This is the solution

142
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,320
I've come up with for you.

143
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,160
You can then enjoy the hot pot
with your eyes closed.

144
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,110
You'll no longer miss

145
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,670
any delicious food in the world.

146
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,110
Don't be grateful.

147
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,440
I'm okay.

148
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,480
It tastes just so-so.

149
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,120
Enjoy the food.

150
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,920
Come on.

151
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,350
Oh, have them back.

152
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,600
Help yourself.

153
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,600
Have some more.

154
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,750
Dr. Gu, I'm home.

155
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,720
I had a good time today.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Let's go have the hot pot next time.

157
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,470
Don't be discouraged by the apartment.

158
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,910
I'll keep helping you with it.

159
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,280
Lin Zhixiao,

160
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,300
don't easily be enchanted
by his handsome face.

161
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,960
What am I thinking of?

162
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,590
Don't believe anything
like love at first sight.

163
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,420
Lin Zhixiao, stay awake.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,820
Are you still the doctor I know?

165
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,720
Are you possessed?

166
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,640
You had the hot pot!

167
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,400
And you didn't even invite me.

168
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,870
There must be something wrong.

169
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,470
Let me observe you more carefully

170
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,550
and see if I can find
any other evidence.

171
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,520
What?

172
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,620
Do you want to experience

173
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,220
the feeling of being dog-tired?

174
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,710
Zhixiao,

175
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,900
come out for lunch.

176
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,270
Lin Zhixiao,

177
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,070
- could you focus?
- It can't be eaten anymore.

178
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,110
I'm focusing.

179
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,150
Then why were you chewing the bone?

180
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,500
There's still meat on it.

181
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,920
Look at your daughter.

182
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,370
In her twenties, she's still childish.

183
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,400
The son of Ms. Zhang next door is

184
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,950
only a few years older than her, right?

185
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,640
He has moved to Beijing

186
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,880
and got married already.

187
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,640
What do you mean my daughter?

188
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,770
Isn't she your daughter too?

189
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,550
Aunt Zhang's son is ugly.

190
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,460
Why don't you compare his face
with mine?

191
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,080
Don't you always ask me

192
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,320
not to talk during meals and bedtime?

193
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,760
Don't have double standards.

194
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,970
Don't always tease me.

195
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,030
Ms. Zhang said

196
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,220
her son would settle her down
in Beijing.

197
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,940
When can my daughter

198
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,500
give me such a good life?

199
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,670
Am I thinking of it too early?

200
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,570
You're just thinking too much.

201
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,400
Don't always underestimate me.

202
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,640
Nothing can be sure in the world.

203
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,520
What if I can?

204
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,370
You just said

205
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,900
Aunt Zhang would move to Beijing?

206
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,650
Mm.

207
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,170
Oh.

208
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,500
What are you smirking at?

209
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,000
That's good.

210
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,600
Zhixiao, come on in.

211
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,470
You look more beautiful.

212
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,280
Thank you.

213
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,650
Make yourself at home.

214
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,250
Okay.

215
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,950
It's the kitchen.

216
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
The living room.

217
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,790
Is this the study?

218
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,150
- Yes.
- May I have a look?

219
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,920
Sure.

220
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,600
My apartment is fully furnished.

221
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,300
It's good.

222
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,440
- Zhixiao.
- Mm.

223
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,280
Your mother told you about it, right?

224
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,030
Yes, yes.

225
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm leaving for Beijing
the day after tomorrow.

226
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,200
I've posted

227
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,000
the rental information on 58. com.

228
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,840
I left your mother's number on it.

229
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,710
And I'll leave the key to your mother.

230
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,350
I'll entrust the apartment to you.

231
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,200
If your friend wants to rent it,

232
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,470
no problem.

233
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,110
You can negotiate with him for me

234
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,670
and save the commission.

235
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,590
Okay. Okay.

236
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,670
Zhixiao,

237
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,820
I've got something else to do.

238
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,120
Just show yourself around.

239
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,850
- I'll leave you alone.
- Okay. Okay.

240
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,350
Goodbye, Aunt Zhang.

241
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,200
I don't like

242
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,220
the structure of this apartment.

243
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,960
The daylighting and ventilation
are just so-so.

244
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
It'll easily breed bacteria.

245
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,700
And it's hand-me-down furniture.

246
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm not used to it.

(Apartment proposal)

258
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,970
What do you think?

259
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,320
It's reasonable and convincing.

260
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,080
Even I want to move into this apartment.

261
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,320
Seriously? Do you really think so?

262
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,220
Yes.

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,280
Later, please email

264
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,670
the same proposal to me.

265
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,110
I'll make such a marketing proposal

266
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,230
for our café, too.

267
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,470
No problem.

268
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,070
Zhixiao.

269
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:18,800
Mm?

270
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,590
You weren't even so serious

271
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,200
when you were preparing
for the college entrance examination.

272
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,200
Instead of focusing on study,

273
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,760
you only care about Dr. Gu.

274
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,920
What does it indicate?

275
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,840
It indicates that I'm trying hard

276
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,520
to flatter Mr. Lin's attending doctor

277
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,760
and I'm an incredible filial daughter.

278
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,670
No way!

279
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,110
You're just fooling yourself.

280
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,770
What are you talking about?

281
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,620
Let me add one thing.

282
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,970
Advantage,

283
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,440
(Advantages)
you can be the neighbor

284
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,520
of the Prettiest Girl of CN.

285
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,000
Done.

286
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,880
Good.

287
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,570
Now you can send it to Dr. Gu.

288
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,670
But the file is too big.

289
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,280
If I send it to him through WeChat,

290
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,760
can I not succeed

291
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,910
unless I delete some photos?

292
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,020
Don't.

293
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,960
You made the proposal so elaborately.

294
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,150
How can you delete some?

295
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,600
Take my advice.

296
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,350
Print it out

297
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,420
and give it to Dr. Gu tomorrow.

298
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,420
Will I be trying too hard?

299
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,570
Aren't you trying too hard already?

300
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,790
Let me say it again.

301
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,150
I made this proposal

302
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,110
for Mr. Lin.

303
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,760
Just for him, got it?

304
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,840
Fine, fine.

305
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,640
For Mr. Lin.

306
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,840
Just for him.

307
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,080
If you give it to him personally,

308
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,670
you'll look more sincere, right?

309
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,300
You made some sense.

310
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,070
Mm.

311
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,770
Fine, then.

312
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,120
I give in to you.

313
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,170
Dr. Gu, aren't satisfied
with this proposal?

314
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,350
- I did a great job, right?
- Don't read this.

315
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,520
Okay. Okay.

316
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,200
- Doctors are tired every day.
- Stop. Stop reading.

317
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,300
- So...
- Done.

318
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,640
Enjoy the tea.

319
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,110
Fine.

320
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,320
Xi,

321
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,680
I really don't understand Gu Wei.

322
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,400
He insists on moving out,
no matter how hard we try to stop him.

323
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,880
What have we done

324
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,070
that displeases him?

325
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,400
Aunt,

326
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,320
Gu Wei has been filial.

327
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,470
Maybe he's just being stubborn
for the moment.

328
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,820
We can't persuade him, anyway.

329
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,680
I know you and Uncle Gu

330
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,070
just worry about him.

331
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,250
He's too busy working

332
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,770
to look after himself very well.

333
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,070
When he lives at home,

334
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,800
you can take care of him, right?

335
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,050
See? You're always sensible, Xi.

336
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,400
Gu Wei has been obedient since little.

337
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,300
He's a good boy.

338
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,760
But compared to you,

339
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,000
he's far worse.

340
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,300
Even you can understand
what I care about.

341
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,350
Why can't he understand his own mother?

342
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,560
I'm so disappointed.

343
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,220
Don't be sad, Aunt.

344
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,750
Gu Wei will understand you one day.

345
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,760
Xi,

346
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,600
could you persuade him

347
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,800
not to move out?

348
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,710
Aunt, you know Gu Wei

349
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,000
very well.

350
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,950
He thinks very independently.

351
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,560
If we all persuade him,

352
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,170
he won't listen.

353
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,760
What do we do, then?

354
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,070
We can't just let him move out.

355
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,200
I've got an idea.

356
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,230
Maybe we can stop him in some other way.

357
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,560
Some other way?

358
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,420
Mm.

This is the estate agent

gave me your contact.

365
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,700
Are you still looking for an apartment?

366
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,590
Yes, I am.

367

Here's the thing.

368
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,470
I've got a resource.

369
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,070
In terms of location, orientation,

370
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,230
decoration, and rent,

371
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,950
it meets your requirements perfectly.

372
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,590
If you're interested,

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,680

374

Okay. No problem.

Mm. Thank you.

Yes, yes. The third.

511
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,100
(Huaqing University First Affiliated Hospital)
So, he wants to see the tenant.

512
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,400
I'll give him feedback.

513
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,500
Please don't mind.

514
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,400
(Sorry, the subscriber you dialed)

515
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,950

516
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,720
(Please redial later.)

517
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,070
Dr. Du said you called me. What's up?

518
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,000
Hello.

519
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,670
Is that Gu Wei?

520
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,040
Who's that?

521
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,500
Please come and meet me.

522
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,850
I seldom judge someone wrongly.

523
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,880
What on earth do you think

524
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,400
of Zhixiao?

525
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,880
What's your relationship

526
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,350
with that woman doctor?

527
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,520
Are you going to two-timing Zhixiao?

528
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,590
What are you talking about?

529
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,880
Now that you and that woman doctor are

530
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,040
in a dubious relationship,

531
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,820
why do you still mess with Zhixiao?

532
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,350
I'm warning you.

533
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,450
No one can bully

534
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,020
my girl.

535
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,430
Shut up!

536
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,760
I really don't understand
what you're talking about.

537
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,620
Lin Zhixiao

538
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,260
didn't answer my phone the whole day.

539
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,500
I also want to ask you
what happened to her.

540
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,620
It's okay that you don't like

541
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,380
the apartments Zhixiao selected for you.

542
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,350
Without any explanation,

543
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,800
you just wasted her efforts.

544
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,350
And then you'll move into

545
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,640
that woman doctor's apartment.

546
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,350
Do you have an idea?

547
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Zhixiao has done a lot for you.

548
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,560
But you just don't cherish her!

549
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,670
(Dr. Gu, it's very, very clean for you!)

550
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,370
(Doctors are tired every day.
So, you need a good rest.)

551
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,020
(Rent: 4,600 yuan/month, two bedrooms,
two living rooms, one kitchen, and one toilet)

552
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,620
(Advantages: You can be the neighbor
of the Prettiest Girl of CN)

553
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,570
Can't you just call me again?

554
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,620
Hello. How was it going?

555
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,710
Did he sign the contract?

556
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,400
Actually, he didn't.

557
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,590
What happened?

558
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,400
I don't know what happened to him.

559
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,880
He just called me,

560
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,150
saying he had rented another apartment.

561
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,750
Fine. I get it.

562
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,860
(Good morning.)

563
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,120
Aunt Zhang's apartment was let out?

564
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,000
Mm.

565
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,250
When?

566
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,000
Dr. Gu called me,

567
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,760
saying he wanted to rent an apartment
in our community.

568
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,800
He asked me for a favor.

569
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,100
I thought he could live next door.

570
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,250
Good morning, neighbor.

571
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,150
Good morning, neighbor.

574
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,800
I just came to say good morning.

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,800

00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,150
Morning, Dr. Gu.

580
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,470
By the way,

581
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,350
if you're available tonight,

582
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,700
come to our home for dinner.

583
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,760
As a welcome party, okay?

00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,600

You're my husband's doctor.

588
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,040
And now, we're neighbors.

589
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,830
We should often visit each other

590
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,920
and take care of each other.

591
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,430
All right. I can also check

how Mr. Lin is recovering.

593
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,400
That's great. It's a deal.

594
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,040
See you tonight.

595
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,020

It'll taste better later.

Zhixiao,

599
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,680
what are you dazing at?

600
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,750
Serve the dishes.

601
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,320
Mm.

602
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,050
I've kept the tea for a long time.

603
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,570
But now,

604
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,350
looks like

605
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,590
I can't enjoy it anymore.

606
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,270
Right.

607
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,250
As you have a stomach problem,

608
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,470
you'd better drink warm water.

609
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,020
Boiled water.

610
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,050
Here, Dr. Gu.

611
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,640
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

Have a taste of my dishes.

627
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,320
Just home cooking.

00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,950
Be seated.

629
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,670
All right.

630
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,850
Come on. Be seated.

Don't be shy. Let me get you some.

I don't know what dishes you love.

Delicious.

639
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,370
I'm glad you like it.

640
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
By the way, Dr. Gu,

642
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,320

643
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,150
Yeah.

644
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,360
What attracts you

645
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,800
to our community?

646
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,800
You can be the neighbor

647
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,300
of the Prettiest Girl of CN.

648
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,720
(Advantages: You can be the neighbor
of the Prettiest Girl of CN.)

649
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,150
The rent is cheap.

650
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,450
And it's near my hospital.

651
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,870
There are many apartments like this,

652
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,170
aren't there?

653
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,170
Don't you have alternatives?

654
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,170
I have one.

655
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,120
But it's an apartment
my parents found for me.

656
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,570
It's an old apartment of their friend.

657
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,870
It's not convenient to live there.

658
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,520
That's all?

659
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,070
Yeah. That's all.

660
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,630
Don't just talk.
Or the dishes will get cold.

661
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,600
Come on. Enjoy the food.

662
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,630
Okay.

663
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,600
You just moved in.

664
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,370
You still need to buy many things, huh?

665
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,550
Do you also have no time

666
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,700
to stroll around the neighborhood?

667
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,390
That's right.

668
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,630
Don't worry.

669
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,630
Zhixiao is quite familiar
with the neighborhood.

670
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,000
After having dinner,

671
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,950
show Dr. Gu around the neighborhood.

672
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,190
Neighbors here all like her.

673
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,430
When she goes to buy a fish,

674
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,080
she can get some shallots for free.

675
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,150
She can?

676
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,670
Okay. Thank you, Aunt Li.

677
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,910
Lin Zhixiao,

678
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,560
please show me around later.

679
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,900
No problem.

680

Lin Zhixiao.

681
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,810
Are you feeling unwell?

682
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,670
No.

683
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,100
Then why are you bashful?

684
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,150
Have dinner properly.

685
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,720
I'm not bashful.

686
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,320
Dr. Gu, enjoy the dishes.

687
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,170
I will.

688
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,560
Mrs. Lin, have some more.

689
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,430
Mr. Lin, care for your health.

690
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,600
Dr. Gu,

691
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,760
here's some for you.

692
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,870
You grab a bite, too.

693
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,190
Just gobble

694
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,620
as you usually do.

695
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,570
I don't.

696
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,950
I never gobble.

697
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,350
I always eat slowly like this.

698
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,280
Here are the slippers.

699
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,100
Lin Zhixiao,

700
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,470
which pair do you like?

701
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,720
You make your own choice.

702
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,320
Pick any pair you like.

703
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,870
You like pink slippers?

704
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,170
Are you not

705
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,320
going to visit me?

706
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,220
Are you saying

707
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,320
the slippers are for me?

708
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,560
Wait.

709
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,870
May I...?

710
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,950
May I have that pair of slippers?

711
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,710
I like that yellow duck.

712
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,850
It looks lovely.

713
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,000
Mm.

714
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,370
Yesterday, your friend Sansan

715
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,220
showed me an apartment proposal.

716
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,800
I didn't know who made it.

717
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,630
It looks excellent with photos

718
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,800
and it's quite touching.

719
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,520
It made me feel that I would lose a lot

720
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,190
if I didn't move here.

721
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,120
I made it.

722
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,900
The Prettiest Girl of CN.

723
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,420
There's more over there.
Shall we go have a look?

724
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,670
Dr. Gu,

725
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,190
you've only picked daily necessities.

726
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,630
And such colors

727
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,600
will depress people
if you keep looking at them.

728
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,320
What makes it different

729
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
from decorating an on-call room?

730
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,430
It's different.

731
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,670
My apartment is bigger.

732
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,430
You really don't have fun in life.

733
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,650
Maybe it's because
my parents are doctors

734
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
and I'm a doctor, too.

735
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,630
I'm used to such a life

736
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,450
and I don't usually care.

737
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,320
So,

738
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,040
you're not as sympathetic as me.

739
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,120
You don't have good taste, either.

740
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,150
Fine. I'll count on you

741
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,710
for the home decoration.

742
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,650
Rest assured. Count on me.

743
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,470
Which one do you prefer?

744
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,450
Grey. Okay?

745
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,360
I just think

746
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,280
I need to change gradually.

747
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,020
You're right.

748
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,390
Buy this, then.

749
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,120
You will change from now on.

750
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,840
And look at the mug.

751
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,950
The cartoon pattern suits you.

752
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,600
It does?

753
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,970
There're more things over there.

754
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,070

762
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,800
My favorite crisps.

763
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,600
I want them.

764
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,630
No. They have too many crumbs.

765
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,800
It's hard to clean
if they fall on the sofa.

766
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,500
But I don't eat them in your home.

767
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,740
I'll enjoy them in my own home.

768
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,850
You can't have them anywhere.

769
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,840
I just complained

770
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,520
you didn't have fun in life.

771
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,840
Fine. I give in to you.

772
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,700
You're really awesome.

773
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,150
Dr. Gu,

774
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,040
look.

775
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,390
Lin Zhixiao,

776
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,120
when did you buy the bulbs?

777
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,570
When you weren't noticing.

778
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,770
Are you surprised?

779
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,600
Look.

780
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,870
You're even too surprised to talk.

781
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,170
Don't rush to say thank you.

782
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,320
Dr. Gu,

783
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,080
could you turn on the switch?

784
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,470
I'd like to see if the bulbs work.

785
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,000
Come down first.

786
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,390
It's too dangerous to stand up there.

787
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,300
It's okay. It's not dangerous.

788
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,390
Hurry.

789
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,270
Do they look great?

790
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,670
I have the same bulbs.

791
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,350
On my honor, I assure you

792
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,320
that the bulbs will look more romantic

793
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,570
at Christmas.

794
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,150

00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,630
All right. Come down first.

797
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,770
I'll hang them later.

798
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,750
Oh.

799
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,710
Thanks.

800
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,520
Are you thirsty?

801
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,910
Let me get you some water.

802
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,900
Okay.

803
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,190
What would you like to drink?

804
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,040
Anything.

805
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,390
Pepsi or orange juice.

806
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,200
But I only have purified water.

807
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:31,920
Iced or at room temperature?

808
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,970
Iced, pleased.

809
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,000
Considering your physical condition,

810
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,870
you'd better have some water
at room temperature bottle.

811
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,560
Okay. You call the shots, Dr. Gu.

812
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,600
Fine. I'll get some for you.

813
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:52,950
Thank you.

814
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,630
Would you like some more?

815
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,600
Mm.

816
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:21,270
How... How about some more?

817
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,600
It's empty.

818
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,870
Um...

819
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,720
I'll go hang the bulbs.

820
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,550
