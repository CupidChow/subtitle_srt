Zhixiao.

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,230
What's wrong with you today?

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,590
I just want a few more looks at you.

21
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,400
That's enough?

22
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,360
Bye-bye.

23
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,080
You're just in time.

24
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,720
I was going to call you.

25
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,750
What happened? You look so serious.

26
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,320
Just now, I thought

27
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,190
you didn't feel right.

28
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,080
Do you really have something to tell me?

29
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,270
What's wrong with you?

30
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,600
Be seated.

31
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,960
What is it? You look so serious.

32
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,750
I've been hesitating.

33
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,390
But I think

34
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,390
I should tell you about this.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You want to annul our engagement?

36
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,270
You know what?

37
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,390
No way.

38
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,550
It's not going to happen.

39
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,910
Never think of it, okay?

40
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,910
It's not about me.

41
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,720
It's about Mr. Lin.

42
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,240
He doesn't want me
to tell you about this.

43
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
But I think you have the right

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,110
to learn about it.

45
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,600
Promise me.

46
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,270
After I tell you,

47
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,520
don't get too excited.

48
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,190
Mr. Lin's cancer

49
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,440
has got worse.

50
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,720
It has got to his liver.

51
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,720
No way.

52
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,110
After his last chemotherapy,

53
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,240
you just told me...

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,240
You told me

55
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,320
that he was all right, didn't you?

56
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,600
And he's in quite a good condition

57
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,160
now.

58
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,950
He's all right.

59
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,000
How could he get worse?

60
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,350
Zhixiao, I know

61
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,950
you can hardly accept it.

62
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,760
No.

63
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,640
It's not that I can hardly accept it,

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,000
but I don't believe it at all.

65
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,600
He's all right now.

66
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,600
Zhixiao,

67
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,950
hear me out.

68
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,230
I think he's all right.

69
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,600
Even if it's true...

70
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,480
Even if it's true, so what?

71
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,670
Anyway,

72
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,760
I'm not going to Germany.

73
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,000
I can take him abroad.

74
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,760
I can...

75
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,110
So far,

76
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,440
a patient whose cancer transferred

77
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,230
from his stomach to his liver

78
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,350
has got a miracle

79
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,350
in his case.

80
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,760
He's cured.

81
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,270
My father will be all right, too.

82
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,320
He will be cured.

83
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,270
Zhixiao...

84
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,830
He will be cured.

85
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,070
Zhixiao...

86
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,950
What?

87
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,790
Don't...

88
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,480
I...

89
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,950
Zhixiao, listen to me!

90
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,920
I don't want to listen to you!

91
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,600
I don't want to listen to you!

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Listen.

93
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,000
Mr. Lin is your father.

94
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,390
He's my family, too.

95
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,040
In this world,

96
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,350
no other doctors care about him

97
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,510
more than I do.

98
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,640
You know?

99
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,700
(Hope you'll get better soon.)

100
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,230
(All the doctors)

101
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,270
(have reached the same conclusion.)

102
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,390
(Operations will no longer)

103
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,600
(help him a lot.)

104
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,000
(We suggest a conservative therapy)

105
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,640
(to alleviate his pain.)

106
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,640
(How much longer can he live?)

107
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,440
For less than a year.

108
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,070
Are you saying

109
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,390
that I have to watch

110
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,510
my father die

111
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,640
and do nothing about it?

112
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,600
Zhixiao,

113
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,200
a conservative therapy

114
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,320
doesn't mean he'll give up.

115
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,950
Mr. Lin promised me

116
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,070
that he would cooperate actively.

117
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,760
I will try my best

118
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,790
to give him treatment

119
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,760
and supervise him with the medicine.

120
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,110
That's why

121
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,880
he's been behaving oddly, right?

122
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,320
That's why he allowed us

123
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,830
to get married.

124
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,950
That's why he put in a good word

125
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,000
for me with your parents

126
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,550
and let us get married soon, right?

127
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,040
Zhixiao, I'm sorry.

128
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,160
I should have

129
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,110
told you earlier.

130
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,180
(Pathological reports)

131
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,060
(Pathological reports)

132
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,640
(What's that look on your face?)

133
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,670
(Do you not want to accompany me?)

134
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,320
What are you talking about, Dad?

135
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,790
How can I

136
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,030
still be happy?

137
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,440
At this moment,

138
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,400
will you still

139
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,080
waste your time

140
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,440
weeping endlessly?

141
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:49,960
(What a childish girl!)

142
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,350
(What are you crying for?)

143
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,640
(I'm not crying.)

144
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,100
(Hope you'll get better soon.)

145
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,880
(I know why you asked me)

146
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,760
(to visit the hospice care wards.)

147
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,150
(You try to tell me)

148
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,520
(that Mr. Lin doesn't want us)

149
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,150
(to treat him as a patient.)

150
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,000
(He doesn't want us)

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,350
(to worry about him.)

152
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,110
(Right?)

153
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,760
(He wants to enjoy every single day)

154
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,760
(for the rest of his life with you.)

155
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,670
(He doesn't want you)

156
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,790
(to sacrifice your time)

157
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,790
(on him.)

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,520
(What was his reaction)

159
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,080
(when he knew about his condition?)

160
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,320
He was calm.

161
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,150
Instead,

162
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,670
he worries more about you.

163
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,400
Will he feel the pain?

164
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,230
Gao Xi, Yan Bingjun,

165
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,470
and I

166
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,440
will try our best

167
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,760
to help him and take care of him.

168
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,590
It's so unfair.

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,590
He's only 56 years old.

170
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,790
I made a birthday wish

171
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,030
that I wanted

172
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,760
my family to be healthy.

173
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,670
Why did

174
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,030
none of my birthday wishes

175
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,080
come true?

176
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,840
Is it because

177
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,400
I was too greedy?

178
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,280
Zhixiao,

179
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,350
shall I tell you a story?

180
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,280
Why do you behave like

181
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,080
you're coaxing a kindergarten baby?

182
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,640
Well, baby Lin Zhixiao,

183
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,440
would you like to listen?

184
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,760
Yes.

185
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,230
When I was studying abroad,

186
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,960
one of my classmates Frank

187
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,030
suddenly passed away,

188
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,230
because of a blood disease.

189
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Frank?

190
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,710
Frank was

191
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,470
a very optimistic young man.

192
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,150
He got on very well

193
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,080
with many people.

194
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,110
But most of our class

195
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,030
didn't know he had an incurable disease

196
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,550
until he died.

197
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,400
His family

198
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,840
must have been sad.

199
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,470
His mother told me

200
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,840
it was the hardest thing

201
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
for her

202
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,880
to bid farewell to Frank.

203
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,840
But throughout the funeral,

204
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,150
she didn't shed tears.

205
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,710
Instead, she was smiling all the time.

206
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,400
I don't believe that.

207
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,840
It's true.

208
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,400
That funeral was also

209
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:29,910
a very unforgettable experience

210
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,350
I had ever had.

211
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,200
On that day, we gathered together,

212
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,080
talking about Frank.

213
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:39,670
His mother

214
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,150
told us a lot

215
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,790
about funny things

216
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,080
Frank did in his childhood.

217
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,470
Starting from his mother,

218
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,880
every one of us talked

219
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,790
about the Frank we knew.

220
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,790
Someone said Frank worked out

221
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,960
and had hamburgers at the same time.

222
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
He even said

223
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,960
no calories were counted

224
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,670
unless others saw him eat.

225
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,440
Another guy said

226
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,440
Frank kept

227
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,790
chasing new girls.

228
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,640
But his true love

229
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,400
turned out to be the girl with glass

230
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,640
he met in a summer camp
at the age of six.

231
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,470
Someone else said

232
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,960
that Frank was the drunkard

233
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,280
who streaked at the school anniversary

234
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,470
with his face covered.

235
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,350
On that day,

236
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,790
we were all smiling.

237
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,670
It was then that I realized

238
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Frank wasn't only

239
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,320
what I thought he was.

240
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
The real Frank

241
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,710
lived a varied life.

242
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,030
In our hearts,

243
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,640
we all had happy memories

244
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,710
with Frank.

245
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,030
I also hope

246
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,520
the memories between Mr. Lin and me

247
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,520
could be joyful

248
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,590
and happy.

249
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,840
I don't want

250
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,760
our memories to be sad.

251
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,520
However,

252
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,840
I just...

253
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,400
I just don't want it.

254
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,280
Silly girl,

255
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,640
we can still pray

256
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,790
for a miracle.

257
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,670
Many patients

258
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,590
actively take the treatment

259
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,230
and live positively.

260
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,960
Then they live for such a long time

261
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,790
that even doctors like us

262
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,520
can be surprised.

263
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,350
But I don't know

264
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,670
whether I can make it.

265
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,910
I also don't know

266
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,150
whether I can be strong enough.

267
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,910
Zhixiao,

268
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,590
you have me.

269
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,350
I will always

270
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,350
be there for you.

271
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,000
Dr. Gu,

272
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,520
I want you to sing a song for me.

273
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,880
Okay?

274
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,670
Mr. Lin, Ms. Li,

275
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,440
come and have breakfast.

276
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,150
Okay.

277
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,670
Or it'll get cold.

278
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,550
Be seated.

279
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,550
Look what I've got for you.

280
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,960
Your favorite wonton

281
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,790
with vegetable stuffing.

282
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,670
Have a taste.

283
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,470
Good. Good.

284
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,960
Enjoy it.

285
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,710
It smells good.

286
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:07,920
You have a cold?

287
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,800
Not serious.

288
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,520
I've just got croaky.

289
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,350
Have you taken the medicine?

290
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,280
Yes, yes.

291
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,110
In autumn, it's cold
in the morning and evening.

292
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,920
Put on one more coat when you go out.

293
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:15,950
Got it.

294
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,470
Does it taste good?

295
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,110
I haven't tasted it yet.

296
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,920
Taste it, then. Hurry.

297
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,470
Aren't you supposed to go out

298
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,680
and look for a job?

299
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,190
I'll stop looking for a job recently.

300
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,110
Forget it.

301
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,590
I have to prepare for my wedding, right?

302
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,000
You two should help me

303
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,230
and lend me a hand.

304
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,070
Look.

305
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,830
I downloaded this from the Internet.

306
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,110
It's the wedding plan.

307
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,520
A thick sheaf of it.

308
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,110
I can't prepare for the wedding alone.

309
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,280
You must help me.

310
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,310
Especially you, Lin.

311
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,070
What about Gu Wei?

312
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Doesn't he help?

313
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,800
He wants you to have the wedding alone?

314
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,070
What are you talking about?

315
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,070
Dr. Gu is

316
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,160
busy with work, okay?

317
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,280
Among us,

318
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,000
he's the only one

319
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,110
who has a job now.

320
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,590
He's so lucky.

321
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,640
Am I

322
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,560
your only daughter?

323
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,520
If I am, you must help me.

324
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,350
I won't...

325
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,710
I won't refuse to help you.

326
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,430
Don't puff.

327
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,800
What a weird sense of humor!

328
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,560
Right.

329
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,430
We have to help her.

330
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,800
So many good things
for weddings of this age.

331
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,430
Why didn't we have these things
when we got married?

332
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,190
Come on.

333
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,520
We got married so many years ago.

334
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,000
And now we're in the modern time.

335
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,560
On my daughter's wedding day,

336
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,640
she must be the most beautiful bride

337
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,110
in this world.

338
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,160
That's for sure.

339
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,310
Of course.

340
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,430
When you go pick the wedding dress,

341
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,470
I'll go with you.

342
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,000
Let me pick it.

343
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,640
I will pick the wedding dress

344
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,280
with a long and big train.

345
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,590
It looks so beautiful on TV.

346
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,070
Fine. Fine.

347
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,160
We'll let you pick it.

348
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,800
Okay?

349
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,000
You can pick a dress for yourself, too.

350
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,800
I'm quite old.

351
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,560
How can I wear that?

352
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,280
I'm serious.

353
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,470
No kidding.

354
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,760
(At the end of the funeral,)

355
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,470
(Frank's mother)

356
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,350
(made a memorial speech.)

357
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,710
(It was excerpted)

358
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,230
(from Frank's diary)

359
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,310
(when he was sick.)

360
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,520
(We can't decide)

361
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,640
(when to live or die.)

362
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,070
(But we can gracefully face)

363
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,280
(what we experienced)

364
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,920
(and cherish what we're experiencing.)

365
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,000
(And we can)

366
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,640
(always have hope)

367
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,230
(for what we will experience.)

368
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,760
(In this way,)

369
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,880
(we'll have no regrets)

370
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,590
(when we have to)

371
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,830
(bid farewell.)

372
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,920
How does it taste?

373
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,920
Is it good?

374
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,920
Too salty.

375
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:37,950
Salty?

376
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,470
Have some water, then.

377
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,190
Wait a minute.

378
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,640
Is it too hot?

379
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,520
Is it available to drink?

380
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,430
It's okay.

381
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,880
What's wrong with you today?

382
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,800
Are you out of your mind?

383
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,470
In our family, you have
the best taste in food.

384
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,470
The quality of dishes for my wedding

385
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,710
counts on you.

386
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,800
From now on,

387
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,710
I'll seriously protect you.

388
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,000
I'll offer you

389
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,350
all-round, wide-ranging,

390
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,760
careful, and sweet

391
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,560
service and protection round the clock.

392
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,110
What am I? A protected animal?

393
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,520
Yes, of course.

394
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,040
Continue, protected animal.

395
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,470
Try the next dish.

396
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,590
Okay. Next.

397
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,920
Try this fish.

398
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,280
- No?
- It doesn't taste good.

399
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,800
The fish, pass.

400
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,280
Don't eat the fried pork.

401
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,230
Try this.

402
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,000
You can't eat these two dishes.

403
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,470
Try the Sweet and Sour Fish.

404
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,070
It's too sweet.

405
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,950
Too sweet?

406
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
I don't think so.

407
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,230
Keep it if you like it.

408
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,040
No, no.

409
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,800
Now that you think it's too sweet,

410
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,520
I won't keep it.

411
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,230
Pass.

412
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,800
Why are you looking at me?

413
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,000
Continue with the next dish.

414
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,110
Try this.

415
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,040
Check how it tastes.

416
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,400
It tastes good. Good.

417
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,280
It's good?

418
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,590
I'll keep it.

419
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,680
Next.

420
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,000
Here.

421
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,680
After you.

422
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,070
Okay.

423
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,640
Here. Let me get some for you.

424
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,280
Let me do it.

425
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,680
(Mr. Lin.)

426
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,040
(Mr. Lin.)

427
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,280
(Lin.)

428
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,920
Dad!

429
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,110
What are you doing here, Zhixiao?

430
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,160
I want to sleep with you.

431
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,000
I want it.

432
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,230
Come on, sweetheart.

433
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,160
How old are you now?

434
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,520
Why do you still act like a baby?

435
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,280
Come on. Raise your head.

436
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,110
Let me give you a pillow.

437
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,280
What happened?

438
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,640
I just had a dream.

439
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,230
What did you dream of?

440
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,880
In the dream,

441
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,830
we went to try the dishes yesterday.

442
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,680
Lin went downstairs to pay the bill

443
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,950
and sneaked away,

444
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,280
leaving me there alone.

445
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,400
I couldn't even find my way back home.

446
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,160
Don't talk nonsense.

447
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,920
You know exactly

448
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,040
what happened yesterday.

449
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,520
Even if you really didn't find us,

450
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,760
couldn't you take a taxi back home

451
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,520
as an adult?

452
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,070
Or you would

453
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,160
ask the police

454
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,000
to drive you back,

455
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,640
Lin Zhixiao.

456
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,950
I just had a nightmare.

457
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
When I told you about it,

458
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,230
it would be harmless.

459
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,830
It wouldn't come true, then.

460
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,830
Get to sleep.

461
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,640
Aren't you leaving?

462
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,760
I'm not.

463
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,560
I'll stay here with you.

464
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:36,880
Anyway,

465
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,040
you can't sleep for a long time.

466
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,040
Dr. Gu will come

467
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,000
and visit you.

468
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,950
Don't you feel shy?

469
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,590
When you were little,

470
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,350
you liked to worm into our quilt

471
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,920
just like this.

472
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,110
Look at your poor handwriting.

473
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,230
When you were little,
I should have urged you

474
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,920
to practice your handwriting.

475
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,830
Then you wouldn't be writing

476
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,950
so disgracefully.

477
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,950
Seriously?

478
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,190
Disgracefully?

479
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,520
Just make do with it.

480
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,400
These are wedding invitations.

481
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,190
No one dares to complain
about my handwriting.

482
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,040
Just because these are
wedding invitations,

483
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,000
you should use better handwriting.

484
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,040
Let me check your handwriting, then.

485
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,230
Be right there. I'll go.

486
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,880
Your handwriting is...

487
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,430
- Aunt Li.
- Gu Wei.

488
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,000
You're right in time.

489
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,950
- We're writing the invitations.
- Just so-so.

490
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:38,760
Just so-so?

491
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,920
There you are.

492
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,400
Mr. Lin.

493
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:40,920
Gu.

494
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,760
Hurry.

495
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,880
Let Gu Wei check on you.

496
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,040
Your health matters more.

497
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Let's talk

498
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,160
about the handwriting later.

499
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,000
Off you go.

500
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,710
Gu, come.

501
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,950
Aunt Li, Zhixiao.

502
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,350
I'll get in

503
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,640
and check on Mr. Lin.

504
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,760
Okay.

505
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,070
Leave your coat to me.

506
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,950
What's wrong?

507
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,190
Zhixiao,

508
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,830
come on.

509
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,000
You're a beautiful girl,

510
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,470
but your handwriting is...

511
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,110
- It's really poor.
- Though you are

512
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,400
mocking me,

513
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,430
I'm still happy

514
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,710
to hear that.

515
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,880
You are?

516
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:32,800
Be seated.

517
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,880
Tell me the truth.

518
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,160
Did Lin Zhixiao

519
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,190
know my condition?

520
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,680
I'm sorry.

521
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
I failed to keep it from her.

522
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,520
I don't blame you.

523
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,070
I never dreamed

524
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,400
to keep it from her forever.

525
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,830
As for you and her...

526
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,800
You shouldn't have

527
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
too many secrets.

528
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,040
Actually, most of the time,

529
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,560
I don't have a problem with you.

530
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,110
It's just because
Zhixiao is my only daughter.

531
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,230
I just felt that the nurse

532
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,590
just carried her

533
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,160
out of the delivery room

534
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,400
and put her in my arms.

535
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,160
Instantly,

536
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,190
she's in a relationship.

537
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,520
She begins to cry and smile

538
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,680
because of a man.

539
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,800
In her life,

540
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,680
the man appears.

541
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,560
And in the future,

542
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,560
the man will even

543
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,280
take her away.

544
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,950
Whenever I think of this,

545
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,070
I really can't

546
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,350
be nice to you.

547
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,350
I understand.

548
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,230
I once asked you

549
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,470
a question.

550
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,560
You didn't answer me.

551
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,040
I didn't mean

552
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,800
to be so aggressive.

553
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,590
But now,

554
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,310
I have to make you answer.

555
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,400
Gu Wei,

556
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,760
can I entrust Lin Zhixiao to you

557
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,070
without concern?

558
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,560
Mr. Lin,

559
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,160
since the first day

560
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,560
Lin Zhixiao and I were
in a relationship,

561
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,470
I've treated her

562
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,680
as my wife.

563
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,430
Even if life changes

564
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,560
and people change too,

565
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,590
I will still try my best

566
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,310
to take care of her.

567
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,590
I will

568
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,830
spend the rest of my life
protecting her.

569
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,070
I'll be relieved, then.

570
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,680
Be seated.

571
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,310
Mr. Guoqing...

572
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,190
Don't write the invitation
for my friend.

573
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,710
Your handwriting is terrible.

574
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,680
Write the invitations

575
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,310
for your own friends.

576
00:28:59,310 --> 00:28:59,920
Here. Here.

577
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,070
Fine. Fine.

578
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,830
How is his condition?

579
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,310
I'm in a good condition, of course.

580
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,160
Li Huijuan.

581
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:14,950
Go.

582
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:15,830
I'll go grocery shopping with you.

583
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,190
But I haven't finished writing yet.

584
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,160
Then what will we have for dinner?

585
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,350
Leave the invitations to us.

586
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,160
Gu Wei and I will write them.

587
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,590
Go shopping.

588
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,000
Fine. Fine.

589
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,230
Write carefully, Lin Zhixiao.

590
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,590
Got it.

591
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,040
I'll ask Dr. Gu to write them.

592
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,830
Okay?

593
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,040
Be careful on your way.

594
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,350
Fine. Got it.

595
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,230
Look, Mr. Lin is getting

596
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,430
better and better.

597
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,310
These days, he's been accompanying me

598
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,430
to do the preparation work

599
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,520
for our wedding.

600
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
Like you said,

601
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,070
when he remains happy,

602
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,590
he'll get better and better.

603
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,190
Look.

604
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,070
He's getting better,

605
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,350
isn't he?

606
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,760
But he still needs

607
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,590
to have enough rest

608
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
and not get tired.

609
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,070
I know that.

610
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,830
I'll go see Sansan this afternoon

611
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,830
and let my father have half a day off.

612
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,680
I'll go back to the hospital.

613
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,950
I can drive you there.

614
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,000
Except for the E-invitations,

615
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,230
you're receiving

616
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,430
the first formal invitation

617
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,830
I have handed out.

618
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,160
Miss Sansan,

619
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,710
as we agreed,

620
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
we'll be the bridesmaid

621
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,280
for each other.

622
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,590
It's your turn.

623
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,000
What a surprise, Zhixiao!

624
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,710
You're the first one of us

625
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,310
who will get married.

626
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,680
Darn it, Dr. Gu.

627
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,470
He has exactly seduced

628
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,760
a pure girl.

629
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,070
If you say so,

630
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,350
you're his accomplice.

631
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,680
Without your help,

632
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,590
Dr. Gu and I

633
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,350
wouldn't have gone this far.

634
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,070
Do you remember

635
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,350
the thing you delivered me

636
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,590
when I visited his home
for the first time?

637
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,830
And do you remember that trip?

638
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,560
I just think

639
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,070
how time flies!

640
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,830
I really regret it.

641
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,470
Don't worry.

642
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,590
Even if I get married

643
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,560
and even if I have Dr. Gu,

644
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,710
you're still in my heart

645
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,830
as you used to be.

646
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,230
No matter how we got along,

647
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,280
we'll always get along like that.

648
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,040
I've bought the bridesmaid dress.

649
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,070
It's very beautiful.

650
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,000
But whether you look gorgeous

651
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,760
or terrible in that dress

652
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,400
depends on

653
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,350
how much you eat every day.

654
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,760
Don't worry.

655
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,070
I won't disgrace you.

656
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,830
Got it.

657
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,590
How is your preparation

658
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,350
for the wedding?

659
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,190
Is there anything

660
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,070
I can do for you?

661
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,190
Not at all.

662
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,280
Everything is ready, but...

663
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,830
But the invitations.

664
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,800
Nothing else is undone.

665
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,040
What about Gu Xiao?

666
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,070
Have you sent an invitation to him?

667
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,830
Yes.

668
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,190
He's in Australia.

669
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,310
Dr. Gu sent him

670
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,430
an E-invitation.

671
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,920
He hasn't replied yet.

672
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,280
Fine.

673
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,310
Anyway,

674
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,590
I'm too busy to think

675
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,560
about romantic things

676
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,520
with him.

677
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,230
For this cafe,

678
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,760
I've owed a big sum of money

679
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,470
to the bank.

680
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,040
From now on,

681
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,430
I'll be a competent career woman.

682
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,280
Come on,

683
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,560

Yeah.

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,280
Unfortunately, you and Ms. Li won't go.

that you can't even recognize me.

725
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,710
Who told you we wouldn't go?

726
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,280
We'll go.

727
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,470
Are you serious?

728
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,230
Didn't you always say

729
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,280
that you hated it most

730
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,520
to accompany Ms. Li and me
with the clothes shopping?

731
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,840
And you told me not to invite you

732
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
for the wedding dress shopping.

733
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,120
Recently,

734
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,430
I've done so many things with you.

735
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,120
I don't mind doing one more thing.

736
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,950
I'll just go.

737
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Mr. Lin,

738
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,230
I know you're the best.

739
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,320
Right?

740
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,710
Don't flatter me.

741
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,760
What's wrong?

742
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,760
Nothing.

743
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,910
I just worry about you.

744
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,280
You got up so late

745
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,710
and you're having breakfast slowly.

746
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,560
Don't you fear Gu will be impatient?

747
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,000
Fine, fine. I'll stop eating.

748
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,230
I'll go get prepared

749
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,630
and come out.

750
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,080
Fine.

751
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,910
You get prepared, too.

752
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,670
Okay. Okay.

753
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,280
I guess

754
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,600
he's already waiting downstairs.

755
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,670
Honey, how do you feel?

756
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,760
How are you?

757
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,390
Are you all right?

758
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,430
I'm fine.

759
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
Keep your voice down.

760
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,600
Don't let Zhixiao hear us.

761
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,950
What do we do? Are you really all right?

762
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,230
Honey,

763
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,360
shall we

764
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,520
not go with her?

765
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,320
We must go.

766
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:58,760
Don't worry.

767
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,910
Zhixiao is so happy.

768
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,150
I don't want...

769
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,430
I don't want to leave any regret

770
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,430
for her wedding.

771
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,800
But... But you...

772
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,000
I know.

773
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm running out of time.

774
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,710
These days,

775
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,910
I don't feel right at all.

776
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,800
Just let me

777
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,710
do as much for Zhixiao

778
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,040
as I can.

779
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,840
It's okay. I'm all right.

780
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,800
Look at you.

781
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,120
Don't...

782
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,390
Don't cry.

783
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,430
Let's go.

784
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,120
Where are they?

785
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,870
Ms. Li.

786
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:04,910
Mr. Lin.

787
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,150
Here we are.

788
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,430
What happened?

789
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,280
Nothing.

790
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,630
Your father asked for the razor.

791
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,190
When he couldn't find it,

792
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,560
he just blamed me.

793
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,360
Don't exaggerate.

794
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,080
I just asked you for a favor.

795
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,710
She...

796
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,800
I'll go get my bag.

797
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,320
Forget it.

798
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,360
You still look handsome
when you're unshaven.

799
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,800
You bet.

800
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,190
- Let's go.
- Hurry.

801
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,100
(Jinyi Bridge)

802
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,040
Gu Wei, be seated for a while.

803
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,430
Are you ready?

804
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,630
The bride is coming.

805
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,080
How do I look?

806
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,000
Do I look beautiful?

807
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,910
You look gorgeous, Zhixiao.

808
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:03,870
You're beautiful.

809
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,760
So beautiful.

810
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,190
Why do you look so dumb?

811
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,430
Why are you taking photos already?

812
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,190
Yeah. Yeah.

813
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,430
I want more photos as a keepsake.

814
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,910
Are... Are you good at taking photos,

815
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,800
Mr. Lin?

816
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,560
I do better than your mother.

817
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,150
Nonsense. I'm good at it.

818
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,910
Come on. Look at me.

819
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,190
Smile.

820
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,630
Smile.

821
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,710
Yes. Smile like that.

822
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,230
Don't move. Don't move.

823
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,520
- Don't snatch my phone.
- Don't move.

824
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,840
Look.

825
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,560
The photos are blurred.

826
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:23,870
Look over there.

827
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,910
Look.

828
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
Nice photos.

829
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,230
She's so beautiful.

830
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,800
That's right.

831
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,280
Look.

832
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,080
My hands shake.

833
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,760
Mr. Lin, Mr. Lin,

834
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,120
shall we rehearse

835
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,560
the red carpet part

836
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,840
of the wedding?

837
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:40,800
Now?

838
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,120
Yeah.

839
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,230
Good idea.

840
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,360
I'm not in a formal suit today.

841
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,670
For... Forget it.

842
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,710
It's okay.

843
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,630
You're the bride's father.

844
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,430
You can pick some suits.

845
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,080
Later,

846
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,800
I can take a photo

847
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,600
of all of you.

848
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,600
Come and pick some suits.

849
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,120
Go ahead. Go.

850
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,430
It's free of charge.
Try on any suits you like.

851
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,520
- Go ahead.
- Go, Mr. Lin.

852
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,040
I've picked two suits for you.

853
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,120
Let me check.

854
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,150
How about that blue suit?

855
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,630
Thank you.

856
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,190
You're welcome.

857
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,600
Try it on. Don't be a killjoy!

858
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,000
Well...

859
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,430
Now that it's free, I'll try it on.

860
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:25,950
Go.

861
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:26,840
Okay. Okay.

862
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,150
The fitting room is over here.

863
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,150
Here I go.

864
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,800
What's wrong, Zhixiao?

865
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,600
I'm just...

866
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,080
I'm just thinking

867
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,910
that my father is so thin.

868
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:01,390
How...?

869
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,910
