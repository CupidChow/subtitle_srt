18
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,360
I have a question to ask you.

19
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,120
Say it.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,630
Since I've agreed to
go on the date with you,

21
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,160
I'm your boyfriend-to-be, right?

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,230
Just a filler.

23
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,550
Then I'm not going.

24
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,440
I'll ask Eric.

25
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,960
I'll go. I'll go.

26
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,470
You're so fast looking for a back-up.

27
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,160
No hesitation at all!

28
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,390
Gu Xiao, come back.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,800
This is the account of the first month.

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,440
Take a look.

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,080
No need.

32
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,440
I don't care.

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,600
You're the boss.

34
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,960
At least hear me through.

35
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,190
Our profit

36
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,190
for this month

37
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,880
is around 20,000 yuan.

38
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,110
It's not a lot,

39
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,800
but barely satisfactory

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,960
for a newly

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,440
opened store.

42
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:46,960
Next month,

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,160
I'll adjust

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
the supply channels.

45
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,550
Because the purchase price
of one beer

46
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,960
is too expensive.

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,110
I have talked with

48
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,080
the new supplier today.

49
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,390
And next month,

50
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,160
we need a relatively large

51
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,550
promotion fee.

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,440
To do some publicity

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,320
on the platform of group buying

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,270
and new media,

55
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,190
I've hired

56
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,160
a very good photographer

57
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
to take some good photos

58
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,240
of our shop.

59
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,800
Wait, wait a minute.

60
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,440
You mean,

61
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,670
we have made money?

62
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,720
What do you think?

63
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,320
Otherwise, why do you open a shop?

64
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,910
Because I…

65
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,830
If we don't make money,

66
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,960
I'll be an incapable

67
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,080
shop manager.

68
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,440
You can fire me anytime.

69
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,240
Sansan, let me tell you,

70
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,600
as long as you are happy,

71
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,440
it doesn't matter
if we can make money or not.

72
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,670
I opened this café for you,

73
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,270
how could I fire you?

74
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,270
Listen up,

75
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,360
this is a serious

76
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,550
job for me.

77
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,750
If you say that,

78
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,440
I'll resign.

79
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,320
Don't resign. Don't.

80
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,960
I won't say it again.

81
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,360
What?

82
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,960
Don't kiss me from now on.

83
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,750
And,

84
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,240
if you ever bring

85
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,800
your friends to drink

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,720
in your own shop

87
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
and don't keep the bills,

88
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,800
I'll resign, too.

89
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,830
I won't do it again.

90
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,440
But I can't promise that

91
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,600
I won't kiss you.

92
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,910
I don't know who hugged me

93
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,360
and kissed me last time.

94
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,830
You…!

95
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,440
Gu Wei.

96
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,950
It's okay.

97
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,230
I'm good.

98
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,760
You look

99
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,440
very special today.

100
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,320
Thanks.

101
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,670
Lin Zhixiao,

102
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,550
are you out of your mind

103
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,350
dressing like that?

104
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,790
What are you saying?

105
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,320
It's perfect this way.

106
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,350
Let's go.

107
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,880
Your marriage is good.

108
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,640
I know, right?

109
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,830
Do you see these threads?

110
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,200
It means there are
many good marriages.

111
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,230
I am attractive to girls.

112
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,670
- But…
- Watch your language.

113
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,950
I'll only love one person.

114
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,200
Right?

115
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,110
Right.

116
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,440
It's not safe.

117
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,350
Greasy.

118
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,110
It's so beautiful here.

119
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,230
How come you take me

120
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,950
to an ancient town?

121
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,350
I saw the introduction
of this ancient town

122
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,200
- posted by you.
- So beautiful. Take a picture for me.

123
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,160
Do you like it?

124
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,720
Let's take pictures.

125
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,070
Yes.

126
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,950
Sansan. Sansan.

127
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,790
Let's go somewhere else.

128
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,440
Let's go, Zhixiao.

129
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,440
Come on.

130
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,200
Let's go.

131
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,790
Come on.

132
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,350
Let's go.

133
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,710
Zhixiao.

134
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,440
Come with me.

135
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,440
What?

136
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,590
Wait here for me.

137
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,790
I'll go buy something.

138
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:19,910
Zhixiao.

139
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,350
How are your feet?

140
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,110
This is…

141
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,960
Lin Zhixiao,

142
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,790
you look particularly tall today.

143
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,840
You look good. Very good.

144
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,550
Gu Xiao!

145
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,200
I'm thirsty.

146
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,550
It's a compliment.

147
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,550
I'd like to drink Coke.
Hurry up and buy it for me.

148
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,520
You look good today.

149
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,670
- Thank you.
- I want to drink Coke too.

150
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,470
Go with him.

151
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,080
Go!

152
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,710
Come on.

153
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,280
Okay.

154
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,910
Wait for me.

155
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,520
How are your feet?

156
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,550
Listen, I'm exhausted.

157
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,960
For such a short path,

158
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,230
I've sprained my feet four times.

159
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,230
It's so hard, so hard for me.

160
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,200
I saw.

161
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,670
But you never fell.

162
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,840
You got good balance.

163
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,590
I'm pretty good, am I?

164
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,230
Yes, very talented.

165
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,670
You never wear high heels.

166
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,840
What's wrong with you today?

167
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,150
Why are you wearing them today?

168
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,320
Go ask Gu Wei.

169
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,280
He said,

170
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,150
I look cute,

171
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,760
like a child.

172
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,470
I just want to prove to him

173
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,710
that I can be classy

174
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,760
and fancy,

175
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,030
and elegant too!

176
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,910
God knows

177
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,280
he brought me to this kind of place.

178
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,320
My feet are worn out.

179
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,200
Look at the shoes.

180
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,400
Is this reasonable? Uh?

181
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,550
He is here.

182
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,880
Wear this.

183
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,520
What's this?

184
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,640
Zhixiao,

185
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,790
you will look

186
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,110
really beautiful

187
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,200
with this pair of shoes.

188
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,350
Let me take a picture of you.

189
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,350
Don't bother.

190
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,000
Dr. Gu,

191
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,880
your taste

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,350
is so ethnic.

193
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,080
It doesn't match with

194
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,110
Zhixiao's style at all.

195
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,030
This pair of shoes

196
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,030
is pretty.

197
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,470
Purple and cute.

198
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,470
I like it.

199
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,550
But I think my shoes

200
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,440
are comfortable.

201
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,350
No need to change.

202
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,350
Your feet will get hurt

203
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,550
if you walk here in high heels.

204
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,200
No, they won't.

205
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,590
They are really comfortable.

206
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,520
Have you ever watched

207
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,670
a foreign movie?

208
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,790
It was a woman who raced with

209
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,760
dinosaurs in high heels

210
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,790
and she outran the dinosaurs.

211
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,590
I feel like

212
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,760
I'm that woman right now.

213
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,760
See?

214
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
I can walk. I can jump.

215
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,440
It's no problem.

216
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,320
Fine.

217
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,790
Sit down.

218
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:15,790
Okay.

219
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,760
Let me know anytime

220
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,110
if you want to change.

221
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,590
Okay, okay.

222
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,320
Where are Gu Xiao and Jin Shi?

223
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,000
They went to buy water in the front.

224
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,080
I'll go find them.

225
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,670
Okay.

226
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,910
I'll wait here.

227
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,440
So cute.

228
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,910
These little purple shoes.

229
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,280
What should I do?

230
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,640
I brought tape.

231
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,200
Take it out, what are you waiting for?

232
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,550
Taking photos is a good idea.

233
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,640
Ask them to stand there.

234
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,910
Jin Shi.

235
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,200
I want to take photos.

236
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
Come on, let's take photos.

237
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,350
Let's go.

238
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,080
Change it.

239
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,760
Come over.

240
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,150
Come on, let's take a picture.

241
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,960
One, two, three.

242
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,030
Let me help you.

243
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,320
Three, two, one.

244
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,790
"Cheese"!

245
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,520
So nice. So sweet.

246
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,880
Gu Xiao, I want to take a picture, too!

247
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
For real?

248
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,840
Come on.

249
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,670
Really?

250
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,880
I want to take a kiss picture, too.

251
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,110
Zhixiao, help us.

252
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,000
Take this for me.

253
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,230
Come.

254
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,960
Look at the camera.

255
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,440
One, two, three.

256
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,320
There.

257
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,710
Zhixiao, your turn.

258
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,440
Go, Dr. Gu.

259
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,760
Closer.

260
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,150
Your hand. Your hand.

261
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,710
Oh my god.

262
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,840
Take this.

263
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,670
Around her shoulders.

264
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,400
Understand?

265
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,080
And your head, a little closer.

266
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,030
A big smile.

267
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,790
Be intimate.

268
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,000
Be more intimate!

269
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,400
Come.

270
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,400
Three, two, one.

271
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,470
Say "cheese".

272
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,230
Take a look. How is it?

273
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,840
- What are you doing?
- It's good.

274
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,670
- Isn't it?
- Post it in the WeChat moments.

275
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,710
I have done it.

276
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,640
No.

277
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,080
We said we're posting together.

278
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,640
Look.

279
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,760
But I've done posting it.

280
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,440
Look.

281
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,670
Dr. Gu,

282
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,910
I'll send you the photo.

283
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,000
How about posting it
in your WeChat moments?

284
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,400
Sorry,

285
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,110
I only post work-related content.

286
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,350
I'll post it again.

287
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,840
Let me see ours.

288
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,840
See my foot!

289
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,550
Here.

290
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,400
I'll introduce you

291
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,440
our specialty.

292
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,550
Love Noodle.

293
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,670
This noodle is

294
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,640
very meaningful.

295
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,320
Thanks.

296
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,760
What meaning?

297
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,200
This Love Noodle

298
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,520
is for a couple

299
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,550
who can eat together

300
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,230
from two ends of the noodle,

301
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,110
and finish eating

302
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,000
in the right middle.

303
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,710
A couple who has eaten

304
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,350
our "Love Noodle"

305
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,710
will be together forever.

306
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,710
Really?

307
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,550
Of course.

308
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,550
Forever.

309
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,440
The couples

310
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,280
who have eaten our noodles

311
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,640
are all married.

312
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,110
I can guarantee you.

313
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,520
I'd like a bowl of love noodles.

314
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,550
- Can... we order that, too?
- Okay.

315
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,230
Okay.

316
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,790
Okay.

317
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,880
Since we're out on a date,

318
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,550
we surely can't miss

319
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,760
this specialty for couples.

320
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,840
Right, Zhixiao?

321
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,710
Exactly.

322
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,640
Do you want the love noodle, too?

323
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,790
Two bowls for us two couples.

324
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,320
Okay.

325
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,080
Two couples.

326
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,910
We…we want this, too.

327
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,200
Okay.

328
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,790
The ordinary noodles cost 38 yuan,

329
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,790
but the Love Noodle 88.

330
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,550
Ms., the price is not reasonable.

331
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,760
This Love Noodle

332
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,080
has a meaning.

333
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,550
I'll take order

334
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,320
for you first, okay?

335
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,280
You two can take your time.

336
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,550
Call me when you're ready.

337
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,280
Fine.

338
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,960
Zhixiao.

339
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,710
How about we just

340
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,230
order two ordinary noodles?

341
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,910
The Love Noodle is not enough for us.

342
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,030
And it's too expensive.

343
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Okay, you make the call.

344
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,350
Come, your hands.

345
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,230
No, no.

346
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,760
I'll pass.

347
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,000
It's clean.

348
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,150
Your noodles.

349
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,840
Thanks.

350
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,790
Please enjoy.

351
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,590
Thanks.

352
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,960
Please enjoy.

353
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,710
What?

354
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,790
It's broken.

355
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,030
How about

356
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,320
we eat one bowl of noodles?

357
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,470
I can't eat up the whole bowl

358
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,030
by myself.

359
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,350
Okay.

360
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,840
Zhixiao.

361
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,880
Close your eyes.

362
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,560
Why?

363
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,400
Close your eyes.

364
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,280
You have tape on your eyelid.

365
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,920
I need to use the toilet.

366
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,800
You guys enjoy it.

367
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,680
Wait.

368
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,040
So is the other eyelid.

369
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,520
Tear it up yourself.

370
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,760
Got it.

371
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,190
Keep eating.

372
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,830
- Zhixiao.
- Zhixiao.

373
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,400
Keep eating!

374
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:47,880
Zhixiao.

375
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,920
Why yell at my brother?

376
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Don't mind her, Wei.

377
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,070
Go ahead and eat, Wei.

378
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,880
It's good.

379
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,040
Zhixiao. Zhixiao. Zhixiao.

380
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,350
Zhixiao.

381
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,830
Don't be angry.

382
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,950
We'll figure this out.

383
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,950
Did you see what he did?

384
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
What are you two couples doing here?

385
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,800
Showing affection?

386
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,070
I'm going crazy!

387
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
We're here to help you.

388
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,680
But Dr. Gu

389
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,160
just doesn't buy it.

390
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,950
Yeah.

391
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,350
Zhixiao,

392
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,280
I think

393
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,040
we should

394
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,070
split up later.

395
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,710
Maybe Dr. Gu

396
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,920
is too shy to be

397
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,070
intimate with you

398
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,830
in front of us.

399
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,430
Exactly.

400
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,230
We will

401
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,950
leave you two

402
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,830
some privacy later.

403
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,560

Should we head back?

426
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,470
There's a firework show

427
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,640
tonight.

428
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,000
Can we go back

429
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,230
after watching it?

430
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,110
Okay, you decide.

431
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,280
Look.

432
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,160
They're pretty, aren't they?

433
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,230
Of course. I like them.

434
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,470
Zhixiao.

435
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,800
Actually, I wanted to tell you

436
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,110
that you look beautiful

437
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,280
in this way.

438
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,680
But wearing high heels

439
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,880
would hurt your bones.

440
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,280
And wearing off-the-shoulder clothes

441
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,470
during this season

442
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,000
is easy to catch a cold.

443
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,760
I just thought

444
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,830
this is our first date.

445
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,310
I want to look pretty

446
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,190
and impress you.

447
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,950
But we will have

448
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,040
many, many dates.

449
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,710
So,

450
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,520
it doesn't matter
for the first impression.

451
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,160
In my eyes,

452
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,040
nothing matters more than that

453
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,310
you're healthy and comfortable.

454
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,710
Maybe I'm not

455
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,800
a romantic person.

456
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,640
I think you look good

457
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,040
no matter what you wear.

458
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,950
You said you're not romantic,

459
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,310
but you know how to say sweet talk.

460
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,230
This is not sweet talk.

461
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,760
I'm telling the truth.

462
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,000
Look, fireworks!

463
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,920
Make a wish.

464
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,640
Why don't you make a wish?

465
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,880

466

As your agent,

488
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,800
I must say,

489
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,000
your performance

490
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,350
is amazing!

491
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,000

Have I ever let you down?

495
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,520
But the best show

496
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,680
must be next time!

497
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,110
Oh, right.

498
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,590
The next show…

499
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,230
The next show is with the orchestra

500
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,070
of Huaqing University,

501
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,590
right?

502
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,310
Yes.

503
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,760
The sponsor wants to
extend the showtime.

504
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,710
They chose one extra music,

505
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,590
which requires another cello.

506
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,160
I don't worry about you, of course.

507
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
But the students have

508
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,070
so much pressure practicing.

509
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,830
I'm afraid they don't
have time to practice.

510
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,070
What do we do?

511
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,040
It's simple.

512
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,000
Find another cellist

513
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,350
among the students

514
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,760
and let her practice this

515
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,800
alone.

516
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,190
Do you have someone in mind?

517
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:14,710
Good.

518
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,830
It's a way to go.

519
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,470
But I'm too busy in the prep period.

520
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,680
You need to watch
the performance level.

521
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,950
Don't worry about it.

522
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,110
I will never break

523
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,190
my own reputation.

524
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,640
Okay.

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,800
What's wrong, Shao?

527
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,680
Nothing.

528
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,950
I'm just thinking,

529
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,190
I'm going to school

530
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,160
for rehearsal.

531
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,430
In that case,

532
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,470
I can just

533
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,560
announce the news.

534
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,110
Good.

535
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,830
Of course you can.

536
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,880
Hurry up!

537
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,040
Take my cello.

538
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,110
Get in the car!

539
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,880
Hurry!

540
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,350
Let's go, go, go!

541
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,470
Why were you in such a hurry?

542
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,350
Was Mr. Lin chasing after you?

543
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,190
Pretty much it.

544
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,430
But it was Ms. Li.

545
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,880
I've almost got caught.

546
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,070
If she finds it,

547
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,830
she and Mr. Lin would

548
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,280
watch me all the time,

549
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,800
and I would have no freedom.

550
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,590
Here.

551
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,110
For you.

552
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,830
Make a quick supplement

553
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,110
to avoid hypoglycemia.

554
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,430
Did you make this yourself?

555
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,040
Yes, it's healthier.

556
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,110
What?

557
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,230
Don't you like it?

558
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,000
I do.

559
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,310
But I'm afraid
I'll spill it in your car.

560
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,310
It's okay.

561
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,760
I can get it washed.

562
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,110
Can we have dinner tonight?

563
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,280
Not tonight, I'm afraid.

564
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
I have a paper to revise.

565
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:56,880
It's fine.

566
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,470
Work is more important.

567
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,350
We'll find another time.

568
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,040
If I finish earlier,

569
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,110
wait for me at home.

570
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,110
We can go for a walk.

571
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,590
Walk?

572
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,430
Good habit.

573
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,350
Is that a "no"?

574
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:14,680
No.

575
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,430
Yes, of course.

576
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,950
I have to go.

577
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,110
There's still some time.

578
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,310
I'll walk you to the entrance.

579
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,230
Delivery message.

580
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,680
I bought two his-and-hers shirts.

581
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,280
As for yours,

582
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:50,950
I was afraid that Mr. Lin would

583
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,110
find out when I mailed it home,

584
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,590
so I sent it to the hospital.

585
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,560
Remember to check it.

586
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,760
Wh-What?

587
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:57,880
Don't worry.

588
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,590
I marked

589
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,590
"school supplies",

590
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,590
they won't find out.

591
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,350
No.

592
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,040
I mean, what did you buy?

593
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,310
His-and-hers shirts.

594
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,070
I saw it in Yin Xi's

595
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,280
Moments post.

596
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,280
So I asked for the link.

597
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,590
This is it.

598
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,190
Two halves piece together

599
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,280
one whole heart.

600
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,000
Is it cute?

601
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,430
Zhixiao,

602
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,470
are you sure there are adult men

603
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,800
willing to wear this kind of thing?

604
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,400
Yes, there are.

605
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,040
Jin Shi wears it.

606
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,560
I'm sorry, Zhixiao.

607
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,110
I will never wear that.

608
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,880
It's inappropriate for my age.

609
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,190
It's all right.

610
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,350
It looks good on me, too.

611
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,540
(Teaching Building 2)

612
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,280
Shao Jiang.

613
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,590
Zhixiao.

614
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,880
Hi, Dr. Gu.

615
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,280
It's been a long time.

616
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,710
Dr. Gu still remembers me.

617
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,190
Surely I do.

618
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,040
Shao Jiang, you are back.

619
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,470
Yes.

620
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,560
Arrived last night.

621
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,470
The tour is over.

622
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,680
I've followed many music criticism

623
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,110
accounts recently.

624
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,590
It's all compliments about you.

625
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,000
They say you played very well,

626
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,430
and hope you can play more.

627
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,520
Congratulations, Shao Jiang.

628
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,470
Thanks, Zhixiao.

629
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,470
It's impossible

630
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,830
to play more.

631
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,830
But,

632
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,430
we're going to add
another piece of music

633
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,160
in my collaboration
with your school orchestra.

634
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,160
One more cello is needed now.

635
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,590
So, you mean…

636
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,310
I recommended you.

637
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,160
So as long as

638
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,400
you play well enough,

639
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,160
we can go on

640
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,470
stage together.

641
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,880
There will be a lot of

642
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
music critics and music agents

643
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,430
in attendance that day.

644
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,950
Does that mean,

645
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,110
if I perform well,

646
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,760
I may be signed up

647
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,710
by a big company?

648
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,230
Yes, you're right.

649
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,190
So,

650
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,160
do you accept my invitation?

651
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,190
My only request is that

652
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,560
you must stay with me

653
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,230
for practice and coordination.

654
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,590
No problem. Don't worry, Shao Jiang.

655
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,230
I will practice hard.

656
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:05,950
Okay.

657
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,640
Then I will

658
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,430
wait for you in the practice room.

659
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,830
Okay, see you later.

660
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,760
Yeah.

661
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,000
Bye, Dr. Gu.

662
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,000
We can have dinner sometime.

663
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,430
Sure. No problem.

664
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,710
Bye.

665
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,470
Bye.

666
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,950
What's wrong?

667
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,470
What?

668
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,710
Shao Jiang is just my senior,

669
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,680
you know it.

670
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,680
You're the only person

671
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,110
in my heart.

672
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,710
Of course, I know.

673
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,230
And I also know that

674
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,680
playing at a concert is really

675
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,070
important for your career.

676
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,560
So you have to work hard.

677
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,160
If I have time,

678
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,710
I will back you up on the scene.

679
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,710
Thank you for your
support and encouragement!

680
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,760
Go in.

681
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,710
Here.

682
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:18,830
Go.

683
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:20,880
Bye.

684
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,230
Liu's girlfriend got stolen
by someone.

685
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,520
Do you know about that, too?

686
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,280
Of course.

687
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,520
By her fitness coach.

688
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:45,830
Yeah, yeah.

689
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,590
That's right.

690
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,590
And that guy is

691
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,070
his girlfriend's

692
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,710
first boyfriend.

693
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,110
What are you talking about
during work?

694
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,520
Wei,

695
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,190
the patient in Bed 7

696
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,160
will stop taking the medicine today.

697
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,950
Pay attention to the heart rate.

698
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,520
Okay.

699
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,040
Give me another

700
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,000
order form.

701
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,470
Here.

702
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,230
Oh, right.

703
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,880
Send me the

704
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,800
medical records later.

705
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,830
Okay.

706
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,070
Catch you later.

707
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,840
Why do you give me this?

708
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,520
All right.

709
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,870
Give it to Bed 7.

710
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,910
Dr. Gu, wait a minute.

711
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,710
You have a parcel
arrived this morning.

712
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,670
I forgot to give it to you.

713
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,910
What's good about
the first boyfriend?

714
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,470
Focus on work.

715
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,430
No gossip.

716
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,600
Of course, the first boyfriend is good.

717
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,360
Especially he is handsome.

718
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,080
How nice!

719
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,800
Yeah.

720
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,560
What's this?

721
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,670
This is…

722
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,950
I think in this section,

723
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,390
the fade-in symbol…

724
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,600
Um…

725
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,560
There has to be enough crescendo.

726
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,910
Like this,

727
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,080
and this,

728
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,230
and this.

729
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,280
Once you play the
fade-in to the utmost,

730
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,560
I think this section would

731
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,760
sound great.

732
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,950
No problem at all.

733
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:05,950
Okay.

734
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:06,760
Zhixiao.

735
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,870
Gu Wei.

736
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,360
Sorry, Shao Jiang.

737
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,040
What brings you here?

738
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,230
Did you miss me?

739
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,320
Wait.

740
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,360
You said you won't wear this.

741
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,760
It's good to
change the style sometimes.

742
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,320
Oh yeah?

743
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,230
You said you have work to do

744
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,360
tonight, didn't you?

745
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,630
Why are you here?

746
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,950
The paper is

747
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:33,670
postponed.

748
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,710
So tonight…

749
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,360
We can

750
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,520
have dinner tonight.

751
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,230
Great!

752
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,120
No more walk!

753
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,120
Love your director so much!

754
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,150
You can, but not necessary.

755
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,390
Are you done?

756
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
Pack up and let's go eating.

757
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,040
Wait a minute.

758
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,560
Shao Jiang.

759
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,190
It's about dinner time.

760
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,360
No wonder I feel a little hungry.

761
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,320
Then…

762
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,320
Do you want to

763
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,520
eat with us?

764
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,080
Is it okay?

765
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,670
That's great.

766
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,040
But I'm afraid Dr. Gu
is not happy about it.

767
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,630
I'm good.

768
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,080
Good if Dr. Gu doesn't mind.

769
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,390
I'll join you then.

770
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,150
Okay.

771
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,670
Sorry,

772
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,040
we young people

773
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,840
just don't get

774
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,470
other people's polite formula.

775
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,120
This morning you said

776
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,000
we can eat together sometime.

777
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,600
There is no time like the present.

778
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,910
I think today is the time.

779
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,150
Let's go.

780
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,390
Done packing?

781
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,150
Let's go.

782
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,360
I just recommended

783
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,870
your favorite restaurant

784
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,840
near the school

785
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,360
to Dr. Gu.

786
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Dr. Gu said yes.

787
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,840
Right, Dr. Gu?

788
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,390
Yes.

789
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,870
As long as it's clean and healthy.

790
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,600
- Let's go.
- Go.

791
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,150
Go.

792
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:14,520
Shao Jiang, Shao Jiang.

793
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,630
Sit over here.

794
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,150
They will serve dishes there.

795
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,520
Okay.

796
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,870
Zhixiao,

797
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:23,950
you are

798
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,430
under the conditioner outlet.

799
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,840
It is easy to catch a cold

800
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,080
and get arthritis.

801
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,910
Sit over here.

802
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,600
Let's ask Shao Jiang

803
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,630
to make the order.

804
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,630
Shao Jiang, please.

805
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,600
Thank you

806
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,150
for taking care of my Zhixiao.

807
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,360
Zhixiao, you should make the order.

808
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,000
We came here often
before I went abroad.

809
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,360
She knows what's best to order.

810
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,120
Okay, I'll do it then.

811
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,120
What would you like to drink?

812
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,280
Water is fine.

813
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,040
What about you, Shao Jiang?

814
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,080
Just the drink

815
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,280
we used to order.

816
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Grains beverage, right?

817
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,950
I see. I'll order now.

818
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,840
Zhixiao, wait.

819
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,150
Are there peanuts

820
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,040
in grains beverage?

821
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,150
You are allergic to peanuts.

822
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,630
Shall we give it

823
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,560
a second thought?

824
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,360
No, don't worry.

825
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,630
There are no peanuts
in this restaurant.

826
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,360
We can eat and drink
whatever we want.

827
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,430
Right, Shao Jiang?

828
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,630
Of course.

829
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:22,630
You've earned

830
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,840
this by yourself.

831
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,760
Remember?

832
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,840
Of course, in my mind, okay?

833
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,280
I remember that

834
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,910
I was in junior high that year.

835
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,360
And you went to college.

836
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,080
I went to see the performance

837
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,320
of your school orchestra.

838
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,630
And I joined you for dinner here

839
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,040
after you finished.

840
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,840
I was too happy

841
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,280
and forgot that I'm allergic to peanuts.

842
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,150
And I ate a lot of it.

843
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,000
And finally, I got allergic.

844
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
I went to the bathroom

845
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,150
and when I came back,

846
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,630
I found your whole face

847
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,150
was swollen

848
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,760
and covered in red rashes.

849
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,390
The manager was freaked out.

850
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:52,840
When he accompanied us

851
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,910
to the hospital,

852
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,150
he was shaking when he spoke.

853
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,670
He said

854
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,120
he would never add peanuts

855
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,760
to any dishes anymore.

856
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,470
I remember

857
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,470
your hands shaking when you

858
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,520
called the police,

859
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,560
like a shaking bow.

860
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:09,320
And then

861
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,600
the teacher who was leading the team

862
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,080
was almost crying, do you remember?

863
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,600
It was Mr. Zhou.

864
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,870
Not Mr. Zhou.

865
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,320
It was Mr. Yao.

866
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,910
Mr. Yao?

867
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,630
Yeah, the one with glasses.

868
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,120
You always mixed

869
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,560
them two.

870
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,630
Yeah, right.

871
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,150
The one with glasses is Mr. Yao.

872
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,000
It was so fun.

873
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,120
Sorry,

874
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,080
you may not know

875
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,320
what we're talking about.

876
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,150
No, it's interesting.

877
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,910
Very good.

878
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,120
Waitress.

879
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,430
Hello.

880
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,040
We're done. Thanks.

881
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,120
You are welcome.

882
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,000
Thanks.

883
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,150
I need to use the toilet.

884
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,000
Lin Zhixiao is

885
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,150
my girlfriend now.

886
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,120
I know.

887
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,150
But in this society,

888
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,360
as long as you're not married,

889
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,000
I've still got the chance.

890
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,360
Maybe you think

891
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,470
I'm not competitive.

892
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,000
But you've seen it.

893
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,320
Nothing can replace the memories

894
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:09,910
and habits between us.

895
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,000
You two are so different in age.

896
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,600
I'm the same age as her.

897
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,230
What are you talking about?

898
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,150
Nothing.

899
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,000
We're discussing

900
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,320
how good the food is

901
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,840
at this restaurant.

902
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,430
Excuse me.

903
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,280
Hello?

904
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,600
Dr. Gu, emergency!

905
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,710
Please come back.

906
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,870
Okay, I see.

907
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:46,950
What's up?

908
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,360
Sorry, Zhixiao.

909
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,760
There's an emergency
in the hospital.

910
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,230
I have to go back now.

911
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
So suddenly?

912
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,520
Dr. Gu is so busy.

913
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,870
But it's okay.

914
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,430
I can take care of Lin Zhixiao.

915
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,520
Work matters most. Just go.

916
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,280
Let me walk you out.

917
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,000
Wait a moment, Shao Jiang.

918
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'll walk him out.

919
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,470
Let's go.

920
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,950
Let's go.

921
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,470
What's wrong with you?

922
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,120
Why do you look

923
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,760
unhappy today?

924
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,800
Did anything happen in the hospital?

925
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,320
Yes.

926
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:31,760
Is everything alright?

927
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,470
It's fine. Wait a minute.

928
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,390
Why are you calling a taxi?

929
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,950
Are you not driving back?

930
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,630
This is for you.

931
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,520
For me?

932
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,320
I… I haven't eaten yet.

933
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,840
Eating too much at night
is bad for your stomach.

934
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,950
Go home and have a rest.

935
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,840
It's not safe at night.

936
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,000
But Shao Jiang

937
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,670
is alone now…

938
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,280
Shao Jiang is an adult.

939
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,710
He can take care of himself.

940
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,520
You don't have to worry about him.

941
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,870
Be good. Get in.

942
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,150
But you…

943
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,230
Don't worry. Get in the car.

944
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,910
Sir, please drive.

945
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,520
Lin Zhixiao,

946
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,630
call me when you reach home.

947
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,220
(Shao Jiang, Dr. Gu said it's too late.
He asked me to go home.)

948
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:11,390
Hello? Xia.

949
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,150
Where are you performing?

950
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,710
In a bar.

951
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,430
Li's friend owns it.

952
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,520
Okay, send me the location.

953
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,120
I'm coming over.

954
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,000
What happened?

955
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,470
You sound not happy.

956
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
I need to vent.

957
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,390
It's the Paganini show tonight.

958
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,870
Okay, waiting for you.

959
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,870
Okay.

960
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,900
So you agree with me

961
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,260
=The Oath of Love=
calling you "cutie"?

962
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:55,980
(Lin & Gu Sweet Little Theater)
Sure.

963
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,540
(Lin & Gu Sweet Little Theater)
I think

964
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,580
"cutie" is

965
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,620
to describe

966
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,300
all good things.

967
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:00,740
Think about it.

968
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:01,980
You can't be beautiful

969
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,220
because you're cute.

970
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:03,740
But if

971
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,140
you're beautiful,

972
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,060
you are also cute.

973
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,620
Right?

974
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,820
Seems I have said it oppositely.

975
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,180
I mean…

976
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,540
It's just that…

977
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,980
If you are beautiful and good-natured,

978
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,540
- then you're cute.
- Yes.

979
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,100
But if you

980
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,420
just look good

981
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,100
and you are bad-tempered,

982
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,380
then you can't be cute.

983
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,780
Then you will always
be my little cutie.

984
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,420
You asked me when did I know

985
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,820
you like me, right?

986
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,020
Probably the moment
you came to the hospital

987
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,540
to play the cello for me.

988
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,060
You knew but you

989
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,460
still refused me.

990
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,060
I didn't refuse.

991
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,860
I just didn't know how to respond,

992
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,260
before you…

993
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,500
Before you ran away.

994
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,340
That's because I was afraid
that you would refuse me.

995
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,740
I wanted to hide away

996
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,020
before you turn me down.

997
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,540
You…

998
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:47,940
You should let me

999
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:49,940
be the one to confess first.
