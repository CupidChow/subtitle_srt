00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,480
As your elder,

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
I have to

20
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,630
ask about your relationship.

21
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,720
And you should

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
at least tell me and your aunt

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,870
about it the first time,

24
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,230
right?

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,440
I think you've got it wrong.

26
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,440
W-What's wrong?

27
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,310
You got here just in time.

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,230
Let me introduce her to you.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,720
This is my agent.

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,360
Hello.

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,160
Hello.

32
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,680
I'm An Fei.

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,550
She is also my girlfriend.

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,950
- You...
- You are...

35
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,960
I'm his teacher.

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,030
Right, yes.

37
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,470
She is...

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,440
Good. Good.

39
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,880
You look... good together.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,080
All right.

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,440
I'll have a walk around.

42
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,910
Let me see you off.

43
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,190
No, no need.

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,880
Take care, Mr. Lin.

45
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,470
Bye-bye.

46
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,000
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,600
Bye-bye.

48
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,910
Am I your girlfriend?

49
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,910
Don't get me wrong. It's temporary.

50
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,160
You'll be mine one day.

51
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,800
Are you still going to practice today?

52
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,190
Not today. Let's go.

53
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,270
Let's go together.

54
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,030
Okay.

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,670
Xi.

56
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,720
Xi.

57
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,270
Xi.

58
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,270
Xi.

59
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,440
Let's talk about

60
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,190
what happened the other day.

61
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,600
There you are.

62
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,600
You finally realized your fault.

63
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,440
I've been thinking a lot

64
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,110
these days.

65
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,630
I think we're

66
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,720
having some problems

67
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,240
and we can try to communicate.

68
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,600
What do you think?

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,800
Let's do it.

70
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,750
Go ahead and say it.

71
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,390
But listen,

72
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,910
I won't forgive you easily this time.

73
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,270
If your apology

74
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,160
is not sincere enough,

75
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
I still don't forgive you.

76
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,030
No, Xi.

77
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,960
I'm not saying

78
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,320
I'm here to apologize.

79
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,440
I mean,

80
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,880
I want to communicate with you.

81
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,190
We both have problems.

82
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,160
Can we

83
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,440
say it out to each other

84
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,550
and correct it?

85
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,440
Say it!

86
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,600
What's your problem?

87
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,880
No, Xi,

88
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,110
why don't you get it?

89
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,110
I'm not talking about
if I should apologize or not.

90
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,760
Don't you think you also have a problem?

91
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,200
I'm saying

92
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,880
we should communicate

93
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,600
and correct it.

94
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,230
Why is it about me

95
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,830
the whole time?

96
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,950
What's my problem?

97
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,390
Tell me what my problem is.

98
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,160
Besides,

99
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,070
we are talking

100
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,230
about different things now.

101
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,670
Didn't you lie to me first?

102
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,550
Shouldn't you

103
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,350
apologize to me?

104
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,270
What do you mean now?

105
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,440
You won't apologize?

106
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,000
Apologize.

107
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,720
Go ahead.

108
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll give you a chance.

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,720
Forget it.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,600
Fine.

111
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,000
It's okay if you don't want
to say it now.

112
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,830
I'll give you a couple of days
to think about it.

113
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,480
No.

114
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,880
I mean us. We should take a break.

115
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,160
Lin Zhixiao!

116
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,230
Don't run! I want to talk to you!

117
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,640
Sorry, sorry.

118
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,350
Are you all right?

119
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,510
Are you okay, Zhixiao?

120
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm okay.

121
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,550
Don't move.

122
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,600
What?

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,670
Let me carry you.

124
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,720
Be good.

125
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,110
Where have you been?

126
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,950
What took you

127
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,830
so long?

128
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,350
I went out for a walk.

129
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,200
You should have told me.

130
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,510
Is Lin Zhixiao back?

131
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,550
No.

132
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,790
No?

133
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,070
You and your daughter

134
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,110
always want to go out.

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,760
Sit down first.

136
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,670
Hello, Mr. Lin.

137
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,950
Where are you?

138
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,830
Here's the medicine
you asked for, Dr. Gu.

139
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,510
I'm at school.

140
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,320
Lin Zhixiao.

141
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,600
What happened to you? Are you hurt?

142
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,200
What... what?

143
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,480
Are you hurt?

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,550
No, no.

145
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,110
I'm going home right now.

146
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,390
I'm not talking to you now.

147
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,070
I'll hang up.

148
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,110
H-Hello?

149
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,390
What's the matter?

150
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,920
Lin Zhixiao got hurt?

151
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,390
I think she's at Dr. Gu's hospital.

152
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,640
How did she get hurt?

153
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,720
Let's go and take a look.

154
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,040
Is it serious?

155
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,640
How would I know?

156
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,000
Come on, lift your foot.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,040
Why would you run?

158
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,200
I don't know how to face you.

159
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,920
What do you

160
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,230
think of doctors?

161
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,040
They heal the wounded
and rescue the dying.

162
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,040
What about their love lives?

163
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,230
They don't have time.

164
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,270
Zhixiao.

165
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,110
I know I'm really busy

166
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,110
at work,

167
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,600
and I don't have much time for you.

168
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,920
It makes you feel insecure.

169
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,110
And I'm sorry

170
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,270
to make you feel that way.

171
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,270
I...

172
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,070
I just...

173
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,670
I also want

174
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,280
to be like other couples,

175
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,320
and I wish you could

176
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
spend more time with me.

177
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,400
But that's not what I'm worried about.

178
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,030
What I'm really worried about

179
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,400
is I don't know what you're thinking.

180
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,840
You're going abroad for so long.

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,760
There are so many temptations out there.

182
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,030
If we can't meet for such a long time,

183
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,880
I don't know if you will...

184
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,350
So, you're worried

185
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,520
that I will be unfaithful?

186
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,670
Those who are unfaithful
are controlled by their lust.

187
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,710
Zhixiao.

188
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,320
All the women,

189
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,520
except you,

190
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,550
are the same to me

191
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,550
on the operating table.

192
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,080
Lust has no effect

193
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,150
on my life.

194
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,470
I've seen the essence

195
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,470
beneath the surface.

196
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,440
Zhixiao, listen.

197
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,760
Actually, I'm here today

198
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,910
to tell you

199
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,760
that I'm not going.

200
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,590
Do you think
you're the only one worried?

201
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,230
I'm worried, too.

202
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
If I leave,

203
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,280
what if you fall for someone else?

204
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,440
You are so careless.

205
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,760
Who's gonna take care of you
when I'm gone?

206
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,230
We're still going to

207
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,760
carry out the love plan

208
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,590
you wrote.

209
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,760
Why are you crying?

210
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,320
So,

211
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,350
either we go together

212
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,080
or we won't go at all.

213
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,790
Anyway, I can't

214
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,150
leave you here alone.

215
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,520
Zhixiao, sometimes

216
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,840
I wish

217
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,110
you had been born

218
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,880
a few years earlier.

219
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,400
Why?

220
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,960
If you were born a few years earlier,

221
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,550
I could have met you earlier.

222
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,760
But then I thought about it,

223
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,840
it's actually good now.

224
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
How is it good now?

225
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
Everything is good.

226
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,880
We don't know what would happen

227
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,840
if we go back to that time.

228
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,350
What if we didn't meet?

229
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,110
What if we met

230
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,400
and broke up?

231
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,440
Isn't it good right now?

232
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,910
You're with me,

233
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,520
and you're right in front of me.

234
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,840
Don't cry.

235
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,840
By the way, Zhixiao.

236
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,320
There is one thing

237
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,670
I've been thinking about for a while.

238
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,840
Don't you think it's time

239
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,150
to tell people about us?

240
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,110
We can't keep it

241
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,200
from your parents forever.

242
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,000
What about us?

243
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll be gentle.

244
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,790
Lin Zhixiao!

245
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,030
Lin Zhixiao!

246
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,230
Put your leg down.

247
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,670
How inappropriate!

248
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,200
I hurt my leg.

249
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,080
He's applying medicine to it.

250
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,520
It's true. Take a look.

251
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,670
Do you have to be that close
to apply medicine?

252
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,030
He obviously has no good intentions!

253
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,000
Mr. Lin.

254
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,880
- I...
- Don't call me that.

255
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,910
Are there are no nurses?

256
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,910
Do you have to do it in person?

257
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,960
You just want

258
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,910
to take advantage of our Zhixiao!

259
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,790
No... no.

260
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,670
Mr. Lin.

261
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,760
Lin Zhixiao and I are in a relationship.

290

didn't happen.

Don't worry.

292
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,110
So you didn't go to the suburbs

Your Highness.

295
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,590
Even a tiger doesn't eat its cubs.

296
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,280
- Spare my life.
- Cut it out.

297
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,110
I'm not your father.

Sit well.

300
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,440
Answer me a question.

301
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,590
You two are very different

302
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,550
no matter in age

303
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,030
or life experience.

304
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,760
Do you know what he thinks?

305
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,790
Don't worry.

306
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,640
Dr. Gu is not that kind of person.

307
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
He told me

308
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,790
he would like to visit you two.

309
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,960
Do you really like him?

310
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,960
Really?

311
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,200
I really do.

312
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,000
Fine.

313
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,150
If you like him,

314
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,790
I'm not against it.

315
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,550
I'll talk to your dad.

316
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,110
I knew

317
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,910
you are the best to me!

318
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,280
Ms. Li is the best!

319
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,110
Aren't you?

320
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,710
All right, keep it down.

321
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,280
Don't cause me trouble anymore.

322
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,030
Got it.

323
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,030
Let me think about how to talk to him.

324
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,960
I'm nervous, too.

325
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,910
Come on, Ms. Li.

326
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,670
I just learned

327
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,790
about the situation.

328
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,200
Here's the thing.

329
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,280
They haven't been together for long.

330
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,150
These two kids

331
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,030
seem pretty serious.

332
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,470
I was going

333
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,710
to ask her about it.

334
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,590
(But it came)

335
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,800
(out of the blue.)

336
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,590
(I'm a little overwhelmed.)

337
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,680
If we hadn't seen them together,

338
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,560
we would still be kept in the dark.

339
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,000
Yes.

340
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,430
I just gave her an earful.

341
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,280
Your daughter

342
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,040
looks careless

343
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,110
and heartless.

344
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,560
(She is actually sensitive.)

345
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,520
(Looks like)

346
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,470
(she does fall for him this time.)

347
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,560
Actually, I think

348
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,520
Dr. Gu is not bad.

349
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,760
Why don't you

350
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,680
like him?

351
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,710
I...

352
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,800
He is only my attending surgeon.

353
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,160
We don't know much about him,

354
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,190
right?

355
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,920
I do want your daughter

356
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,920
to find a good man.

357
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,760
I don't want her to get hurt
if she meets a bad man.

358
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,040
Yes.

359
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,470
But think about it,

360
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,110
if we don't even

361
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,000
give him a chance to spend time with us,

362
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,040
how can we get to know him?

363
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,040
Am I right?

364
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,400
She was still a spoiled little girl

365
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,950
in my arms yesterday.

366
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,040
In the blink of an eye, she just grew up.

367
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,880
(Our daughter has grown up.)

368
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,110
(There will be such a day.)

369
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,400
(Don't bother her with this yet.)

370
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,040
(Let's talk about it after the concert.)

371
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,140
(How are you doing?)

372
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,900
(Don't worry. I'm still alive.)

373
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,740
(It's a safe night.)

374
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,400
Xiao.

375
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,710
What are you doing?

376
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,710
Browsing on Moments.

377
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,230
What?

378
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,400
What are you doing?

379
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,920
Unlock it.

380
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,430
Why don't you play cards by rules?

381
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,830
Unlock it.

382
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,190
I'll unlock it.

383
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,430
Not this system.

384
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,800
Which system then?

385
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,520
I saw it.

386
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,230
Hurry up.

387
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,580
(WeChat Broadcast Messages)

388
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,220
(I miss you.)

389
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,900
(Where are you drinking? Count me in.)

390
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,300
(What's up, man? Are you dumped again?)

391
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,540
(Son, are you short of money again?)

392
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,280
W-What's wrong?

393
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,590
Son, are you short of money again?

394
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,070
You installed two systems on your phone,

395
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,280
but there's nothing going on.

396
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,950
Do you have a problem?

397
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,590
I told you.

398
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,950
I'm loyal, but you don't believe me.

399
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,860
(Unfriend)

400
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,620
(Son, one more thing, your father
found out about the 2 million...)

401
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,920
So what?

402
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,920
Not bad.

403
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,160
Well, are you nervous?

404
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,160
It's my first time

405
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,430
to perform in such a formal concert.

406
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,710
I think my palms are sweating.

407
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,560
It's okay.

408
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,000
Take it easy. Come on.

409
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,020
(Your fan is ready to enter.
The rising star, come on!)

410
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,500
(Huaqing University Orchestra
and Shawn Indoor Concert)

411
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,710
(I'm your senior)

412
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,400
(and your friend for years.)

413
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,830
(And I will always be your friend.)

414
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,920
(Thank you, Shao Jiang.)

415
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,280
(I'm going)

416
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,430
(to be one of the best cellists)

417
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,350
(in China.)

418
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,040
(Of course)

419
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,680
(I want you to come to my concert.)

420
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,560
(Do you know)

421
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,470
(what my dream is?)

422
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,800
My dream is to be a cellist.

423
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,400
(Are you ashamed of that?)

424
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,760
One, two, three.

425
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,470
Ms. Li.

426
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,680
Come here, my little princess.

427
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,000
You are excellent.

428
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,520
I'm proud of you.

429
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
It's okay.

430
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,400
Beautiful.

431
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:26,920
Mr. Lin.

432
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,230
What do you think of my performance?

433
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,710
Do you still want me
to take the postgraduate entrance exam

434
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,680
and become a teacher?

435
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,070
It's not bad. Keep it up.

436
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,000
Can't you say something nice?

437
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,040
That's the way he is.

438
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:36,920
Zhixiao.

439
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,470
The performance is wonderful.

440
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,680
Thank you.

441
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,640
Hello, Miss Lin.

442
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,880
Hello.

443
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,350
I'm An Fei, an agent

444
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,470
from Philharmonic Music.

445
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,160
I'm also Shao Jiang's agent.

446
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,800
Hello.

447
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,830
Your performance

448
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,110
really touched me.

449
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,110
I hope

450
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,590
you can sign with our company.

451
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,310
I will make you

452
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,800
a rising star of a cellist.

453
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,560
But this is

454
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,470
a German company.

455
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,470
The recruits need

456
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,310
to go to our orchestra in Germany

457
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,800
for exchange study

458
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,880
about one year.

459
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,710
I don't know

460
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,760
if you want to.

461
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,160
I think you can go.

462
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,160
Can you give me some time

463
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
to think about it?

464
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,560
All right, sure.

465
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,400
Thank you.

466
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,800
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

467
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,590
Are you going abroad for one year?

468
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,950
To celebrate

469
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,470
the substantial progress

470
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,470
in Mr. Gu and Miss Lin's careers

471
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,230
and the fact that they are about
to go to Germany together!

472
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,040
I'm so happy.

473
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,310
Why are you so happy?

474
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,400
Why wouldn't I be?

475
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,160
So, you didn't mean it

476
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,640
when you said you were okay
with a long-distance relationship.

477
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,190
I'm a sensible person.

478
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,190
It doesn't matter
if you don't understand me.

479
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,470
But now you're making fun of me?

480
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,350
You're so happy now,

481
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,230
but what if

482
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,400
something happens to me

483
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,520
and I can't go to Germany by then,

484
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,000
what would you do?

485
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,830
Then I'm going

486
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,760
to date a handsome guy

487
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,710
with blond hair.

488
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,190
What?

489
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,230
Ich drücke dir die Daumen.

490
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,760
It means good luck in German.

491
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,350
If that's German,

492
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,110
I can say it, too.

493
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,430
By the way, Zhixiao.

494
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,920
After Mr. Lin and Aunt Li

495
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,640
found out about us

496
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,560
at the hospital,

497
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,350
did they say anything to you?

498
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,640
No.

499
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,280
I guess it's because

500
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,560
the fact that I got into the orchestra

501
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,950
and be able to go aboard

502
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,160
for exchange study

503
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,950
is a lot more impactful on him.

504
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,830
I don't know if he will
have any thoughts

505
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,110
after he recovers from it.

506
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,110
Let me teach you

507
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,000
a way to stay alive.

508
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,280
What?

509
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,430
Find a time

510
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,280
and take me to visit Mr. Lin.

511
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,520
What's wrong with you, Lin?

512
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,760
Are you okay?

513
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
I'm fine. I'm fine.

514
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,280
Look how upset you are.

515
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,470
Our daughter found a boyfriend.

516
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,520
Is it that hard for you to accept?

517
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,000
You're just blindly optimistic.

518
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,230
Gu Wei

519
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,590
is a lot older than Lin Zhixiao.

520
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,680
Your daughter

521
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,470
hasn't really set foot
into the real world yet.

522
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,350
Are you not afraid
of her getting deceived?

523
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,230
Now they're going to Germany together.

524
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,520
They will be far away from us.

525
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,560
How old is Zhixiao?

526
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:01,950
Can you always

527
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,190
treat her like a little girl

528
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,400
and keep her to your side?

529
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,110
I'm back.

530
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,350
You're back.

531
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,280
Come here, walk this way.

532
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,560
You're both here.

533
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,110
Should we

534
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,310
go out on a date against all odds

535
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,760
like you young people?

536
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,470
Lin.

537
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,830
Why are you being like this again?

538
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,190
What are you talking about?

539
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,430
Ms. Li.

540
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,470
Why don't you stop sweeping the floor?

541
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,350
Have a seat.

542
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,230
What's the matter?

543
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,430
Sit down.

544
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,230
All right, just say it.

545
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,590
Don't hem and haw.

546
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,760
Take a seat, Ms. Li.

547
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,760
Well, it's not my idea.

548
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,640
It's Dr. Gu's idea.

549
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,350
Anyway, Mr. Lin knows it.

550
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,830
I should take the initiative

551
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,310
to be tested by him.

552
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,430
You know

553
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,520
Mr. Lin.

554
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,230
If I take you to see him,
are you not afraid...

555
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,230
Don't worry, I'm prepared.

556
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,760
Besides, marriage and relationship

557
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,110
are not small things.

558
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,110
Whatever your parents'

559
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,680
decision is,

560
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,710
I will accept it.

561
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,430
It's not like that.

562
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,110
Mr. Gu.

563
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,680
That's fast. You kind of

564
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,950
caught me off guard.

565
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,590
You talk about marriage all of a sudden.

566
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,280
I don't think I'm ready.

567
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,230
Come on, Lin Zhixiao.

568
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,400
Are you gonna leave me?

569
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,470
What?

570
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,190
All right, I know.

571
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,760
I know you're not ready for this.

572
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,950
Actually, I'm not

573
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,950
asking you to marry me right now,

574
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,640
or giving you any pressure.

575
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,230
I just want you

576
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,950
and your parents to know

577
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
that we're serious.

578
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,070
I'm making plans

579
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,310
for our future.

580
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,110
Besides, think about it,

581
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,190
if I don't take the initiative
to tell them my situation,

582
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,280
how could Mr. Lin and Ms. Li

583
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,400
trust me to spend a year

584
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,800
in Germany

585
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,920
with you alone?

586
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,280
Even if you're not afraid,

587
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,350
I'm still afraid Mr. Lin would

588
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,950
sneak into my apartment
to install a camera.

589
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,680
Did he say that?

590
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,190
He did.

591
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,800
Why would I lie to you?

592
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,560
If I lie to you,

593
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,160
he won't show up when he's supposed to,

594
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,710
and you will know it's a lie.

595
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,520
Since Dr. Gu brought it up,

596
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:46,640
it means he is a mature, sensible,

597
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
conscientious, and responsible man.

598
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,800
Right?

599
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,520
Yeah.

600
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,070
Well, in that case,

601
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,280
Lin,

602
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,280
let's not be too hard on the kids.

603
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,230
Besides, he saved your life.

604
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,110
Yeah.

605
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,470
Could that be the same thing?

606
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:10,910
Well,

607
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,560
invite him over

608
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,950
for dinner on Sunday.

609
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,430
I need to have a good talk with him.

610
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,520
That's great!

611
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,040
Sorry, sorry

612
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,710
about your glasses.

613
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,120
I'm too excited.

614
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,630
I knew you are

615
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,150
understanding,

616
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:28,910
aren't you?

617
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:29,560
All right,

618
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,150
I'm going to...

619
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,870
What?

620
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,040
Tell him on WeChat.

621
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,600
No problem.

622
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,360
I'll do

623
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,320
whatever you say.

624
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,630
I wasn't

625
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,600
going to see him.

626
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,950
I was going to send him
a WeChat message anyway.

627
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:42,800
He's in the hospital right now,

628
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
not at home.

629
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,080
Well,

630
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,360
I'll leave then?

631
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,000
I'll tell him

632
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
to get prepared.

633
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:01,040
You're mature, grounded, and sensible.

634
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,670
Our Lin is so great.

635
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:04,910
You're great.

636
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,040
Let's talk with him first.

637
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,600
Go away.

638
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,360
(Mr. Lin is taking a lenient attitude)

639
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,680
(towards your decision to visit them
of your own volition.)

640
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,820
(He invites you over
for dinner on Sunday.)

641
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,420
(Don't worry. I'll do well.)

642
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,260
(Don't worry, I'll do well.)

643
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,620
(I won't talk to you.
I have to work now.)

644
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,230
Dr. Gu.

645
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,430
Here are the progress notes.

646
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,600
Thank you.

647
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,470
Sansan, what's up?

648
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,430
There is one thing,

649
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,710
and it's a good thing.

650
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,950
Are you free tonight?

651
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,360
I want to give you and Dr. Gu

652
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,630
a big celebration.

653
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,390
You don't

654
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,190
have to make a grand gesture.

655
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,280
Come on.

656
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,760
Drop the act.

657
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,230
Just check with Dr. Gu.

658
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,360
(Call me back, bye-bye.)

659
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,950
Got it.

660
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,910
Wait a minute.

661
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,560
Bye-bye.

662
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,600
Okay, sure.

663
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:45,910
Dr. Gu!

664
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,670
E.R. just brought in

665
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,870
a car accident victim

666
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,470
with severe abdominal trauma

667
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,000
and suspected ruptured spleen
and pancreas

668
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,800
requiring immediate surgery.

669
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,150
Contact the patient's
family immediately.

670
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,190
Tell the operating room

671
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:54,870
to get ready now.

672
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,560
Yes.

673
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,600
Dr. Gu is coming now.

674
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,430
Contact the patient's family

675
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,320
Immediately.

676
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,150
The patient has
a massive abdominal hemorrhage.

677
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,950
We can't wait.

678
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,800
An exploratory laparotomy

679
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,670
must be performed immediately.

680
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,150
What about the patient's family?

681
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,150
We've tried everything

682
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,600
and we still can't reach the family.

683
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,390
Gu Wei.

684
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,630
The patient is getting worse.

685
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,520
But there is no one

686
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,150
to sign the consent form.

687
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,950
If anything goes wrong,

688
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,520
Dr. Gu will be

689
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,230
in a very difficult situation.

690
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,360
We can't wait.

691
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,710
The patient's life is more important.

692
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,840
I'll call the medical office

693
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,840
and apply for approval.

694
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,910
- Okay.
- Okay.

695
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,760
Anesthesiologist.

696
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,710
Fluid infusion
and blood transfusion now.

697
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,670
The blood pressure is falling.

698
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,910
(How is it?)

699
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,280
(What did Dr. Gu say?)

700
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,600
I just called him.

701
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,560
He didn't answer.

702
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,870
I guess he is busy now.

703
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,840
I'll go to school this afternoon

704
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,600
and go straight to him

705
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,840
after class.

706
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,470
He's not on duty

707
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,390
today anyway.

708
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,470
I'll tell him in person.

709
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,600
(Okay.)

710
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,870
(See you tonight.)

711
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,000
No problem.

712
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,430
(It's not easy.)

713
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,390
At least we got the patient back

714
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,000
after the serious injuries.

715
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,150
It was a close call.

716
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,190
The patient has lost too much blood

717
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,390
and gone into shock for a long time.

718
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,040
The condition is still unstable.

719
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,190
Pay close attention to the patient

720
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,120
and be aware

721
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,320
of abdominal drainage.

722
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,390
Let me know immediately

723
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,320
if anything goes wrong.

724
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:26,670
Okay.

725
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,280
Also, be aware

726
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,800
of possible pancreatic leakage

727
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,710
and abdominal bleeding after surgery.

728
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,710
It's very dangerous.

729
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,670
Got it.

730
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,080
Why is it dark inside?

731
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,520
What's going on now?

732
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,190
Zhixiao.

733
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,430
What's the matter?

734
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,230
Stay behind me

735
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,630
after we get in.

736
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,710
It's so dark.

737
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,630
It's okay. Follow me.

738
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,470
Maybe let's not go inside.

739
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,670
Where are these two people?

740
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,950
Sansan. I'm scared.

741
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,430
It's okay. Follow me.

742
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:25,470

00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,470

744
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,470

745
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,630
You scared me!

What are you doing?

747
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,630
Are you okay?

748
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,600
I'm fine.

749
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
Gu Xiao, wash my clothes

750
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,670
and send them to my home.

751
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,150
Dr. Gu.

752
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,840
What a bummer.

00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,760

How could you run a cafe
with your skills?

799
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,560
Sansan is the manager.

800
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,040
All management decisions

801
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,150
are made by Sansan.

It's up to you.

805
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,520
But I do whatever you say.

806
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,760
There is

I think the smell

is from you.

00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,710

I heard from my dad

821
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,600
that Uncle got really mad at you

822
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,870
because you secretly took money

823
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,870
from your family

824
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,840
to open this cafe.

825

827
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,080
I'm starting a business,

828
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,120
and the cafe
can make my girlfriend happy.

829
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:38,950
It's worth it.

Yes.

832
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,520
I was looking at you guys,

833
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,710
and I thought this felt great.

834
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,950
The person I like

835
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,800
and my friends

836
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,950
are all here by my side.

838
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,120
That's it.

839
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,950
I want nothing more!

840
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,430
Yeah.

841
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:55,870
I still remember

842
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,000
back in school

843
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,390
you always wanted

844
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:59,600
to go on a double date

845
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,470
with me.

846
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:01,840
I didn't expect

847
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,150
a scene like this.

00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,670
I'm finally back,

849
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,040
but now you're leaving.

850
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,600
It's okay.

851
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,190
One year is a short time.

852
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,000
When I come back,

853
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,040
we can meet again.

854
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,280
That's right.

855
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,630
It's just Germany.

856
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:15,840
If I miss you,

857
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,600
I'll just take a plane

858
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,710
to see you.

859
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,470

861
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,320
just give me a call.

862
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,000
I'll be right there

863
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
to uphold justice for you.

864
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,710
Sansan, you're the best.

865
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,600
How about you?

866
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:27,360
Have you really decided

867
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,670
to be with Gu Xiao?

868
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,600
Didn't you call him

869
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,950
childish and unreliable?

870
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,320
How did you change your mind so fast?

871
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:34,800
I thought about it.

872
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,120
He does have a lot of problems,

873
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,470
but in a relationship,

874
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,230
we can change for each other.

875
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,870
We will work hard together,
make progress together,

876
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,080
and grow up together.

877
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,470
The most important thing

878
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,280
is I meet someone

879
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,670
I really like.

880
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,470
Sansan, you've grown up.

881
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:54,520
This is the first time

882
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,320
I've heard you say

883
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,710
you like someone.

884
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,040
Hush, keep it down.

885
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,670
He will get cocky

886
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,520
if he hears it.

887
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,000
Okay, I won't say it.

888
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I won't say it.

889

=The Oath of Love=
(Lin & Gu’s Sweet Little Theatre)

890
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,560
Did I ever

891
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,800
have the nerve to ignore you?

892
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,480
Of course you did.

893
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,160
You don’t remember?

894
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,680
I don’t.

895
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,960
In the month between
Mr. Lin’s discharge from the hospital

896
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,120
and his second admission
for chemotherapy.

897
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,400
Did you already fall for me
at that time...?

898
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,640
No.

899
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,520
- I didn’t.
- No?

900
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,160
- That’s nonsense.
- You didn’t?

901
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,920
I didn’t.

902
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,640
- It’s impossible.
- I really didn’t.

903
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,400
I’m sure you did.

904
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,880
I didn’t.

905
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,480
Dr. Gu.

906
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,280
- I said...
- Were you already in love with me?

907
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,960
In love with you...

908
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,080
You were attracted

909
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,840
by my beautiful appearance

910
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,640
and my cheerful personality,

911
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,160
right?

912
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,840
Admit that you were in love with me.

913
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,480
I...

914
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,400
Were you in love with me?

915
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,520
I said no and I meant it.

916
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,800
You were in love with me.

917
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:45,800
You did.

918
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,000
Maybe a little bit.

919
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
A little bit?

920
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,920
A little bit?

921
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,280
All right, I said no!

922
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,180
