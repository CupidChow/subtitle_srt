Here come the doctors.

00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,310
Du.

20
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,040
Dr. Gu,

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,950
you're finally back.

22
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,590
How's his condition?

23
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,400
Not very optimistic.

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,440
Dr. Yan,

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,910
please save my son.

26
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,120
- Get up. Get up.
- He's my single child.

27
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,160
I know. I know.

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,510
- He's my single child.
- I know, Aunt.

29
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,190
I understand.

30
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,870
Dr. Gu, Dr. Yan,

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,950
which one of you
will perform the operation?

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,190
Time to prepare for it.

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,080
Dr. Yan,

34
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,480
please save my son.

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,550
Listen.

36
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,310
I didn't perform the first operation

37
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,160
on your son.

38
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,910
So, I don't know very well

39
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,440
about his condition.

40
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,910
Let's transfer him to another hospital.

41
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,040
No, no.

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,910
Your son's life is at stake.

43
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,360
I know

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,440
you don't trust me at all.

45
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,440
But your son's life

46
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,390
matters most.

47
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,470
I performed the first operation on him.

48
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,240
I know best

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,470
about his abdominal condition.

50
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,270
I'm the most suitable doctor
for the operation.

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,320
I assure you

52
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,030
with my career

53
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,470
that I'll do my best to save him.

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,960
Make the decision immediately.

55
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,750
Your son's vital signs are
extremely unstable.

56
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,240
Under such circumstances,

57
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,080
don't hesitate anymore.

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,630
Or your son will die!

59
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,240
You...

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,630
Fine.

61
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,390
I'll give you

62
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,440
the last chance.

63
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,320
If...

64
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,550
If my son dies,

65
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,520
I won't let you go.

66
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,110
Thank you. Get ready for the operation.

67
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,720
Yes.

68
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,080
- Dr. Gu...
- Please save my son.

69
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,830
I'll count on you.

70
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,110
Please.

71
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,030
Don't do this.

72
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,000
Please get up.

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,360
Dr. Yan...

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,750
Rest assured.

75
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,520
Go ahead. Go.

76
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,600
Get up. Please get up.

77
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,470
Please set up.

78
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,750
Listen to me. Listen.

79
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,670
Dr. Yan,

80
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,550
take care of them.

81
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,750
I'll go to the Medical Service Division

82
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,880
for Dr. Gu's operation permission.

83
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,360
Come on.

84
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,190
Listen to me. Listen.

85
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,030
Let me tell you.

86
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,470
Dr. Gu is

87
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,030
an excellent surgeon in our hospital.

88
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,880
He won't let you down.

89
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,800
He won't.

90
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,750
Trust me.

91
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,440
I'll count on you.

92
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:46,670
(Do you think)

93
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,720
(when you're in trouble,)

94
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,190
(you can hole up)

95
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,160
(and make all of us)

96
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,440
(worry about you?)

97
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,550
(What are you doing here?)

98
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,960
(Having fun?)

99
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,240
(Enjoying yourself?)

100
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,190
I just want to order my thoughts.

101
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,030
What thoughts?

102
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,320
What thoughts can you order?

103
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,320
Zhixiao...

104
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,390
Don't touch me!

105
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,630
(Don't come to me)

106
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,470
(until you solve your problem!)

107
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,640
How do you feel?

108
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,480
The operation was a success.

109
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,600
Great.

110
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,350
Don't worry.

111
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,600
Your son is all right.

112
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,270
Okay.

113
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,160
You can check on him.

114
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,320
Thank you, doctors. Thank you.

115
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,950
Son.

116
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,950
Good.

117
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,230
Thank you.

118
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,070
It's our duty. You're welcome.

119
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,230
All right.

120
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,040
Thank you, director.

121
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,880
Stay with him.

122
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,550
Let's go.

123
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,230
Okay.

124
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,160
President.

125
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,640
The operation was a success.

126
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,000
Well done.

127
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,270
Dr. Gu,

128
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
my son wants to see you.

129
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,790
Dr. Gu, my son woke up.

130
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,640
Don't try to talk yet.

131
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,480
You are

132
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,510
still very weak.

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,600
And the surgical wound

134
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
won't recover so soon.

135
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,640
By the way,

136
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
don't let him get out of bed or walk

137
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,640
in a day or two

138
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,920
in case he hurts the wound.

139
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,880
Got it.

140
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,070
You're still in a critical condition.

141
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,110
For the sake of your health,

142
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,600
you must live more carefully

143
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
than ordinary guys.

144
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,040
By the way,

145
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,670
does he have the habit

146
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,600
of smoking?

147
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,160
Yes.

148
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,070
He has to

149
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,390
quit smoking.

150
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,720
But Dr. Gu,

151
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,200
is this all that you want to say?

152
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,670
You rest for recuperation.

153
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,200
As his parents,

154
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,670
you should take good care of him.

155
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,950
As for any other problem,

156
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,390
let's talk about it later.

157
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,550
If anything

158
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,480
ails him,

159
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,920
tell the nurse immediately.

160
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,040
The nurse will inform me of that.

161
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,480
Thank you.

162
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,480
Dr. Gu,

163
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,110
thank you.

164
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,350
Gu Wei,

165
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,760
how was the talk?

166
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,600
Yeah, Wei.

167
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,110
Did you explain to them?

168
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Will they not sue you?

169
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,320
Yeah, Dr. Gu.

170
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,350
I didn't explain anything to them.

171
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,830
Why?

172
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,790
The patient needs a good rest.

173
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,230
I'm a doctor.

174
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,270
He's a patient.

175
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I only answer for his health.

176
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,550
But Wei,

177
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,160
you've been cursed on the Internet.

178
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,230
For him,

179
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,550
you were even suspended at work.

180
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,440
Don't you care about that?

181
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,640
It's not that I don't care.

182
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,440
Legally, I did nothing wrong.

183
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,110
During the operation,

184
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,640
I made no mistake.

185
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,880
So...

186
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,230
So what?

187
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,550
Go on.

188
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,480
So, I'll actively prepare the information

189
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,720
for the investigation.

190
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,230
I believe

191
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:24,830
a fair outcome

192
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,920
will be ensured.

193
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,040
Do you still remember

194
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,600
why we chose

195
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,790
to be doctors?

196
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,830
I was wrong.

197
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,070
I used to care so much

198
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,270
about how others thought of me

199
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,480
that I forgot

200
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,600
the original desire of doctors was

201
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,720
to only save patients.

202
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:46,830
Wei,

203
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,040
but you've been wronged.

204
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,350
Many other doctors are

205
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,200
experiencing the same cases.

206
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,880
The only difference

207
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,950
lies in the severity.

208
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,760
Someone told me

209
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,350
that she despises those guys most

210
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,550
who give up easily.

211
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,670
So, let's just face the problem bravely

212
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,270
and do the best we can.

213
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,270
Dr. Gu,

214
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,760
it finally dawned on you.

215
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,670
Actually, we wanted

216
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,640
to persuade you like this

217
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,830
a long time ago.

218
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,390
However...

219
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,920
Her scolding enlightened me, I guess.

220
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
During this period,

221
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
you also had a hard time.

222
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,350
Thank you.

223
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,110
Wei, I still don't...

224
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,520
Don't try to persuade him.

225
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,150
What he just said indicates

226
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,760
that he knows what to do.

227
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,760
Fine, then.

228
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,520
You wanted to persuade him,
but you just didn't.

229
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,670
Funny.

230
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,840
Zhixiao, I have something to tell...

231
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,230
Have you handled

232
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,280
the problem in the hospital?

233
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,150
Don't worry.

234
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,790
I've talked to the parents
of that patient.

235
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,880
I'm sorry.

236
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,350
Don't be angry anymore.

237
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,150
Have you had dinner?

238
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,550
Shall we have dinner together?

239
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:02,520
Dr. Gu,

240
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
I made my point very clear to you

241
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,230
last time

242
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,110
that as a boyfriend,

243
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,520
you did a very poor job.

244
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,840
You're a clever man

245
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,550
and you must understand

246
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,640
what this means.

247
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,320
I...

248
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,320
Zhi...

249
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,030
Zhixiao.

250
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,520
Zhixiao.

251
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:42,880
Zhi...

252
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,400
Dr. Gu.

253
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,760
Aunt Li,

254
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,440
may I talk to Zhixiao?

255
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,200
She has to go to work tomorrow morning.

256
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,230
She should go to bed now.

257
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,790
Why don't you go back home, too?

258
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,880
Aunt Li,

259
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,110
please let me see her.

260
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,200
I have something to tell her.

261
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,350
She indeed has to go to bed.

262
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,230
By the way, Dr. Gu...

263
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,200
Here's the thing.

264
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,030
You know best

265
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,550
about my husband's problem.

266
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,280
Now,

267
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,790
he mustn't be annoyed.

268
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,790
So, could you please

269
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,640
not come

270
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,280
to our home lately?

271
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,150
Sorry to have disturbed you, Aunt Li.

272
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,000
What?

273
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,790
My father wasn't awakened, was he?

274
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,790
No, no.

275
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,030
Are you all right?

276
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,030
Yes.

277
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,880
I'm fine. Don't worry.

278
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,320
Actually,

279
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,150
if something makes you unhappy,

280
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,960
you can tell me about it.

281
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,470
Ms. Li,

282
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,910
I'm no longer

283
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,320
a little girl.

284
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,520
I'm an adult.

285
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,520
As for such problems,

286
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,000
I can handle them by myself.

287
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,470
Don't worry, okay?

288
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,640
Well...

289
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,320
If you know what you want,

290
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,440
that would be the best.

291
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,030
I know best what I want.

292
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,790
Trust me.

293
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,520
I have to read the score.

294
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,790
Go back to sleep.

295
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,910
Go ahead.

302
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,590
(have got engaged at that time,)

303
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,200
I might stay in China

304
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,400
for you.

But if we're still
in a relationship only,

306
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,670
I'll go find

307
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,640
a handsome boyfriend

308
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,440
with blonde hair and blue eyes.

309
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,080
What?

310
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,710
Ich drücke dir die Daumen.

311
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,910
It's German.

312
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,110
It means good luck.

(Songbook for Grading Tests)

315
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,150
Have you received your salary
for last month?

316
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,880
No.

317

What about you?

318
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,230
No, either.

319
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,440
And you guys?

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,710
- What?
- What's wrong?

321
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,710
Have you received your salary
for last month?

- No.
- No.

323

We were just talking
about changing our jobs.

324
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,790
No salary, after all.

325
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:06,960
Our boss

326
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,200
hasn't been here for days.

327
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,470

Run away?

329
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,880
Yeah.

330
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,840
This month,

331
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,030
our business is so poor.

exactly the amount.

Thank you.

350
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,190
Xi,

351
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,470
let's talk.

352
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,100
(Gone Girl)

353
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,710
I should get back to my dorm.

354
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,070
An Fei asked me to give this to you.

355
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,000
What do your parents

356
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,400
think of your trip to Germany?

357
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,430
They certainly think

358
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,110
this is a good chance.

359
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,560
However,

360
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,110
when you're abroad,
you'll have a long-distance relationship.

361
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,710
Dr. Gu...

362
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,040
It's my own business.

363
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,000
It has nothing to do with him.

364
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,560
Then...

365
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,350
Germany...

366
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,040
I'll go. I'll certainly go.

367
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,470
Zhixiao,

368
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,520
I put the breakfast on your door handle.

369
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,590
Did you eat it?

370
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:20,760
Did you come

371
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,950
just to ask me about that?

372
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,110
Shao Jiang, let's get in and continue.

373
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,430
Who's this man? Do you know him?

374
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,590
No.

375
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,820
(Deutsche Grammophon)

376
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,280
We made a few modifications...

377
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,110
That man has been waiting outside

378
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,830
for a long while.

379
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,040
- Who's he waiting for?
- How about this?

380
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,070
He's Lin Zhixiao's friend, I guess.

381
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,950
He is?

382
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,880
Lin Zhixiao,

383
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,520
that man just talked to you.

384
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Is he your boyfriend?

385
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,230
He's so romantic.

386
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,430
I think we can

387
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,520
reorganize these bars.

388
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,110
Zhixiao.

389
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,230
What on earth do you want?

390
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,070
You know very well

391
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,880
what I want.

392
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,110
I don't know.

393
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,160
I just began to work in this company.

394
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,590
Could you stop pestering me?

395
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,000
Please don't cause trouble for me.

396
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,760
Zhixiao, let me explain.

397
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,160
Dr. Gu, you'd better leave.

398
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,830
This is our company.

399
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,830
It's inappropriate for you to wait here,

400
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,680
isn't it?

401
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,880
You should at least not
cause trouble for Zhixiao.

402
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,880
I'll be waiting for you back home, okay?

403
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,590
Actually,

404
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,710
you felt sorry for him

405
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,760
when you saw him wait

406
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,160
for such a long time.

407
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,040
I didn't.

408
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,470
Forget it.

409
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,040
Let's talk about you.

410
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,310
How's it going with you and An Fei?

411
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:58,640
Since when

412
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,110
were you so gossipy too?

413
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,160
She's a good girl.

414
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,710
You're going to be
in a relationship with her?

415
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,430
Do you really want me

416
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,710
to have a good girlfriend so soon?

417
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,640
You don't like me at all,

418
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,470
do you?

419
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,590
Shao Jiang,

420
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,000
don't make fun of this anymore,

421
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,800
will you?

422
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,110
No kidding.

423
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,520
I really want you

424
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,640
to live a happy life

425
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,880
and find your cup of tea.

426
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,430
You know what?

427
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,230
I want you to be happy, too.

428
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,680
You can quarrel with your boyfriend,

429
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,520
but don't easily break up with him.

430
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,190
Or it'll hurt his feelings.

431
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,350
Fine.

432
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,640
You know best

433
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,070
what you want.

434
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,920
Are you done talking

435
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,110
with Lin Zhixiao?

436
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,190
Yes.

437
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,280
Are you available?

438
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'd like to invite you to lunch

439
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:23,680
in return for your help

440
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,000
with Lin Zhixiao.

441
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,560
If you want to invite me for that,

442
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,430
don't bother.

443
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,830
I just appreciate her talent.

444
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,560
However...

445
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,230
If you simply want to invite me,

446
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,070
I'm available.

447
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,230
I want to invite you myself.

448
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,230
Would you like to go?

449
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,110
Sure.

450
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,680
Zhixiao, you're back?

451
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,520
Where are you going?

452
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,470
For a walk.

453
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,760
What's this?

454
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,710
The list for going abroad.

455
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,190
I'm going to Germany, you know.

456
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,110
I'll get everything packed.

457
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
You're really going abroad?

458
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,190
What's that look?

459
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,230
I am, of course.

460
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,110
Don't worry.

461
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,430
I can take care of myself.

462
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,110
Go ahead.

463
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,880
Go for the walk.

464
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,560
How about this, honey?

465
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,640
Go without me.

466
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,950
You have a lot of things to pack.

467
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,230
Let me help you.

468
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,950
Don't bother. I'm no longer young.

469
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,680
Stop treating me as a child.

470
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,560
I can handle this alone.

471
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,350
Off you go. Go.

472
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,560
Go, go, go.

473
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,520
Go take a walk.

474
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,760
Don't bother about me.

475
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,350
But...

476
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,190
Take care of him. Go.

477
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,830
Just go. I'm okay.

478
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,040
Hello.

479
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,470
Hello.

480
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,160
I want to order a bouquet.

481
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,800
Okay. Sir,

482
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,920
who do you want it for?

483
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,640
My girlfriend.

484
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,710
Okay, just do that.

485
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,820
(I'm sorry.)

486
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,190
What on earth do you want?

487
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,710
Sorry.

488
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,400
I came to borrow the antipyretic.

489
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,640
I have a fever.

490
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,040
Fever?

491
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,470
You just had a bouquet delivered.

492
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,640
But now you have a fever?

493
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,190
Can you have a fever whenever you want?

494
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,760
I just realized it.

495
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,800
I basked in the sun the whole afternoon.

496
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,760
After I came back,

497
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,400
I had a cold bath.

498
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,880
Then I have a fever now.

499
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,280
But you're a doctor.

500
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,800
Haven't you had some medicine at home?

501
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,800
I ran out of it.

502
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,830
I'm sorry,

503
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,950
but I don't have the antipyretic, either.

504
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,800
And Dr. Gu,

505
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,760
please don't forget again

506
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,160
that we broke up,

507
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,560
will you?

508
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,880
Sorry to have disturbed you.

509
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,400
Gu Wei?

510
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,190
What happened?

511
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,310
Are you all right?

512
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,590
There you are.

513
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,110
Let me feel it.

514
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,880
Why is your forehead so hot?

515
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,680
You really have a fever?

516
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,680
Get up

517
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,800
and lie in bed, okay?

518
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,470
Be careful.

519
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,590
Can you walk?

520
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,590
Are you feeling better?

521
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,470

I'm not leaving.

524

I'll go get some medicine for you.

525
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,430
You have the antipyretic, don't you?

526
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,000
There's too much medicine in my home.

527
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,800
I just forgot it.

I'll go get you some water.

531
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,400

Sit up and take the medicine.

533
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,360
Now that you took the medicine,

Wait a moment.

539
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,280
I'll go make the porridge for you.

540

Lie down. Don't catch a cold.

Zhixiao, let me explain.

559
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,630
I really didn't know

00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,120
what I could do

561
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,360
to make you forgive me.

562
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,600
That's why I pretended to be ill.

563
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,390
Dr. Gu,

564
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,230
you needn't have done that.

565
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,910
I'm going to Germany.

566
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,280
During this period,

567
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,190
I've figured everything out.

568
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,710
I don't think

569
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,910
we're suitable for each other at all.

570
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,630
I don't know why,

571
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,470
but I know we're not the same

572
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,840
in personality, experiences,

573
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,520
and codes of conduct.

574
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,190
Maybe it's because

575
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,120
I'm in love for the first time

576
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,120
that I think nothing will be a problem

577
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,280
as long as we love each other.

578
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,520
But I didn't expect us

579
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,760
to end up like this.

580

I don't think

582
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,870
I know much about you.

583
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,760
Anyway, I'm going to Germany.

584
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,670

As for our relationship,

just let it go.

588
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,800
When are you leaving?

589

590

I'm a doctor.

We're usually busy with work.

We don't have much time for traveling.

597

601

602

that I would go to Germany with you.
