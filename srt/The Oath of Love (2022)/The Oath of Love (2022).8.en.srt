I'm not going to the seminar. Sorry.

Han Han.

21
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,275
Do I look like

22
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:12,700
a real cellist today?

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,960
No audience could see you from far away.

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,700
You mussed up my fringe.

25
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,875
What? Do I look okay?

26
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:18,925
You laughed at me before.

27
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:21,075
You also care about your fringe.

28
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,775
This is a special day.

29
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,520
It's the first time

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,150
that I play the cello

31
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,670
at such a concert.

32
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,750
I must care about every detail.

33
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,320
Do a good job, then.

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,119
If you perform successfully,

35
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,200
I'm afraid you no longer need

36
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,679
to play the triangle.

37
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:39,125
Of course. I must prove myself today.

38
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:39,720
Come on.

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,500
Come on.

Yes.

42
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,750
Let us

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,600
only practice one part,

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,199
from Bar 48 to 56.

45
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,039
- Okay.
- Only this part.

46
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,300
- Get ready for it. Tune the instruments.
- Okay.

Stop.

55
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,359
Why is your hand shaking so violently?

56
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,600
Did you practice too much?

57
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,825
Have you been practicing all these days?

58
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:22,925
Go take a rest.

59
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,625

I was okay this morning.

00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:34,760
Give me a second chance.

66
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,775
- I can do it.
- Say no more.

67
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,335
Don't force yourself, all right?

68
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,720

70
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,000
go get Fang Zhou here.

71

Fang Zhou, get your cello

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,559
and take her place.

73
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,325
All right.

74
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,200

long time no see.

86
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:15,325
Gu,

87
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:17,825
I didn't expect you to come
and watch the concert today.

88
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:19,239
Come on.

89
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,200
This is my daughter Han Han.

90
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,400
She's the chief cellist

91
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,599
of today's concert.

92
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,920
Hello, Mr. Gu.

93
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,600
Why do you not let it go?

94
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,125
- Who's your partner?
- Nice to meet you.

95
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:32,320
The concert was a success.

96
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,225
Thank you.

97
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,675
Who wants to enjoy
your poor performance?

98
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,925
I do.

99
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:42,800
You want to enjoy
her triangle performance?

100
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,500
Yes, I do.

101
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,675
And I think

102
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:46,925
Lin Zhixiao's triangle playing

103
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,425
can be the punchline of the concert.

104
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,900
Just now, I heard

105
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,760
that you asked her to pay
for the damage.

106
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,675
But as I can see,

107
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,034
your cello isn't damaged at all.

108
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,119
If you insist on asking
for compensation,

109
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:00,375
I guess you need
a professional institution

110
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,760
to confirm the damage condition
and the amount of compensation.

111
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,100
If it's really damaged,

112
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
I'll pay for that.

113
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:08,150
Who are you?

114
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:11,650
- I...
- He's my fan.

115
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,399
My fan.

116
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,450
Yes.

117
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,399
Look.

118
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:30,519
My fan.

119
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,375
You're my fan from now on.

120
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,799
Give me your hands.

121
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:38,679
Why?

122
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,975
You touched her cello.

123
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,225
Your hands should be disinfected.

124
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:46,725
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

125
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:49,725
But why did you come today?

126
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,075
As I said, I came to watch the concert.

127
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,500
I saw you talk with the principal.

128
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,679
He invited you, right?

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,950
- I...
- It's okay.

130
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,275
Even if you didn't come for me,

131
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:04,475
I still want to thank you
for helping me out.

132
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:06,040
I have to say

133
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,640
that you looked amazing

134
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,079
when you leaped to my defense.

135
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,750
You're like 1.8m tall.

136
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,750
I'm 1.836m tall, actually.

137
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:19,400
You have a good sense of humor, Dr. Gu.

138
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,125
Thank you.

139
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,720
Come on.

140
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,675
Let me walk you home.

141
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,975
Okay.

142
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,775
Uncle, Aunt, I'm full.

143
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,000
Have you enjoyed the meal?

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,650
Yes.

145
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,599
Gao,

146
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,175
how's the work of your team lately?

147
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,350
Thank you for your concern.

148
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,511
With Gu Wei there,
everything goes smoothly.

149
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,080
I had wanted him

150
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,725
to come back for dinner with you.

151
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:52,650
But he couldn't, for some business.

152
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,875
Xi,

153
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,700
do you know what he is busy with?

154
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,800
Aunt,

155
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,575
I don't understand him very well now.

156
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,175
I think he's been weird lately.

157
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:12,850
When I called him today,

158
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,400
he said he would watch a concert

159
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,200
and wouldn't come back for dinner.

160
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,175
Do you know about it?

161
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,000
Actually, I invited him

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,025
to attend today's seminar with me.

163
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,325
It was a rare chance.

164
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,950
But he said he couldn't come

165
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,630
because of some emergency.

166
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,025
It's just not like him.

167
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,150
He seems to be distracted recently.

168
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,475
Whose concert did he go to?

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,500
The concert of a patient's daughter.

170
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,075
Dr. Gu,

for a long time

178
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,625

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,400

181
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,925

341
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,640
Just go. Go.

342
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,650
Shall I help you with it?

343
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,375
No, no. I can handle it. Off you go.

344
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,275
Wait a minute.

345
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,175
She's the family of my patient.

346
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,475
Dr. Du.

347
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,959
Go on with the ward round.

348
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:47,775
I'll be right back.

349
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:48,610
Okay.

350
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,375
Hi.

351
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,119
Let's go.

352
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:53,775
Mm.

353
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,350
Dr. Gu, would you like some Pepsi?

354
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,839
Pepsi in the day?

355
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,575
You can also drink it at night.

356
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,625
When I received your message,

357
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,700
I came to see you.

358
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,950
I've got something to tell you, too.

359
00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:09,575
Let's talk in my office.

360
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:10,200
Mm.

361
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,575
Dr. Gao. Dr. Gao.

362
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:13,600
Come over, please.

363
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,100
I'm sorry, Dr. Gu.

364
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,800
Punish me as you wish.

365
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,650
It's tie-dyed?

366
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,775
Is this the popular style recently?

367
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,600
I'm sorry. Terribly sorry.

368
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
How about this?

369
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,300
I'll buy the same suit for you

370
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,500
as compensation, okay?

371
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,525
Show me your right hand.

372
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,275
Ah?

373
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,675
Why?

374
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,280
Turn it over.

375
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,880
Seriously, Dr. Gu?

376
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,080
Will you hit my hand to vent your anger

377
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,239
just like Mr. Lin?

378
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,575
We're already in modern times.

379
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:05,335
Why do doctors still punish people?

380
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,875
Doctors in our hospital do research,

381
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:08,836
teach students, and give operations.

382
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:11,225
I can also be a teacher.

383
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:14,075
Terrific.

384
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,275
Give me your hand.

385
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,225
I failed to check carefully
under the streetlight last night.

386
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,225
You indeed need

387
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,550
a professional orthopedist

388
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,596
to check on your wrist.

389
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,319
But...

390
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,825
Your wrist is more important
than my suit.

391
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,575
(Register with an expert orthopedist)
Register with an expert orthopedist.

392
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Dr. Gu,

393
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,100
did you line up for a long time

394
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,150
to register for me?

395
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,275
I didn't.

396
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:10,175
Dr. Du did.

397
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:11,575
He lined up for you
after his night shift.

398
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:13,585
You must have asked him to.

399
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,825
Or he wouldn't know

400
00:24:14,825 --> 00:24:16,386
there was a problem with my wrist.

401
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:22,200
Fine. I know you want to help
without letting me know.

402
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:24,850
Thanks, Dr. Gu.

403
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,375
In this case,

404
00:24:30,175 --> 00:24:31,839
go get a cup of water for me.

405
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,225
After saying so much,

406
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,250
I'm thirsty.

407
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,125
Got it. Be right back.

408
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,325
Wait a minute.

409
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:41,875
Wash the cup carefully.

410
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,850
Yes, sir.

411
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,450
(Apartments to let)

412
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,280
Take the temperature of Bed No. 15.

413
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,025
Okay.

414
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,325
Hello, Dr. Gao.

415
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,550
Wait.

416
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,175
Is it Gu Wei's cup?

417
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:08,500
Mm. I got some hot water for him.

418
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,400
Miss Lin Zhixiao,

419
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,025
I have to remind you as a doctor.

420
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:14,584
Your father is already discharged.

421
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:17,500
Don't often come here
unless you have to.

422
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,620
We're quite busy.

423
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,850
It fell to me to take care

424
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,169
of your father's chemotherapy.

425
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,725
Come to me if you have any problems.

426
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,725
As for some other doctors,

427
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,800
you'd better keep your distance.

428
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,825
Or it would create a bad influence.

429
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,880
Dr. Gao, you get me wrong.

430
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
I came to see Dr. Gu because...

431
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,700
You don't need to explain to me.

432
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,000
I saw you come in a hurry.

433
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,360
I guess you have something else to do.

434
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,175
I'm on my way to see Gu Wei.

435
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,479
Leave the cup to me.

436
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,675
I'll give it to him.

437
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,800
You may leave.

438
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,175
But...

439
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:52,675
Come on in.

440
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:54,925
Thank you.

441
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,950
What's wrong with her?

442
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,389
I haven't finished yet.

443
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,775
My bag is still in the office.

444
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,719
Dr. Du.

445
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:13,700
Miss Lin, what are you doing here?

446
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,775
You came to see Dr. Gu?

447
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:17,875
Knock at the door and get in.

448
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:20,550
But Dr. Gao is in the office now.

449
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,050
They keep the door closed?

450
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,425
Dr. Du.

451
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,950
Have you noticed

452
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,000
that Dr. Gao doesn't like me?

453
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,125
You bet.

454
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,850
I guess she likes no one,

455
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,350
but Dr. Gu.

456
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,425
When Dr. Gu is away,

457
00:26:45,425 --> 00:26:47,350
I've never seen her smile.

458
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,325
I get it.

459
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:50,839
I'll get to my business.

460
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:51,725
- Bye-bye.
- Okay.

461
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,475
What's the look on your face?

462
00:26:57,475 --> 00:26:58,641
You don't want to see me?

463
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,700
You're wrong.

464
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,119
I just met Lin Zhixiao.

465
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,100
She has something urgent to do.

466
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,750
Then I brought the cup to you.

467
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,760
Something urgent?

468
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,200
Not very important, I'm afraid.

469
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,175
After all, it's her privacy.

470
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:13,325
I shouldn't ask too much.

471
00:27:13,475 --> 00:27:14,030
Mm.

472
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,675
Well, what can I do for you?

473
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,525
It's the paper of our application
for the research fund.

474
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:21,405
Review it.

475
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,560
Your eyes will be hurt like this.

476
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,825
I've got the printed paper.

477
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,550
Here. Read this.

478
00:27:36,575 --> 00:27:39,000
Yesterday, I happened to
read a new paper

479
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,325
with basically consistent viewpoints.

480
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:44,350
It can be used as our new quote.

481
00:27:44,975 --> 00:27:47,061
But I think we should

482
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:48,500
confirm the paper content more strictly

483
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,780
before we quote it.

484
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,400
It'll be less risky.

485
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,025
Well...

486
00:28:01,225 --> 00:28:03,100
(Pepsi)

487
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,400
Looks like

488
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,640
you get along well with Lin Zhixiao.

489
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:09,050
Mm.

490
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,239
We get along well.

491
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,200
That's good.

492
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,050
Any more questions?

493
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,439
No.

494
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,300
I'll go see Dr. Du.

495
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,975
Mm.

496
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,839
Tell me the result
after you review the paper.

497
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:29,475
Okay.

498
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,760
Come on. Help me.

499
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,400
I'm dying.

500
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,319
I'm dying if nobody helps me.

501
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,025
Help me.

502
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:54,675
Oh.

503
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,700
Dr. Gu.

504
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,479
What took you so long?

505
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,725
Did you really have so much
to talk about?

506
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,875
You've been waiting for me here?

507
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,400
Where else could I go?

508
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,520
Thanks.

509
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,525
Now that you've waited for a long time,

510
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,775
shall I treat you to lunch?

511
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,250
Sure.

512
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,175
Let's go.

513
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,225
I don't need room cleaning!

514
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,975
Son, open the door.

515
00:29:31,975 --> 00:29:32,900
It's me, your mother.

516
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,319
Hurry.

517
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,450
Wait a second.

518
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:42,150
Be right there.

519
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,359
- Son.
- Mom.

520
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,479
Get packed and go home.

521
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:53,325
Be quick.

522
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,150
Where's your husband?

523
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,500
Your father has gone abroad
for business.

524
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,525
He won't be back soon.

525
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,675
Oh, my dear son.

526
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,750
It doesn't feel good
to live in a hotel, huh?

527
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,275
Look, you're thinner.

528
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,075
I'm not.

529
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:10,966
Mom.

530
00:30:10,966 --> 00:30:11,686
What?

531
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,275
I know why I'm thinner.

532
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,439
Lately...

533
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,680
Lately, I don't eat well

534
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,175
or sleep well.

535
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:21,880
I'm exhausted.

536
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,975
What happened, Son?

537
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,400
Tell me about it.

538
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:27,079
I'll try to help you.

539
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,825
It's just because my father
looks down on me!

540
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,750
To prove myself,

541
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,250
I've been working hard
on doing business.

542
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:38,300
And I've found
a great business opportunity.

543
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:39,850
Everything is ready,

544
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,800
but the investment fund.

545
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,600
It hurts, Mom.

546
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,700
Mom,

547
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,275
give me some money.

548
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,760
I'll make you a shareholder.

549
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,775
Go away.

550
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,239
You want some money again.

551
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,239
Could you stop
wasting your father's money?

552
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,147
Come on.

553
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,525
Why do you think I'm wasting money?

554
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,050
I'm starting business seriously.

555
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:03,200
Mom,

556
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,950
trust me this time.

557
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,479
This time?

558
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:12,175
I trusted you so many times.

559
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:12,959
You want me to trust you again?

560
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,325
How can I?

561
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,150
Mom,

562
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,175
stop packing things.

563
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:30,475
Do you want my father

564
00:31:30,475 --> 00:31:32,500
to look down on me forever?

565
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,875
Mom, be seated.

566
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,520
Be seated, please.

567
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,275
It's okay that he doesn't trust me.

568
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:46,900
But Mom,

569
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:49,425
you have to trust me.

570
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,925
I'm borrowing money from you
one last time.

571
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,425
I'm serious.

572
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,175
I promise.

573
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,000
You will?

574
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:01,375
I promise

575
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:03,275
I will do business seriously

576
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,875
and surprise my father.

577
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,275
When I make money,
I'll buy presents for you.

578
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:10,865
Fine.

579
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,975
I'll trust you one more time.

580
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,560
I'll transfer some money to you

581
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,760
from my private fund account.

582
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,479
Really?

583
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,325
In this way,

584
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:20,725
your father won't be aware.

585
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,239
But I'm warning you.

586
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,520
This is the last time.

587
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,400
Yes.

588
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,560
And you mustn't be on the tiles anymore.

589
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,359
Got it?

590
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,500
I won't be on the tiles anymore.

591
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,925
I love you, Mom.

592
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,025
Come on, you're no longer young.

593
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:36,800
Why are you still childish?

594
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,560
However old I am, I love my mother.

595
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,600
All right. All right.

596
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,475
Go get packed.

597
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:42,875
And let's go home.

598
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:44,314
Hurry. Look how thin you are now!

599
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,250
(Sansan)
Shall we meet tomorrow?

600
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,100
Why are you playing
with your phone again?

601
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:57,560
I'll stop. I'll stop.

602
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,475
Get packed and let's go home.

603
00:32:58,475 --> 00:32:59,825
I'm on it.

604
00:33:01,425 --> 00:33:02,250
Dr. Gu,

605
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,750
what are we going to have for lunch?

606
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:04,880
It's up to you.

607
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,125
How about the hot pot?

608
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,050
Barbecue or crawfish?

609
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,150
What?

610
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:15,350
(Healthy porridge)
Those kinds of food

611
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,680
(Healthy porridge)
will easily accumulate heat in your body

612
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,274
(Healthy porridge)
and cause gastrointestinal illness.

613
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:20,900
You'd better have
less greasy or spicy food.

614
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,079
As a gastroenterologist,

615
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,000
I suggest a bland diet.

616
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,350
Check the menu

617
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,225
and see what you would like to eat.

618
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,050
Less salt and oil?

619
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,675
Normally, no oil is used in porridge.

620
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:41,050
You know quite a lot, Dr. Gu.

621
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,239
Here's our order. Thank you.

622
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:43,525
Okay. Please wait.

623
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,650
Is it appropriate?

624
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,080
Well, thank you, Dr. Gu.

625
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,375
Your hands will be cleaned then.

626
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:13,800
Okay.

627
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:24,840
Thank you.

628
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:25,850
Enjoy your meal.

629
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,275
Dr. Gu,

630
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,125
you're not a big eater.

631
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:37,100
You don't like the food?

632
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,800
Shall we go to another restaurant?

633
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,800
No, no. I'm just having a free lunch.

634
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,225
I don't have the nerve
to request anything.

635
00:34:42,275 --> 00:34:44,120
It's good. Good.

636
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,300
It's healthy food.

637
00:34:46,575 --> 00:34:47,650
You're right.

638
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,150
Didn't you say you would compensate me?

639
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,150
Right, right. I will.

640
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,750
I'll buy a new suit for you.

641
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,625
Not a very expensive one, okay?

642
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,750
Don't bother. Compensate me with labor.

643
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,650
I plan to move out.

644
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,550
Check the apartments for me.

645
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:15,439
Oh, no problem.

646
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:16,825
You should have told me.

647
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:17,875
I can help.

648
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,000
When will you be available?

649
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,239
Shall we make a date

650
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,360
to check the apartments together?

651
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,520
Seriously, Dr. Gu?

652
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,869
How old-fashioned you are!

653
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:26,750
When you want to check an apartment,

654
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,310
you can do it online.

655
00:35:32,325 --> 00:35:33,175
Don't get me wrong.

656
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:34,200
I don't mean to laugh at you.

657
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,355
I just think...

658
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:38,300
Oh, I know. You're a serious guy.

659
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,375
And you don't often surf the Internet.

660
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:40,455
I get it.

661
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:42,199
Count on me.

662
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,300
You'll be satisfied.

663
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,840
Have some porridge.

664
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,025
Okay. Okay.

665
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,400
Enjoy your porridge, too.

666
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,679
Hello. This is your milk.

667
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,575
Thank you.

668
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,225
You came to me so early in the morning.

669
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:15,875
You're more punctual
than you are at work.

670
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,375
I have some good news for you.

671
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,450
I've rented the shop you fancied.

672
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,075
The one in the downtown?

673
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,875
Aren't you afraid
that you can't recover your costs?

674
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,675
What am I afraid of?

675
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,525
I'm Gu Xiao,

676
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,850
from a rich family.

677
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,679
I can do whatever I want.

678
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:38,750
Just think about it.

679
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,351
Think about the name of our café.

680
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:41,925
Name?

681
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,350
Enjoy?

682
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:50,600
Tasty?

683
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:55,025
Enjoy and tasty?

684
00:36:55,025 --> 00:36:55,650
Mm.

685
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:02,275
Sounds good.

686
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,479
But a little bit

687
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:06,560
uninspired.

688
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,900
Uninspired?

689
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,320
Why don't you think of one?

690
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,700
I indeed came up with one.

691
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,425
San Gu Cafe.

692
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,750
Our names are in it.

693
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,850
In memory of our meeting.

694
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:19,175
What do you think?

695
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,800
San Gu?

696
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:25,825
What makes our meeting

697
00:37:25,825 --> 00:37:27,825
worth remembering?

698
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,600
What are you talking about?

699
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,199
Our meeting isn't worth remembering?

700
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,000
Think about it.

701
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:34,280
How did we meet?

702
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,925
It was indeed an unusual meeting.

703
00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:38,450
But it was also interesting.

704
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,800
Shall we do it again tonight?

705
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,199
Go away.

706
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,150
Why can't friends warm each other?

707
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,000
I don't need it.

708
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,325
Let me know when you need it.

709
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,825
(In-patient)

710
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,025
Dr. Gu.

711
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,050
What did the director say?

712
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:25,975
He asked me to rest for half a month.

713
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,825
In this way,

714
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:30,075
don't practice the cello
during that time.

715
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:35,150
Oh.

716
00:38:36,225 --> 00:38:37,525
Goodbye, Dr. Gu.

717
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,425
(Symphony Orchestra)
You all did a great job at the concert.

718
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,540
I'd like to heavily praise Fang Zhou.

719
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,150
When she was assigned the mission
at the last minute,

720
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,538
she performed wonderfully

721
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
and cooperated perfectly
with other students.

722
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,125
She's awesome.

723
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,350
Thank you, Madam.

724
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,921
Fang Zhou is really great.

725
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,600
Zhixiao,

726
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,875
why haven't you slept
at this time of night?

727
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,925
Can you hear me, Zhixiao?

728
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,350
Hello, Dr. Gu.

729
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,400
Hello, Aunt Li.

730
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,600
I'm sorry

731
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,719
to call you at this time of night.

732
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,375
I was just off work.

733
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,225
I'm calling to check

734
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:24,500
Mr. Lin's physical condition.

735
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,275
It's so considerate of you, Dr. Gu.

736
00:40:26,275 --> 00:40:28,356
He's recovering very well.

737
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,375
I'm glad to hear that.

738
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,760
By the way,

739
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,000
is Lin Zhixiao

740
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,500
still playing the cello?

741
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,000
Even you heard it?

742
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,760
Yes, yes.

743
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,250
I don't know why,

744
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,950
but since she came back home,
she's locked herself in the room,

745
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,250
playing the cello continually.

746
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,850
I called her, but she ignored me.

747
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,900
Actually, playing the cello
for a long time

748
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,479
and sitting with one pose

749
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,040
will be particularly bad for health.

750
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,950
She isn't in a hurry for the practice.

751
00:40:52,479 --> 00:40:54,100
She should rest regularly.

752
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,350
Okay. Thank you for reminding me.

753
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,910
I'll try to stop her.

754
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,200
- Goodbye, Aunt Li.
- Okay.

755
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,475
Goodbye.

756
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:07,560
Zhixiao, it's getting late.

757
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,625
Get to bed early

758
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:09,975
and play the cello tomorrow, okay?

759
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:13,875
Zhixiao.

760
00:41:23,725 --> 00:41:24,675
Dr. Gu.

761
00:41:24,675 --> 00:41:25,400
Mm.

762
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,875
How's your wrist recovering?

763
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,350
Have you taken enough rest

764
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,350
as the doctor asked you to?

765
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,500
I have.

766
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,825
I've been resting.

767
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,224
I haven't played the cello.

768
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,425
Oh, really?

769
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,199
Now that you've taken enough rest,

770
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,475
please do me a favor.

771
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,000
You promised

772
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,375
to check the apartments for me, right?

773
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:46,879
I've been very busy lately.

774
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:47,900
So, could you please

775
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,925
sort out a file of apartments for me?

776
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,479
In the file,

777
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:53,875
there should be
more than a hundred apartments.

778
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:55,800
Email it to me tomorrow morning.

779
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,600
What?

780
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,650
A hundred apartments?

781
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,300
I want more alternates.

782
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,919
I'll count on you, then.

783
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:04,150
Dr. Gu, Dr...

784
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,025
What on earth is going on?

785
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:12,775
A hundred apartments?

786
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,760
What a cheap labor

787
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,125
to compensate him!

788
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,800
For Mr. Lin,

789
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,850
I'll bear with it.

(58. com, Apartments to let)

791
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,159
I'm not compensating him.

792
00:42:51,925 --> 00:42:54,391
He's exploiting me instead.
