What's wrong, Mr. Lin?

19
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,440
What's wrong?

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Huijuan…

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,550
Huijuan…

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,270
I'll go give her a call.

23
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,540
(Beds No. 08-09, Ward No. 4)

24
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,320
Actually,

25
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,800
when Mr. Lin is asleep,

26
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,390
you can also take a rest.

27
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,390
Thank you for your concern.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,670
Ms. Li, what were you doing?

29
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,080
Why didn't you answer the phone?

30
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,910
Zhixiao,

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,630
I'm a little bit sleepy.

32
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,470
Call me later.

33
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,600
What's wrong, Ms. Li?

34
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,080
Mom? Mom?

35
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,360
What's wrong?

36
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,440
Nothing.

37
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,240
I may have to go home now.

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,140
(In-patient)

39
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,520
Hello.

40
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,550
What?

41
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,440
You don't look very well

42
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,320
and Aunt Li will worry about you.

43
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,790
Let her take a good rest.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,830
Come with me.

45
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,200
You're awake?

46
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,160
How's my mother?

47
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,790
Have you checked on her?

48
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,640
How's she?

49
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't worry.

50
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,270
She just has a cold.

51
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,950
In the day, she realized

52
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,950
that she had a cold.

53
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,880
In case Mr. Lin was too weak

54
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,720
after the chemotherapy,

55
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,040
she didn't dare
to return to the hospital.

56
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,760
As she wanted to nurse that cold soon,

57
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,160
she took double doses of the medicine.

58
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,720
When the medicine began to take effect,

59
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,920
she fell into a deep sleep.

60
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,390
Don't worry.

61
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,270
She's all right now.

62
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,550
Just let her rest.

63
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,760
You didn't tell her

64
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,000
I wasn't very well, did you?

65
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,390
I didn't.

66
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,110
My father is still in hospital.

67
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,440
Rest assured.

68
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,950
Xiaowei is on duty today.

69
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,440
I've told her

70
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,950
to inform me in no time

71
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,480
if anything happens.

72
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,600
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

73
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,640
I'd better return to the hospital.

74
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,830
If I stay here,

75
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,160
I think I'll inconvenience you.

76
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,350
I really feel sorry for that.

77
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,920
No. Where do you think you can go?

78
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,880
You're the weakest now.

79
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,070
You have a cold.

80
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,230
And you're suffering from hypoglycemia

81
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,350
caused by overfatigue.

82
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,830
What you should do now is

83
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,200
to take the medicine regularly

84
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,440
and have enough rest, you know?

85
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,510
When I drifted off

86
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,390
in the hospital,

87
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:23,920
I felt that someone

88
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,070
touched my neck and forehead.

89
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,950
It was you,

90
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,070
right?

91
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,440
Your senior...

92
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,790
Shao Jiang.

93
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,510
Whatever.

94
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,480
Now that you were so busy,

95
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,160
why didn't ask him for help?

96
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,040
Why would I ask him for help?

97
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,320
He's not the nurse's aide of our family.

98
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,480
Why would I always bother him?

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,830
Right.

100
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,640
He can't be a nurse's aide.

101
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,880
He will be one of your family.

102
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,200
Now that you and he like each other...

103
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,720
Who told you that?

104
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,000
I like someone else.

105
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,440
Take the medicine first.

106
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,880
Put your hand out.

107
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,390
Thank you.

108
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,070
Take a good rest, then.

109
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,320
Leave everything to tomorrow.

110
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,480
I'm going to sleep.

111
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,720
You may leave.

112
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,200
Don't tuck yourself in the quilt.

113
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,670
Or you'll feel suffocated.

114
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:54,950
I...

115
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,390
I'll leave you alone.

116
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,920
Call me if you need anything.

117
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,620
(Clinical Oncology)

118
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,500
(Gu Xiao)

119
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,550
Hello.

120
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,470
Hello, Wei.

121
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,030
How's your mood?

122
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,030
Let me cheer you up,

123
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,320
will you?

124
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,790
I'm in a good mood.

125
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,710
There's nothing

126
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,880
that I can't handle.

127
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,470
Just mind your own business.

128
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,030
Hello?

129
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,080
What a bad temper!

130
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,150
Lin Zhixiao,

131
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,150
you just took the medicine
on an empty stomach.

132
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,710
You have to eat some porridge.

133
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,790
Lin Zhixiao. Lin Zhixiao.

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,470
I want some more sleep.

135
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,280
Good girl, get up and have the porridge.

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,350
Come on. Let me get you up.

137
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,760
It may be a little bit hot.

138
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,280
Here.

139
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,550
Have some more.

140
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,790
It tastes terrible.

141
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
I don't want it anymore.

142
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,790
I want to sleep.

143
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,910
Be careful. Come on.

144
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,960
Be careful.

145
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,790
I'll take my leave, then.

146
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,350
Don't leave.

147
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,030
You're awake?

148
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,550
I'm sorry.

149
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,150
You sweated a lot.

150
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,350
Go take a bath.

151
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,520
I'll get some clothes for you.

152
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,440
Thank you.

153
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,520
(It's the smell of Dr. Gu.)

154
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,000
What happened, Zhixiao?

155
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,710
Lin Zhixiao.

156
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
Are you feeling unwell?

157
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,110
No, no.

158
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,230
I don't want you to see me.

159
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,710
Good girl, let me check on you.

160
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,030
Are you getting allergic?

161
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
Are you allergic to peanuts?

162
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,230
I put some peanuts in the porridge.

163
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,670
Sorry.

164
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,760
I didn't know you were allergic to them.

165
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,080
I'm sure I look ugly now.

166
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,670
No. Let me...

167
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,590
Let me check on you.

168
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,840
Trust me.

169
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,760
In my eyes,

170
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,030
you're always lovely.

171
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,760
What's wrong?

172
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,840
Does it hurt?

173

00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,470
such a careful

343
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,920
and responsible doctor as Dr. Gu?

344
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,680
All right.

345
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,430
I'll listen to you.

346
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,040
Let's stay in China for the treatment.

347
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,310
Let the doctors observe you for a while.

348
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,560
Could you...?

349
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,430
Could you be seated for a moment?

350
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,800
You're making me dizzy.

351
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,190
I can't even watch TV.

352
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,920
Ms. Li, Ms. Li.

353
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,310
Dr. Gu said

354
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,350
he would call us

355
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,470
as soon as he got the report.

356
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,350
Look, even Lin is calm.

357
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,520
Stop walking back and forth.

358
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,160
Just be seated for a while.

359
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,680
But they said

360
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,800
they would call at around ten o'clock.

361
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,590
Look.

362
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,800
It's already two past ten

363
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,680
and they haven't called us yet.

364
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,430
Just wait.

365
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,000
They won't be so punctual.

366
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
It's ringing.

367
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I... Who'll answer it?

368
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,230
I'm too nervous. Hurry.

369
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,230
- Come on, Zhixiao.
- Let me answer it.

370
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,000
Dr. Gu, this is Lin Zhixiao.

371
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,880
Have you got my father's report?

372
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,070
Good news.

373
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,310
According to the index
of carcinoembryonic antigen,

374
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,310
the chemotherapies worked
better than we expected.

375
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,880
Does it mean

376
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,640
his chemotherapies in China are useful?

377
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,760
Yes.

378
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,160
See? I told you.

379
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,920
All right. Stop.

380
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,040
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

381
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,230
All right. All right.

382
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,520
Today is a big day for us.

383
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,350
We must celebrate it.

384
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,880
Zhixiao,

385
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,950
go grocery shopping with me.

386
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,400
Dr. Gu, um...

387
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,950
Thank you.

388
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,310
We're too excited.

389
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,760
If...

390
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,000
If you don't mind,

391
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
I'll hang up.

392
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,110
Wait a minute.

393
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,470
What?

394
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,230
I've been expecting

395
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,070
to tell you something.

396
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,560
What is it?

397
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,280
I always wanted to tell you

398
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,110
that I'm sorry.

399
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,040
I was rude to you.

400
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,470
First,

401
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,640
I was stressed out at work.

402
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,520
Second,

403
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,110
I mistakenly believed

404
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,310
that you were in a relationship
with Shao Jiang.

405
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,280
What do you mean, Dr. Gu?

406
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,880
I mean it literally.

407
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,280
Gu Wei,

408
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,950
I...

409
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,350
Sorry,

410
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,310
but I've got something urgent to do.

411
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,070
Shall we talk later?

412
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,830
Okay. No problem.

413
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,310
Bye-bye, Dr. Gu.

414
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,280
Wei,

415
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,070
I've modified the paper

416
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,230
as you told me.

417
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,160
I have to submit it soon.

418
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,230
Please review it again.

419
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,640
Don't make me feel
that you get plenty of time.

420
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,950
Or you'll suffer the consequences.

421
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,230
I'll return it after the modification.

422
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,830
Okay.

423
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,310
Review it quickly.

424
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,950
What's wrong, Zhixiao?

425
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,190
Zhixiao, what happened?

426
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,640
Nothing.

427
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,350
Is there anything wrong
with your father?

428
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,280
No.

429
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,560
According to Dr. Gu,

430
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,950
my father is in good condition.

431
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,800
Don't worry.

432
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,190
He just told me

433
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,590
some professional terms

434
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,760
and I didn't really understand.

435
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:40,950
When I go to the hospital

436
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,310
to fetch the report,

437
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,470
I'll ask him face to face.

438
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,680
Ms. Li, aren't we going

439
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,590
to buy some groceries?

440
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,640
I'll get changed

441
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,470
and then go with you.

442
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,280
Right, right.

443
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,560
We'll go buy some groceries.

444
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,680
- Wait for us at home.
- Okay.

445
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:14,880
It's hot.

446
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,070
I think Gu Xiao

447
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,160
has been better.

448
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,470
He looks more reliable now.

449
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,800
In the day, he pretends to work hard.

450
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,830
But every night,

451
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,040
he invites his friends

452
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,520
to drink in our cafe.

453
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,680
He's just extravagant.

454
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,800
Won't you think more about it?

455
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,280
What if he dumps you?

456
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,590
So what?

457
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,880
I'll have new boys.

458
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,950
I'm not like you.

459
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,040
You're just a stick-in-the-mud.

460
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,350
Why am I a stick-in-the-mud?

461
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,000
I...

462
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,280
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

463
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,710
Who wants

464
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,800
to express her gratitude

465
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,400
to her Dr. Gu?

466
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,520
Isn't that normal?

467
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,310
My father is getting better.

468
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,430
I should

469
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,920
thank Dr. Gu for that.

470
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,710
In this case,

471
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,680
I advise you

472
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,110
to give him a banner.

473
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,560
And it says,

474
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,110
"Thank you, benevolent doctor."

475
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,430
Such banners are sold
around the hospital.

476
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,400
A wide variety of styles.

477
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,400
You want me

478
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,070
to give him a banner

479
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,710
with such words on it.

480
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,110
It's quite weird, okay?

481
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,350
To give him a present, I should...

482
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,160
I should at least...

483
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,880
Dr. Gu,

484
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,400
it's the anti-hair loss shampoo.

485
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,430
Men's Supplements. Come on!

486
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,710
You think the banner

487
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,830
doesn't accord with

488
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,190
your eagerness

489
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,280
to make the man you like

490
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,710
confess his love to you.

491
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,800
Don't talk nonsense.

492
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,880
I'm not thinking like that.

493
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,830
Don't pretend in front of me.

494
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,040
I've been worried about you.

495
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,830
How ungrateful you are!

496
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,470
What do you mean pretending?

497
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,350
I'm not pretending. I...

498
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,520
Keep your voice down.

499
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,640
Who told me that

500
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,040
"Shall we talk later?"

501
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,680
When is later?

502
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,230
Will you really talk to me later or not?

503
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,470
Shut up.

504
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,680
This time, I'm very keen

505
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,070
to give him a present.

506
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,000
But I don't know what I shall give him.

507
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,390
Help me figure out

508
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,080
what present can be the most suitable.

509
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,800
I find it boring

510
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,000
to give him a normal present.

511
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,870
How about playing the cello for him?

512
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:20,840
Playing the cello for him?

513
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,360
When you make it

514
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,390
romantic enough,

515
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,040
he'll confess his love to you

516
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,150
if he really likes you.

517
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,360
Let me say it again.

518
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,040
I'm not planning
to confess my love to him.

519
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,360
What's your plan, then?

520
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,120
To thank him.

521
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,950
I just want to thank him.

522
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,840
Fine, I get it.

523
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,560
You just want romantic involvement

524
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,710
with him.

525
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,360
Then you won't be

526
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,600
in a relationship with him
until much later.

527
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,470
Stop. Say no more.

528
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,870
Just say no more, okay?

529
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,600
Bye-bye, my friend.

530
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:47,870
Bye.

531
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,670
Don't leave.

532
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,230
I've got many more...

533
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,840
I'll take my leave. Bye-bye.

534

Zhixiao. Zhixiao.

535
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,470
Honey, time for the medicine.

536
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,910
Go take it in the bedroom.

537
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,950
Take the vitamin C, too.

538
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,230
Zhixiao,

539
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,670
it's already late.

540
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,390
Where are you going?

541
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,670
To have a battle with someone?

542
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,630
Something like that.

543
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,120
I'm exhausted.

544
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,500
(Gastroenterology Center)

545
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,190
If you don't mind,

546
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,190
I'll knock off.

547
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,360
Okay.

548
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,600
Get to your business.

549
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,320
Yes.

550
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,390
Why are you here?

551
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,560
Dr. Gu,

552
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,910
I want to play the cello for you.

553
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,600
May I?

554
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,320
Yes.

555
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,630
Rooftop?

556
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:21,670
Is it heavy?

557
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,150
You want to play the cello for me,

558
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,080
don't you?

559
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,230
Get started.

560
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,630
(Dr. Gu,)

561
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,280
(I'm playing the polka)

562
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,560
(for you.)

563
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,280
(It's plain and simple,)

564
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,710
(just like my love for you)

565
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,390
(that you can hear.)

566
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,840
Thank you.

567
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,040
It sounds great.

568
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:15,670
But...

569
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:15,950
Dr. Gu,

570
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,910
don't bother to say anything.

571
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:21,800
I just came

572
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,120
to play the cello for you

573
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,760
and thank you

574
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,150
for taking care of my father.

575
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,320
I don't mean anything else.

576
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,280
I'll take my leave.

577
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:29,520
But...

578
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,470
(Hello, where are you?)

579
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,040
I... I...

580
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,760
I'm...

581
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,520
I saw you.

582
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,910
Let me drive you home.

583
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,360
Don't bother.

584
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,600
I can go home alone.

585
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,040
You have work to do, don't you?

586
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,760
Have you brought an umbrella?

587
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,600
I'll go take the subway.

588
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,870
I can run there. It's close.

589
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:40,840
Let me walk you.

590
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,710
Thank you.

591
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,320
You got caught in the rain.
When you're home, have some hot water

592
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,950
and take a hot bath.

593
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,150
Don't catch a cold.

594
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,520
Okay.

595
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,320
Dr. Gu,

596
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,840
how many people

597
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,360
have you walked to the subway?

598
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,430
My cousin,

599
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,710
friends, and classmates.

600
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,630
What about your patient's family?

601
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,710
A doctor's job doesn't include

602
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,190
walking his patient's family
to the subway.

603
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,630
If I'm not your patient's family,

604
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,670
what am I?

605
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:38,870
Sorry.

606
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,520
It was too noisy just now.

607
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,230
I didn't hear you.

608
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,190
What did you just say?

609
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,190
Nothing.

610
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,040
I said nothing.

611
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,470
I'll take my leave.

612
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,390
Wait a minute for me.

613
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,520
Don't get in the carriage yet.

614
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,080
Drink it when you're back home.

615
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,870
Pepsi?

616
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,910
Okay.

617
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,230
I'm leaving, then.

618
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,950
Bye-bye.

619
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:22,980
Why do you always

620
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,140
=The Oath of Love=
trust Shao Jiang instead of me?

621
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,980
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
Because I care for you.

622
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,380
I care for you.

623
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,060
So, I often mention him

624
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,220
to make you jealous.

625
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,580
I indeed care for you.

626
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,420
It's the girls' trick. Don't you know?

627
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,140
My mother is right.

628
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,860
About what?

629
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,940
The more beautiful a girl is,

630
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,860
the more deceptive she can be.

631
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,260
A man can always

632
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,220
be deceitful.

633
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,100
Let me ask you something.

634
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,380
When we were here last time,

635
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,380
why did we quarrel?

636
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,460
How do I know?

637
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,180
You shall explain.

638
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,540
Why did we quarrel?

639
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:52,660
People quarrel,

640
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,260
medically speaking,

641
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,460
only because

642
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,580
they want

643
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,100
to give vent

644
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:57,620
to their emotions.

645
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,980
Some people,

646
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,420
for example,

647
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,060
like to take their frustrations out

648
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,980
in this way

649
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,420
when life doesn't go very well.

650
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,780
What do you mean?

651
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,620
Are you saying

652
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,780
that my life

653
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,780
doesn't go very well

654
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,860
and I want to give vent to my anger?

655
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,540
I don't mean that.

656
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,300
So, you think I'm making trouble
out of nothing?

657
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:16,780
No.

658
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,460
You think I just want to quarrel?

659
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,580
No. You're just overthinking.

660
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,420
How would I think like that?

661
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,820
Do you think I'm very bad-tempered?

662
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,260
You hesitated.

663
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,580
You hesitated.

664
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,060
A little bit.

665
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,140
A little bit?

666
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,460
You have a second chance.

667
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,940
Not at all.
