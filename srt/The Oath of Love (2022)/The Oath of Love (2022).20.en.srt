You can't say that.

20
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,270
Now you are his sister-in-law.

21
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,270
Who is his sister-in-law?

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,440
Xiao Shan.

23
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,870
I want to give Zhixiao a surprise.

24
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,590
Okay.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,830
What's going on?

26
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,670
Sansan, what's the matter?

27
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,030
Hello, Zhixiao.

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,000
Have you finished your class?

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,960
I'm in the library right now.

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,320
Why do you sound like

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,360
you're in a bad mood?

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,630
Well,

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,550
I booked a guest house in the suburbs.

34
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,800
Come with me and we can have fun there.

35
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,720
Right now?

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,190
It's a deal.

37
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,880
Go home now

38
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,830
and pack your stuff.

39
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,550
I'll meet you

40
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,320
downstairs at your house later.

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,270
Bye-bye.

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,160
(The number you dialed)

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,960
(cannot be connected for the moment.)

44
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,960
(Please redial later.)

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,160
Get in the car.

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,320
No, I'm waiting for Sansan.

47
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,520
Sansan won't come. There is only me.

48
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,110
I accidentally said the wrong thing

49
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,960
and gave my girlfriend the wrong idea.

50
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,320
So, I had to take a few days off

51
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,520
and take my girlfriend out for a trip

52
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,720
as an apology.

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,600
I don't know if my girlfriend

54
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,190
would accept it.

55
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,240
You didn't give your girlfriend

56
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,320
the wrong idea.

57
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,270
What she thinks is true, isn't it?

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,670
I don't know if other people like it

59
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,910
when their girlfriends are clingy,

60
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,240
but I like it.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,110
It's okay

62
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,110
if you don't stick to me.

63
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,360
I'll just stick to you from now on.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,520
You're really annoying, do you know it?

65
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,030
How did you make me

66
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,110
stop being angry with a few words?

67
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,000
I was not going to talk to you

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,910
in the next three days.

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,830
It's a good thing
that you cool off quick.

70
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,670
It means you can often get angry.

71
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,070
Rest assured.

72
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,550
I won't feel pressure.

73
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,880
That's not who I am.

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,880
You must be hungry.

75
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,200
Here.

76
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,760
Don't think

77
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,600
you can butter me up with this.

78
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,040
Get in the car.

79
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,600
Take my luggage.

80
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,480
(What kind of surprise)

81
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,790
(will Dr. Gu give me)

82
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,200
(this time?)

83
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,670
I specially

84
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,950
prepared this for you.

85
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,350
You've been sitting in the car all day.

86
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,110
You must be tired.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,320
Take a bath and have some rest.

88
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,440
I didn't know

89
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,320
you're such a romantic man.

90
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,390
Of course.

91
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,670
I love it.

92
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,230
Where are you taking me?

93
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,110
Why?

94
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,230
You look disappointed.

95
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,000
No.

96
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,390
I'm just worried

97
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,000
you'll take me

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,390
to survive in the wild.

99
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,480
If that were the case,

100
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,070
I would have told you in advance,

101
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,830
so you could be prepared.

102
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,480
They've been talking

103
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,640
about meteor shower recently
in the hospital.

104
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,880
I'll take you to see the stars.

105
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,000
Meteor shower?

106
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,160
Does it mean I can make a wish?

107
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,230
Are we going

108
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,000
to live there?

109
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,880
Don't worry.

110
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:05,920
Although it's not

111
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,110
a famous scenic spot,

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,720
there is still a guest house.

113
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,670
I won't let you sleep in the open air.

114
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,070
Here, you guys.

115
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,480
Take your ID cards and room card.

116
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,920
Have a pleasant

117
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,110
and wonderful evening.

118
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,390
Thank you.

119
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,590
(Relro gakka)

120
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,160
Hello.

121
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,160
Hello, I want to check in.

122
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,760
Okay.

123
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,200
How many rooms do you want?

124
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,880
Two.

125
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,760
Two?

126
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes.

127
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,440
All right.

128
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,480
Give me your ID cards.

129
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,440
Okay.

130
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,920
Sorry.

131
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,830
We only have one room left.

132
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,880
A deluxe double king-size room.

133
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,350
Is there a sofa?

134
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,350
Yes.

135
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,760
Okay, we'll have the big room.

136
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,470
Okay.

137
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,840
Okay. You can decide.

138
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,520
Let's go there tomorrow.

139
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,320
Okay, what do you want
to eat for dinner?

140
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,320
All right. You guys.

141
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,910
Here is your room card

142
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,670
and your ID cards.

143
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,760
Have a romantic

144
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,520
and wonderful evening.

145
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,520
Thank you.

146
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,000
Hello.

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,710
Hello.

148
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,230
Sir, do you still have rooms?

149
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,960
Yes.

150
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,840
There is only

151
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,230
one deluxe double king-size room.

152
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,760
Come on, everyone.

153
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,320
The owner is quite interesting.

154
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,440
How about I...

155
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,880
Zhixiao, how about this?

156
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,230
Let's put our luggage in the room first,

157
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,200
and I'll come back later.

158
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,150
Okay.

159
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,200
Here. You guys.

160
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,280
Take your ID cards and the room card.

161
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,030
Thank you.

162
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,840
Have a romantic

163
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,440
and wonderful evening.

164
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,000
We booked ten rooms

165
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
for the 15th.

166
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,030
Okay.

167
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,910
And...

168
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,640
Wait here.

169
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll check the doors
and the windows first.

170
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,110
Zhixiao.

171
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,960
Wait a minute.

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,590
Have you finished?

173
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,880
Can I come in?

174
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,350
Just a minute.

175
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,960
Okay!

176
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,670
I'm coming in!

177
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,550
I'm done. Come in.

178
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,350
Come in.

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,710
You must be tired.

180
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,840
Take a break.

181
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,320
I'll unpack.

182
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,000
Don't sit down!

183
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,110
What's wrong?

184
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,280
It's dirty. Let me disinfect it first

185
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,840
in case of skin	allergy.

186
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,080
You neat freak.

187
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,760
It's a sickness and you need to cure it.

188
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,030
It's beautiful out there.

189
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,400
Done.

190
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,710
You can sit now.

191
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,640
Thank you.

192
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,520
There's still some time.

193
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,640
Do you want to go out

194
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,470
and walk around?

195
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,960
Okay.

196
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,400
I just saw a brochure

197
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
in the lobby

198
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,550
that says there's

199
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,670
a bridge of love nearby.

200
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,150
It's said that if a couple

201
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,400
walks across the bridge,

202
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,280
they will stay together forever.

203
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,000
Do you believe that?

204
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,880
Of course, I do.

205
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
If you believe in such things...

206
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,840
What's the matter?

207
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,640
It will come true if you believe in it.

208
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,350
I want to change my clothes

209
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,710
and go to the toilet.

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,840
Can you...

211
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,790
I'll meet you outside.

212
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,080
Okay.

213
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,030
Call me if you have any problems.

214
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,350
What's the matter?

215
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,030
Sansan, there is a big problem.

216
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,670
You have to save me.

217
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,320
Don't exaggerate it.

218
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,200
Aren't you supposed

219
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,440
to be traveling

220
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,880
with Dr. Gu?

221
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,200
How big the problem can be?

222
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,280
I'm not sure.

223
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,080
But I...

224
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,590
I saw it.

225
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,350
I saw...

226
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,280
You know it.

227
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,110
That's it!

228
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
How obvious the implication is.

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,230
Dear.

230
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,230
It's 2019 now.

231
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,440
Think about it,

232
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,550
what else can happen

233
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,440
when a couple

234
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,790
is alone in a room,

235
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,470
right?

236
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,150
But I...

237
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,590
I...

238
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,880
I'm not...

239
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,400
You're not ready?

240
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,230
- Well...
- Don't give her bad advice.

241
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,400
Let me talk to her.

242
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,110
Put her on speaker.

243
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,280
Zhixiao, listen to me.

244
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,350
If you're not ready,

245
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,520
it's okay to say no.

246
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,350
Do you know it?

247
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,710
How can she say no?

248
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,030
Think about it,

249
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:26,710
Dr. Gu

250
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,400
is a mature man,

251
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,110
right?

252
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,710
He won't force you.

253
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,640
What's more,

254
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,910
it's still in broad daylight.

255
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,760
You have plenty of time

256
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,080
to think about it.

257
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,760
But when it's dark

258
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,960
in the evening,

259
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,670
everything could happen.

260
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,280
Stop talking nonsense.

261
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,520
Zhixiao.

262
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,760
Is there anything wrong?

263
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,790
No!

264
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,230
I'll be right out there
after I put on some makeup!

265
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,200
I can't

266
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,640
talk to you now,

267
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,150
otherwise, Dr. Gu

268
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,840
will get suspicious.

269
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,760
I gotta go. Bye.

270
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,590
What was that?

271
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:17,910
I'm coming!

272
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,400
Shall we go?

273
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,150
Let's go.

274
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,080
Hold on. Hold on.

275
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,200
Let's not do this.

276
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,350
It's too scary.

277
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,960
Who wanted

278
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,030
to come to this place?

279
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,760
Who told me confidently

280
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,000
that it will come true
if you believe in it?

281
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,840
And you'll get what you want
if you wish hard.

282
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,470
That's superstition.

283
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,840
How can we

284
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,030
count on a bridge

285
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,150
to give us happiness,

286
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,880
right?

287
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,320
This is

288
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,520
too childish.

289
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,320
It disregards

290
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,910
the basic core of materialism.

291
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,960
You are...

292
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,840
We spent the afternoon
walking around the mountain

293
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,880
to get to this place.

294
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,790
To go back to the guest house,

295
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,440
there are only two options.

296
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,350
One, go back the way we came.

297
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,840
Two, walk across the bridge.

298
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,230
You can choose.

299
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,400
No, my legs are shaking.

300
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,150
I don't want to walk on it.

301
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,880
I'll carry you.

302
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,030
Come on, I'll carry you.

303
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,590
All right.

304
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,440
Ready?

305
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,910
Hold on! Hold on!

306
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,670
Put me down!

307
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,550
Put me down! Put me down!

308
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,520
You can't carry me!

309
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,230
What's wrong?

310
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,160
The brochure says

311
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,880
that it will only work when the couple

312
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,800
walks across it together.

313
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,070
It won't work

314
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,710
if my feet don't touch the bridge.

315
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,280
No, no, no.

316
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,590
You have

317
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,230
a very flexible view of science.

318
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,640
I'm a student of liberal arts.

319
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,190
Do you trust me?

320
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,310
You trust me.

321
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,230
Give me your hand.

322
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,190
I'll hold your hand all the time.

323
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,310
I promise

324
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,950
I won't let you go

325
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,950
no matter what happens.

326
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,830
Even if something happens,

327
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,950
I'll be with you, okay?

328
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,040
You're making it even scarier,

329
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,920
okay?

330
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,880
Trust me. Let's go.

331
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,710
Walk slowly.

332
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,830
Slowly.

333
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,230
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

334
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,760
Wait a minute.

335
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,920
Help me up. I'm not going anymore.

336
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,680
Is it scary?

337
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,920
Is it scary?

338
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,110
No.

339
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,040
What are you doing?

340
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,830
Wait a minute!

341
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,000
Look, they're laughing at you.

342
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,310
I don't want to play this.

343
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,470
You...

344
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,950
Let go of my hand.

345
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,880
It's really scary.

346
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,830
Gu... Gu Wei.

347
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,280
Can you slow down?

348
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,640
Am I not slow enough?

349
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,800
No.

350
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,590
You're fast now.

351
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,760
I'll slow down a little bit, all right?

352
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,430
Okay.

353
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,560
Slow down.

354
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,680
I'll slow down.

355
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,950
Don't scare me.

356
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,310
Are you scared?

357
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm not scared when you're around.

358
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,280
It's not that scary,

359
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,950
right?

360
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,160
Come on, be brave.

361
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,160
I, Lin Zhixiao,

362
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,470
will spend a lifetime
and grow old together with Gu Wei.

363
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,400
We'll grow old together.

364
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,590
We'll cross that bridge even if we die.

365
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,800
Let's not die.

366
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,040
We're gonna go across the bridge alive.

Zhixiao, I'll get another room.

386
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,920
Never mind.

387
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,040
It would be a waste of money
to get another room.

388
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Let's just make do with it.

389
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,280
Okay. Whatever you say.

390
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,310
Are you full?

391
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,430
Yes.

392
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,680
I'm also full.

393
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,110
Let me do it.

394
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,400
It's raining heavily outside.

395
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,430
Yeah.

396
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,950
It's only 7:00 PM now.

397
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,000
What are we gonna do next?

398
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,830
I brought books.

399
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,560
How about we read books together?

400
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,110
All right.

401
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,470
I brought the July, the August,

402
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,640
and the September issues of Gut.

403
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,800
And Huang Jiasi Surgery.

404
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,640
Which one do you want to read?

405
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,310
A-Any book will do.

406
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,560
In fact,

407
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,760
it just occurred to me

408
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,760
that reading right after a meal

409
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,110
isn't good for digestion.

410
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,350
How about

411
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,040
watching a movie?

412
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,710
Okay.

413
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,400
Do you like movies?

414
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,760
I like movies.

415
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,740
(Nine months later)

416
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,310
The window is not closed properly.

417
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,520
I'll check it.

418
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,070
Listen...

419
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,190
I'll go to the bathroom.

420
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,020
(With a number of allies
positioned throughout the group,)

421
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,140
(none of his rivals
dare to challenge him.)

422
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,760
Zhixiao, what's...

423
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,560
Sorry, sorry!

424
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,830
Don't look at me! Just go!

425
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,190
Zhixiao.

426
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:08,760
Are you okay?

427
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,230
Why don't you come out first?

428
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,520
No!

429
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,800
I'm not going out!

430
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,280
I... I didn't

431
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,230
see anything.

432
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,520
Don't take this the wrong way.

433
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,950
Liar!

434
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,190
You and Mr. Lin...

435
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,430
The second time

436
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:26,920
when you met me,

437
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,000
you just took one look

438
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,760
at Mr. Lin's medical records

439
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,470
and you memorized it.

440
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,280
How could you

441
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,920
not see anything?

442
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,230
Well, you can't

443
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,190
lock yourself in there

444
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,000
all night.

445
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,310
Stop talking.

446
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,760
Just go, okay?

447
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,590
Leave me alone.

448
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,590
I'll have another room.

449
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,950
Are you sure you want another room?

450
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,230
No.

451
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,520
I'm trying to help you.

452
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,950
Well...

453
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,400
All right.

454
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,400
I'll get you another room.

455
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,470
It has been a while.

456
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,190
How about we give Zhixiao a call?

457
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,110
Will we disturb them?

458
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,070
It's late now.

459
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,310
I don't think we will disturb them.

460
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,470
Let's call her. Let's call her.

461
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,190
Let's call her.

462
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,800
Okay?

463
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Okay. Call her.

464
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,190
Sansan.

465
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,160
How's it going?

466
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,680
I'm doomed.

467
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,190
What do I do?

468
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,520
There is a serious problem now.

469
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,190
Serious?

470
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,830
How is it serious?

471
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,160
Think about it.

472
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,350
There was such a great opportunity,

473
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,920
but he didn't try to do anything to you.

474
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,110
Well,

475
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,000
does he not like you enough?

476
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,640
Have I been putting
on too much weight lately?

477
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,230
I was trying to lose some weight.

478
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,520
But you guys kept asking me out

479
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,640
for milk tea.

480
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,350
I can't lose any weight.

481
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,310
I'm so fat now.

482
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:09,950
It's your fault!

483
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,350
It was you

484
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,590
who asked us out for milk tea, okay?

485
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,760
What's more,

486
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,520
can't you

487
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,590
have some confidence in yourself?

488
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,000
How?

489
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,350
You have no idea

490
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,310
what he just saw.

491
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,800
I must have had

492
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,760
a horrible look on my face

493
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,560
and acted in a weird way.

494
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,710
It was like a horror thriller.

495
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,040
You know,

496
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,710
he saw me in that way.

497
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,680
I was too ugly.

498
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:30,880
He will never

499
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,710
forget me

500
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,950
in that way.

501
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,070
Well,

502
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,230
you should get dressed up now

503
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,310
and go knock on his door

504
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,070
to save your image.

505
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,000
How's that?

506
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,590
How dare I go to see him again?

507
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,000
I can't even face him now.

508
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,590
Okay?

509
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,430
Are you never gonna see him again?

510
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,470
I'm not talking to you anymore.

511
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,710
I want to shut myself off for a while.

512
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,520
No, I'll shut myself off for a year.

513
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,470
I'll hang up. Bye-bye.

514
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,640
Zhixiao!

515
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,590
Lin Zhixiao.

516
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,880
Lin Zhixiao.

517
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,000
What's gonna save you?

518
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,040
Give me one.

519
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,000
What are you going to do?

520
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,710
How's that?

521
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,160
I don't know what to say
about your advice.

522
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,140
(Go to him now and tell him you are
afraid of thunder and the dark!)

523
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,560
Well,

524
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,920
this is too phony.

525
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,640
What's that?

526
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,640
The lightning!

527
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,280
It's too scary.

528
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,830
Will anything go wrong, honey?

529
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,830
It's okay. It should be all right.

530
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,000
What if you mistake someone else for me?

531
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,280
I will never mistake
anyone else for you.

532
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,520
Don't walk around on your own.

533
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,640
Let's go back to the room.

534
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,590
Why did you come back?

535
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,560
I'm worried you're afraid of thunder

536
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,350
and the dark.

537
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,880
Unfortunately, I lack

538
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,520
the qualities of the heroine
of the romance.

539
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,280
I'm not afraid of thunder, or the dark.

540
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm not afraid of bugs.

541
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,110
I'm not even afraid of snakes.

542
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,000
Well, good for you.

543
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,230
Of course.

544
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,920
Your hair is wet.

545
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,070
You're afraid of nothing.

546
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:58,760
Come over.

547
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,760
I want to ask you a question.

548
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,760
When you

549
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,190
saw me

550
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,310
in the bathroom,

551
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,400
why didn't you...

552
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,000
Why didn't I do what?

553
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,880
Never mind.

554
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,160
Just forget I asked you that.

555
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,230
Since you're so troubled

556
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,110
with this problem,

557
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,310
why don't we...

558
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,470
You...

559
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,760
You... you weren't like this before.

560
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,310
Actually, I've been always like this.

561
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,190
I just didn't want to scare you.

562
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,110
Since you're not against it,

563
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,430
why don't we just...

564
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,800
Look how scared you are.

565
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,800
All right, I won't tease you.

566
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,800
Have a good rest.

567
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,590
Don't overthink.

568
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,800
Who is overthinking?

569
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,160
I'm not overthinking, okay?

570
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,800
All right. All right.

571
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,350
I guess I'm overthinking.

572
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,040
Yes.

573
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,350
You're overthinking.

574
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,880
You...

575
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,920
You're the one who acted on impulse

576
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,560
and you're also the one
who got cold feet.

577
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,590
If I wanted to do something,

578
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,800
I would have done it a long time ago.

579
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,950
Would I wait until today?

580
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,560
Stop thinking about it.
Go to sleep early.

581
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,310
We're gonna climb mountains
tomorrow morning.

582
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,710
Climb mountains?

583
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,520
It has been raining today.

584
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
We didn't see the stars.

585
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,280
I'll take you
to see the sunrise tomorrow.

586
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,800
I can't take you all the way here
for nothing.

587
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:22,950
Go to sleep.

588
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,230
The rain is heavy.

589
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,080
I'll be here with you.

590
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,710
Zhixiao.

591
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,470
Are you overthinking again?

592
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,710
Do you think I'm judgy about you

593
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,190
and I don't like you enough?

594
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,320
Come over.

595
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,190
I don't deny

596
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,120
this matter

597
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,470
is important in a relationship.

598
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,280
I also know

599
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,840
more and more young people

600
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,840
advocate carpe diem.

601
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,280
But I think we should

602
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,950
take this matter seriously.

603
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,760
We should wait for the right moment,

604
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,470
when the time comes.

605
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,670
We still have a long way

606
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,760
ahead of us.

607
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,520
There's no rush,

608
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,080
right?

609
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,470
So,

610
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,230
it's not because

611
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,470
you don't like me enough?

612
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,190
Of course not, you little fool.

613
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,190
Maybe I'm just old-fashioned.

614
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,800
You're underestimating yourself.

615
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,840
You are

616
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,710
an unearthed relic, okay?

617
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,600
I'll accept that.

Because this is the first place

676
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,520
I came to the countryside

677
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,080

00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,800
I would sit here,

693
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,320
looking at the starry sky.

694
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,560
It made me

695
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,190
feel that

696
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,390
my spirit was pure

697
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,320
with no distracting thought at all.

698
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,520
I still remember that feeling.

699
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,320
I was thinking

700
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,040
if I meet someone

701
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,360
I love one day,

702
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:51,760
I must

703
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,870
bring her here.

704
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,630
That's very

705
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,230
romantic of you, Dr. Gu.

706
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,630
Of course.

707
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,000
I was young once.

708
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,950
Where is

709
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,120
the medical service station?

710
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,080
Can we see it from here?

711
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:15,840
It's over there.

712
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,430
Do you see it?

713
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,120
Was there an elementary school

714
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,000
halfway up the hill?

715
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,040
It moved away last year.

716
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,360
What's wrong?

717
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,470
That's why I found this place familiar

718
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,000
when I first got here.

719
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,710
I've been here before.

720
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,040
It's true.

721
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,150
When I was a freshman in college,

722
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,870
I spent my summer vacation here

723
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,710
as a volunteer

724
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,360
teaching left-behind children

725
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,320
music lessons.

726
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,600
I remember that school

727
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,560
was right there.

728
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,560
I think we might have met

729
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,320
at that time.

730
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,080
How?

731
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,150
Watch each other from the distance?

732
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,800
I'm not lying.

733
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,670
One night

734
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,870
a kid had a stomachache.

735
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,080
The substitute teacher

736
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,840
had a minor car accident on the way

737
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,320
and couldn't come.

738
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,470
I took the kid

739
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,120
to the medical service station.

740
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,520
I remember we went that way.

741
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,800
We walked a long way
on the mountain road.

742
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,000
It was dark and windy.

743
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,630
We suffered a lot.

744
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,950
I still remember it now.

745
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,670
And then?

746
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,080
Then it was the standard ending.

747
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,600
I met a doctor.

748
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,560
The doctor

749
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,760
saved the kid.

750
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,150
But I think

751
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,190
there was a problem with the doctor.

752
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,910
He had a really low EQ,

753
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,230
and he was mean and impolite.

754
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,870
I'm still impressed.

755
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,120
How exactly

756
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,760
was he

757
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,040
mean and impolite?

758
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,760
I don't remember the details.

759
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,430
But there was one good thing about him.

760
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,910
The doctor

761
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:46,910
had the best interests

762
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,390
of his patients at heart.

763
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,360
But as soon as he started to talk,

764
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,120
it was...

765
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:02,820
Here comes one of Gu Wei's
sharp questions.

=The Oath of Love=

767
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,740
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
Were you dancing with those guys

768
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,940
in the bar that day?

769
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,260
Of course not.

770
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:07,900
Do you think

771
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,940
I was dancing with them?

772
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:10,820
No?

773
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:11,700
No.

774
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:12,900
Are you imagining

775
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,060
that I was dancing with them?

776
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,540
Then

777
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,460
who was the guy next to you

778
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,660
when I found you?

779
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:19,620
I didn't even care

780
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,340
who he is.

781
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:21,820
You were...

782
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,620
How do you think I was dancing?

783
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,940
In a cute way?

784
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,020
Then what did you say

785
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,420
to that guy?

786
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,420
I said,

787
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,220
you are such an idiot,

788
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,180
you're ugly.

789
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,340
- No, no.
- You are no match for my boyfriend.

790
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,140
- No.
- You are no match for my boyfriend.

791
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,060
The last thing I heard was

792
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,860
he deserved to die alone.

793
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,060
Yeah, I meant him.

794
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,580
He deserved to die alone.

795
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,780
That man deserved

796
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:45,900
to die alone.

797
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,980
Then you walked in.

798
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,020
Really?

799
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:48,300
Yeah.

800
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:48,980
But why were you looking at me

801
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,420
so surprised?

802
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,700
Because I was excited.

803
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,300
Right at that moment,

804
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,820
my Prince Charming,

805
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,260
my boyfriend showed up

806
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,420
and saved me.

807
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,620
I was so happy!

808
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,900
Why don't you dance for me?

809
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,620
Why should I dance for you?

810
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,340
I want to see it.

811
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,180
I can do different types of dance.

812
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,220
Which one do you want to see?

813
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:07,820
Well...

814
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,340
You know,

815
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,500
I can't dance well

816
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,660
without music.

817
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,980
I can also do

818
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,980
Mongolian dance,

819
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,180
and Xinjiang dance.

820
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:19,740
I can do them all.

821
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,740
You should also dance for me.

822
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,980
- Let's stop. No dancing.
- You have to...

823
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,660
Why?

824
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,620
No, you have to dance.
