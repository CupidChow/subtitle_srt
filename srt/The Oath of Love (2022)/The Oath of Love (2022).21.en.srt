I don't exactly remember.

19
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,550
But he had one good point.

20
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,040
He did everything

21
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
in the best interests

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,510
of his patients.

23
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,480
But when he spoke,

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,230
he...

25
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,440
He what?

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,310
Why do I think

27
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,080
you're just like

28
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,400
that doctor?

29
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,680
No way.

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,400
That doctor was

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,800
tall, fat, and strong.

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,120
He was nothing like you.

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,000
It can't be you, right?

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,440
Wait a minute.

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,030
What? What are you looking for?

36
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,800
Is it him?

37
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,110
Dear me.

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,550
Is this you?

39
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,750
Yes, three years ago.

40
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,160
So,

41
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,910
you were the doctor I saw?

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,550
We indeed met three years ago?

43
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,160
How did you lose weight?

44
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,390
What's your secret?

45
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,670
Tell me about it.

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,270
I was busy working

47
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,360
and I had to maintain

48
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
the sensitivity of muscles.

49
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,830
I developed the habit of exercising

50
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,670
and then I lost weight.

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,670
As the saying goes,

52
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,600
when you're overweight, you're ugly.

53
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,630
I have to lose weight, too.

54
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,910
I have to.

55
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,880
Dear me.

56
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,910
You used to be a fat young man.

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,160
Oh, dear. It must be fate.

58
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,910
Zhixiao.

59
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,030
Come over.

60
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,270
Tell me.

61
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,630
If...

62
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,240
I mean if...

63
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,160
If I were

64
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,440
what I used to be,

65
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,910
would you not like me?

66
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,360
Am I that kind of shallow girl

67
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,880
who only cares for appearance?

68
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,600
Then...

69
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,320
If I get fat again,

70
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
don't dislike me.

71
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,550
This is

72
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,670
what I'm trying to say.

73
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,910
If I put on 30 catties,

74
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,750
would you dislike me?

75
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,670
I wouldn't!

76
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,830
30... 30 catties?

77
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,910
But being overweight will hurt

78
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,800
your health

79
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,000
and make your heart overburdened.

80
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,000
Besides, excessive body fat

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,390
of your viscera

82
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,440
will cause chronic illnesses,

83
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,240
including hypertension and hyperlipemia.

84
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,630
So,

85
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,440
I will

86
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
urge you to lose weight.

87
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,190
Don't touch me.

88
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,750
Wh... Why?

89
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,830
What's wrong?

90
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,750
At this moment,

91
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,670
shouldn't you say

92
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,360
something sweet like,

93
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,320
"No matter what you look like,

94
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,440
I will always love you."

95
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,830
No matter what you look like,

96
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,320
I will always love you.

97
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,440
No, no.

98
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,240
I reminded you of that.

99
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,440
It doesn't count.

100
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,080
No matter what you look like,

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,750
I will always love you.

102
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,040
I'm serious.

103
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,160
I forgive you, fatty.

104
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,350
So, my boyfriend

105
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,440
used to be a fat boy.

106
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,920
Fatty.

107
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,880
Counting from my first year

108
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,640
in college,

109
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,440
I've known you for three years.

110
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,880
In this way,

111
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,110
you were hating me

112
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,270
for most of the time,

113
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,160
right?

114
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,110
It's fate, anyway.

115
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,830
Fine.

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,070
You're always right.

117
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,510
Actually, when I came here

118
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,270
for the first time,

119
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,920
I hated this place a lot.

120
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,230
But now,

121
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,160
I find it

122
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,350
the most romantic place in the world.

123
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,350
Because it's where

124
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,390
we met each other.

125
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,920
Why don't you take me here

126
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,510
every year from now on?

127
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,230
I will.

What's on your mind?

135
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,320
I'm thinking

136
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,920
that you love me a lot.

137
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,790
Since when

138
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,640
did you fall in love with me?

139
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,040
You didn't fall in love
at first sight, I believe.

140
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,000
But I'm sure

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,230
you fell in love with me

142
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,110
before I fell in love with you,

143
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,950
right?

144
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,350
Didn't you

145
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,830
fall in love with me first?

146
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,230
Come on, boy, stop pretending.

147
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,160
I didn't understand it at that time.

148
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,830
But now I'm exactly aware.

149
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,200
You looked for my father with me

150
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,950
and helped me out at the concert.

151
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,070
You were doing this

152
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,070
beyond the doctor's duty.

153
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,040
Don't say you didn't like me then.

154
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,720
Then let me

155
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,040
explain to you.

156
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,200
First, I looked for Mr. Lin

157
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,920
because he was

158
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,880
my patient.

159
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,670
Second, the concert thing...

160
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,720
I happened to be free that day

161
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,440
and I visited the university
where I studied.

162
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,390
Unexpectedly, I saw

163
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,510
that someone was bullying you.

164
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,480
I couldn't leave you in the lurch.

165
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,550
What about my hand?

166
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,880
You cared a lot about my hand.

167
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,510
You forgot it again.

168
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,720
I'm a doctor.

169
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,760
Though I'm not an orthopedist,

170
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,600
taking care of the patient

171
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,950
should always be my duty.

172
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,550
What about the slippers?

173
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,480
And the couples' mugs.

174
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,670
We're neighbors.

175
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,790
You may visit me at any time.

176
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,550
And you know, I...

177
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:26,920
I am

178
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
a neat freak.

179
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,670
Don't keep denying it.

180
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,440
Just admit it.

181
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,640
Admit what?

182
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,920
You fell in love with me first.

183
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,950
Me?

184
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,480
You sorted out apartments for me

185
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,040
and helped with my house decoration.

186
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,320
Around that time,

187
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,270
you nearly took my home

188
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,320
as your own home.

189
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,760
You forced me

190
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,670
to sort out apartments for you.

191
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,720
As for the house decoration,

192
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,510
Ms. Li asked me

193
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,640
to take you shopping.

194
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,000
For the sake that you're all alone,

195
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,040
I helped with your house decoration.

196
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,440
It's the way

197
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,040
I care about a neighbor.

198
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,640
Fine. I get it.

199
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,790
I forced you to sort out
apartments for me, right?

200
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,200
Right.

201
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,160
Then you found the apartment

202
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,390
across the hall.

203
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,550
Is it because

204
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,790
you wanted to live near me?

205
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,950
And tell me.

206
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,950
When I checked Dr. Gao's apartment,

207
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,040
why were you angry?

208
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,830
You were jealous, weren't you?

209
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,230
I wasn't angry.

210
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,830
I wasn't jealous, either.

211
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,550
You even came to the hospital

212
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,760
and played the cello for me.

213
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,070
You left after you finished it.

214
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,790
Didn't you chase me?

215
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,920
You win.

216
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,950
I'll stop arguing.

217
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,390
I'm going to sleep.

218
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,510
Don't disturb me. Drive safe.

219
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,110
Silly goose,

220
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,280
I fell in love with you first.

221
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,590
You just admitted it?

222
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,670
Watch out for your head.

223
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,670
Done.

224
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,230
I'm not getting in.

225
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,110
I have to go back to work.

226
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,200
She'll be back soon, I guess.

227
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,470
Lin Zhixiao.

228
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,350
What... What's wrong?

229
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,550
What are you doing here?

230
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,840
Hello, Mr. Lin, Ms. Li.

231
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,470
Lin Zhixiao

232
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,320
nearly fell.

233
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,110
I gave her a hand.

234
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,200
I'm wearing high-heeled shoes.

235
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,000
And this is a slope.

236
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,840
Luckily, Dr. Gu gave me a hand.

237
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,590
He did?

238
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,030
Are you all right?

239
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,110
Yes. It only hurts a little bit.

240
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,640
Mr. Lin, Aunt Li,

241
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,710
are you back from grocery shopping?

242
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,110
Zhixiao went traveling the other day

243
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,320
and she came back today.

244
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,790
I'll make the pork-rib soup

245
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,150
she likes most.

246
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,080
Ms. Li,

247
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,790
it's so nice of you.

248
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,320
She knows I like pork-rib soup most.

249
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,280
If you excuse me,

250
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,110
I'm going to work.

251
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,350
Off you go, Dr. Gu.

252
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Goodbye, Mr. Lin, Ms. Li.

253
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,670
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

254
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,350
Goodbye.

255
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,400
Be careful when you walk.

256
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,790
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

257
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,000
What?

258
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,200
Aren't you happy to see me?

259
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,230
Go. Let's go back home.

260
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,710
Your trunk...

261
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,520
I forgot it.

262
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,880
How careless you are!

263
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,640
What are you looking at, Mr. Lin?

264
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,760
Let's go.

265
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,840
Aren't you hot?

266
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,960
You even wear a vest

267
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,280
outside your coat.

268
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,840
Haven't you noticed

269
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,400
that Dr. Gu wears a lot, too?

270
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,000
But he's handsome.

271
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,080
Come on in.

272
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,550
Vice President Gao, you asked to see me?

273
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,670
Oh, Gu.

274
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,440
Come over.

275
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,440
Be seated.

276
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,670
The German delegation was

277
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,960
very satisfied

278
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,350
with your work.

279
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,320
So, they want to invite you

280
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,710
to an exchange project in Berlin

281
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,440
for one year.

282
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,230
The hospital

283
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,320
has had a meeting

284
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,400
about it.

285
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,080
If you agree to go,

286
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,520
we'll make further communication

287
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,760
with the German delegation.

288
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,910
You know

289
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,550
such a chance

290
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,150
can be really good.

291
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,760
It is of great help

292
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,320
to your future assessments

293
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,200
and promotions.

294
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,840
It's not easy

295
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,200
to have a big chance of improvement

296
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,790
at such a young age.

297
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,550
What? You don't want it?

298
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,710
Vice President Gao,

299
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,350
it was very sudden news

300
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,520
to me.

301
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,880
I think I need some time

302
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,320
to discuss it with my family.

303
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,710
Got it. Reply to me as soon as possible.

304
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Thank you, Vice President Gao.

305
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,840
Here's the soup. Be careful, it's hot.

306
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,400
Come on. Make way.

307
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,110
It smells so...

308
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,000
Ms. Li,

309
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,320
the soup tastes as good
as a Michelin dish.

310
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,840
I'm serious.

311
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,640
Dishes at the hotel weren't good, right?

312
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,840
You're wrong.

313
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,000
The dishes at the hotel tasted good.

314
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:07,790
But compared

315
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,910
to your dishes,

316
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,440
they were far worse.

317
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,470
You always flatter her.

318
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,760
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

319
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,710
Ignore your father.

320
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,230
Was it fun to travel to the suburbs?

321
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,470
Yes.

322
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,110
Why didn't you post anything

323
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,960
in Moments?

324
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
When you went traveling with Sansan,

325
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,840
you loved to take photos

326
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
and post them in Moments,

327
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,000
didn't you?

328
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,150
It's enough.

329
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,320
Come on.

330
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,550
How short-tempered you are!

331
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,960
No one is gonna take away your soup.

332
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,200
No.

333
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,640
I just haven't tasted your soup

334
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,030
for a long time

335
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,880
and I'm way too excited.

336
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,440
Seriously?

337
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,550
I was just too happy.

338
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,790
We were so busy having fun

339
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,280
that we forgot to take photos.

340
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,350
Tastes great.

341
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
What is this?

342
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,520
A bracelet of prayer beads?

343
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,080
It looks so old-fashioned.

344
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,670
Since when

345
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,790
did you like this kind of bracelet?

346
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,400
I don't.

347
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,880
I just bought it some days ago.

348
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,710
I'll perform at the concert, you know.

349
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,790
I've bought this

350
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,670
so that I can pray to it

351
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,320
for some blessing

352
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,030
at the concert.

353
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,790
It's for good luck.

354
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,640
Excuse me for the bathroom.

355
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,640
Come back quickly.

356
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,710
Or the dishes will be cold.

357
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,840
Why didn't you go before the meal?

358
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,960
Is there some chemistry

359
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,440
between Lin Zhixiao and Dr. Gu?

360
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,470
They were acting weirdly.

361
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,350
If there is,

362
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,550
that's okay with me.

363
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,790
Dr. Gu is young and promising.

364
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,350
He's good.

365
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,440
What makes you think so?

366
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,550
Your daughter is still young.

367
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,000
Besides...

368
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,000
She's an adult.

369
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,440
Why do you still bother?

370
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,440
Come on,

371
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,670
you like to imagine things

372
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,760
and make a wild guess.

373
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,350
Anyway,

374
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,550
do you think Dr. Gu

375
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,350
will like your daughter?

376
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,790
Everything is possible.

377
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,820
(Boyfriend)

378
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,000
Hello? You're done working?

379
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,080
Are you going to knock off?

380
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,910
Have you had dinner?

381
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,470
Not yet.

382
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,110
Zhixiao,

383
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,880
come to my home tonight.

384
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,030
Got it.

385
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,840
Go...

386
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,760
Why didn't you knock

387
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,760
before you came in?

388
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
The door is open.

389
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,880
What?

390
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,760
You look guilty.

391
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,110
I don't.

392
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,960
What did you come for?

393
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,550
What's wrong?

394
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,910
How are you preparing

395
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,110
for the concert?

396
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,520
Well prepared.

397
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,440
You know that?

398
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,790
This is a precious chance.

399
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,440
You must work hard.

400
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,400
Perform carefully and seize the chance.

401
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,400
If you can find a job,

402
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,150
your efforts over a dozen years

403
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,790
won't be wasted.

404
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,550
And I...

405
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,230
I'll be relieved.

406
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,080
Got it.

407
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,550
I was just practicing.

408
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,110
When you broke in,

409
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,960
I was freaked out.

410
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,230
I'll continue.

411
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,880
Where are you now?

412
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,830
I'll go

413
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,350
wait for you at your door.

414
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,070
See you later.

415
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,640
Bye-bye.

416
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,800
Gu...

417
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,560
Lin Zhixiao,

418
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,040
don't play the cello anymore,

419
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,800
okay?

420
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,920
When you play the cello day and night,

421
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,560
you have been disturbing my sleep.

422
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
I've complained about that many times

423
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,830
to the property management company.

424
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,190
You play the cello so poorly.

425
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,230
What are you talking about?

426
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,520
What's wrong with your eyes?

427
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,190
Gu Wei,

428
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,350
you have poor taste.

429
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,280
Do you also

430
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,800
have a hearing defect?

431
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,470
I play the cello

432
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,920
so beautifully.

433
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,230
But you think I'm making a noise?

434
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,310
What poor taste you have!

435
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,470
You know what?

436
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,520
If I didn't respect you

437
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,310
for the sake
that you were Mr. Lin's doctor,

438
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,590
I would have been rude to you.

439
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,350
You know?

440
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,280
You always pull a long face.

441
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,000
Obviously, you have a low IQ.

442
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,430
You must be from a cold family

443
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,350
and you haven't enjoyed much love.

444
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,000
You have little empathy.

445
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,710
Yes, I'm talking about you.

446
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,640
It's my problem

447
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,520
whether I haven't enjoyed much love.

448
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,710
But it's your problem

449
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,760
that you have little empathy.

450
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,830
As your neighbor,

451
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,830
I don't need

452
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,920
to pay the bill for your problem.

453
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,760
You mustn't play the cello anymore.

454
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,830
Why can't I?

455
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,000
Lin Zhixiao.

456
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,160
Why are you so rude to an elder?

457
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,000
Sorry, Dr. Gu.

458
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,520
Lin Zhixiao is still young.

459
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,430
Please don't bother yourself
arguing with her.

460
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,680
I won't, Uncle.

461
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,880
Call me Mr. Lin.

462
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,760
Mr. Lin.

463
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,710
Get back to your room.

464
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,520
Bye-bye, elder.

465
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,520
Sorry, elder.

466
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,280
Don't play the cello anymore.

467
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,950
Dr. Gu,

468
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,880
Lin Zhixiao doesn't play the cello

469
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,310
so poorly, does she?

470
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,470
Go to bed early.

471
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,680
The same to you.

472
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,000
Hello, Zhixiao.

473
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Gu... Gu Wei,

474
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,040
sorry for what I just said.

475
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,950
Don't take it seriously.

476
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,520
I didn't really mean that.

477
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,190
I know you didn't mean that.

478
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,640
But...

479
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,950
Was Mr. Lin harsh on you?

480
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,400
No.

481
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,920
He didn't doubt our relationship at all.

482
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,310
I...

483
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,520
I didn't mean to hide it from him.

484
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,470
You know him.

485
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,190
He's quite fussy.

486
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,430
If he knows our relationship,

487
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,710
he'll keep asking

488
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,950
and he won't let me rest.

489
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,680
I understand.

490
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,110
Unfortunately,

491
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,160
I can't go see you today.

492
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,400
If I go out now,

493
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,950
Mr. Lin will suspect me.

494
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,160
It doesn't matter.

495
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,160
How about this, Zhixiao?

496
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,640
Let's have lunch tomorrow.

497
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,520
Good idea.

498
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,400
Buy me a big lunch.

499
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,280
No problem.

500
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,920
Go to sleep early.

501
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,000
The same to you.

502
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,430
Go to sleep early. Good night.

503
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,830
Good night.

(Exchange project to Germany)
(Study on Gastroenterology)

505
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,110
Are you all right, Yin Xi?

506
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:04,800
I'm all right.

507
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,830
It's okay that he ignores me.

508
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,310
He'll regret it.

509
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,470
I dumped him, anyway.

510
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,920
Come on.

511
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,950
My lady,

512
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,000
what are you writing?

513
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,190
Don't read it.

514
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,110
Or I'll be shy.

515
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,000
Let me have a look.

516
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,230
Fine.

517
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,680
I have to practice playing the cello

518
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,230
and prepare for the concert.

519
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,160
Dr. Gu has to give operations

520
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,190
and work on shifts.

521
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,760
We have little time to see each other.

522
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,190
We're neighbors.

523
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,350
But Mr. Lin is home.

524
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,110
You know.

525
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,230
We can hardly meet.

526
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,710
I must arrange everything

527
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,680
very properly.

528
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,760
We must cherish

529
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,520
every second in love.

530
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,140
(Routes for the Prettiest Girl of CN
and her "keeper")

531
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,000
You've even arranged the transportation

532
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,520
and calculated the traveling time?

533
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,400
Dear me.

534
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,520
What's this?

535
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,280
Sequencing of eligible places

536
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,400
for your dates.

537
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,000
Lin Zhixiao,

538
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,350
if you studied so hard

539
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,520
like this,

540
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,830
you would have been the best student.

541
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,230
So, you know?

542
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,190
When I do something I'm interested in,

543
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,470
I'll certainly make it.

544
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,830
It's time to tease you, at last.

545
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,830
It's my turn to say,

546
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,000
the smell of love is

547
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,950
indeed hurting a single girl

548
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,430
like me.

549
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,350
Let's tell you some gossip.

550
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,110
What gossip?

551
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,000
About Shao Jiang.

552
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,000
His agent An Fei.

553
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,830
Do you know her?

554
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,520
Yes.

555
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,520
I heard she has served

556
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,920
as Shao Jiang's agent

557
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,560
because she likes him.

558
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,830
Seriously?

559
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,760
Does Shao Jiang like her?

560
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,280
I don't know.

561
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,040
But when I saw them,

562
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,680
they were getting along very well.

563
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,190
She stands a chance, I guess.

564
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,230
That would be great.

565
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,520
Hope Shao Jiang

566
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,280
will meet a girl

567
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,560
that he really likes.

568
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,470
Yeah.

569
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,280
After all, he's Prince Charming

570
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,470
to all girls of our high school.

571
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,310
We want him to be happy.

572
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,640
Lin Zhixiao.

573
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,560
Shao Jiang.

574
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,350
Go.

575
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,950
Speak of the devil.

576
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,160
Go ahead.

577
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:37,800
I've just finished

578
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,950
the preparation for the concert.

579
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,760
The time, stage, and songs

580
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,830
have been decided.

581
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,110
What about you?

582
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,800
Did you shirk when I was away?

583
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,830
I didn't.

584
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,590
Every day,

585
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,040
I keep practicing hard.

586
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,040
Okay. I know that.

587
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,350
In a day or two,

588
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,710
there'll be the last rehearsal
before the concert.

589
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,160
Don't forget to come
to the practice room

590
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,190
and rehearse with everyone else.

591
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,520
Don't worry.

592
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,280
I'll be there on time.

593
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,560
The concert will be held this weekend.

594
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,350
Here are two tickets for Mr. Lin

595
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,160
and Aunt Li.

596
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,950
I've reserved the best seats for them.

597
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,470
Thank you, Shao Jiang.

598
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,190
May I have

599
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,470
a little request?

600
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,470
Can I have one more ticket?

601
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,560
I prefer a ticket

602
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,110
far from these two seats.

603
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,160
The farther, the better.

604
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,950
For Dr. Gu, right?

605
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,560
This is a ticket in another zone.

606
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,350
It was meant for a friend of mine.

607
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,110
Take it.

608
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,760
What... what about your friend?

609
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,560
It's okay. I have more tickets.

610
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,190
Thank you, Shao Jiang.

611
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Shao Jiang, last time, I...

612
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,830
Last time...

613
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,920
Zhixiao,

614
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,110
I'm not a man

615
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,470
who can't let it go.

616
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,920
I'm your senior

617
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,470
and your friend for years.

618
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,520
Nothing will change in the future.

619
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,310
We will

620
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,280
always be best friends.

621
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
Shao Jiang, I really hope

622
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,520
that you can find a girl

623
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,640
you love.

624
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,920
I also hope

625
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,350
that you'll be happier.

626
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,950
I'll say no more

627
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,830
comforting words.

628
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,190
I'm glad you can understand.

629
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,710
Rest assured.

630
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,190
I'll take my leave.

631
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:23,920
Bye-bye.

632
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,560
Bye-bye.

633
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,640
Hello? An Fei.

634
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,520
I'd like to recommend a girl to you.

635
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,950
Who?

636
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,760
Even if you recommend her,

637
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,310
I have to check

638
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,800
if she's capable enough.

639
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,950
She's good.

640
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,110
Vice President Gao.

641
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,920
Gu, come on.

642
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,280
It's the sheet

643
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,230
of your exchange project in Germany.

644
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,800
After you make up your mind,

645
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,310
fill in the sheet and give it to me.

646
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,470
Thank you, Vice President Gao.

647
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:27,700
(In-patient)

648
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,400
Zhixiao, I...

649
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,800
Take it.

650
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,760
It's the debut

651
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,190
of the genius cellist Lin Zhixiao.

652
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,880
A new star of classical music

653
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,680
has been rising.

654
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,710
Congratulations, Dr. Gu.

655
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,710
You will witness

656
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,590
such a historical moment.

657
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,640
What's wrong?

658
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,560
Why do you look unhappy?

659
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,800
I don't.

660
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,520
I feel happy for you.

661
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,640
What were you trying to tell me?

662
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,680
I wanted to ask

663
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,310
what you would like to eat today.

664
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,070
Be seated.

665
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,680
Come on.

666
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,830
What would I like to eat?

667
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,350
Read this.

668
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,560
What is this?

669
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,800
You and I are

670
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
quite busy.

671
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,230
Mr. Lin is

672
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,710
very strict with me, too.

673
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,880
So,

674
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,560
I've put down

675
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,880
all things

676
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,470
I want to do

677
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,710
when I'm in a relationship.

678
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,560
On it,

679
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,280
(Gu & Lin's Dating Schedule)
here's everything I want to eat.

680

(Schedule of the Prettiest Girl of CN)

681
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,590
But today, you can make the choice.

682
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,310
You pick one.

683
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,000
What do you think?

What's wrong?

687
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,950
Pretty girl,

688
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,070
what would you like to eat today?

689
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,470
You decide.

690
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,950
Your favorite hot pot, then.

691
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,640
You're indeed my keeper.

692
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,430
I like your decision.

00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,070
this notebook.

696
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,000
I have one, too.

697
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,920
I'll put your notebook...

698
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,590
I'll put it here

699
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,800
where you can see it easily.

700
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,040
Then you can...

Are you

705
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,190
going to Germany?

706
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,000
Yesterday, I was informed

707
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,560
that I would be assigned to Germany.

708
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,070
So, you invited me here today

709
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,680
because you wanted

710
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,950
to tell me about this, right?

711
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,560
How long will you be there?

712
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,350
For one year.

713
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,350
Got it.

714
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,430
One year.

715
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,190
Zhixiao...

716
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,350
How about this?

717
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,520
Let's...

718
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,110
Let's talk about it later.

719
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,880
I'm quite surprised.

720
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,110
Give me a minute.

721
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,520
You take a good rest first.

722
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:02,640
Zhixiao...

723
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,800
Give me a minute.

724
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,800
I'll take my leave.

725
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,680
Here.

726
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,830
I'm full.

727
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,110
Lin Zhixiao must be in a relationship.

728
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,830
Are you sure?

729
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,230
She's secretive, carried away,

730
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,520
and moody.

731
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,520
It's exactly...

732
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,710
The sign of love?

733
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,520
Precisely.

734
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,470
Mr. Lin,

735
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,230
you've retired because of illness.

736
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,070
Things like catching students in love,

737
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,830
confiscating phones,
or punishing students to run

738
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,920
can no longer be your duty.

739
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,920
Stop worrying about that.

740
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,800
Our daughter has her life to live.

741
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,110
Why are you so calm?

742
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,350
You're not sure about that at all.

743
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,520
Do you have any evidence?

744
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,190
Focus on the meal.

What do I do?

753
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,950
I was planning

754

755
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,040
so cheerfully.

00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,520
But unexpectedly,

757
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,280
the news came as a bolt from the blue.

758
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,360
I can't accept it.

759
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,800
Can a long-distance relationship
last long?

760
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,430
I don't think so.

761
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,360
Think about it.

762
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,800
I stayed with Jin Shi every day.

763
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,760
But we broke up, at last.

When you're just in a relationship,

765
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:50,630
you have to live far from each other.

767

Let him tell you about it.

768
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:55,800
Gu Xiao!

769
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,360
Come over.

770
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,360
What, honey?

771
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,870
Your cousin

772
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,390
will be assigned to Germany.

773
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,600
He will?

774
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,950
He's taken seriously in the hospital.

775
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,760
When he's back,
he'll be promoted, I guess.

776
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,760
Did I summon you

777
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,800
to talk about this?

778
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,080
What else should I say?

779
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,000
Tell Zhixiao something

780
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
about Germany.

781
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,230
I once visited Germany.

782
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,910
In Germany,

783
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,430
there are good cars and beer.

784
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,840
And beautiful girls are everywhere.

785
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,600
They're ebullient and bold.

786
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,120
Compared with them,

787
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,230
you are...

788
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,120
…childish.

789
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,190
Gu Xiao, you!

790
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,080
Don't listen to him.

791
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,230
Did you hear him? Childish!

792
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,150
Don't listen to him.

793
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,190
He said I'm a childish girl.

794
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:36,800
You're not childish at all.

795
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,840
Does he have to go?

796
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,080
Why don't you just tell him

797
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,870
not to go?

798
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,760
How can I do that?

799
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,520
It's about his future.

800
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,710
If I stopped him,

801
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,670
what would I be like?

802
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,560
A stupid girlfriend

803
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,800
who doesn't care for him at all.

804

If he has to go,

805
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,080
you go with him!

806
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,390
How can I go with him?

807
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,470
You made sense.

808
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,230
I can go with my boyfriend.

809
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:01,710
Right.

810
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,080

You're leaving already?

814

816
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,630

817

Okay.

823
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,630
Good.

you're checking my phone already?

00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,760
Will you give it to me or not?

Have you not told your girlfriend yet?

Is it hard for her

845
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,710
to accept this?

00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,040
You all did a great job.

868
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,120
Go take a good rest

869
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,600
and get ready for the final performance.

870
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,840
You did a very good job today,

871
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,390
right?

872
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,630
Don't you think so?

873
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,470
I feel much better than before.

874
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,080
Yeah. Much better.

875
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,150
If you remain calm like this,

876
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,950
relax on the day of the concert,

877
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,840
and perform carefully,

878
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,600
there won't be any problem.

879
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,390
Okay.

880
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,520
Is there anything else

881
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,600
you want to adjust?

882
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,600
Okay. I'll practice more.

883
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,670
Right. Stop worrying

884
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,390
about the technique thing.

885
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,630
Let's just enjoy the stage.

886
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,390
Okay. Go back home for a good rest.

887
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,360
Bye-bye, Shao Jiang.

888
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,360
Don't forget to take your bag.

889
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,390
Thank you.

890
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,560
I'm leaving.

891
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,390
Bye-bye.

892
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,360
Be careful on your way back home.

893
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,840
Shao Jiang.

894
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,000
Mr. Lin?

895
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,860
(Huaqing University
First Affiliated Hospital)

896
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,320
Wang, what are you busy with?

897
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,120
Go have dinner.

898
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,800
Okay. I'm on it.

899
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,390
Fine.

900
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,600
Wei, time to knock off.

901
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,520
Shall we have dinner together?

902
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,040
Wei?

903
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,520
Time to knock off.

904
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,520
Let's go have dinner.

905
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,000
Go without me.

906
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,870
I have something else to do.

907
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,040
You want me to get fat alone again?

908
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,760
When you were little,

909
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,000
you were excellent.

910
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,230
When you've grown up,

911
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,760
you haven't let us down.

912
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,190
You have become

913
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,630
a famous violinist.

914
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,760
You have a bright future.

915
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,000
Mr. Lin, you flatter me.

916
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,360
What did you come for today?

917
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,120
I'm... I'm just looking around.

918
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,390
Looking around.

919
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,390
You are?

920
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,470
Shall I show you around, then?

921
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,120
No, no.

922
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,470
Don't bother.

923
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,000
Shao Jiang,

924
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,320
when you're busy,

925
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,040
can you take care of your family?

926
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,390
Not really, if I'm far too busy.

927
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,760
I may have to travel around the world.

928
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,670
Then you're not responsible
for your wi...

929
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,000
For your family.

930
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,870
I don't have a choice.

931
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,520
It's our work.

932
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,630
That's why people like us
get married to peers.

933
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,040
Just like my parents.

934
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,600
They're able to understand each other.

935
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,390
Yes, yes.

936
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,870
It's important to understand each other.

937
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,870
Right. Right.

938
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,470
What plan do you have

939
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,560
for your future?

940
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,760
I mean, for your career

941
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,710
and life. What plan do you have?

942
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,080
Life? Career?

943
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,190
Actually,

944
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,120
for my own life,

945
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,710
I haven't had a plan yet.

946
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,190
I'll just let nature take its course.

947
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,190
That's not right!

948
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,870
Young men,

949
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,520
especially young talents

950
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,470
like you,

951
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,560
should neglect

952
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,470
neither your life nor career.

953
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,870
You must have plans

954
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:09,710
for your life.

955
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,120
For example,

956
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,080
when do you plan to get married?

957
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,840
Get married?

958
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,470
Yeah.

959
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,470
Mr. Lin, I don't...

960
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,000
I don't really understand.

961
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,080
Are you being numb

962
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,230
or are you playing the fool?

963
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,190
Let me get to the point.

964
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,600
Fine. Fine.

965
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,560
My daughter Lin Zhixiao

966
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,870
hasn't been spoiled too much.

967
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:35,390
However,

968
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,760
she's still the apple of my eye.

969
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,390
Yes, yes.

970
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,630
Even if you are

971
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,630
my favorite student,

972
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:41,630
I have to

973
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,630
care about your relationship

974
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,800
as your elder.

975
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,870
At least,

976
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,630
you should have told my wife and me

977
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,040
about your relationship,

978
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,390
right?

979
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,420
Today, Zhixiao and I are

980
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,470
=The Oath of Love=

981
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,420
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
visiting a glass skywalk.

982
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,820
She highly recommended it.

983
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,220
Zhixiao.

984
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,020
Aren't you supposed to be scared?

985
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,300
I pretended.

986
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,140
In a relationship,

987
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,260
there are always tricks.
