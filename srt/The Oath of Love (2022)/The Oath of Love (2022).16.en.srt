Dr. Gu. You...

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,910
You were all smiles

20
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,960
when you read the English material.

21
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,880
You are not an average person indeed.

22
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,030
You do have a lot of passion

23
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,110
for your job.

24
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,110
What's the matter?

25
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,520
The academic conference.

26
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,190
There's a team meeting
at the hospital tomorrow.

27
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,190
So the venue has been changed.

28
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,670
To where?

29
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,110
The lecture hall of our old school.

30
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,670
Our school?

31
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,960
That's better.

00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,830
Dr. Gu.

33
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,160
You are even happy
about the academic conference.

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,360
You're way more dedicated than I'm.

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,910
When am I gonna

36
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,320
be like you?

37
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,470
The surgery is about to start.

38
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,440
Is everything ready?

39
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,470
I'll go get ready now.

40
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,000
See you tomorrow.

- Okay.

49

join us for dinner later?

I'm not going.

I have an appointment tonight.

53
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,040
Professor Lyu wants to talk to you.

54
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,040
I want to discuss with you

what you

56
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,110
mentioned earlier.

57
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,230
Okay. I won't keep you then.

58
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,350
All right. Bye.

59
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,670

This is my school.

Aren't you in the music department?

65
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,920
Why are you here
in front of the medical school?

66
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,270
Who are you waiting for?

67
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,670
I'm waiting for Dr. Gu.

68
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,600
We're going

69
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,510
to have dinner later.

70
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,670
Aren't we going

71

to have dinner together later?

72
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,950
Didn't you ask Gu Wei to come?

73
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,600
I did. He said he had an appointment.

74
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,920
Ask him again. Hurry.

75
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,320
Okay.

76
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,040
Hurry! Run!

77
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, this Gu Wei.

78
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,550
There are so many experts today,

79
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,950
and the director is also going.

80
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,720
It's inappropriate for him not to go.

81
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,270
Yeah, it's definitely inappropriate.

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,720
Miss Lin, since you're also here,

83
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,110
come with us.

Sorry. Sorry.

86
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,440
I didn't know

87
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,670
you're having dinner today.

88
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,270
I'll ask Dr. Gu about it

89
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,510
when he comes.

90
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,270
No, no need to ask him.

91
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,640
He'll go straight to the restaurant.

92
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,200
Let's go together. Come on.

93
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,790
Oh, no. I'm not going.

94
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,200
I'll send him a WeChat message

95
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
and tell him.

96
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,670

99
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,440
coming today.

100

Many of them flew all the way

101
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,440
from Beijing and Shanghai.

102

Just think about it.

Yeah, let's go together.

108
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,920
Come with us.

110
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,600
Do you want to see me?

111

112
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,440
We'll have dinner together later.

114

Let's go.

are you going to follow them...?

Yeah.

118

Yeah, hurry up!

120

We've been waiting for you for a while.

121
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,920
Come on, Zhixiao.

122
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,600
Let's go.

123
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,110

Why are you sitting so far away from us?

141
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,640
Come on, sit over here.

142
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,390
Come here.

143
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,440
It's okay. I'm fine here.

It's okay. Go ahead.

149
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,200
I can sit here myself.

150

Really?

00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,640
Dr. Gu.

160
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,720
Am I right?

161
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,200
Right.

162
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,440
Gu is a talent indeed.

163
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,550
- He is excellent.
- Okay, thank you.

164
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,550
Good.

Keep working hard.

After you came up

167
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,920
with that idea,

168
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
I searched

169
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,600
a lot of literature,

170
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,670
and I think

171
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,110
it's quite feasible,

172
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,270
and it's promising.

173
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:26,950
Yes.

174
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:27,920
Come on.

175
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,600
He thinks highly of you.

176
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,070
Yes.

177
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,390
You should promote it appropriately.

178
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,600
Our hospital

179
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,720
also takes it seriously,

180
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,270
and we think

181
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,880
it's constructive and forward-looking.

182
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:36,880
Feel free to say it,

183
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,270
we can work on it together.

184
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,640
Yeah, I know.

185
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,920
Professor Lyu.

186
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,760
It tastes good.

187
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,550
Try this.

188
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,480
Okay.

189
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,920
Sorry, I need to answer this.

190
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,920
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

191
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,600
Hello.

192
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,480
Come on.

193
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,670
Let's have a drink together.

194
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,670
Come on.

195
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,350
Thank you. Thank you.

196
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,600
Come on.

197
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Have a drink, guys.

198
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,550
I almost forgot it.

199
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,600
Let me introduce her to you.

200
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
This is Lin Zhixiao.

201
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,070
Miss Lin's

202
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,920
father

203
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,270
has gastric cancer.

204
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,230
Gastric cancer.

205
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,230
The surgery

206
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,000
was done by Dr. Gu,

207
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,070
and the chemo was given by Dr. Gao.

208
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,160
Right now, the cancer

209
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,270
is under control.

210
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,160
Miss Lin.

211
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,000
I think we've met, right?

212
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,950
Sorry about that time.

213
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,600
Your father

214
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,390
is treated by the best team

215
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,600
of our hospital this time.

216
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,350
A good doctor

217
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,110
should not only be experienced,

218
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,760
but also energetic, vigorous,

219
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,590
and passionate about medicine.

220
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,840
They're at their best

221
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
at their age.

222
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,000
Right, right.

223
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,640
I'm really grateful to Dr. Gao,

224
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,760
Dr. Gu,

225
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,550
and also

226
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,640
Dr. Gu, and Dr. Yan

227
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,200
for their help for me and my father.

228
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,280
Thank you very much.

229
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,320
That's what we should do.

230
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,790
What's more,

231
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,470
the two of them

232
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,000
make a perfect team at our hospital.

233
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,520
They are like the golden couple.

234
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,440
Am I right, Gao?

235
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,520
You're right, Director.

236
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,960
That's right.

237
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll make a toast to you, Dr. Gao.

238
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,400
Well,

239
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
I do appreciate it,

240
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,760
but I'm not going to drink.

241
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,520
Sit down.

242
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:16,910
Sit down.

243
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,440
Dr. Gao.

244
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,960
You won't drink
when she offers you a toast.

245
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,670
Do you think

246
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,320
you will never make a toast to her?

247
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,840
No, I mean,

248
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,200
on your wedding with Dr. Gu,

249
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,150
are you not going

250
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,350
to toast every one of us?

251
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,840
Director, am I right?

252
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,710
Yan is right.

253
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,200
Gao, don't be shy.

254
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,320
We're

255
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,840
still waiting,

256
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,470
waiting to drink at your wedding feast.

257
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,840
By the way,

258
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,960
your father never rushed you

259
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,350
during all these years?

260
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,030
He does rush me.

261
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,320
All right, I'll talk to Gu

262
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,470
after he comes back!

263
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,030
Why hasn't he married

264
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,550
such a beautiful girl like you?
That's ridiculous.

265
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,440
He is not young anymore.

266
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,150
Dr. Gao.

267
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,030
I'll drink a toast to you and Dr. Gu.

268
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,350
I wish you both happiness.

269
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,520
I got some stuff to do. I should go.

270
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,550
Take your time.

271
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,960
Thank you.

272
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,280
Miss Lin.

273
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:23,880
Let's eat.

274
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,470
Come on.

275
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,030
Let's have another drink.

276
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,840
Come on.

277
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,840
(Is it possible)

278
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,230
(that he already has a girlfriend,)

279
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,470
(and he is just playing with you?)

280
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,710
(On your wedding with Dr. Gu,)

281
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,880
(are you not going)

282
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,030
(to toast every one of us?)

283
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,350
(We're waiting)

284
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,840
(to drink at your wedding feast.)

285
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,440
There were ten people having a fight,

286
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,590
and eight people
trying to stop the fight.

287
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,470
Six people got scared

288
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,880
and locked the door.

289
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,200
Well, try to solve it.

290
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,880
Case solved.

291
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,030
Where is Lin Zhixiao?

292
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,880
I sent you a WeChat message.

293
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,710
Check your phone.

294
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,710
She just left. She got something to do.

295
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,670
Gu, you're back.

296
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,520
Come over.

297
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,350
I want to talk to you.

298
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,280
Gu Wei!

299
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,030
Gu Wei!

300
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,550
Director is talking to you.

301
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,880
Yan Bingjun.

302
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,520
Lin Zhixiao is not

303
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,280
any patient's family member.

304
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,960
She is the girl I like.

305
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,030
Please do me a favor

306
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,320
and treat the girl I like,

307
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,710
no,

308
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,030
treat my girlfriend with politeness.

309
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,230
Director, and you guys,

310
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,520
please don't

311
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,000
make jokes on me and Dr. Gao anymore.

312
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,030
Well...

313
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,710
I got drunk. It's my fault.

314
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,350
I'm sorry.

315
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,400
I got things to do. I'm leaving.

316
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,880
Why are you looking at me?

317
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,790
Director.

318
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,150
I'm really sorry.

319
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,550
I'm not feeling well.

320
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,200
Sorry, guys.

321
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,030
Take your time.

322
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,030
Zhixiao.

323
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,470
Zhixiao, I want to talk to you.

324
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,910
Can we talk another time?

325
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:25,840
Zhixiao!

326
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,790
Zhixiao, listen to me!

327
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,760
No!

328
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,880
I must say it today.

329
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,960
But I don't want to talk to you today.

330
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,440
I want to go home,

331
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,790
Okay, Dr. Gu?

332
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,960
I have to go back to practice the cello.

333
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,150
Just hear me out.

334
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,230
Actually,

335
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,550
I wanted to tell you

336
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,550
when you came to the hospital

337
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,400
with your cello

338
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,470
and played for me.

339
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,030
But...

340
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,030
Will you stop talking?

341
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,790
I don't want to hear from you anymore!

342
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,080
I know I flattered myself!

343
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,110
I know it's my problem!

344
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,000
I thought you'd treat me differently

345
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,550
than you treated everyone else!

346
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,280
But you and Dr. Gao

347
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
are going to get married,

348
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,110
why are you making a fool of me?

349
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,590
I know you and Dr. Gao

350
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,590
make a better couple.

351
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,230
But why didn't you

352
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,440
tell me that?

353
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,320
Why didn't you let me know
we'd never work it out

354
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,710
so I would quit?

355
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,590
Why are you making a fool of me?

356
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,110
Why do you keep

357
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,710
telling me things

358
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,440
that aren't true?

359
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,400
That's what you think?

360
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,470
Otherwise?

361
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,110
Don't move.

362
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,280
Do you hear it?

363
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,880
My heart is beating fast,

364
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,400
approaching 110 beats a minute.

365
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,710
I have regular check-ups,

366
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,520
so we can rule out

367
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,350
the possibility

368
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,470
that I have any heart diseases.

369
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,000
So?

370
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,150
It's because of you.

371
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,400
I don't understand what you're saying.

372
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,320
This...

373
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,150
I was going

374
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,200
to put this on you myself

375
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,520
after you say yes.

376
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,350
But...

377
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,110
My grandmother gave this to me.

378
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
This is the first gift

379
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,470
she got from my grandfather.

380
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,710
Is this

381
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,910
a token of love?

382
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,590
It's a token of their love,

383
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,150
and it will be

384
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,320
a token of our love.

385
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,710
She told me to give it
to the girl I like.

386
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,110
I want

387

Morning.

546
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,190
You got up so early.

547
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,680

All right.

556
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,430
Go to wash up,

557
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,110

589
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,430
You had been texting someone
at the library

before he became your boyfriend.

594
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,230
Now you're hiding it from me
when you're in a relationship!

595
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,350
Did you ask her for advice?

00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:06,830
So, it means

597
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,070
I'm the last one to know!

598
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,520

your boyfriend.

608
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,350
We're old acquaintances.

Is it necessary?

610
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,160
He is not an old acquaintance.

611
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,280
Does Yin Xi know him?

612
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,160
Yeah, what's his name?

613
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,070
What does he do? Where does he live?

614
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,560
Tell us now.

615
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,640
His name is Gu Wei.

616
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,640
He is a doctor,

617
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,680
and he lives in...

618
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,430
He lives in her house.

619
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,070
Are you two living together?

620
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,560
My God, Lin Zhixiao!

621
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,680
Next door.

622
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,590
He lives next door to us.

623
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,190
Can you

624
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,280
speak clearly next time?

625
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,310
You almost gave me

626
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,430
a heart attack.

627
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,430
Next door?

628
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,680
How did you meet?

629
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,830
- He is...
- I know that.

630
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,760
They met in a bar on a dark night.

631
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,880
Lin Zhixiao.

632
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,350
What's going on with you?

633
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,680
Don't listen to her.

634
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,800
Can you believe her?

635
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,920
He is my dad's attending doctor,

636
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,110
simple as that.

637
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,680
Where are you now?

638
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,110
Maybe they did it
since they live close to each other.

639
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,070
They just got together.

640
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,310
It wouldn't be that fast.

641
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,920
But I think they should have kissed.

642
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,520
Of course, we kissed.

643
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,350
Keep bragging.

644
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,280
Do you think I can't tell

645
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,430
when you're lying?

646
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,680
Looks like Dr. Gu

647
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,070
is not active enough.

648
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,310
Why didn't he do something

649
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,880
after he confessed his love?

650
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,160
What do you know?

651
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,040
You don't understand.

652
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:41,830
Boring.

653
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,580
(Wanna see a movie tonight?)

654
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,280
Dr. Gu

655
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,880
asked me to go to see a movie tonight.

656
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:48,880
Things will move on as they should

657
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,040
when we are watching

658
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,000
the movie tonight.

659
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,040
Then you have to

660
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
tell us everything.

661
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,310
I want to hear

662
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,560
every detail.

663
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,640
Me too.

664
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,000
That will depend on my mood.

665
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,620
(What movie are we
going to see tonight?)

666
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:04,880
See a movie.

667
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,920
A date.

668
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,310
Perverts.

669
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,940
(You can decide.)

670
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,590
Done, my sisters.

671
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,640
Vice President Gao.

672
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,560
I heard from Xi

673
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,920
that she will take a few days off
and go abroad?

674
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,160
She was really upset

675
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,640
when she came back last night.

676
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,280
She said that all of a sudden.

677
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,430
I'm here to ask you about it.

678
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,230
Do you know the reason?

679
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,280
She has been stubborn since childhood.

680
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,070
She wouldn't tell me when I asked her.

681
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,350
Gu, she always

682
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,710
listens to you.

683
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,070
Can you ask her about it

684
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,950
and talk to her?

685
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,230
I'm sorry, Vice President Gao.

686
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,070
This is Gao Xi's personal affairs.

687
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,000
I don't think it's appropriate

688
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,830
for me to ask her.

689
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,880
I see.

690
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,680
Vice President Gao, Dr. Gu.

691
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,230
There is an emergency patient

692
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,280
who needs immediate surgery.

693
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:26,830
Go ahead.

694
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,230
Let's go.

695
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,040
Hall No. 4 is inside.

696
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,230
Welcome.

697
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,160
Welcome.

698
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:38,590
Thank you.

699
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,400
Inside, please.

700
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,160
Welcome.

701
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,950
Welcome.

702
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,880
We can decide after we're done shopping.

703
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,350
Let's watch the movie first.

704
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,680
Gauze.

705
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,070
The intraoperative bleeding

706
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,110
is more serious than expected.

707
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,000
Tell the blood bank

708
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,710
to get the blood.

709
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,520
I'll do it right now.

710
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,400
Hurry.

711
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,110
Move inside.

712
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:10,760
Hemostatic forceps.

713
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,360
My boyfriend

714
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,560
is busy at work,

715
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,040
but he's not gonna stand me up.

716
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,280
He'll be here in a minute.

717
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,710
Zhixiao.

718
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,320
Sorry, I'm late.

719
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,760
What took you so long?

720
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,190
The movie is over.

721
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,520
There was an emergency surgery.

722
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
I didn't know it would take me so long.

723
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,390
It's okay.

724
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:24,760
Well,

725
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,000
I'll buy tickets for the next movie.

726
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,870
No need.

727
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,320
This is the last one.

728
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,520
Besides, Lin will get mad

729
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,630
if I don't go back at this hour.

730
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,840
I'm sorry.

731
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,360
Now I finally get it.

732
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,230
Get what?

733
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,520
Dating a doctor

734
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,840
is like looking for

735
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,080
a missing person anytime.

736
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,120
Let's go home. Come on.

737
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,360
Hold on.

738
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,600
This is my boyfriend!

739
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,520
He's just busy at work.

740
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,670
He didn't stand me up.

741
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,870
Isn't he handsome?

742
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,840
Bye-bye.

743
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:14,950
Bye-bye.

744
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,670
Do you think I'm handsome?

745
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,670
How do you know that?

746
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,710
You are the most handsome man
in the universe.

747
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,560
What? Is there anything wrong?

748
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,360
No, I approve it.

749
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,560
You can look at me as long as you want.

750
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,470
Okay.

751
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:41,870
What about me?

752
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,000
What about you?

753
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:46,910
Do you think

754
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,800
I'm pretty?

755
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,950
Well...

756
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,280
I need to think about it.

757
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,190
It takes you so long to think about it.

758
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,520
That hurts my pride.

759
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,190
I told you

760
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,560
you're cute no matter what.

761
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,390
Cute?

762
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,520
Am I not that kind of

763
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,560
beautiful, elegant,

764
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,430
and classy girl?

765
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,470
You know what, don't say it.

766
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,080
I see.

767
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,870
I don't even believe

768
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,470
I'm that kind of girl.

769
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,670
Cute.

770
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,390
I'm not that cute.

771
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,390
Are you all right?

772
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,760
I'm fine. I'm fine.

773
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
Are you okay?

774
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,470
I'm okay.

775
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,390
You are just like a kid.

776
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,560
I'm not a kid.

777
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,190
I'm a mature woman.

778
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,320
Do you know

779
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,230
what "cute" means?

780
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,800
Don't use the word
if you don't understand it.

781
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,800
You're the one who is cute.

782
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,840
You're cute.

783
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,870
Cute, cute, cute!

784
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,910
You're a cute man!

785
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,320
Okay, okay, I'm cute.

786
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,390
You're a kid.

787
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,540
(I was wrong,
you're always pretty in my heart!)

788
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,780
(I was wrong,
you're always pretty in my heart!)

789
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,860
(You are beautiful
and cute in my heart!!!)

790
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,920
(Lin Zhixiao: That's rare.)

791
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,530
( Old Fireworks Town, a good date place
of ancient charm. Experience it!)

792
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,260
(Single people don't deserve to travel.)

793
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,260
(Wanna go out on weekends?)

794
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,840
Zhixiao, tell us the truth.

795
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,870
Didn't you two

796
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,080
make any progress in the cinema?

797
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,320
The cinema was in complete darkness.

798
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,470
Didn't anything

799
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,800
romantic happen?

800
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,670
Forget about the romance,

801
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,870
I didn't even see the movie.

802
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,080
I mean it, Dr. Gu

803
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,430
had an emergency surgery

804
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,760
and left me at the door

805
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,430
staring at the ticket inspector

806
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,280
for three whole hours.

807
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,600
I even admire myself

808
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,670
that I made it to the end.

809
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,760
This was too bad.

810
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,230
I feel sorry for you.

811
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,040
But,

812
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,670
Dr. Gu told me

813
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,520
that he will take me out on a date

814
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,600
during his weekends off.

815
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,360
Did he mention the place?

816
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,230
No.

817
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,630
He said

818
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,870
it's a mysterious place.

819
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
It's a date.

820
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,080
It's whether an amusement park, a zoo,

821
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,710
or a water park.

822
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,080
I don't think so.

823
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:06,910
Dr. Gu

824
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,470
is a man in his 30s.

825
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,950
Maybe he will take you

826
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,230
to a library, a museum,

827
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,280
or a wine-tasting party.

828
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,670
No way.

829
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,470
What do I do

830
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,390
if he takes me to these places?

831
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,870
I don't know anything about any of this.

832
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,630
I have an idea.

833
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,040
What?

834
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,520
Take me and Yin Xi with you.

835
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,950
We can check him out for you

836
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,630
and give you two a push.

837
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,120
I promise

838
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,760
you won't stare at someone

839
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,950
for three whole hours this time.

840
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,230
That's not appropriate.

841
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,150
Dr. Gu

842
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,600
asked me out for a date.

843
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,840
If I bring you two with me,

844
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,630
what is that?

845
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,000
Then let's have

846
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,150
a triple date.

847
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,320
Yin Xi can bring Jin Shi.

848
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,190
I'll bring a man, too.

849
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,800
Who are you going to bring?

850
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,950
What man?

851
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,710
Can I go with you?

852
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,630
All right, I'll make do with you.

853
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,150
We just

854
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,560
made the decision on our own.

855
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,280
We should at least

856
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,760
tell Dr. Gu about it.

857
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,630
I don't know

858
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,840
how to tell him.

859
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,870
I'll tell him.

860
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,560
Gu Xiao, call your brother.

861
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,040
Are you not going to tell me

862
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,390
what's going on now?

863
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,230
Give me your phone!

864
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,560
Look.

865
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,950
Hello, Dr. Gu.

866
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:30,870
I'm Sansan.

867
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,320
I know you and Zhixiao

868
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,470
are going out on a date this weekend.

869
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,120
Gu Xiao and I also want
to come with you,

870
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,150
and also our good friends

871
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,390
Jin Shi and Yin Xi.

872
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,320
Is that okay with you?

873
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,670
Good.

874
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,600
Then we have a deal.

875
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,800
We'll meet you downstairs
at Zhixiao's house.

876
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,430
Bye-bye.

877
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:46,430
Done.

878
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,520
Great.

879
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,080
I forgot

880
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,150
that I have something serious
to tell you.

881
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,710
Go ahead.

882
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:04,600
I'm having a date

883
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,910
with him this weekend.

884
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,120
I want you two

885
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,870
to take me to the mall this afternoon

886
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,040
and pick a nice dress for me.

887
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:09,840
I can't.

888
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,080
I can't leave

889
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,080
him alone at the cafe.

890
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,120
I'm too worried.

891
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,950
What about you, Yin Xi?

892
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,080
I have an appointment with Jin Shi.

893
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,390
I'm going to see him later.

894
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,630
What's going on with you two?

895
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,710
What about me?

896
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,320
I want to show up

897
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,840
in front of him with a new look.

898
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,360
Our Zhixiao

899
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,430
is good-looking.

900
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,630
Everything will look good on you.

901
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,670
Just pick something by yourself.

902
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,040
Good girl.

903
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,320
You can do it, come on.

904
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,390
I know.

905
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,900
How did you feel
when you hugged me the first time?

I couldn't stop

909
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:43,980
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
thinking

910
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,860
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
how much you weigh.

911
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,540
What do you mean?

912
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,620
Do you think I'm heavy?

913
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,300
Of course not.

914
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,300
Let me ask your mom.

915
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,540
Let me ask you.

916
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,260
Do you think...

917
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:54,860
Just ask me the question if you want.

918
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,580
Why would you ask my mom?

919
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,540
It was...

920
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,660
It was a slip of the tongue.

921
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,220
Let me ask you,

922
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,420
how much weight

923
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,060
do you think a boy

924
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,060
would consider heavy for a girl?

925
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,140
About 50 kilos.

926
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:09,980
Say it again.

927
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,260
Think about it carefully.

928
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:11,540
Hold on.

929
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,380
Is it too much or too little?

930
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,180
Too little, of course.

931
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,260
Are 50 kilos

932
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,300
heavy for you?

933
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:16,740
Hold on.

934
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,580
So, you're saying

935
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,020
you're over 50 kilos?

936
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:20,780
No way.

937
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,700
You're always

938
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,940
under 50 kilos in my heart.

939
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,180
Wait a minute.

940
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,700
You're saying

941
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,220
you don't know how much I weigh.

942
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,140
You don't love me at all.

943
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,020
Of course, I know how much you weigh.

944
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:33,460
How much do I weigh?

945
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,420
You are always

946
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,340
44 kilos

947
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,180
in my heart.
