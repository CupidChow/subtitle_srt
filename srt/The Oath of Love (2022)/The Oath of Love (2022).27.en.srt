This handsome man

19
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,720
is yours.

20
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,310
Narcissist.

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,830
Who is a narcissist?

22
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,720
You.

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,160
I'm not.

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,230
Yes, you are.

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,830
Let's cook together.

26
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,000
I cook vegetarian meals
and you make meat dishes.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,360
I cut vegetables, and you cut meat.

28
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,400
Is there a labor division like this?

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,480
Of course.

30
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,760
You're professional.

31
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,480
You cut better than I do.

32
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,120
Lin Zhixiao.

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,270
Are you implying

34
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,000
that I'm a butcher?

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,160
Yes, you are.

36
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,000
Butcher.

37
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,390
Who is a butcher?

38
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:13,960
You.

39
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,190
Who?

40
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,750
Butch…

41
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,960
It's still before twelve.

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,960
Make a wish.

43
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:31,960
I've just made one

44
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,320
at home.

45
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,550
That doesn't count.

46
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,360
You made it

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,390
with Mr. Lin.

48
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,750
Now make one with me.

49
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,750
Okay.

50
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,030
I'll do it now.

51
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,750
I'm done.

52
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,910
What is it?

53
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,160
I wish all my family

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,550
are healthy.

55
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,550
And?

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,720
Nothing else.

57
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,470
Cut the cake.

58
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,440
I made another wish.

59
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,240
I wish the two of us

60
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,550
will be together forever.

61
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,600
What?

62
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,000
Your lips are dry.

63
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,640
It's fine.

64
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,350
Wait.

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
It's alright. I can just peel it off.

66
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,320
Use this.

67
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,200
I'm a man.

68
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,320
What's wrong with that?

69
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,600
Men can use this too.

70
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,510
I'll just drink water.

71
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,230
Let me ask you.

72
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,230
Except for sleeping,

73
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,880
how many hours are you

74
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,070
with your water glass every day?

75
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,230
Two.

76
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,510
Two hours, okay.

77
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,040
If you drink eight glasses
of water a day,

78
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,440
which means four glasses

79
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,480
in an hour,

80
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,830
that is one glass for 15 minutes.

81
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,600
Can you do it?

82
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,000
Since when did you become so smart?

83
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm a math genius,

84
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,200
okay?

85
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,230
I'm not using lipstick.

86
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,320
This is not lipstick.

87
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,070
This is a lip balm.

88
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,920
It's colorless.

89
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,550
Look.

90
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,720
Colorless.

91
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,440
Do you want me to use it so much?

92
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,160
I just want to

93
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,440
be with you forever.

94
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,790
Time flies

95
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,000
when I'm with you.

96
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,350
I want to

97
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,350
be with you forever, too.

98
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,880
But it's quite late,

99
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,040
I have to go back.

100
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,110
Otherwise, Mr. Lin…

101
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,640
You know it.

102
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,350
Zhixiao,

103
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,720
stay here tonight.

104
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,070
How can I do that?

105
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,320
If Mr. Lin finds out,

106
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,880
he will kill me,

107
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,070
and then kill you.

108
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,200
You see,

109
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,790
I'm with

110
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,110
my girlfriend,

111
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,760
but it's like cheating.

112
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
I can't even celebrate

113
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,040
your birthday with you.

114
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,320
We don't have a choice.

115
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,640
Mr. Lin has been the dean

116
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,510
of students for 20 years.

117
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,880
I've been disciplined

118
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,000
by school rules for all these years.

119
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,440
If I stay overnight at your house,

120
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,640
he won't allow it.

121
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,040
Unless…

122
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,390
Unless we are married,

123
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,350
there would be no issue then.

124
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't get me wrong.

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,760
I didn't mean that.

126
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,880
I'm just telling you…

127
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,480
About Mr. Lin's character.

128
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,670
I'm… I'm not saying

129
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,760
we should get married or what.

130
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,880
Don't feel pressured,

131
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,640
or burdened.

132
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,760
What if I am serious?

133
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,350
Lin Zhixiao,

134
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,670
will you marry me?

135
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,880
Do you remember

136
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,830
when we first met?

137
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
You were with Mr. Lin in the hospital.

138
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,270
I was making rounds one night

139
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,230
and saw you tucking the quilt for him.

140
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,000
Your eyes

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,320
were strained.

142
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,720
You didn't look

143
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,760
awake at all.

144
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,830
But you were like

145
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,160
being given an order,

146
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
looking after

147
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,350
your family instinctively.

148
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,160
I felt envious of your family

149
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,880
at that time.

150
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,270
I was sure

151
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,040
you are a good girl.

152
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,350
You squabbled

153
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,880
with Mr. Lin every day,

154
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,000
and was

155
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,590
very impolite to me too.

156
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,150
But I thought

157
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,640
you are like the sun

158
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,000
shining in the

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,880
cold ward.

160
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,110
It was hard for me
not to pay attention to you.

161
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,790
I remember during that time,

162
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,350
Dr. Du said that I giggled

163
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,350
every time I saw you.

164
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,080
I must look silly

165
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,880
when I giggled.

166
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,670
But I still want to see you

167
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,520
every day

168
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,000
even if I look like a fool.

169
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,590
Later,

170
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,030
you broke your head because of me.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,320
I was anxious at that time.

172
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,030
I was thinking,

173
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,640
what should I do?

174
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,000
I guess I could only
make it up to you by marrying you.

175
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,670
Later I found that

176
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,880
you are so much younger than me,

177
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,280
and so clumsy.

178
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,110
I really could

179
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,710
do nothing

180
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,840
about you.

181
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,200
And it's weird that

182
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,280
you're nothing like

183
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,710
the girlfriend I imagined.

184
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,550
But as soon as I can think of

185
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,350
being with you,

186
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,280
I'm full of expectations.

187
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,280
There are a lot of

188
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,150
families and couples

189
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,550
falling apart because of

190
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,670
disease in the hospital.

191
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,350
Zhixiao,

192
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,880
do you know why

193
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,320
is your father so enviable?

194
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,790
Because he knows

195
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,110
your mom

196
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,670
would never abandon him.

197
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,280
The satisfaction of

198
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,960
being accompanied and looked after

199
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,910
by someone and

200
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,080
taking it for granted,

201
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,350
it made me

202
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,000
very jealous.

203
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,080
They always say,

204
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,320
young people often

205
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,230
talk about

206
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,080
passionate love,

207
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,080
but it's nothing comparable with

208
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,350
gray-haired parents walking

209
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,280
side by side in the park.

210
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,080
That is exactly

211
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,350
Mr. Lin and Auntie Li.

212
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:50,880
As for work,

213
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,520
kids,

214
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,230
health,

215
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,520
and everything,

216
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,150
I can't promise you

217
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,280
a good and easy life

218
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,670
all the time.

219
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,640
But I can assure you that,

220
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,000
no matter it's good or bad,

221
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,520
easy or difficult,

222
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll always be there with you.

223
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,590
I want you to be confident like Mr. Lin,

224
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,350
taking everything for granted.

225
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,350
Lin Zhixiao,

226
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,110
will you marry me?

227
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,150
Are you asking me

228
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,350
to marry you with this pull ring?

229
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,790
It's an emergency.

230
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
I haven't bought the ring yet.

231
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll make it up to you later.

232
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,840
Marry me, will you?

233
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,350
Yes, I will.

Hi.

242
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,200
(Are you asleep?)

243
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,320
(Not yet.)

244
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,640
Too excited?

245
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,840
So unreal.

246
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,030
My dear wife.

247
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,000
Mrs. Gu.

248
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,880
You know, people fall in love

249
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
with some people in their life,

250
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,400
but marry

251
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,640
the others.

252
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,320
But I'm married to the one I love.

253
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,110
It's a bad bargain for me.

254
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,230
Clearly, you're

255
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,350
thinking it wrong.

256
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:52,960
Am I?

257
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,640
Good night.

258
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,200
My dear wife.

259
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,030
Good night.

260
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,200
My dear husband.

261
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:31,910
Morning.

262
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,640
Morning, Dr. Gu.

263
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,910
Gu Wei,

264
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,350
what's so happy about?

265
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,550
Good.

266
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,440
Do you know where to

267
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,200
custom diamond rings?

268
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,840
Custom…

269
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,640
Diamond ring?

270
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,280
Yes, I proposed.

271
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,350
Really?

272
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,440
Gu Wei, I know a store.

273
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:49,910
Really, where is it?

274
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,470
Yeah.

275
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,000
Why did you propose so soon?

276
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,910
I mean, it's a bit sudden.

277
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,030
Actually, the first day

278
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,000
I dated her,

279
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,790
I wanted to get married to her.

280
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,790
I have just brought it

281
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,760
forward.

282
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
For so many years,

283
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,230
I have always felt that

284
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,230
as long as I'm by your side,

285
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,150
accompany you,

286
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,150
and wait for you,

287
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,880
you will finally

288
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,080
accept me one day.

289
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,200
Though I have accepted the fact

290
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,110
that you're together,

291
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,840
sometimes I still

292
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,880
can't help but wonder,

293
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,110
what am I doing wrong?

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,080
I feel like

295
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,760
a loser.

296
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,110
Gao Xi,

297
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,000
don't think that way.

298
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,320
You're really great

299
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,320
and there are many people like you.

300
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,640
How shall I put it?

301
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,710
It's like some people
prefer traditional Chinese medicine

302
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,230
but some prefer western medicine.

303
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,840
Does there

304
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,230
have to be

305
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,280
a winner?

306
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,790
I really hope

307
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,400
you can find

308
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,710
your own love.

309
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,150
Is there really nothing

310
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,000
we can talk about except for medicine?

311
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,790
I'm not good at talking.

312
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,520
But I hope that

313
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,550
there will be someone

314
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,790
by your side

315
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,110
who can take care of you.

316
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,710
One day

317
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,350
you will have

318
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,640
your own family.

319
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,670
When that day comes, you can't just

320
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,110
work as hard as you do now.

321
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,200
Spend more time

322
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,910
with your family.

323
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,200
Why didn't I find out before

324
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,190
that you're so chatty like my dad?

325
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm going down.

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,680
This is the report you want.

338

Dr. Gu proposed to me.

- Proposed?
- Proposed?

340
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,070
Shh…

341
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,560
Be quiet, okay?

342
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,070
Where is the diamond ring?

343
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,800
Let me see.

344
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,710
Show us.

345
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,560
Diamond ring…

346
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
I don't have it yet.

347
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,400
No diamond ring?

348
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,800
How did he propose?

349
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,680
With this.

350
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,280
Lin Zhixiao, you're crazy.

351
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,680
You've fallen

352
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,760
for a pull ring?

353
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,560
He will make it up to me.

354
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,950
Do Mr. Lin and Ms. Li

355
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,710
know about it?

356
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,520
I haven't told them yet.

357
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,110
I don't know

358
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,400
how to tell them.

359
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,190
You said yes behind their back?

360
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,280
Yeah.

361
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,040
I'll wait and see.

362
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,710
Are you doing all right?

363
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,800
How is it going with

364
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
you and Gu Xiao?

365
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,280
I've been talking about myself,

366
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,110
and forgot to ask you.

367
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,160
He left. What can I do?

368
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
So he just left

369
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,710
without telling you?

370
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,310
What will you do?

371
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,800
What about the cafe?

372
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,590
I'll let Gu Wei ask

373
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,560
what does he mean.

374
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,470
Yeah, let him ask.

375
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,680
No, no. No need.

376
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,590
He has disappeared,

377
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,880
what's the point of tangling with him?

378
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,000
Do I look

379
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,430
like an outcast

380
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,520
to you?

381
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,430
As for San Gu Cafe,

382
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,190
it will have nothing to do with me.

383
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,680
That's your efforts.

384
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,430
Are you sure?

385
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:22,300
(On Sale)

386
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,740
(On sale for mismanagement.
Price is negotiable.)

387
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,310
(Sorry, the subscriber you dialed)

388
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,230
(is power off.)

389
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,620
(Sorry, the subscriber you dialed)

390
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,300
(is power off.)

391
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,430
You're back.

392
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,040
Ms. Li cooked soup.

393
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,190
I left one bowl for you.

394
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,880
I'll go heat it up.

395
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,520
Do you want it or not?

396
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,070
Are you tired?

397
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,950
Come over.

398
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,590
What's wrong?

399
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:31,880
Sit down.

400
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,680
I have something to tell you.

401
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,230
What's wrong? Why so serious?

402
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,230
Sit first.

403
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,470
Zhixiao,

404
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,070
I'm thinking

405
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,430
why don't we set

406
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,520
the wedding date?

407
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,710
How about this,

408
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,160
we get married

409
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,640
as soon as you graduate,

410
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,520
okay?

411
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,160
Why so sudden?

412
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,880
I saw a diamond ring

413
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,800
that suits you very well.

414
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,950
I can't wait to put it on you.

415
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,400
Did you go to see the diamond ring?

416
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,230
So anxious?

417
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,280
I don't have a choice.

418
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,470
I want to

419
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,040
be with you legally.

420
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,470
The only way is

421
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,230
to marry you.

422
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,830
Well…

423
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:22,830
How about we

424
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,280
find a time

425
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,400
for our parents to meet?

426
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,400
Okay.

427
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,400
You decide.

428
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,800
- Let me.
- My cello!

429
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,000
Are you alright?

430
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,400
Lin Zhixiao,

431
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,760
why did you put the cello

432
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,680
at the door?

433
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,160
I'm going to…

434
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,160
I go to practice every day recently.

435
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,000
So I just put it there

436
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,800
for convenience.

437
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,520
That's your tool for living.

438
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,710
What if it's broken?

439
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,920
You've grown up.

440
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,920
Can't you take care of
your own business?

441
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,710
Your mother has sacrificed herself

442
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,640
for the family,

443
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,830
can't you help her for a little bit?

444
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
What's wrong with him?

445
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,950
Hi, Zhixiao,

446
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,590
have you told your family?

447
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,590
Not yet.

448
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,760
Mr. Lin is in

449
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,070
a bad mood today.

450
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,710
He just scolded me.

451
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,160
Let's wait until tomorrow.

452
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,830
Zhixiao.

453
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,190
I'm here with you.

454
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,760
I know.

455
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,560
Good night.

456
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,520
Good night.

457
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,950
Mr. Lin, Ms. Li.

458
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:31,760
I have an

459
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,470
important thing

460
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,400
to announce.

461
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,640
Gu Wei.

462
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,070
You are an adult.

463
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,560
You must have

464
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,040
your own opinions.

465
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,560
You two have just met

466
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,560
for such a short time.

467
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,160
Don't you think it a little hasty

468
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,190
to make the decision now?

469
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,470
Marriage

470
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,680
is not a joke.

471
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,070
It's a big thing in your life.

472
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,710
Mom,

473
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,430
I've long passed the age

474
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,520
of being impulsive.

475
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,070
I have thought it through.

476
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
I want to look after her

477
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,830
for the rest of my life.

478
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,560
I made up with Dr. Gu.

479
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,230
He proposed to me.

480
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,920
And I said yes.

481
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,430
Wh… when?

482
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,310
On my birthday night.

483
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,590
Mom, Dad,

484
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,520
I really hope

485
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,950
we can have your blessings.

486
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,230
I want to talk with Zhixiao alone.

487
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,430
Okay.

488
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,350
I'll leave you two to talk.

489
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,760
Sit down.

490
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,400
I know you must be

491
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,640
very angry right now.

492
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,430
I also know that

493
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,040
you never liked Dr. Gu.

494
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,070
I didn't make this decision

495
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,590
on impulse.

496
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,310
We've been through

497
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,310
a lot of

498
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,800
ups and downs,

499
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,070
some from ourselves,

500
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,230
and some from the others.

501
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,160
Since I have been with him,

502
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,190
I got to know that

503
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,190
I want to be with him,

504
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,000
I want to marry him,

505
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,640
and I want to live with him

506
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,800
for the rest of my life.

507
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,350
Dad,

508
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,190
I've always

509
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,230
been obedient to you.

510
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,000
But this time,

511
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,920
I want to make a decision

512
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,160
for my own life,

513
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,070
can I?

514
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,000
Dad.

515
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,920
Set a date with his parents.

516
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,350
You agreed?

517
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,640
Thank you!

518
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,160
Mr. Lin.

519
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,920
What?

520
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,000
What kind of girl

521
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
do your parents like?

522
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,560
Are you nervous?

523
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,280
This is my first time
meeting your parents.

524
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,400
Of course I am.

525
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,800
Tell me.

526
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,800
Both of my parents are doctors

527
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,430
and highly educated.

528
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,830
Naturally, they like

529
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,160
girls with higher education.

530
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,520
Appearance doesn't matter

531
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,350
to them.

532
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,680
They prefer family type.

533
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,400
Because doctors are busy

534
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,760
and have no time for family.

535
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,350
By the way,

536
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,520
they have mysophobia,

537
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,920
just like me.

538
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,640
Do… do your parents

539
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,880
know about me?

540
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,230
I'm an undergraduate,

541
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,920
and for my work,

542
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,830
I will fly around

543
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,040
when I have to.

544
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
You're busy,

545
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,680
so am I.

546
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,000
I can't have

547
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,040
too much time to

548
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,880
take care of the family.

549
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,310
I'm kidding.

550
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,280
They know

551
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,520
everything about you.

552
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,160
They would have disagreed
when I started dating you.

553
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,110
Besides, I like you,
that's the most important.

554
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,160
They won't interfere too much.

555
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,800
You've just scared me to death.

556
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,680
I knew it.

557
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,000
How could your mom and dad

558
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,560
be so traditional?

559
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,920
Silly.

560
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:05,800
(Bye.)

561
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,230
Bye.

562
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,590
Why haven't you slept yet?

563
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,590
I can't sleep.

564
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,680
So I'm reading some books.

565
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,040
Sit with me.

566
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,830
What's up?

567
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,560
This is the electricity card,
and water card.

568
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,470
You will receive a message
once you get the bill.

569
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,160
Take this to pay the bill.

570
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,070
This is the mortgage bank card.

571
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,680
The amount will be deducted

572
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,350
every month.

573
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,880
Save money in it in advance.

574
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,070
The light is broken. I fixed it

575
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,880
Do you know how to fix it?

576
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,040
Never mind.

577
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,110
Call the property management

578
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,880
if it's broken again.

579
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,230
Why are you telling me all this?

580
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,680
Isn't this what

581
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,470
you and Ms. Li

582
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,350
usually manage?

583
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,880
Can't you share the burden

584
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,560
with me and Ms. Li?

585
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,920
You're about to get married.

586
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,680
You have to learn how to
manage a house.

587
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,040
You can't just idle around.

588
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,070
I got it.

589
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,880
What about your going abroad?

590
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,160
I've decided not to go to Germany.

591
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,680
Don't worry.

592
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,230
I have auditioned

593
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,830
for several bands locally.

594
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,800
It's not as good

595
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
as the previous company,

596
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,590
but I have thought it through,

597
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,830
I don't want to leave you and Ms. Li.

598
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,520
I don't want to leave Dr. Gu.

599
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,160
Anyway,

600
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,430
I can stay with you

601
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,160
from now on.

602
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,800
Go.

603
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,280
Go to bed early.

604
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,760
You too.

605
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,310
Zhixiao,

606
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,590
are you ready?

607
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,680
It's rude to be late today.

608
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,640
Coming.

609
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,280
Perfect.

610
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,680
How is it?

611
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,760
Good.

612
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,560
Decent enough?

613
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,070
They will like me, will they?

614
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,230
I won't embarrass you.

615
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,950
Are you in such a rush

616
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,320
to get married?

617
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,320
What are you saying?

618
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,630
That's not what I mean.

619
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,390
Let's go.

620
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,520
Let's go.

621
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,390
Go.

622
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,360
Come on.

623
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,470
Ms. Li is so pretty.

624
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,670
Mr. Lin is handsome too.

625
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,560
Of course.

626
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,800
Mr. Lin, Auntie Li.

627
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,230
They are my parents.

628
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:54,630
Mom, Dad.

629
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,910
This is Mr. Lin.

630
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:56,800
Auntie Li.

631
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

632
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,120
- Hi.
- Hi.

633
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,670
Mr. Gu. Mrs. Gu.

634
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,600
Hi, Mr. Gu.

635
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,430
Hi, Mrs. Gu.

636
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,870
Hi.

637
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:10,840
You see,

638
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,120
we have just learned about this.

639
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,800
This is so sudden.

640
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,190
I didn't prepare a decent

641
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,430
greeting gift.

642
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
This is just a little

643
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,080
something from us.

644
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,390
Hope you like it, Zhixiao.

645
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Thank you, auntie.

646
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,600
You're welcome.

647
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Thank you, uncle.

648
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,430
- You're welcome.
- It's okay.

649
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,910
Mr. Lin, Mrs. Lin,

650
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,320
look at Zhixiao,

651
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,710
so innocent and cute.

652
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,950
We both like her

653
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,280
very much.

654
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,630
But after all,

655
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,950
she is a little young.

656
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,670
I mean,

657
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,280
we can wait for her
for another two years

658
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,430
so they can get a further
understanding of each other

659
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,600
before getting married.

660
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,470
What do you think?

661
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,150
Mom.

662
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,120
Zhixiao.

663
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,670
Pour some tea for Mrs. Gu.

664
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:15,560
Okay.

665
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,710
No, it's fine.

666
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,670
Auntie, let me pour you some water.

667
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,670
Thanks. Thanks.

668
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,520
Sorry, Auntie.

669
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,360
It's okay. It's okay.

670
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,560
I'm sorry.

671
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,800
- I didn't mean to. Auntie.
- It's okay, it's okay.

672
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,560
Sorry, Auntie.

673
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,080
It doesn't matter.

674
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,910
It's okay.

675
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:40,670
Do you

676
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,230
want to think about

677
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,390
what I just said?

678
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,470
Anyway,

679
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,430
they're together

680
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,190
for too short a time.

681
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,760
I think

682
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:49,840
it's better

683
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,280
to give them more time.

684
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,320
Mom.

685
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,120
Gu Wei.

686
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,470
Mr. Gu, Mrs. Gu.

687
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,560
Our Zhixiao

688
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,670
is young,

689
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,710
and not mature

690
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,430
enough.

691
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,120
But in some ways,

692
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,560
she's even more mature

693
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,120
than me.

694
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,150
Things happened

695
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,360
to us during this year,

696
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,120
her mother and I

697
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,950
were panicked,

698
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,870
but she was not defeated

699
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,470
by these things.

700
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,950
She has become

701
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,840
the backbone, the pillar

702
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,230
of our family.

703
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,280
She has

704
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,280
many shortcomings,

705
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,520
but one merit.

706
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,760
She is strong

707
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,630
and resilient.

708
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,000
She had a rough time learning the cello

709
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,430
when she was a child.

710
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,190
Sometimes

711
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,800
she cried.

712
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
But she kept on learning

713
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,710
the next day.

714
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,360
She never complained.

715
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,870
She's not smart.

716
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,360
She's not fast at learning.

717
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,320
But with this

718
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,630
tenacity,

719
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,710
and persistence,

720
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,870
she can persevere in anything.

721
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,360
They two love each other.

722
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,630
As parents,

723
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,280
we should give our blessings,

724
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,080
right?

725
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,000
Of course

726
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,040
in marriage,

727
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,560
only love is not enough,

728
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,080
there are daily necessities too.

729
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,280
Passion fades away

730
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,560
as they stay together longer.

731
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,870
Those who can't endure it

732
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,280
leave each other.

733
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,040
Those who can

734
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,670
become a family.

735
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,520
A family

736
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,120
can only be complete

737
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,080
when both of them stay together.

738
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,600
I don't know

739
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,470
if it will be tough for them

740
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,840
once they get married,

741
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,230
but I believe

742
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,360
that our Zhixiao

743
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,080
will be able to support a family.

744
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,560
What Mr. Lin said is very reasonable.

745
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,910
In fact,

746
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,190
as parents,

747
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,870
as long as the two
truly love each other,

748
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,870
how can we

749
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,870
not support

750
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,760
or bless them?

751
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,520
Right?

752
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,950
Gu Wei,

753
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,800
you have your own thoughts.

754
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,190
It's your life.

755
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,360
You live with it.

756
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,470
In principle,

757
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,390
as long as you have

758
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,150
thought about it clearly,

759
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,710
as elders,

760
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,430
we won't interfere.

761
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,040
Right?

762
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,520
It's just that we have

763
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,470
only one daughter.

764
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,950
We don't want her

765
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,800
to be rich or what,

766
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,230
we just want her

767
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,000
to be healthy and safe.

768
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,230
Actually, we don't

769
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,600
want her to leave us.

770
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,190
But we know

771
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,560
what it's called

772
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,230
young lovers, old partners.

773
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,870
Right?

774
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,470
There is still a long way to go.

775
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,470
I just hope that

776
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,710
you can support

777
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,470
each other.

778
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,150
I understand.

779
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,760
I've been treated

780
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,840
Zhixiao as

781
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,600
my future wife.

782
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,910
In the future,

783
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,190
I will do my best

784
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,150
to give Zhixiao

785
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,150
a happy family.

786
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,840
Why are you all

787
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,390
so sentimental?

788
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah.

789
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,320
Isn't this a good thing?

790
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,080
I think,

791
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,280
how about

792
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,670
we just set the wedding date

793
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,430
today?

794
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,040
Yes, sure.

795
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
We understand

796
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,950
you don't want Zhixiao to leave.

797
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,840
It's okay if you want to

798
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:36,910
keep her a little longer.

799
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:37,800
How about next year?

800
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,120
May Day of next year,

801
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:39,800
or National Day.

802
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,040
They are all lucky dates.

803
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,120
How about this year?

804
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,630
This…

805
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,390
Let's just

806
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,950
ask for their opinions,

807
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,670
okay?

808
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,670
Gu Wei.

809
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,280
What do you think?

810
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,280
I also want to marry Zhixiao

811
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,120
and become her family

812
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,840
as soon as possible.

813
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,320
Don't worry,

814
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,870
everything will stay

815
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:07,560
the same as before.

816
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,840
You're not losing a daughter,

817
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,120
you're going to have a son.

818
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,710
Uncle, Auntie.

819
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800
You're going to have

820
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,430
a daughter too.

821
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,600
Good.

822
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:31,870
All right.

823
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,390
I embarrassed myself, didn't I?

824
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,230
We're going to be in-laws.

825
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,520
Come, have some tea.

826
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,320
Come.

827
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:45,760
Yeah.

828
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,520
The tea is getting cold.

829
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:46,950
Come.

830
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,150
Come.

831
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,910
Watch your behavior.

832
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:54,630
Lin Zhixiao.

833
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,470
Have some tea.

834
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,870
I never thought Mr. Lin

835
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,520
would be so useful today.

836
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,520
Without his help,

837
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,040
we wouldn't have been so successful.

838
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,280
He scolds me a lot,

839
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,670
I thought he looked down

840
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,000
upon me deep in his heart.

841
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:19,710
But I was really

842
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:20,630
moved by

843
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,910
what he said today.

844
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,950
What are you smirking about?

845
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:29,910
Why are you so weird?

846
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:30,670
What's happening?

847
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,670
Nothing.

848
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,910
Maybe I was too nervous today.

849
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,040
Suddenly relaxed,

850
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,710
I feel a little tired.

851
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,600
Were you nervous?

852
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,870
I didn't see it at all.

853
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,040
I almost knocked over

854
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,910
the cups on the table

855
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,040
and made a flood.

856
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,760
Can you stop?

857
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,470
It was embarrassing.

858
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:51,910
Okay.

859
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,760
Go back and rest.

860
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,390
You too.

861
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,800
Rest early.

862
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,600
I'm leaving.

863
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,390
Okay.

864
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,430
Zhixiao.

865
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,910
What's wrong with you today?

866
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,280
I just want to see you more.
