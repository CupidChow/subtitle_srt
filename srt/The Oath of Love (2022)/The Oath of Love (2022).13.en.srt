(Shao Jiang)

(Events)
(Solo Violin Recital At Bella Palace, France)

20
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,540
(Shao Jiang replied, he was flattered being
called the "Dream Lover of Billions of Girls".)

21
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,120
The "Dream Lover of Billions of Girls"?

22
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,870
He cares.

23
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,830
He doesn't care.

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,440
He cares.

25
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,550
He doesn't care.

26
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,750
(Hi, Zhixiao.)

27
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,320
Sansan,

28
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,320
I feel so bad.

29
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,440
Listen.

30
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,360
A lot of things happened.

31
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,080
Hi, Wei.

32
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,800
Hi, what're you doing?

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,470
What can I do?

34
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,000
Just work in the café.

35
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,160
Alone?

36
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,720
With Sansan.

37
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,000
But

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,830
she doesn't have much time
to talk to me.

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,390
She's on the phone.

40
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,880
Looks like

41
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,830
she's talking on the phone

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,470
with Lin Zhixiao.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,670
Okay.

44
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,470
They seem to be close.

45
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,720
They can talk for half a day
about trivial things.

46
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,830
She just left me alone.

47
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,720
Woman.

48
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,470
Here's the deal.

49
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,630
I'll give you a hand tomorrow.

50
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,000
No, thanks.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,800
I've almost finished it.

52
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,270
It's not easy for you
to have a few days off.

53
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,880
You should make full use
of this holiday

54
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,550
to go to a bar

55
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,110
and find yourself a girlfriend.

56
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,080
Don't waste the time.

57
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,630
You're welcome

58
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,440
to the opening ceremony.

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,910
So,

60
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,240
are you turning me down?

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,390
How's that possible?

62
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,110
Then, it's a deal.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,270
Why is he suddenly so concerned
about me?

64
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,960
Weird.

65
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,390
It's very kind of you

66
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,920
to take your time out

67
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,070
to send this fortunate potted plant

68
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,390
to celebrate the opening of our café.

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Thank you for your efforts.

70
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,320
It's my pleasure.

71
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,920
Gu Xiao is also one of the shareholders.

72
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,670
What a pity!

73
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,070
You came at the wrong time.

74
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,670
Today is not the right day.

75
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,070
Sansan.

76
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,720
You're not bullying my brother again,
are you?

77
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,760
What are you talking about?

78
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,390
Does your brother look like
that he's easy to bully?

79
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,200
Did you get ready

80
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,390
for the opening ceremony?

81
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,510
We're close.

82
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,600
Actors, drinks

83
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,160
and the show

84
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,230
are all set.

85
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
You got a show?

86
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,320
We have invited…

87
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,760
We have invited Shao Jiang,

88
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,000
a local graduate from Huaqing University

89
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,670
and a rising star in violin performance

90
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,000
who has now gone international.

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,320
Shao Jiang? Man or woman?

92
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,830
When did you change the plan?

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,480
Why didn't you tell me…?

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
Don't be silly.

95
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,000
Your brother is here.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,550
Why don't you make him

97
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,440
a cup of coffee?

98
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,230
Shao Jiang. I think you must
have heard of him.

99
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,320
I heard you've

100
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,230
met him.

101
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,950
Then you must know that

102
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,830
Shao Jiang is not only

103
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,830
Zhixiao's childhood sweetheart,

104
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,070
but the person who activated her

105
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,600
to learn the cello.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
(When I was in college,)

107
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,040
(my academic performance was terrible.)

108
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,160
I didn't know

109
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,320
if I could get into a college or not.

110
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,760
I almost gave up.

111
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,550
Until a senior student showed up

112
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,000
and he encouraged me

113
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,480
and showed me the right way.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,070
It was also because of him

115
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,670
that I started playing the cello.

116
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,040
Now I can rest reassured.

117
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,510
The man who knows Zhixiao's feelings

118
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,000
and can take good care of her

119
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,480
has finally come back.

120
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,790
None of my business.

121
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,600
By the way,
I've got things to do at the hospital.

122
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,720
I gotta go.

123
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,920
You are busy, huh?

124
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,320
Okay then. See you next time.

125
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,670
Gu Xiao. I gotta go.

126
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,550
Wei. Wei.

127
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,600
Come on, Dr. Gu.

128
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,790
Work hard
on both your work and life.

129
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,160
After all, that's what life is like.

130
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,920
You gotta face a new challenge every day,

131
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,790
no,

132
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,830
a blow instead.

133
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,830
Wei. Wei.

134
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,390
Wei.

135
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,480
Wei.

136
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,550
Sansan is just bad-tempered

137
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,760
and sharp-tongued.

138
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,510
Don't take it personally.

139
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,600
If so,

140
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,760
why do you still love her?

141
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,920
I guess I was born

142
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,070
to be handsome, rich, and smart.

143
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,790
My life is so far so good.

144
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,600
So I wanna try something different.

145
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,920
But, no. Wait a sec.

146
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,070
I don't love her.

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,790
We're just friends and pot-companions

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,040
and partners.

149
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,950
Then why

150
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,000
do you love Lin Zhixiao?

151
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,790
What're you talking about?

152
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,070
Do you think I'm like you,

153
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,000
a dating freshman

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,510
who looks like a king but a rookie?

155
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,270
Wei.

156
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,000
Although

157
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,070
I would rather die

158
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,270
than choose my future sister-in-law

159
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,230
between Gao Xi

160
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,480
and Lin Zhixiao.

161
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,510
But now, I've changed my mind.

162
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,670
I will never allow you to lose

163
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,270
to the musician guy.

164
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,390
I just don't wanna lower myself

165
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,510
to compete with the younger people.

166
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,200
I understand that.

167
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,480
But...

168
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,670
Wei, you gotta do something.

169
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,270
And let her know
what you've done for her.

170
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,440
You've done all these things for her
without letting her know.

171
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,760
With her dumb head,

172
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
she won't even get it

173
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,550
next life.

174
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:53,500
(Could you come to my place?
I got a problem.)

175
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,200
Dr. Gu,

176
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,670
what can I do for you?

177
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,110
Dr. Gu?

178
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,320
Well,

179
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,520
the string of lights doesn't work.
Could you please help fix it?

180
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,710
It was you who picked it out.

181
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,150
How come it doesn't work?

182
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,520
I was afraid it would break

183
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,110
so I bought a good one.

184
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,710
Lin Zhixiao, take your time.

185
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,080
I'm gonna go to my study.

186
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,760
If you get it fixed…

187
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,150
- I have…
- Gotcha.

188
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,550
Turns out there's a battery missing.

189
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,550
No wonder it doesn't work.

190
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,910
Luckily I have a spare one.

191
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,030
Wait a minute.

192
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,670
Okay, it's on.

193
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,670
But, Dr. Gu...

194
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,030
Why is this battery gone?

195
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,320
I didn't take it away.

196
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,150
You didn't?

197
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,790
Then did anyone come to your house?

198
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,710
No worries.

199
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,110
I've fixed it for you anyway.

200
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,590
Remember to check

201
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,110
these basic issues first in the future.

202
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,670
Dr. Gu, if there's nothing else,
I'll leave now.

203
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,840
Wait a minute.

204
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,440
What's up?

205
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,150
I need to talk to you
about something.

206
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,880
What is it?

207
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,960
Well...

208
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,230
Mop the floor for me.

209
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Those shoes are for home use.

210
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,280
They're especially clean.

211
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,350
But you just stepped outside.

212
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,550
Dr. Gu.

213
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,910
You won.

214
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,150
I'll mop.

215
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,880
Clean it up a bit.

216
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll come over later to check.

217
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,280
Got it.

218
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,590
Lin Zhixiao…

219
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,550
(Zhixiao.)

220
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,760
(Jiang, what brings you here?)

221
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,790
(Isn't this Dr. Gu's place?)

222
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,150
(Why did you come out of his place?)

223
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,840
(I went to fix something for him.)

224
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,230
Fix something?

225
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,960
What can you fix for him?

226
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,790
A light bulb.

227
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,790
I bought it for him before.

228
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,470
You can ask him

229
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,880
to come to me next time.

230
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,590
I can handle it.

231
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,520
Are you worried that Dr. Gu…?

232
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,960
Don't worry, Jiang.

233
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,200
Dr. Gu…

234
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,590
How can I describe him to you?

235
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,200
He's extremely nerdy
and stereotypical

236
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,790
and almost a galaxy

237
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
away

238
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,790
from the kind of person

239
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,440
that you've imagined.

240
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,280
That's not appropriate either.

241
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,030
Just listen to me, okay?

242
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,230
Don't go

243
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,400
to a single man's place anymore.

244
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,150
You've been back just for a few days

245
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,200
and now you're acting like my father.

246
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,230
Your father?

247
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,670
We're different.

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm jealous.

249
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,840
(That is funny.)

250
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,640
Wait a minute.

251
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,520
(What?)

252
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,670
Isn't this the Arpeggione Sonata

253
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,230
recorded by Mischa Maisky?

254
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,440
How did you know I liked it?

255
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,470
Of course, I do.

256
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,840
(Jiang, I have to say)

257
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,110
your taste is really...

258
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,280
Come on.

259
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,590
I'm a professional musician

260
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,790
who got some fans, okay?

261
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,440
Do you expect
that I would give you

262
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,710
the "Ode to Joy" or "To Alice"?

263
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,640
Or "Canon"?

264
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,710
If you gave me Canon,

265
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,960
I would hit you.

266
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,110
(It's far from classy.)

267
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,760
(Come on in.)

268
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,670
(Ms. Li is at home.)

269
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,000
(Ms. Li,)

270
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,640
(look who's coming.)

271
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,520
Hello, Auntie.

272
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,590
Good to see you, Shao Jiang.

273
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,320
Come on in.

274
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,440
(He bought you flowers.)

275
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,000
(You're so sweet.)

276
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,280
(I'm glad you like it.)

277
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,880
Take my husband to go abroad?

278
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,640
Yes. You should know

279
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,110
about the medical level abroad.

280
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,550
Taking Mr. Lin to see the doctors
overseas

281
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,640
may help his disease

282
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,670
to a certain extent.

283
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,470
But,

284
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,790
we don't know anything

285
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,280
about going abroad
for medical treatment.

286
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,440
It's okay.

287
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,880
I've already asked someone for advice.

288
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
I can contact

289
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,280
the best cancer treatment center there.

290
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,440
Then,

291
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,760
what do we need to prepare?

292
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,520
We need medical records now.

293
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,710
You can take pictures of them
and send them to me.

294
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,790
I'll go find the doctor.

295
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,670
Okay.

296
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,790
Sure, no problem.

297
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,350
Good.

298
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,790
Then, it's a deal.

299
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,760
Okay, okay, okay.

300
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,470
(Ms. Li, your memory is fading.)

301
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,110
The vase was in the storage room.

302
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,910
I…

303
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,150
Auntie, I got something to deal with.

304
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,960
I gotta go.

305
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,760
You're leaving now?

306
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,550
Yes, I have to.

307
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,640
Stay a little longer.

308
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,760
No, thanks.

309
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,440
Okay, okay, okay.

310
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,670
- Then I'll see you next time, alright?
- Okay.

311
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,590
Okay. I'll visit you and Mr. Lin
next time.

312
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,470
Zhixiao, go see him off.

313
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,710
Come on.

314
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,840
- Okay.
- Let's go, then.

315
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,470
Be safe on the road.

316
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,440
Okay, don't worry.

317
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,110
Just now at my home,

318
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,110
what were you guys talking about?

319
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,200
You guys were being weird.

320
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,550
It's a surprise.

321
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,710
You'll find out later.

322
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,640
What is it?

323
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,150
About the music or the show?

324
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,590
You wanna know?

325
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,520
Yes.

326
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,840
Just tell me.

327
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,110
Look, what is it?

328
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,080
How naughty you are!

329
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,910
You're doing

330
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,550
what you did as a kid.

331
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,030
But you're fooled by me.

332
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,790
No way!

333
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,080
Alright. Just kidding.

334
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,840
I gotta go.

335
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,910
Okay.

336
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,350
Bye-bye.

337
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,080
Bye-bye. Jiang.

338
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,640
Bye-bye.

339
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,980
(Jiang, I'll send you
my husband's medical information later.)

340
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,110
Leo. It's me, Shawn.

341
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:05,950
Hello?

342
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,310
Dr. Gu.

343
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,110
What's the problem?

344
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,160
Are you busy?

345
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,350
No, I'm not.

346
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,310
You're not asking me

347
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,350
to work for you, aren't you?

348
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,190
No.

349
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,950
I saw your WeChat moment.

350
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
I thought it was funny.

351
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,000
(You mean the moment)

352
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,310
(that I posted)

353
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,470
(of my live show?)

354
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,070
What do you think

355
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,280
of my performance?

356
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,760
You look happy.

357
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:48,950
(Yes.)

358
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,710
(I was having fun that day.)

359
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,430
(I had been struggling with)

360
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,710
(whether I had to perform)

361
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,160
(on a real stage or not.)

362
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,310
(So I had put a lot of pressure
on myself.)

363
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,280
(But I forgot the essence of music,)

364
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,640
(in fact, is to make myself happy.)

365
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,800
(Until that day,)

366
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,070
(Jiang took me to a jazz restaurant,)

367
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,160
(I have found my purpose
of learning music.)

368
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,710
It was good. I listened to it.

369
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,710
I thought your performance was great.

370
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,350
You did?

371
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,190
But I guess it was just okay.

372
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,040
Thanks to Jiang.

373
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,070
(I thought about it.)

374
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,920
(That night,)

375
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,520
(I've done four styles of music.)

376
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
(But we worked well together.)

377
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,310
Dr. Gu, what's going on?

378
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,070
Am I talking too much?

379
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,680
Are you a little tired?

380
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,280
No, I'm not.

381
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,400
I just suddenly thought

382
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,520
of something at work.

383
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,110
In fact,

384
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,830
you just saw my picture
of playing the cello.

385
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,830
The vibe is better on the spot.

386
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,710
If you want,

387
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,520
I…

388
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,470
(I can take you to the scene next time)

389
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,280
(to feel it.)

390
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,070
(Would you like to go?)

391
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,430
I have been busy at the hospital lately.

392
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,800
I need to get prepared
for the academic conference too.

393
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,560
Let's talk about it later.

394
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,280
(Okay, okay, okay.)

395
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,680
Good.

396
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,470
Then,

397
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,760
anything else to say, Dr. Gu?

398
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,680
(Strike a proper balance
between work and rest.)

399
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,280
(Don't over-practice the cello.)

400
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,470
Okay, then. Go to bed early.

401
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,590
Good night. Dr. Gu.

402
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,230
Good night.

403
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,560
Zhixiao. Thank God, you're here.

404
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,230
I'm making the fish soup

405
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,160
for your father.

406
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,830
But I forgot to buy the green onions.

407
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,920
Why don't you go downstairs
and buy some?

408
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,310
I haven't eaten yet.

409
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,280
It's downstairs.

410
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,310
Just a few steps away.

411
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,110
Eat it when you get back.

412
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,520
Good girl. Go.

413
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,190
Hello?

414
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,430
What?

415
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,470
The physical signs of Bed 35
went wrong?

416
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,800
Easy. Tell me in detail.

417
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,590
Take your time.

418
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,070
Give me the indicators.

419
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
I'll be there right away.

420
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,280
(Take it easy. I'm coming.)

421
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,590
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

422
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:38,800
Hello?

423
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,800
Lin Zhixiao, what're you doing?

424
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,710
(What can I do?
Just practicing my cello.)

425
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,160
How can I help you?

426
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,310
(It's about the opening ceremony.)

427
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,430
We got an activity during the day

428
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,310
written in the invitation.

429
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,760
But Gu Xiao and I

430
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,680
are going to hold a private party
at night.

431
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,470
Why don't you ask Dr. Gu
to come with you?

432
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,430
Me? I ask Dr. Gu to come?

433
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,710
Why?

434
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,640
Why not Gu Xiao?

435
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Hasn't Dr. Gu

436
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,920
taken some moves

437
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,000
toward you lately?

438
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,110
What do you mean?

439
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,310
The prodding trick didn't work.

440
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,160
What a nerd.

441
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,190
What did you say?

442
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,800
Don't you wanna talk

443
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,680
about life and dreams with him

444
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,000
over a glass of champagne?

445
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,310
Listen to me. Just call him.

446
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,310
How can I…?

447
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,520
How can I call him?

448
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,000
I-I…

449
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,040
H-he's so busy.

450
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,310
What if I he's in the middle of…

451
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,560
I just can't call him.

452
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,190
(Stop nagging.)

453
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,590
(Listen to me and go call him.
Bye-bye.)

454
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,950
Come on.

455
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,430
The patient of Bed 21

456
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,310
has to stay in the hospital
for observation.

457
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,400
Okay, got it.

458
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,430
The patient just had a surgery

459
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,400
and should go on a fast.

460
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,560
Okay.

461
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,310
Hello? I'm listening.

462
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,710
Dr. Gu. This is Lin Zhixiao.

463
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,680
Are you busy now?

464
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,310
Well, Sansan

465
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,520
just called.

466
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,640
Their café is gonna open.

467
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Next Saturday?

468
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,520
I'm on duty next Saturday.

469
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,310
I don't have time.

470
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,070
Isn't Dr. Yan on duty

471
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,110
next Saturday?

472
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,560
Sorry.

473
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,430
I was too busy.

474
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,310
I misremembered the time.

475
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,590
Is there anything else?

476
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,190
No, it's fine.

477
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,070
Just asking.

478
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,280
Then I won't bother you, Dr. Gu.

479
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,070
Your work is important.

480
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,040
Sorry, Wei.

481
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,230
It's fine. Keep going.

482
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,760
Okay.

483
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:58,460
(How is it going?)

484
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:06,340
(He is not available.
He is never available. And...)

485
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:19,700
(And what?)

486
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,860
(Nothing, maybe I'm overthinking it.)

487
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,230
Shao Jiang, this is…?

488
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,230
This is the recommendation

489
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,310
sent by my friend abroad.

490
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,310
I asked him to reach

491
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,760
the best expert in this field.

492
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,280
We can start the process

493
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
anytime,

494
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,400
so that Mr. Lin can go there

495
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,800
to have himself examined and treated.

496
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,070
You have found the doctor so soon?

497
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,710
And he is the best of all.

498
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,310
Great!

499
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,190
The medical conditions over there

500
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,230
are top notch.

501
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,560
I think it would

502
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,000
help a lot

503
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,040
in Mr. Lin's treatment.

504
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,040
Yes, yes.

505
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,800
Jiang,

506
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,920
thanks so much for the help.

507
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,160
Otherwise, we don't know

508
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,310
where to start.

509
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,680
I just did what I should.

510
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,640
What do we need to do now?

511
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,430
Do we need to prepare the materials?

512
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah.

513
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,110
You need to prepare Mr. Lin's

514
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,310
detailed medical records,

515
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,800
including the details of

516
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,680
the previous surgeries.

517
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,430
And translate them into English.

518
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,430
And one more thing,

519
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,310
you have to start

520
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,760
preparing visa documents.

521
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,430
There's a lot

522
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,230
to prepare.

523
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,590
We gotta hurry up then.

524
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,160
Do we have to go to Shanghai

525
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,070
to apply for a visa?

526
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,230
Jiang, this…

527
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,000
This visa thing,

528
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,070
I'm really not familiar.

529
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,520
I guess I have to trouble you.

530
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,310
No problem.

531
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,310
Auntie, don't worry.

532
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,190
I'll help you

533
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,070
with the visa.

534
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,800
That would be great!

535
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,280
Jiang,

536
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,800
sorry for all these troubles.

537
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,950
Thank you.

538
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,040
You're welcome.

539
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,000
But…

540
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,070
Going abroad for treatment
is a big matter.

541
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,520
We can't make the decision so hastily.

542
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,160
What are you saying, honey?

543
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,800
This is a good opportunity.

544
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,070
We must go.

545
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,640
It's getting late, Jiang.

546
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,110
You go back first.

547
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,640
Okay, see you then.

548
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Shao Jing, I'll see you off.

549
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,310
Jiang,

550
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm sorry for this.

551
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,800
We will discuss this.

552
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,680
- It's okay.
- We'll keep in touch

553
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,800
about this.

554
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,520
Yeah, sure.

555
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,680
Thanks.

556
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,310
My pleasure.

557
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,160
I'll see him off.

558
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,920
What are you doing?

559
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,190
It wasn't easy for him to get this.

560
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,000
What are you doing?

561
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,680
I'm not going.

562
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,310
Zhixiao.

563
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Mr. Lin wasn't

564
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,160
happy about this.

565
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,640
Am I being

566
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,110
a little

567
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,310
reckless about this?

568
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,590
No, no.

569
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,310
You know

570
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,310
Mr. Lin.

571
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,800
He always pulls a long face.

572
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,470
Don't mind it.

573
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,920
Um…

574
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,800
What do you think about this?

575
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,470
When Mr. Lin was diagnosed,

576
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,040
I thought about

577
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,280
taking him abroad for treatment.

578
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,040
It's just that at that time,

579
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,310
I searched on the Internet that

580
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,590
the treatment in foreign countries

581
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,950
may not be better than it here.

582
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,350
So I gave up the idea.

583
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,950
Since you have helped us

584
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,070
contact an expert.

585
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,160
I think it should

586
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,070
be a good choice.

587
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,920
But it seems that

588
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,310
you are not as active as your mom.

589
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,800
Do you have any concerns?

590
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,310
I would like to ask

591
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,950
Mr. Lin's attending doctor

592
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,640
for his opinion.

593
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,310
Attending doctor?

594
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,310
Is it Dr. Gu,

595
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,470
who ate out with us

596
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,470
that day?

597
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,040
Yes, he is Mr. Lin's

598
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,310
chief surgeon.

599
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,760
You trust his judgment, don't you?

600
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,920
Zhixiao, you have really

601
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,710
grown up during this time.

602
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,640
But in my eyes,

603
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,800
you have always been the little sister

604
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,230
under protection.

605
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,590
Shao Jiang…

606
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,070
Promise me.

607
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,040
No matter what happens in the future,

608
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,470
you will come to me first, okay?

609
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,830
Now that I'm back,

610
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,920
I won't let you

611
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,040
carry so much burden alone.

612
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,880
I'll be there

613
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,640
whenever you need me.

614
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,110
Okay. Thank you, Shao Jiang.

615
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,520
Get inside. See you.

616
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,400
Bye.

617
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,160
Bye.

618
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:10,500
(Dr. Gu, are you home?)

619
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,300
(You recalled a message. Re-edit.)

620
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,640
(I'm not going.)

621
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,880
I'm good here.

622
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
Why go abroad?

623
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,430
It's a waste of time!

624
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,710
What's a waste of time?

625
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,950
This is a good opportunity.

626
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,110
We have to give it a try.

627
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,830
Others want to go but they can't.

628
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,950
He said

629
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,280
that the medical conditions

630
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,430
abroad are top-notch.

631
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,040
Foreign farts are fragrant!

632
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,190
Subservient!

633
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,110
What are you doing?

634
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,590
Could you talk nicely?

635
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,400
Jiang tried so hard

636
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,520
to find the expert for you.

637
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,070
Why are you being so stubborn?

638
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,590
For such an important thing,

639
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,000
you asked Jiang to do it

640
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,160
without discussing with me first?

641
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,400
You're crazy.

642
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,830
I told you, I'm not going.

643
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,590
You call me crazy?

644
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,430
You're so unreasonable.

645
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,710
All I did is for you!

646
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,560
I don't need it!

647
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,430
I would rather die at home

648
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,640
when I have to!

649
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,310
Dad!

650
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,230
Lin Jianguo!

651
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,590
Say that again.

652
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,430
That's not what he meant.

653
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,280
Fine, now that you don't want to live,

654
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,190
why would we

655
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,560
care about you?

656
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,760
Do as you want!

657
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,950
No, Mom, Mom.

658
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,190
It's my own business.

659
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:14,590
What are you doing?

660
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,880
No one decides it for me!

661
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
I won't go.

662
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,520
- Stop it.
- As you wish!

663
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,470
Can you be quiet?

664
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,140
(Lin Zhixiao: Thank you, Dr. Gu.)

665
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,620
(Lin Zhixiao recalled a message.)

666
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,110
Take a bath.

667
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,040
And go to sleep.

668
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,710
Don't just sit here.

669
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,070
Don't bother.

670
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,920
I've thrown all your cigarettes.

671
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,310
You know it.

672
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,560
Could I talk with you?

673
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,800
You're just a kid.

674
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,310
I have nothing to talk with you.

675
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,040
Don't treat me like a kid.

676
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,400
I have grown up.

677
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,560
Could you take it seriously

678
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,800
with me for once?

679
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,070
Tell me about it,

680
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,190
why you don't want to

681
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,190
go abroad for treatment.

682
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,680
I said,

683
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,920
I'm treated well here,

684
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,400
why go abroad?

685
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,000
See?

686
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,800
Is this how you talk with someone?

687
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,350
Don't be in a hurry to deny it.

688
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,280
It's just another option.

689
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,040
I think we can

690
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,400
give it a thought.

691
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,470
Is it so good abroad?

692
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,560
You guys are

693
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,040
too naive.

694
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,040
You think it too simply.

695
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,430
Okay, fine. You tell me,

696
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,310
what do you think

697
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,590
it is bad abroad?

698
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,520
What?

699
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,800
Going abroad to see a doctor

700
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,190
(is easy to say.)

701
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,880
(But in reality,)

702
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,400
(can I go there alone?)

703
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,430
(Your mom has to go with me, does she?)

704
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,160
(Both of us)

705
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,310
(have language barriers)

706
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,000
(and have difficulty communicating.)

707
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,310
(And I also know that)

708
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,800
(it takes about one week)

709
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,310
(for diagnosis and treatment result.)

710
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,310
And it takes another week

711
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,710
for the second appointment.

712
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,110
So we do nothing during this time

713
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,830
but wait?

714
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,950
It does not matter.

715
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,430
I can solve the language problem.

716
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,710
I will go with you.

717
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,310
I passed CET-4.

718
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,680
I can manage simple conversations.

719
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,400
Absurd!

720
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,160
Now is the most critical time for you

721
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,760
to graduate and find a job.

722
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,160
How can you go with us?

723
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,190
Absolutely no.

724
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,310
We can rent

725
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,520
an apartment

726
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,350
near the hospital.

727
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,070
And hire a translator

728
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,430
when you get there.

729
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,430
Hire a translator?

730
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Do you know how much does that cost?

731
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,400
How much does it cost to rent a house?

732
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,400
So the reason why you don't want

733
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,310
to go abroad for treatment is

734
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,560
because you are worried about money?

735
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,760
That's a waste of money.

736
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,880
How can I do that?

737
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,310
How is it a waste of money?

738
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,760
You will be healed.

739
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,560
It's necessary money to spend.

740
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,190
Do you know how much is that?

741
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,470
In a foreign country,

742
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,640
you have to pay 40,000 U.S. dollars
in advance

743
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,070
for the diagnosis and treatment alone.

744
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,470
That's about

745
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,430
300,000 yuan.

746
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,710
What about the cost
of follow-up treatment?

747
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,230
And air tickets, food,
accommodation, and travel,

748
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,470
and other expenses?

749
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,230
It will cost us this house,

750
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,800
and all of money

751
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,830
we have saved

752
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,640
in our life.

753
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,070
Is it worth it?

754
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,070
Yes!

755
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,560
As long as you can be cured,

756
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,880
everything is worth it!

757
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,230
What if I can't be cured?

758
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,230
No matter if I can be cured or not,

759
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,230
you and your mom

760
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,150
will have a life

761
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,840
to live.

762
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,360
You have class tomorrow morning,
Don't you?

763
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Go to bed now.

764
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,150
Go see if your mom is asleep.

765
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,670
And ask her

766
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,360
what does she want to eat
tomorrow morning.

767
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,670
I'll go buy it.

768
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,040
So stubborn.

769
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,670
Why don't you go ask her yourself?

770
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,280
Mom.

771
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,120
It's me.

772
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,000
Don't cry.

773
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,390
You know

774
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,560
Mr. Lin well.

775
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,910
He's just so stubborn.

776
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,120
Why be angry with him?

777
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,670
Yes, but…

778
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,040
After hearing

779
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,150
what he said today,

780
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,600
I am angry with him too!

781
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,230
He betrayed a good heart

782
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,560
of you, didn't he?

783
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,560
You're worried about him so much.

784
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,120
But what did

785
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,360
he say today?

786
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,120
We have to teach him a lesson today.

787
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,190
We don't give him a good look.

788
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,910
I'll get a washboard

789
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,320
as long as you give the order, Ms. Li,

790
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,190
and make him kneel on it,

791
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,190
so you can give him severe punishment.

792
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,910
How about that?

793
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,800
My silly girl, don't say that.

794
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,520
How could I really

795
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,950
be angry with your dad?

796
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,360
Not angry?

797
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,320
Then why are you crying?

798
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,360
Zhixiao,

799
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,230
you don't know,

800
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,840
I still remember

801
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,630
every sentence

802
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,710
and every word

803
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,230
that Dr. Gao said to me

804
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,390
on the day your dad

805
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,870
was diagnosed.

806
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,230
She said your dad has

807
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,760
a poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma

808
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,760
with a high degree of malignancy,

809
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
poor prognosis,

810
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,280
easy metastasis

811
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,190
and recurrence.

812
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,950
(These words go back and forth)

813
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,230
(in my head every day.)

814
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,120
Sometimes I can

815
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,840
even dream about it.

816
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,630
(Don't cry.)

817
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,840
(Don't cry, okay?)

818
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,520
(Actually, he can still
argue with me now.)

819
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,320
(He can still pat on the table.)

820
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,470
I'm quite happy about this.

821
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,120
Does that mean

822
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,320
he's better now?

823
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,360
Right?

824
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,320
Actually, I know

825
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,430
what he thinks.

826
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,600
He's just afraid.

827
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,150
He's afraid of losing this house.

828
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,000
He's afraid of spending money.

829
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,040
He is afraid that

830
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,120
if he goes abroad for treatment,

831
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,360
our money is run out

832
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,390
but he can't be cured.

833
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,230
He would leave

834
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,870
nothing to us.

835
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,870
I know.

836
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,630
You know.

837
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,600
Then why did you
still argue with him?

838
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,230
It's not right to think that way.

839
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,630
He knows nothing at all!

840
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,190
Is he healing for himself?

841
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,190
Okay, he says he won't go,

842
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,150
and he doesn't care.

843
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,840
He would be gone,

844
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,520
so he doesn't have to
think about anything.

845
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,000
What about us

846
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,320
who still live?

847
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,040
You tell me, what can I do

848
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,470
if he's gone?

849
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,760
It's not gonna happen, Ms. Li.

850
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,870
(Don't cry, okay?)

851
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,870
(Could you stop crying?)

852
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,710
(I'll talk to him again.)

853
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,430
(Okay?)

854
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,870
(I'll talk to him.)

855
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,950
(Don't cry. Don't cry.)

856
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,430
Don't cry.

857
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,390
It's okay.

858
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,560
It's okay, Zhixiao.

859
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,560
I will be fine in a while.

860
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,470
I still don't want to

861
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,600
see his long face today.

862
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You…you go

863
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,910
get him a quilt

864
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,760
and put it in the living room,

865
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,430
so he can sleep there tonight.

866
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,000
Okay.

867
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,390
I'll go get him a quilt

868
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,560
and let him sleep in the living room.

869
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,870
And,

870
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,120
you go and heat the dinner for him.

871
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,150
He ate too little tonight.

872
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,430
Don't worry.

873
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,560
Mission accepted.

874
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,320
There, there.

875
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,190
Don't cry, Ms. Li.

876
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,360
Go talk to him.

877
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,190
I know.

878
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,120
(A few months ago,)

879
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,800
(my biggest trouble was that)

880
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,710
(Mr. Lin wouldn't let me be a musician.)

881
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,040
(I thought)

882
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,190
(I was an adult.)

883
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,080
(I could endure any difficulty.)

884
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,150
(I could solve any trouble.)

885
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,430
(Now I know,)

886
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,840
(I grew up too slowly.)

887
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,150
(I want to be more mature)

888
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,710
(and more responsible.)

889
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,320
(I have to become)

890
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,000
(a real adult right away.)

891
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,910
(I want to protect you,)

892
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,870
(Ms. Li and Mr. Lin.)

893
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:04,700
(In-patient)

894
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,470
(Lin Zhixiao: Thank you, Dr. Gu.)

895
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,460
(Lin Zhixiao recalled a message.)

896
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:21,730
(What did you want yesterday...)

897
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:32,470
Dr. Gao,

898
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,600
I'm going to take Mr. Lin

899
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,560
abroad for treatment.

900
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Transfer?

901
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,630
Yes,

902
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,360
I've made all arrangements there.

903
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,230
If you want the inpatient case

904
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,560
filed by the hospital,

905
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,360
the family members can
go to the record room

906
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,230
to make a copy with ID number

907
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,520
and inpatient number.

908
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,910
But I'm not sure if the new hospital

909
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:49,950
recognizes it or not.

910
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,670
Thank you, Dr. Gao.

911
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
In fact, the medical records

912
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,470
have been sorted out by Ms. Li.

913
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,630
I came here

914
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,360
to get Mr. Lin's

915
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,630
detailed surgical records.

916
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,150
So they can use them

917
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,470
as a reference.

918
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,120
Surgical records…

919
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,280
Gu Wei, he is looking for you.

920
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,600
Hi, Dr. Gu.

921
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,040
I'm Lin Zhixiao's senior,

922
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,760
Shao Jiang. We met before.

923
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,870
I don't know if you still remember me.

924
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,150
What do you want?

925
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,150
It's because of Mr. Lin.

926
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,840
I plan to take Mr. Lin

927
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,560
to a foreign cancer

928
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,840
treatment center for treatment.

929
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,390
I heard that you are

930
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,670
Mr. Lin's chief surgeon.

931
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,120
I hope you can provide me

932
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:26,950
with a detailed

933
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,710
surgical records of Mr. Lin.

934
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,630
Did the patient's family send you?

935
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,150
No, I came here myself.

936
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,910
Did they know it?

937
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,000
They did.

938
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,120
Ms. Li also supports me

939
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,430
in taking Mr. Lin to go abroad
for treatment.

940
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,190
Dr. Gu,

941
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,390
it's not that we don't trust

942
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,430
your medical skills.

943
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,150
It's just that

944
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,080
we hope to

945
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,390
seek more help

946
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,320
and more insurance.

947
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,000
According to the regulations,

948
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,470
I only talk with the patients

949
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,710
and their family members

950
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,280
about the patients' conditions.

951
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,390
I'm sorry. I'm going to
do a ward round.

952
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,870
Wait a minute, Dr. Gu.

953
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,840
Giving me the surgical records

954
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,840
won't take you

955
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,600
too much time.

956
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,670
You see, I'm here already,

957
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800
please do me a favor.

958
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,950
Did you hear what I said?

959
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,470
I'll only talk about the case's situation

960
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,040
with himself

961
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,280
or his family.

962
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,430
Are you his family?

963
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,230
Not yet.

964
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,120
But I will be very soon.

965
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,000
Come to me when you are.

966
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,180
=The Oath of Love=
Dr. Gu,

967
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,250
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
why is there

968
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,740
a music box?

969
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,980
You like music boxes?

970
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,390
Where did you find it?

971
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,920
It's for me, isn't it?

972
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,250
You love elegant art.

973
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,140
The music box isn't your type.

974
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,480
It's... It's not for you.

975
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,300
Not for you.

976
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,840
So, is it for entertainment?

977
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,430
You know what?

978
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,100
I like this present very much.

979
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,180
It's the best present I've ever had.

980
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,230
Really?

981
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,300
You like this music box?

982
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:09,850
Yes, of course.

983
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,530
Because it's a present from you.

984
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,660
Why did you...?

985
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,750
Sorry.

986
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:26,690
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

987
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,050
I can fix it.

988
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,450
It's okay, Zhixiao. It's okay.

989
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:33,930
I'm fixing it.

990
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:35,130
Done.
