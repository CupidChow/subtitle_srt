Come on, guess.

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,830
What is it?

22
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,510
Instant camera?

23
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,310
Yeah.

24
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,760
It's very convenient.

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,550
Jin Shi and Yin Xi

26
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,870
have taken many photos with it.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,080
Then they made an album

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,160
of sweetheart photos.

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,720
They keep showing it off.

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,310
I want to take photos with you, too.

31
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,870
Okay. Let's do it.

32
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,680
How to turn it on?

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,550
Press this, silly boy.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,630
Here.

35
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,080
Fine. Come on.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,320
Wait. Wait.

00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,440
Lean forward. Lean forward.

38
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,320
Then my face

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,270
will look smaller.

40
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,750
Done.

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,000
Let me check.

42
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,160
Have you used the instant camera before?

43
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,190
No.

44
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,720
I knew that.

45
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,160
Young guys like us

46
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
use this kind of camera.

47
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,440
Let me show you.

48
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,320
Is that so?

49
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,520
Zhixiao.

50
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,800
What did you do?

51
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,270
I took a photo of you, of course.

52
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,750
Why did you take an ugly photo of me?

53
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,880
You looked pretty.

54
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,880
I didn't. I'm sure I looked ugly.

55
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,670
Trust me.

56
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,360
I'm serious.

57
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,110
You are?

58
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,470
You better be.

59
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,240
Do I look lovely in it?

60
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,030
Being lovely means I'm not pretty.

61
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,110
Are you saying I'm not pretty?

62
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,720
You're pretty and lovely.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,960
Don't try to fool me.

64

I'll take a photo of you, too.

67
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,720
I don't want it.

68
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,440
Why?

69
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,670
I seldom take photos.

70

Do you love me?

71
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,390
Will you take photos or not?

72
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,910
Look at the camera.

73
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,190
Isn't it too close?

74
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,800
Because you took an ugly photo of me.

166
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,720
My mother is an anesthetist

and my father is
a cardiothoracic surgeon.

168
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,790
Wow, what a great family!

169
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,230
When you work together,

170
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,760
you can give operations

171
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,550
on a man's organs

172
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,720
throughout his body.

173
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,760
So, be a good girl.

174
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,110
What are you talking about?

175
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,440
Who's this baby?

176
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,640
She's so cute.

177
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,200
She's my cousin's daughter,

178
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,070
Little June.

179
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,790
Her name is Little June?

180
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,720
Lovely, isn't she?

181
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,720
If only all kids

182
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,670
could be as lovely

183
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,920
as Little June!

184
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,980
Because she has good genes.

185
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,020
You're flattering yourself again.

186
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,140
Would you like a try?

187
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,700
Try what?

188
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,420
Good genes.

189
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,860
Your wicked look...

190
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,540
The meal is ready.

191
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,260
Wait a minute.

192
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,140
Come over.

193
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,540
Be right there.

194
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,140
So much porridge?

195
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,580
Because you're hungry.

196
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,860
You're indeed my raiser.

197
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,740
I'm raising a pig.

198
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,260
Who do you mean a pig?

199
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,220
Me.

200
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,220
That's more like it.

201
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,860
Enjoy the porridge.

202
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,740
No peanuts in it this time.

203
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Why isn't there any mince in it?

204
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,220
Just enjoy it.

205
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,660
Hi, Jin Shi.

206
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,340
Going to class?

207
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,100
The class is starting soon.

208
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,220
Why aren't you going to the classroom?

209
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,540
I'm waiting for Xi.

210
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,420
Isn't that obvious?

211
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,660
The classroom is near.

212
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,660
Do you have to go together?

213
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,620
My girlfriend wants that.

214
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,900
What can I do?

215
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:07,900
By the way,

216
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,500
are you going to today's dinner party?

217
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,660
You know what??

218
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,500
I haven't told Xi

219
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,300
about the dinner party yet.

220
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,860
Hello.

221
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,660
Hello.

222
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,420
What were you talking about?

223
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,300
Why didn't you call me to wake me up?

224
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:22,980
I got up late.

225
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,220
I called you.

226
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,420
Check it if you don't believe me.

227
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,420
Did you mute your phone again?

228
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,780
Yes, I guess.

229
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,540
I heard

230
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,420
that a new good movie

231
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,300
would be on today.

232
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,620
Shall we go watch it after class?

233
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,420
Movie?

234
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,660
Let's just go to the movie theater

235
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,660
near our campus.

236
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,780
Tonight?

237
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,420
Yeah.

238
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,420
When will your class be over?

239
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,100
Will you come to me
or shall I go see you?

240
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,300
Tonight,

241
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,420
I'm afraid I have something to do.

242
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,420
What is it?

243
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,860
Um...

244
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,100
My tutor...

245
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,420
He said he might need me

246
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,740
to modify my paper.

247
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,780
Lately,

248
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,660
I'm working on my paper.

249
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,220
Fine.

250
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,540
We can watch it some other day.

251
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,860
Let's go to the classroom.

252
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,620
Go.

253
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
I have sent the file you sorted out

254
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,540
to the delegation.

255
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,100
They expressed their gratitude to you.

256
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,220
I'm glad they're satisfied with it.

257
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,660
Did you stay up late again?

258
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,540
No.

259
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,420
Thank you for your hard work.

260
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,100
It's my job, Vice President Gao.

261
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,620
Why hasn't Dr. Gu

262
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,220
texted me back yet?

263
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,300
Are all doctors

264
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,500
so busy?

265
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,340
Zhixiao,

266
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,500
let me show you something.

267
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,660
What?

268
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,220
Look in the mirror.

269
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,860
Don't you

270
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:03,740
look like

271
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,660
you're eagerly expecting your husband?

272
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,300
I've learned this from you.

273
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,100
Why did you sigh?

274
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,220
Jin Shi can't have dinner with me

275
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,540
for some business.

276
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,300
Let him be.

277
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,220
I can accompany you.

278
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,100
Let's go for dinner together.

279
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,100
I can have it with no one, but you.

280
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,100
What are you talking about?

281
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,660
You sound like

282
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,300
you don't want to have it with me.

283
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,860
Let's go. If we're late,

284
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,300
there will be no delicious dishes
in the canteen.

285
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,500
Shall we have dinner

286
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
in the new hot pot restaurant
at the school gate?

287
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,860
Someone in the Orchestra told me

288
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,860
the hot pot there tasted great.

289
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,660
Shall we go have a big dinner?

290
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,860
Good idea.

291
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,420
Go.

292
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,660
Go.

293
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,220
Give me the book.

294
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,900
I'll return it with mine.

295
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,540
Fine.

296
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:04,980
Excuse me.

297
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,540
How many of you?

298
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,220
Two.

299
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,900
Come in, please.

300
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,340
Okay.

301
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,330
Come on. Cheers.

302
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,300
What's wrong, Yin Xi?

303
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,980
Wait a second.

304
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,300
Jin Shi?

305
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,180
Aren't you busy with your paper?

306
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,300
Uh, Yin Xi...

307
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:29,860
Yes.

308
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,540
I'm having dinner with my classmates.

309
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,620
Busy with dinner?

310
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:34,860
Right.

311
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,620
The class was just over

312
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,180
and we came for dinner together.

313
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,660
Then why didn't you

314
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,860
tell me about it?

315
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,980
I'm afraid you wouldn't...

316
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,660
You wouldn't allow me to come.

317
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,100
When you didn't even ask me,

318
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,300
how did you know I wouldn't agree?

319
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,660
We made him come.

320
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,540
Yes. We...

321
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,620
We made him come.

322
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,420
Jin Shi, explain to Yin Xi.

323
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,740
Xi, I know you...

324
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,300
Don't quarrel with her.

325
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,220
Say something sweet.

326
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,420
Go with her. Go.

327
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,300
Because I know

328
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,740
you wouldn't allow me to come!

329
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,660
What are you yelling for?

330
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,860
How rude you are!

331
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:02,900
Jin Shi.

332
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,300
I'm just being rude.

333
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,860
Don't you know

334
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,740
what temper you have?

335
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,300
Would you agree if I told you?

336
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:09,900
Fine.

337
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,740
I'm just having dinner

338
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,500
with my classmates, so what?

339
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm just doing it.

340
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,060
Jin Shi, what are you doing?

341
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,780
Why are you yelling?

342
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,900
Calm down, will you?

343
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,340
Yeah.

344
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:16,900
People are watching.

345
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,660
Enjoy the dinner, then.

346
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,300
Enjoy your dinner.

347
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,100
Yin Xi.

348
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,980
Go after her, Jin Shi.

349
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,660
Go.

350
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,300
Jin Shi, what's wrong with you?

351
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,100
Why don't you

352
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,660
get Yin Xi back first?

353
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,100
Okay?

354
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,100
I'm not going after her.

355
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,300
Don't try to persuade me.

356
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,620
Come on. No matter

357
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,340
what happens,

358
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,980
I have to go after her.

359
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,620
What wrong have I done?

360
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,740
I can't bear it anymore.

361
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,500
Jin Shi, what's wrong with you?

362
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,660
What do you mean?

363
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,740
I don't mean anything.

364
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,060
Zhixiao, let me tell you something.

365
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,300
I've been bearing it for a long time.

366
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,740
Every day, Xi wants me
to walk her to classes

367
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,860
and walk her back to the dorm.

368
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,420
Whenever she calls me,

369
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,420
I have to go to her

370
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,340
and keep her company.

371
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,300
All I want is

372
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,540
some private space.

373
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,740
I've had enough of it!

374
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,300
Could you stop

375
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,740
saying this

376
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,300
in front of so many people?

377
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,340
Say no more, okay?

378
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,540
Let's go after Yin Xi,

379
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,060
shall we?

380
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,860
Yeah. Get her back first.

381
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,180
Come on. What's the problem

382
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,660
with saying this
in front of my classmates?

383
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,620
Why must I apologize?

384
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,500
What wrong have I done?

385
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,100
I'm just...

386
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,300
Zhixiao,

387
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,420
I'm just having dinner
with my classmates.

388
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,540
What wrong have I done?

389
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,860
Nothing. You're just drunk.

390
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,420
I won't argue with you, okay?

391
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,060
Let's get out

392
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,900
and apologize to Yin Xi

393
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
before we have a talk, all right?

394
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
- Go. Just go.
- Fine. Fine.

395
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,540
Let me tell you

396
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,660
what I'm afraid of most

397
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,100
every day.

398
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,420
Every day, I fear it most

399
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,860
when Yin Xi calls me.

400
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,060
Because she only calls
to check where I am

401
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,540
or ask me to accompany her.

402
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,860
I just want

403
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,420
some private space

404
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,740
with my good friends.

405
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,980
What's the problem with it?

406
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,780
My good friends...

407
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,420
I know

408
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,740
you always mock me,

409
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,300
right?

410
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,860
No, we don't.

411
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,500
It doesn't matter.

412
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,340
We don't mock you.

413
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,180
And I always tell Xi

414
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,340
that I don't want to post in Moments

415
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,300
for PDA

416
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,780
and I want to be a mature man.

417
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,740
But she never listens.

418
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,180
Every time I mention it, she gets angry.

419
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,540
Because she thinks

420
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,660
I no longer love her.

421
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,420
I know a girl needs to feel secure.

422
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,740
What about me?

423
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,620
I'm a young man.

424
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,900
Every day, I post in Moments

425
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,740
for PDA.

426
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,100
She even arranges

427
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,980
the couples' clothing for me.

428
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,980
I can't even wear my own clothes.

429
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,420
Don't I need respect?

430
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,420
You keep asking me

431
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,500
to care for her feelings.

432
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,340
What about my feelings?

433
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,340
Who cares about my feelings?

434
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,780
You're a man.

435
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,420
If you keep saying this,

436
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,660
they'll mock you more.

437
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,100
You'll be more humiliated, you know?

438
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,540
Say no more, okay?

439
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,100
Are you finished?

440
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,780
Yin Xi.

441
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:14,860
I didn't know

442
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,100
this was how you thought of me.

443
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,180
Say something sweet to make her happy.

444
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,860
Now that you can't bear it,

445
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,900
let's break up.

446
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,980
Don't say that, Yin Xi.

447
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,420
What, Jin Shi?

448
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,100
You want to break up?

449
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,220
Again? Fine.

450
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,980
I agree.

451
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,540
Let's break up!

452
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,660
What are you talking about?

453
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,540
He's drunk, Yin Xi.

454
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,180
He... He's just drunk.

455
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,340
Okay.

456
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,340
Go after her.

457
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,660
- Go.
- Go after her.

458
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,300
Yin Xi! Yin Xi!

459
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,740
Let's continue with dinner.

460
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,860
Yin Xi. Yin Xi.

461
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,220
Don't cry.

462
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
Jin Shi is drunk.

463
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,100
He's just drunk.
Don't believe what he said.

464
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,860
Zhixiao,

465
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,780
leave me alone

466
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,860
for a moment.

467
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,900
But you...

468
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,780
Sansan,

469
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,620
do you like it?

470
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,740
I told you

471
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,260
to stop pestering me.

472
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,900
Sansan,

473
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,740
I know you're angry with me.

474
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,380
I promise you.

475
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,260
As long as you get back with me,

476
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,100
I'll spend more time with you.

477
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,620
Okay?

478
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,140
I've told you many times.

479
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,860
Please don't come to me again.

480
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,620
Don't come to you again?

481
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,620
What?

482
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,740
You don't even like

483
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,100
my present now?

484
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,140
You've got a richer boyfriend?

485
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,500
Who?

486
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,140
The man who runs the cafe

487
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,020
with you.

488
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,740
Right?

489
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,780
I hear he's from a rich family.

490
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,020
Hello? Zhixiao.

491
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,140
Sansan, I have something to tell you.

492
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,140
- Just now...
- I'm in the middle of something.

493
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,020
I'll call you back later.

494
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,900
Who I'm with

495
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
has nothing to do with you.

496
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,020
Besides, I've returned

497
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,860
all your presents

498
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,020
to you.

499
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,260
Don't tell me you didn't receive them.

500
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,100
I'm rich

501
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,500
and I don't need anything from you.

502
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,540
Please take your present

503
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,300
and leave.

504
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,620
Come on. Why are you going away?

505
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,140
I'm not finished yet.

506
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,900
Why are you leaving already?

507
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,140
Get out of here!

508
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,860
I'm not finished yet.

509
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,380
Let go of her!

510
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,020
Let go of me. Let...

511
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,100
Isn't he

512
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,500
the man who runs the cafe with you?

513
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,980
I came to get back with you

514
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,100
because I'm showing respect.

515
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,140
But you really

516
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,620
hook up with another man.

517
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,140
What do you think

518
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,420
you are?

519
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,020
Mind your language.

520
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,140
How dare you push me!

521
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,020
I...

522
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,380
Does it hurt?

523
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,900
Why did you bother
to fight that kind of guy?

524
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,380
You should have called the police

525
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,260
to drive him away.

526
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
You shouldn't have got hurt.

527
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,140
I'm talking to you.

528
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,900
Fine. Fine.

529
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,780
I owe you this.

530
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,220
Thank you.

531
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,620
Okay?

532
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,100
Why are you staring at me like that?

533
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,260
What's wrong with you lately?

534
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,500
You've been weird.

535
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,140
Were you dumped by a girl?

536
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,660
Did you quarrel with your parents?

537
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,380
Are you in debt?

538
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:07,780
If you're in debt,

539
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,540
tell me about it.

540
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,140
I'll... I'll give you all my...

541
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,900
I love you.

542
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,020
You...

543
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,780
Why did they break up?

544
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,220
They two

545
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,620
have been together since little.

546
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,780
They're a sweet couple.

547
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,260
Over the years,

548
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,020
everyone thinks

549
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,740
they're a model couple.

550
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,420
But they just broke up.

551
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,620
I even bought

552
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,260
the same couples' clothing as theirs.

553
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,140
Is love

554
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,740
really so unreliable?

555
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,860
What's wrong with you?

556
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,500
Are you very tired?

557
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,140
Last night,

558
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,020
did you stay up late

559
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,300
for the file?

560
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,780
I'm all right.

561
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,380
I'm just thinking

562
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,500
whether love is reliable

563
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,380
has nothing to do with their breakup.

564
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,260
Then tell me why they broke up.

565
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,220
Sometimes, we can't judge one thing

566
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,260
only from one aspect.

567
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,780
Maybe Jin Shi was really suffering.

568
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,020
No one wants to be forced

569
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,540
to do anything he doesn't like.

570
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,140
And no one

571
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,620
wants to stick

572
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,980
to another person

573
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,500
instead of having his own space.

574
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,380
But they shouldn't

575
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,740
have broken up

576
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,500
just because they quarreled for that.

577
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,300
Zhixiao, you're too young.

578
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,220
Many things

579
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,660
can't be as simple as you think they are.

580
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,620
Actually, when we

581
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,980
hang out together,

582
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:40,860
I realized

583
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,020
it didn't feel right about them.

584
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
Now, I'm sure

585
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,500
there's something wrong
with their relationship

586
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
that hasn't been solved.

587
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,620
Why do you keep saying

588
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,020
it's Yin Xi's fault?

589
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,900
Did she force Jin Shi

590
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,140
only by asking him to post in Moments?

591
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,540
I'm just analyzing reasonably.

592
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,900
When Yin Xi knew

593
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,260
Jin Shi was busy with something,

594
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,380
she checked where he was

595
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,420
and stayed clingy to him

596
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,220
all the time.

597
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,980
Even a couple

598
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,860
should have some private space

599
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,140
and personal life.

600
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,780
What?

601
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,260
Nothing.

602
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,620
Zhixiao,

603
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,740
I'm going on the night shift.

604
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,020
Don't you hug me?

605
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,660
All right. I have to go back.

606
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,420
Good girl.

607
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,100
Sansan.

608
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,540
(Zhixiao, I was
in the middle of something.)

609
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,500
(What did you call me for?)

610
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,620
Something terrible happened.

611
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,620
What?

612
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,780
Stop crying,

613
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,300
Yin Xi.

614
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,660
Why exactly

615
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,140
did Jin Shi do that?

616
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,380
What did he promise us?

617
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:19,980
He promised

618
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,140
he would take good care of you, right?

619
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,100
If two guys aren't clingy

620
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,860
in a relationship,

621
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,380
what's the point of their relationship?

622
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,260
Shall we

623
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,540
get rid of him?

624
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,100
Sansan,

625
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,540
does every man not

626
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,220
want his girlfriend

627
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
to be clingy to him?

628
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,300
Of course.

629
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,020
Some men don't want that.

630
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,500
When a man needs you,

631
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,100
you must turn up immediately.

632
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,420
When he doesn't need you,

633
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,140
you must go away actively.

634
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,420
Once you fail to go away in time,

635
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,300
he'll say,

636
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,420
"You've changed."

637
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,660
Stop crying. Stop.

638
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,220
Don't cry!

639
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,260
You lost a boyfriend.

640
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,380
Just find a new one,

641
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,380
okay?

642
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,380
By then,

643
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,140
Jin Shi will regret it.

644
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,780
That's right.

645
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,740
Don't be clingy to him, then.

646
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,620
What's the big deal?

647
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,380
Let's tell those bad guys.

648
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,500
If they ignore us now,

649
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,220
they won't be good enough for us later!

650
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,900
Good point.

651
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,500
Tonight,

652
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,020
let Yin Xi

653
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,020
have a good rest.

654
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,020
Tomorrow,

655
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,380
let me take you somewhere.

656
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,900
No problem.

657
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,260
Have some water.

658
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,500
Gu Wei,

659
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
shall we go have lunch together?

660
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,100
Oh, I forgot.

661
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,620
Your girlfriend will
bring you lunch, right?

662
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,500
I won't wait for you.

663
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,380
I'll go have lunch.

664
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,540
(Will you bring lunch to me today?)

665
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,020
Does he take me as his maid?

666
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,260
(I'm busy. Have lunch in the canteen.)

667
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,540
Dr. Gu,

668
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,140
the patient of Bed No. 21 asked
to see you.

669
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,660
Go.

670
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,500
Here we are.

671
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,900
Sansan,

672
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:30,900
isn't this skirt

673
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,500
too short?

674
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,220
Don't be scared.

675
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,420
You look great in it.

676
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,780
You look exactly like me

677
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,540
when I came here for the first time,

678
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,260
right?

679
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,500
Look at Zhixiao.

680
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,260
She's doing fine here.

681
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,100
Go.

682
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,780
Go.

683
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,140
Give me your phone.

684
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,020
Why?

685
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,780
Why do we keep

686
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,740
an ex-boyfriend?

687
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,860
Because we can piss him off.

688
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,620
Let's take a photo.

689
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,620
Of me?

690
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,500
Yeah.

691
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,660
Make her legs look longer.

692
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,980
I will.

693
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,860
Down. Down.

694
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:01,980
All right.

695
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,780
Do I look good?

696
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,260
- Look.
- Not bad.

697
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,500
Beautify the photo.

698
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,860
She looks gorgeous, doesn't she?

699
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,620
Good. Good.

700
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,660
Let me post it in Moments.

701
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,780
Do I really look good?

702
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,620
I'm enjoying myself in the pub.

703
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,500
Here we go.

704
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,140
Go.

705
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,380
Wait for me.

706
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,620
I quit. Boring.

707
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,100
Continue.

708
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,100
Are you really not

709
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,380
going to call your girlfriend?

710
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,660
She's a girl, anyway.

711
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,900
Maybe she's waiting

712
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,100
until you apologize to her.

713
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,540
I'm not calling her.

714
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,860
Why do I have to call her first
every time?

715
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,860
She isn't angry alone.

716
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,140
I'm angry, too.

717
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,020
Are you all right, Yin Xi?

718
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,740
What's wrong?

719
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,380
It's been two days.

720
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,740
I broke up with him

721
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,260
two days ago.

722
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,780
He hasn't even texted me back.

723
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,380
What's the point of posting in Moments?

724
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,980
He doesn't care about me at all.

725
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,100
He never cares.

726
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,380
I think...

727
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,900
I think he wanted to break up

728
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,660
a long time ago.

729
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,260
Don't cry, Yin Xi.

730
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,980
I've been with him for so many years

731
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,220
and I don't feel secure.

732
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,020
I just want him to stay with me

733
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,780
and keep telling me he loves me.

734
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,020
Am I doing it wrong?

735
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,100
No.

736
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,500
He posted in Moments

737
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,260
for PDA.

738
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,540
I knew

739
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,900
he didn't share them with some contacts.

740
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,100
He doesn't love me at all.

741
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,300
He even thinks I'm too clingy!

742
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,300
He must be living

743
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,260
a very happy life now!

744
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,260
He's free, at last!

745
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,900
Yin Xi,

746
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,220
don't be sad, okay?

747
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,020
Yin Xi.

748
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,660
Stop crying!

749
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,500
Pretend you just wasted so many years.

750
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,620
Give me your phone.

751
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,900
I'm calling him right away.

752
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,260
And I'll curse him!

753
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,540
Hello? Jin Shi.

754
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
What wrong has Yin Xi done?

755
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,500
Why did you do that to her?

756
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,740
I'm quite wrong about you!

757
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,140
Sansan?

758
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,780
You know?

759
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,500
Don't call me Sansan.

760
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,260
Why do you think you can call me that?

761
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,220
Do I even know you?

762
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:06,860
Who are you?

763
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,220
Zhixiao, your turn.

764
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,860
Jin Shi!

765
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,140
Why can you say

766
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,740
that Yin Xi is clingy?

767
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,620
She isn't clingy.

768
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,780
You... You know what?

769
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,380
Men like you think

770
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,660
girls are clingy, right?

771
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,620
You deserve to be single.

772
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,380
Right.

773
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,860
You'll be single until you're 80.

774
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,660
No girls will be with you.

775
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,740
Bad guy!

776
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,900
Yin Xi!

777
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,780
I'm telling you.

778
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,260
Nothing makes you irreplaceable.

779
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
Without you,

780
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,540
I'm living quite a happy life now!

781
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,740
Xi...

782
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,500
Who are you?

783
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,220
Didn't I tell you?

784
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,020
We broke up!

785
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,620
You can't interfere with me anymore!

786
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,380
She's right!

787
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,500
See you.

788
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,380
See you.

789
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,300
See you.

790
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,020
Does it feel good?

791
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,780
Yes!

792
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,780
What's wrong?

793
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,380
I'm going back to my dorm.

794
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,140
Cheers.

795
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,020
Who's calling?

796
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,380
Hello?

797
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,660
Hello?

798
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,380
Lin Zhixiao, are you in a pub?

799
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,620
Who's that?

800
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,300
See you!

801
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,220
It hit my eye.

802
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,660
It hurts.

803
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,860
I'm sorry, Babe.

804
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,380
It's okay. It's okay.

805
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,900
(Sorry, the subscriber you dialed)

806
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,220
(is busy.)

807
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,500
(Please redial later.)

808
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,230
(Sorry...)

809
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,860
Hello? Wei.

810
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,420
Hello?

811
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,740
Do you know what pubs

812
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,740
Xiao Shan usually visits?

813
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,380
She's in the pub again?

814
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,660
I know.

815
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,780
But why are you asking about Sansan?

816
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,220
Are you looking for Lin Zhixiao?

817
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,780
I'm just asking.

818
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,740
Tell me quickly.

819
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,140
Yin Xi.

820
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,780
Go dance with me. Go!

821
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,900
Let's dance. Go.

822
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,140
Go ahead, Pikachu.

823
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,380
- Let me introduce some cool guys to you.
- Come with us.

824
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,660
- Go.
- Come with us.

825
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,380
Wait here.

826
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,260
Come on!

827
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,100
(Yin Xi)

828
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,700
(Xi, it's 11:00 PM. Come back early...)

829
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:10,300
(Yin Xi)
(Xi, it's 11:00 PM. Come back early...)

830
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,540
(Idiot)

831
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,700
(Idiot)

832
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,100
(Missed call)

833
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,780
Let's get hyper!

834
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:48,900
Who are you?

835
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,780
What's up?

836
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,500
Beauty, are you alone?

837
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,380
No. I'm here with my friends.

838
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,780
They're dancing over there.

839
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,420
Do you have anything to tell me?

840
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,100
Of course.

841
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,260
What?

842
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,260
Try to accost me?

843
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,900
You're so straightforward?

844
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,300
Exactly.

845
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,980
You're right about it.

846
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,380
I have a boyfriend.

847
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,900
Stay... Stay away from me.

848
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,740
Thank you.

849
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,620
Where's your boyfriend, then?

850
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,900
You're such a lovely girl.

851
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,140
Doesn't he worry about it?

852
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,020
Why would he worry?

853
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,140
He's a man.

854
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,620
He wants freedom

855
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,860
and private space.

856
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,260
I'll give it to him, then.

857
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,100
I'll give him enough private space.

858
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,300
Sounds like

859
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,380
you quarreled with your boyfriend,

860
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,620
right?

861
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,780
Why would we quarrel?

862
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,980
We didn't.

863
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,780
Who does he think he is?

864
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,340
He always pulls a long face,

865
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,820
just like my father.

866
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,340
He's 30 years old.

867
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,340
Without me, he would still be single.

868
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,220
I helped him out.

869
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,100
Or he would be lonely

870
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,660
all his life!

871
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,220

872
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,300
What do you want?

873
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,820
It's yours, right?

874
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,500
Yes.

875
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,580
What are you doing?

876
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,060
I'm not leaving. I'm not.

877
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,380
I'm not leaving.

878
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,020
Lin came to catch me.

879
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,820
So did you, huh?

880
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,140
I'm not going anywhere.

881
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,980
Let go of me.

882
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,260
Why are you taking off your coat?

883
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,900
What do you want to do?

884
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,060
Don't be silly, I warn you!

885
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,380
Sansan! Yin Xi!

886
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,580
Help!

887
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,060
Gu Wei is taking me back!

888
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,540
Sansan!

889
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,820
Tell girls of this booth

890
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,100
that I'm taking my girlfriend away.

891
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,820
- I'm Gu Wei.
- Sansan!

892
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,340
- Okay.
- Yin Xi!

893
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,260
Yin Xi.

894
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,580
Does it feel good?

895
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,580
Yes!

896
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,260
Are they cool?

897
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,060
Yes!

898
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,420
Are you happy?

899
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,780
Yes!

900
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,580
I'm too tired.

901
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,820
I need a rest.

902
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,580
I need it.

903
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,660
Go.

904
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,340
Where's Zhixiao?

905
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,900
Excuse me.

906
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,260
Hello, Miss.

907
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,300
Where's the girl who just sat here?

908
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,300
Your friend was

909
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,380
taken away by her boyfriend.

910
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,580
Boyfriend?

911
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,340
Yes. He said he was Gu Wei.

912
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,140
Dr. Gu.

913
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,260
- Fine.
- Fine.

914
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,980
Thank you.

915
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,060
Sansan, I feel much better now.

916
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,260
Thank you.

917
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,100
Don't bother to say thank you.

918
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,540
Seriously,

919
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,980
do you like

920
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,100
any of those cool guys?

921
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,740
I came to give full vent to my sorrow.

922
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,500
I didn't really come here

923
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,060
to find a new boy.

924
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,220
Okay. Let's go back home.

925
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,820
I'll make something to eat for you.

926
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,380
Okay. Go.

927
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,300
Let me take my bag.

928
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,980
We're going home.

929
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,580
Stop.

930
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:44,820
I'll get off.

931
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,620
I'm going back for more fun.

932
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,980
Look what time it is now.

933
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
Haven't you had enough fun?

934
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,340
I don't allow you

935
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:49,980
to visit a pub anymore.

936
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,220
Why do you restrain me?

937
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,740
Like you said,

938
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,300
you hate a clingy girlfriend most.

939
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,420
Even a couple

940
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,580
should have their own private space.

941
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,580
I think you made a good point.

942
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,220
I give you some private space.

943
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,660
Shouldn't you also give me

944
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,780
some private space, too?

945
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,740
This is what you're angry at?

946
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,860
I'm not angry.

947
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,140
You got me wrong.

948
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,060
I didn't mean that.

949
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,060
I didn't get you wrong.

950
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,380
You made your point

951
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,060
crystal clear to me.

952
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:20,860
Let me explain...

953
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,980
Don't bother to explain.

954
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,980
There's a big gap

955
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,340
between our lives.

956
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:24,820
Young guys like me

957
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,780
like the wine

958
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,420
and disco dance.

959
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,060
It's none of your business,

960
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,780
I don't want you to interfere, either.

961
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,740
But don't worry.

962
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,580
I won't be clingy to you.

963
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,140
I'll give you enough private space

964
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,260
in case you dislike me sooner or later.

965
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,220
Zhixiao, I really don't mean that.

966
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,420
Stop the car.

967
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,540
Why?

968
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,300
Stop.

969
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,220
I'll walk home.

970
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,020
We're arriving soon.

971
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,300
I said, I'll walk home

972
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,340
in case I annoy you.

973
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,620
Zhixiao, I really didn't

974
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,580
mean that.

975
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,340
Unlock the door.

976
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,260
Unlock the door.

977
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:21,980
We're home.

978
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,380

979
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,420

980
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,820
Go. Let's go home.

982
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,420

00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:04,900
I'll be right there.

987
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,580
Okay.

988
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,060
Be careful.

989
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,340

00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,060

I've been a little bit busy these days.

992

I'll go to the cafe tomorrow.

993

for the first time?

997
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,540
I said I love you,

998
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,820
and it scared you like this?

999
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,380
I didn't hear it for the first time.

Why do you always communicate

1040
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,600
through me?

1041
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,240
Hurry.

1042
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,920
I'm wanted?

1043
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,920
Hello?

1044
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:02,840
Whenever you want to talk to me,

1045
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,680
you must be up to something.

1046
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,000
What did you do to Zhixiao?

1047
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,040
Xiao Shan,

1048
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,080
could you do me a favor?

1049
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,680
Why must I help you?

1050
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,640
Don't say that.

1051
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,000
You're his cousin-in-law, after all.

1052
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Who's his cousin-in-law?

1053
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,120
Xiao Shan,

1054
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,600
I want to surprise Zhixiao.

1055
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,400
=The Oath of Love=
Let me ask you.

1056
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,000
=The Oath of Love=
You said I played the cello so badly

1057
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,960
(Lin & Gu’s Sweet Little Theatre)
that it affected your sleep that day,

1058
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,040
(Lin & Gu’s Sweet Little Theatre)
was it true?

1059
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,320
You mean Shao Jiang?

1060
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,320
I also think he was terrible
at playing the cello.

1061
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,320
I’m talking about me.

1062
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,200
It was the day

1063
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,880
when I said you lacked empathy

1064
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,400
and your family was indifferent.

1065
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:43,920
What do you mean?

1066
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,640
What do you mean what I mean?

1067
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,840
I’m sure you remember it, am I right?

1068
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,520
You said I was terrible
at playing the cello,

1069
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,720
did you mean it?

1070
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,840
Wait a minute.

1071
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,360
Zhixiao.

1072
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,320
Did you mean
what you said the other day?

1073
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:54,920
Yes, yes.

1074
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,720
I meant it. I meant it.

1075
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,520
I’m going to play the cello

1076
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,760
and drive you crazy.

1077
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:02,760
Fine.

1078
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,960
I wish you and Shao Jiang
a long life together.

1079
