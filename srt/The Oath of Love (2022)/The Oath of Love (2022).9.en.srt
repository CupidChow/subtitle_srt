You're early, Dr. Gu.

19
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:44,500
(You have a new email)

20
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:49,075
(Mail received)

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,279
Hello, Dr. Gu.

22
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,550
I'm calling to tell you

23
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,800
I got the email.

24
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,075
Um, good.

25
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:02,675
Have a good rest and get some sleep.

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,080
How can I sleep?

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,525
I have to practice...

28
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,700
Yeah.

29
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,800
I'm getting ready for bed.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,520
Thank you, I appreciate your concern.

31
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:12,440
Wait a minute.

32
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,360
It just occurred to me

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,199
that I haven't

34
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,100
told you my requests

35
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,279
after I read your email, right?

36
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:20,039
I need you to categorize

37
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,839
these 100 houses

38
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:24,675
by region and the distance
to the hospital,

39
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:26,250
and then by rent,

40
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,250
and the class of the house.

41
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,399
Send it to my email when you're done.

42
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,080
Thank you.

43
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,200
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,720
Say it again.

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,559
What's the matter?

46
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:36,039
Is there anything wrong?

47
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,199
If I remember it correctly,

48
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,525
you agreed

49
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,000
to pay the debt with labor.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,425
I thought...

51
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:43,450
But that's okay.

52
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,080
If you don't want to do it,

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,300
I would never force you.

54
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,951
How could I?

55
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,080
You're my creditor.

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,119
I'll try my best

57
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,559
to do whatever you ask me to do.

58
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,825
Don't worry, Dr. Gu.

59
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,930
I'll get it done.

60
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,625
Um.

61
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,350
Goodbye.

62
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,839
What a cruel exploiter!

63
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,679
You have no humanity!

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,650
I'll face it with a smile.

65
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:19,450
(Apartments to let)

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,000
Wei.

67
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,450
Why are you so happy?

68
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,850
Nothing.

69
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,559
A little cat just fluffed up.

70
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,650
I've never seen you
petting a cat before.

71
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,850
Whose cat?

72
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
I'm asking

73
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,520
what you want for breakfast.

74
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,850
I'll get you the same old thing?

75
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,375
A coke, thank you.

76
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,325
You can buy whatever else you want.

77
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,775
Don't you drink soy milk in the morning?

78
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,800
Wei.

79
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,500
Good for you.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,425
Why are you so talkative today?

81
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:51,265
Hurry.

82
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,275
Leave it to me.

83
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,275
(Mail sent)

84
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,525
Done.

85
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,850
Hello, Dr. Gu.

86
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,320
I've sent the information to you

87
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,200
as you asked.

88
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,600
Any other instructions?

89
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,125
No.

90
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,045
You did a good job.

91
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,200
I've read it.

92
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,760
It's great.

93
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,000
Can I go to bed now?

94
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:51,559
Of course.

95
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:54,279
But you found these houses for me,

96
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,320
I think I'll need you
to see the houses with me.

97
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,825
A normal person

98
00:04:57,825 --> 00:04:59,185
sleeps for eight hours a day.

99
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,920
I'll see you eight hours later.

100
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,279
You just said

101
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,925
it's for a normal person.

102
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,880
I've been up all day and all night.

103
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,450
Am I still a normal person?

104
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,425
Sorry

105
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,961
that I disturbed your rest.

106
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:13,850
Go to sleep.

107
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,279
Don't worry about the houses.

108
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,799
I'll find a place.

109
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,650
It's a little late, though.

110
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm afraid I can't see the houses.

111
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,275
Wait, wait.

112
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:24,650
That's not what I meant.

113
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,490
I mean,

114
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,150
at least you should give me

115
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,275
ten hours,

116
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,000
twelve hours,

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,320
fourteen hours.

118
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,125
Fourteen hours?

119
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,239
As a grownup, you sleep like a baby.

120
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,075
Your brain develops late.

121
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,750
Sleep eludes old people like you.

122
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,850
Don't envy us young people.

123
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,609
Okay?

124
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:48,600
You're not going
to sleep for eight hours

125
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,875
and practice the cello
for six hours, are you?

126
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,825
What are you saying?

127
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:55,096
How is that possible?

128
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,700
Good.

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,880
See you tomorrow morning.

130
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,825
See you tomorrow.

131
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,175
Dr. Gu, what's the matter?

132
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:56,125
Dr. Gu.

133
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,425
You are so early.

134
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,000
Get in the car.

135
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,150
Okay.

136
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,475
Thank you.

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,825
Sorry.

138
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,700
Something came up today.

139
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,950
I moved up the appointment.

140
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,950
Dr. Gu, it's only...

141
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,720
Let's go to see the house.

142
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,550
I'll pick you up.

143
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,975
What time is it?

144
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm going to kill you.

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,725
I'm going to kill you!

146
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:38,166
Does he still have humanity?

147
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,775
No way, Dr. Gu.

148
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,015
Do you have a change of the heart?

149
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:51,559
We're going to see
several apartments today.

150
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:53,525
You need to replenish your energy.

151
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,725
How do you know I like this?

152
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,475
Do you feel very sorry

153
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:02,440
for torturing me

154
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,575
relentlessly

155
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:04,654
and want to apologize to me?

156
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:06,400
If you want to apologize to me,

157
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,650
just go ahead and do it.

158
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,725
I appreciate your hard work these days.

159
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:11,950
Thank you.

160
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,550
What about the apology?

161
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,325
Thank you.

162
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,575
You're welcome.

163
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,575
Soybean milk.

164
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,300
That's very thoughtful of you.

165
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,799
Fasten your seat belt.

166
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,800
Get ready to go.

167
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:57,150
- Miss Lin, check out this apartment.
- Dr. Gu.

168
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,150
I've done the research.

169
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,250
It's only a ten-minute walk

170
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,771
from your hospital.

171
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:03,075
There are

172
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,354
all kinds of amenities here.

173
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,525
Most importantly,

174
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,840
this is a school district house,

175
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,250
and there's a municipal

176
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,411
key middle school nearby.

177
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,225
Look.

178
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:13,359
The vibe, and the environment.

179
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,600
Doesn't it smell like knowledge?

180
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,275
You're an expert, Miss Lin.

181
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,700
You're not an undercover
from our rivals, are you?

182
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,225
I think you watched too many TV shows.

183
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:23,270
This way.

184
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,475
I think the orientation
of this room is great.

185
00:09:25,475 --> 00:09:26,634
It could be your bedroom,

186
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:29,025
and it's big.

187
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,025
This way.

188
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,280
Look at the pink wallpaper.

189
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,175
It's okay. Here's the big one.

190
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:35,696
That's the bathroom.

191
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,000
This way, Dr. Gu.

192
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,575
Isn't it really big?

193
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:40,825
There's plenty of room.

194
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,425
Lin Zhixiao.

195
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,600
You did a good job.

196
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,025
It's okay.

197
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,050
How is it?

198
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,700
Do you like it?

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,050
Is it good?

200
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,325
What do you think?

201
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,960
I don't like

202
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,900
the structure of the house.

203
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,599
The light and the ventilation
are mediocre.

204
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,875
It will grow bacteria easily.

205
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,575
Take out your hands.

206
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,119
You don't like it?

207
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,400
It's fine if you don't like it.

208
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,119
There is still another one.

209
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:16,320
Let's go to the next house.

210
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,919
This way.

211
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,575
After you, Dr. Gu.

212
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,050
I'm sure you will like the next one.

213
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,575
I got it. I got it.

214
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,000
That's right. This is the one.

215
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,150
Dr. Gu.

216
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,640
What do you think of this house?

217
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,760
It's spacious,

218
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,350
and the orientation is good.

219
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:32,175
The two bedrooms are airy.

220
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,905
It won't be stuffy when you sleep.

221
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,000
Although it's small,
it's fully equipped.

222
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,925
Isn't it great?

223
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,799
Take a closer look and feel it.

224
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,050
If you think it's good,

225
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,211
let's just rent this one.

226
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,300
(House for rent Upper East 4,000 yuan/month)
How about we rent this house?

227
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:54,156
Then I can go home and practice...

228
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,359
Sleep.

229
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:58,850
I can go home and sleep.

230
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,100
Why are you looking at me like that?

231
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,400
I don't have flowers on my face.

232
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,560
Hello, your takeaway.

233
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,000
Lin Zhixiao.

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,600
Um.

235
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,000
It's 3:00 PM now.

236
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,119
Yeah.

237
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:17,150
The guy next door ordered takeaway
at 3:00 PM,

238
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,325
which means he must have

239
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:19,425
stayed up late last night

240
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:20,505
and he just got up.

241
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,280
Such people tend
to have irregular schedules.

242
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,119
Plus the poor sound insulation,

243
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,250
it will disturb my rest.

244
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,750
So...

245
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,150
What do you want?

246
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,479
No.

247
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,350
Okay.

248
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,225
Lin Zhixiao!

249
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:43,825
Lin Zhixiao!

250
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,679
What do you want, Dr. Gu?

251
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,725
Since the day before yesterday,

252
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:52,225
you've bossing me around,

253
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:52,919
right?

254
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:55,039
My time isn't as valuable as yours?

255
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,450
Are you done?

256
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:58,850
Yes.

257
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:00,550
I did it on purpose.

258
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,000
Is there a problem with your brain?

259
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,025
If you rest more

260
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:05,080
and stop practicing the cello,

261
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,650
I'll find a house on my own right away,

262
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,530
and I won't bother you.

263
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,525
You promised me you'd
follow the doctor's advice.

264
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,850
It's gonna be hard to recover your hands

265
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,249
if you keep practicing
the cello these days.

266
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,475
You have no idea how I feel.

267
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,840
I'm already way behind the others.

268
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,375
I'm trying to catch up.

269
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,575
I want to be responsible for myself.

270
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:26,700
What's wrong with that?

271
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,075
Haste makes waste.

272
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,559
If you keep practicing

273
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,175
and something goes wrong
with your hands,

274
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
that would be irresponsible of you.

275
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,025
A musician's hands are precious.

276
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,525
I hope you can cherish them.

277
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,400
I'm a fan, after all.

278
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,250
Let's go to see the next house.

279
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,600
This way, please.

280
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,800
Dr. Gu, please.

281
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,275
There is more in there.

282
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,750
It's not bad, right?

283
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,025
There is another room.

284
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,550
This is the toilet.

285
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,750
How is it?

286
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,640
Take a look.

287
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,320
There is no problem

288
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,520
with the light,

289
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,080
the ventilation,
and the sound insulation.

290
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,100
Well,

291
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,599
don't be in a hurry to say no.

292
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:15,900
Think about it.

293
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,520
This is the last one.

294
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,025
It's really the last one.

295
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,100
I...

296
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,475
I won't rush you.

297
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,310
This is a nice house,

298
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,550
right, Mr. Agent?

299
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,800
I like it.

300
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,799
Look.

301
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,039
What a wide view.

302
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,525
There's a little lake down there.

303
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,075
What do you think, Dr. Gu?

304
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:41,086
Do you like it?

305
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,725
I'll rent this one.

306
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:50,039
Thank you! Thank you!

307
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,700
You're blessed with life-long peace!

308
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,301
But I don't want the furniture.

309
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,960
What do you mean?

310
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,919
Don't be nervous.

311
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,799
It's used furniture.

312
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:58,840
I'm not used to it.

313
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,175
You scared me.

314
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,650
Dr. Gu, I think people like you

315
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,250
should live in a vacuum.

316
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
Normal people like me

317
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,719
can't live with you.

318
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:08,599
But that doesn't matter.

319
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,640
As long as you're happy.

320
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:13,075
How much is the rent for this house?

321
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,350
The best houses around
are in this neighborhood.

322
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,951
The rent is affordable.

323
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,159
6,000 yuan a month.

324
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,119
Rent should be paid for three months,
with a deposit of one month,

325
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,750
and the agency fee of one-month rent.

326
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,175
That's expensive.

327
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:25,576
Can you reduce the price?

328
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,559
Miss Lin.

329
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,200
This is the rock-bottom price.

330
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,345
You've seen the house.

331
00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:31,425
The house type is great.

332
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:32,985
Housing is also in short supply.

333
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,159
We already have a lot of appointments

334
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,225
to see this house on 58.com.

335
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,325
Well, Dr. Gu.

336
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:40,275
Why don't you go downstairs

337
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:41,570
and take a look at the environment?

338
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:42,800
I need to talk

339
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,839
with Mr. Agent.

340
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,275
Go ahead.

341
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,700
Take your time. Look around.

342
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,625
Well...

343
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,100
- Come on, take a seat.
- You're too kind.

344
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,231
Don't feel constrained.

345
00:16:58,231 --> 00:16:59,350
Make yourself at home.

346
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,231
Have a seat.

347
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,200
To be honest,

348
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,375
that good-looking man

349
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,016
is actually my boyfriend.

350
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,325
Your boyfriend?

351
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes.

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,575
Didn't you just call him Dr. Gu?

353
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,239
It's a nickname.

354
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,850
It's what we young people do.

355
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,319
He is my boyfriend,

356
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,250
and he is a doctor.

357
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,599
You have no idea

358
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,040
how hard it is to be a doctor.

359
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,479
The job is hard and tiring,

360
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,375
and the salary is low.

361
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,735
Now he is with me,

362
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,050
he has to support me and his family.

363
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,569
There is no money left.

364
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,975
Can you do us a favor

365
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:34,455
and reduce the price?

366
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,100
Wait.

367
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,200
Didn't your boyfriend
just agree to rent the house?

368
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,125
Why are you saying this to me
when he is not around?

369
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,439
He's a proud man.

370
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:44,600
I can't say this in front of him.

371
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,650
In fact, he's already
spent all his money.

372
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,920
He has no money left.

373
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,475
He can't even afford his food.

374
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:51,325
He only drinks some glucose

375
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:52,845
in the hospital to get by.

376
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,700
It has been really hard for him.

377
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,700
Miss Lin, please don't make jokes.

378
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,100
I've seen all kinds of clients

379
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,339
after so many years in this job.

380
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,425
The watch on your boyfriend's wrist

381
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,599
is not cheap.

382
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,400
It's a fake.

383
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:07,575
A-grade replica.

384
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,719
Think about it.

385
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,359
If he doesn't dress well,

386
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,825
my parents will look down on him.

387
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,359
We're getting married soon.

388
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,700
He always wants
to give me the best life.

389
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,659
He has sacrificed a lot.

390
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:20,125
I can't bear

391
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,825
to let him sacrifice more for me.

392
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:23,950
If that's the case,

393
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,250
your boyfriend is an affectionate man.

394
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,520
Of course.

395
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,425
He's the best man in the world.

396
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:31,106
He is really good to me.

397
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,150
Just help us.

398
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,700
See if you can reduce the price,

399
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,575
okay?

400
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,040
Miss Lin, you're...

401
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,700
You're making it difficult for me.

402
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,175
How about this?

403
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,640
You can come to me
when you're sick next time.

404
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,700
You won't need to wait in line
for registration.

405
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,247
I'll just ask him to treat you.

406
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:47,319
Miss Lin, that's a curse on me.

407
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:47,975
No, no, no.

408
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:49,225
I didn't mean that.

409
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,479
Well, are doctors

410
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:52,400
really that poor?

411
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,680
Yes, I'm not lying.

412
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,000
It's really hard to be a doctor.

413
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,475
It's strenuous and tiring,

414
00:18:58,475 --> 00:18:59,675
and it doesn't pay well.

415
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,239
But someone has to do it.

416
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,599
He is such a person

417
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,239
who makes sacrifices for other people.

418
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,550
He is my hero.

419
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:09,879
He just said it himself

420
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:11,479
that we don't want the furniture.

421
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,675
Just reduce the price. Okay?

422
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:17,150
Well,

423
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,631
I'll call the landlord

424
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:19,270
and see

425
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:21,079
if I can make it 5,500.

426
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:21,775
Okay?

427
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,439
Thank you.

428
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:24,375
You're welcome.

429
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:28,479
Hello, ma'am.

430
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:29,900
Well, they've seen

431
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,040
the house.

432
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,100
But can we

433
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,460
give them a little discount?

434
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,439
I know.

435
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,175
They sincerely want to rent the house.

436
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,725
Can we

437
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:38,850
reduce the price a little bit?

438
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:41,725
It's not easy for them
as a young couple.

439
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,425
5,500?

440
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,475
All right, 5,500 then.

441
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:47,425
Thank you.

442
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,900
All right, thank you.

443
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,359
It's done.

444
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,150
5,500.

445
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,525
Thank you. Thank you.

446
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:56,685
You're blessed with life-long peace.

447
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,575
You're back.

448
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,475
Sir, your girlfriend
is good at bargaining.

449
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,319
Nah.

450
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,325
Let's go.

451
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:05,325
All right, Dr. Gu.

452
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:07,275
You two lovebirds

453
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:08,725
can get a double bed later on your own.

454
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,125
That's interesting.

455
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,200
Come on, Dr. Gu.

456
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:14,050
Well, we'll talk on the phone.

457
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,775
Um.

458
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,225
What's wrong?

459
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,925
Did you just pretend we were a couple?

460
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,119
How is that possible?

461
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,760
What's wrong with me?

462
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,975
Why would I pretend we were a couple?

463
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Really?

464
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,839
Yeah, Mr. Agent

465
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,175
got it wrong.

466
00:20:38,175 --> 00:20:39,359
He thought we were a couple.

467
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,925
But don't worry,
I've explained it to him.

468
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:42,350
I said we were not.

469
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,175
So I didn't buy a fake watch

470
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:47,415
in order to see your parents,

471
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:50,350
and I didn't drink glucose
in the hospital

472
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,200
because I can't afford food?

473
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,119
How could you
eavesdrop on us at the door?

474
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,175
Why did you send me out
before you said it?

475
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,450
I can tell that you're a bad liar.

476
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,570
I was afraid you couldn't pull it off.

477
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:02,360
Who said I couldn't do it?

478
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,100
I think I can.

479
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,475
Hello.

480
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,239
Hello, sorry.

481
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,500
I forgot

482
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,620
to give you the lease.

483
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,920
Just send it to my email.

484
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,975
I'll send you my email address.

485
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:23,920
Okay. Okay.

486
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,675
Okay.

487
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,300
Let's go, Dr. Gu.

488
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,718
Um.

489
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:36,250
(In-patient)

490
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,350
(Receive a new mail)

491
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:17,100
(Lease To: Gu Wei)

492
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,920
Being abroad can't stop
your public display of affection.

493
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,900
I want to block you both.

494
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,175
Sansan!

495
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:28,000
Bye, thanks.

496
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,225
Bye.

497
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:31,359
(Drop-off area)

498
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,600
Honey! I'm coming!

499
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,575
Who sent you here?

500
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,825
Dr. Gu.

501
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,640
Dr. Gu?

502
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,325
Why would he send you here?

503
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,475
He… He went to see houses,

504
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:47,275
and I went with him.

505
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:48,400
See houses?

506
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,625
He said he wants to rent a house.

507
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,500
So he asked me to go with him.

508
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,800
He wants to rent a house.

509
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,100
But why would you go with him?

510
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,150
It's because

511
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,319
I ruined his clothes when I washed them.

512
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,800
So I'm paying the debt with labor.

513
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,850
Did you wash his clothes?

514
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,439
Um.

515
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:05,011
Why would you wash his clothes?

516
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,040
It's because of the concert last time.

517
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Then...

518
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,560
He just...

519
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,200
Well done, Lin Zhixiao!

520
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,400
You've been moving fast
when I was not around.

521
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,880
Don't be ridiculous.

522
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,000
There's nothing between us.

523
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,199
I want you

524
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,650
to tell me everything,

525
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,725
and all the details later.

526
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:22,250
Don't miss any single detail.
Do you hear me?

527
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:26,075
There are so many obvious signs.

528
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,625
Don't you feel anything strange?

529
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,725
No reaction at all?

530
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,225
I do feel sorry for Dr. Gu.

531
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,675
How did he meet such a stupid

532
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:43,100
and insensitive girl like you?

533
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:44,950
Are you saying

534
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,675
that Dr. Gu likes me?

535
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:48,750
Or what?

536
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,000
Why else would he do much for you?

537
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,650
Does he have nothing else to do?

538
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,750
Surgeons are busy.

539
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,400
No way.

540
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,825
Why not?

541
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,075
You're the one who calls yourself

542
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:03,925
the most beautiful girl in the game.

543
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:05,225
Now you become a chicken.

544
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,700
Look at our Zhixiao.

545
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,740
What a gorgeous girl.

546
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,475
Why can't a doctor

547
00:24:10,475 --> 00:24:11,375
like you?

548
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,455
Does he have no feelings?

549
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
There are so many pretty girls
in the hospital,

550
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,475
and we've only known each other
for a short time.

551
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:17,625
Now he likes me?

552
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:20,525
Dear.

553
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,200
Have you heard

554
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,171
of love at first sight?

555
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,275
Time is not what matters the most.

556
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,800
The most important thing is

557
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,850
there is chemistry between you.

558
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,650
It's still impossible.

560
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,680
Lin Zhixiao!

561
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,000
You have

562
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,040
the look of a young girl

563
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,150
and the heart of a middle-aged man.

564
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,950
- Go sign the contract with me tomorrow.
- Is it Dr. Gu?

565
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,200
Give it to me!

566
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,850
Why?

567
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,449
Just do it!

568
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,250
Don't send him nonsense.

569
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,825
Xiao Shan.

570
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,280
What are you texting?

571
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,125
Sit down! Don't move!

572
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:32,605
Don't move! Sit down!

573
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,675
Done.

574
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,450
I'm sorry, Dr. Gu.

575
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,630
I have an appointment tomorrow.

576
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,900
Can we take a rain check?

577
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,550
The shy emoji!

578
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,359
You sent him the shy emoji!

579
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,325
You also sent him

580
00:25:56,325 --> 00:25:57,845
the heart-shooting emoji!

581
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,439
I'm free tomorrow!

582
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:01,350
Why did you tell him
I have an appointment?

583
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,760
Calm down.

584
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,975
I haven't sent him

585
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,750
"Dr. Gu,

586
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,000
do you have a girlfriend?"

587
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,300
If you send him anything like that,

588
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,050
I'm gonna kill you!

589
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,400
He's actually my boyfriend.

590
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,475
Your girlfriend is good at bargaining.

591
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,280
Yeah, Mr. Agent

592
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,520
thought we were a couple.

593
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,800
I can tell that you're a bad liar.

594
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,075
I was afraid you couldn't pull it off.

595
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,150
Who said I couldn't do it?

596
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,959
Don't you know how to play hard to get?

597
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,075
If you're free every time
he asks you out,

598
00:26:38,075 --> 00:26:40,116
doesn't it make you look unwanted?

599
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,825
I sent him the heart-shooting emoji,

600
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,500
so there is something

601
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,659
that would remind him of you.

602
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,125
He is calling me.

603
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:53,885
What do I do now?

604
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:56,040
Answer it.
What kind of question is that?

605
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,400
What do I say after I answer it?

606
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,839
That you're too busy
and you don't have time tomorrow.

607
00:26:58,839 --> 00:26:59,439
You're busy!

608
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:00,400
I have time!

609
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,065
You're busy!

610
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:01,825
I'm not busy!

611
00:27:01,825 --> 00:27:02,624
You're busy!

612
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:03,359
Okay.

613
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Dr. Gu, I'm busy…

614
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,825
No, Dr. Gu, hello.

615
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:07,784
I'm Lin Zhixiao.

616
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:09,875
Since you're not free tomorrow,
when do you have time?

617
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,075
I have time tomorrow.

618
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:13,375
Lin Zhixiao!

619
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,599
It was my friend
who just sent the message.

620
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,100
Sorry about that.

621
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,575
I'll treat you to a meal
after signing the contract tomorrow.

622
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,375
Treat me to a meal?

623
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:26,800
Sure, I have time tomorrow.

624
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,150
We can eat together.

625
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,275
What would you like to eat?

626
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,275
As long as it's not porridge.

627
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,100
Okay, you can decide.

628
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,800
Send me the address

629
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,000
after you choose a restaurant.

630
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,000
And also,

631
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,125
go home early and be safe.

632
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,125
See you tomorrow.

633
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,850
See you tomorrow.

00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,359

685
00:30:55,925 --> 00:30:57,975
There are so many obvious signs.

686
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,600
Don't you feel anything strange?

687
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:04,075
No reaction at all?

688
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,640
I do feel sorry

689
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,200
for Dr. Gu.

690
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:12,079
How did he meet such a stupid

691
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,725
and insensitive girl like you?

692
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,975
I didn't want to come.

693
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,425
Dr. Du gave me the key,

694
00:31:18,425 --> 00:31:19,475
so I came in.

695
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,450
This is Doctor's Lounge.

696
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,131
You're not welcome. Go out.

697
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:24,700
I really like the gift

698
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,175
you bought for me.

699
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,750
Why don't you wash an orange for me?

00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,556

You have a pronounced swollen wrist.

00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,275
I think it's because
you practiced too much.

Is there something
you want to see me about?

00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,925
I have something to ask you.

725
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:00,800
Is Gu Wei your older brother?

726
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:01,750
Ah.

727
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,725
What's the matter with him?

728
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,625
What do you mean?

729
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,275
Does he have a wife

730
00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:09,954
or a girlfriend?

731
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,425
No.

732
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,599
Has he had many relationships?

733
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:15,920
How old was he
when he had his first girlfriend?

734
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,160
Why did he break up last time?

735
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,400
What is

736
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,325
his hobby?

737
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:21,559
Are his parents easy to get along with?

738
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,839

739
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:23,625
What kind of girls does he like...?

740

Hold on, hold on.

741
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,000
When did you become

742
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,600
interested in my brother?

743
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,125
How is he better than me?

744
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,525
Your brother is a doctor.

745
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,760
According to what you said,

746
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,079
he is a great doctor.

747
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,346
He's better than you
in terms of your careers.

748
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:45,275
He works for people.

749
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:46,625
I'm a boss.

750
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:47,725
What's wrong with that?

751
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:50,000
Your brother's a doctor.

752
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:52,119
Did you get your college diploma?

753
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,760
Don't look down on me.

754
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,700
Look, the ability is what matters now

755
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,050
in society.

756
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:00,850
I...

757
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,375
What's wrong with me?

758
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,000
Your brother looks

759
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,275
less of a playboy than you do.

760
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:10,900
A playboy?

761
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,225
Do I look like

762
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:14,525
a playboy now?

763
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,350
People like me
are actually the most affectionate men.

764
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:20,000
You know what, my brother

765
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
grew up being sexually continent.

766
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,075
He still doesn't know

767
00:34:22,075 --> 00:34:23,479
how to be around a woman!

768
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,125
He is sexually continent?

769
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,725
That's great.

770
00:34:26,725 --> 00:34:28,600
Such men are scarce animals.

771
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,479
If I meet such a man,

772
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:31,150
I have to hold on to him.

773
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,425
No.

774
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,399
All right.

775
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,825
I'm just kidding.

776
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,100
I'm asking for my girlfriend.

777
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,900
I'm not interested in your brother.

778
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,475
You should have said it sooner.
You scared me.

779
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:52,650
Wait!

780
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,700
Your girlfriend?

781
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,725
What girlfriend?

782
00:34:55,725 --> 00:34:57,764
Listen, regular girls
are not good enough for my brother.

783
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,760
Who is your girlfriend?

784
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,425
What are you looking at?

(Lease Contract)

786
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,150
Hello, Aunt.

787
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,125
Do you know

788
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,885
that Gu Wei wants to rent a house?

789
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,725
Wei.

790
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:24,450
You've been acting weird lately.

791
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:26,475
You're off work today.

792
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,025
But you got up early this morning

793
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:29,450
to read books.

794
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:32,000
You're seriously sick.

795
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:35,975
So you just got up after a long sleep

796
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,000
and you still have time
to worry about me?

797
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,625
I assume you've memorized
all the books you were assigned.

798
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,560
Let me give you a random test.

799
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
Still the old rules,

800
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,040
if you make a mistake,
write it down five times.

801
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,159
No, no, Wei.

802
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,280
You took me wrong.

803
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,520
I love learning.

804
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,475
I'll go to study right now.

805
00:36:52,225 --> 00:36:52,929
Hey.

806
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,525
Lin Zhixiao!

807
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,959
Morning.

808
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,739
Lin Zhixiao.

809
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:37,414
Um.

810
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,040
Did you play video games all night

811
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,600
or sneak out to the bar?

812
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,600
If you keep being like this,

813
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,360
I'll have to restart
the work-rest schedule

814
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,520
and the curfew.

815
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:50,025
Mr. Lin.

816
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,125
Don't underestimate me.

817
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,850
I was up all night studying philosophy,

818
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,650
and thinking about the classical

819
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,170
and eternal theme of human society.

820
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,000
You don't get it. Boring.

821
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:14,425
Lin Zhixiao, have you got up?

822
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,375
Um. Good morning, Dr. Gu.

823
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,199
I think my water glass...

824
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,520
Where is my water glass?

825
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,679
Is it in my room?

826
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:28,829
I haven't had any water.

827
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,100
What's Zhixiao doing?

828
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,575
Based on my years of working experience,

829
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,925
I think Lin Zhixiao

830
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,050
is probably in puppy love.

831
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:46,725
Really?

832
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,427
Do you need me to pick you up?

833
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:55,875
It's okay.

834
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,000
I'll take the direct subway to there.
It's very convenient.

835
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,500
Put on more clothes.

836
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:05,200
The weather forecast says
it's going to rain today.

837
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:23,500
Put on more clothes.

838
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:25,350
The weather forecast says

839
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,950
it's going to rain today.

840
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,050
Do you hear me?

841
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,075
Um.

842
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,650
Okay.

843
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,975
I hate Sansan.

844
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,600
She made me feel

845
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,075
that the way Dr. Gu behaves and speaks
looks like he likes me.

846
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:47,225
What do I do?

847
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,450
How am I supposed to face him later?

848
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
Oh my God.

849
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,950
How do I become like this, Lin Zhixiao?

850
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:56,900
Oh my God.

851
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,800
Hello, Mom.

852
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,825
Did you get off work?

853
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
Come back home.

854
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,575
Your dad and I want to see you.

855
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:11,325
Oh.

856
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,050
I might have to work overtime today.

857
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
I'm really busy.

858
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,000
You know we don't have

859
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,575
a fixed timetable in the hospital.

860
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:26,675
Mom.

861
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,275
What are you doing here?

862
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:32,925
You haven't been home for days.

863
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,750
If I don't come to you,

864
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,850
am I never going to see you again?

865
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,800
I told you I'm busy.

866
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:41,975
Well,

867
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,925
are you moving out?

868
00:40:45,525 --> 00:40:46,325
Um.

869
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,950
I'm looking for a house to rent.

870
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:51,475
Aren't you going

871
00:40:51,879 --> 00:40:53,479
to discuss it

872
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:54,525
with your parents?

873
00:40:54,725 --> 00:40:56,100
Of course, I will tell you.

874
00:40:56,399 --> 00:40:57,959
I just want to do it later.

875
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,300
Later.

876
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,879
So you're going to rent the house first,

877
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:03,550
and then just inform us, right?

878
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:04,750
Gu Wei.

879
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:07,425
What's wrong with you now?

880
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:12,725
I won't argue with you here.

881
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,080
Go back with me.

882
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,080
We'll talk about it at home.

883
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
Mom.

884
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,650
Gu Wei.

885
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,425
Your dad's waiting for you at home.

886
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,600
I came to you in person,

887
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,025
and you still won't come home?

888
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,760
Let's go. Come on.

889
00:41:49,525 --> 00:41:51,350
Sorry, something came up.

890
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,625
I'll be there later.

891
00:41:57,075 --> 00:41:58,150
It's okay.

892
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,550
I'll go to see the agent first.

893
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,275
I'll be right there when I'm done.

894
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,249
OK.

895
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,399
Be careful on the road.

896
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,207
Um.

(Chengxuan Real Estate)

898
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,025
Hello!

899
00:42:49,325 --> 00:42:50,225
Miss Lin, there you are.

900
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,375
Where's your boyfriend?

901
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:54,120
Does he go to save the world again?

902
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:54,840
No, no.

903
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,400
He is in the hospital.

904
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,360
He'll be here later.

905
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,280
All right, have a seat.

906
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,959
Okay.

907
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,600
This way.

908
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,520
I'll get you a glass of water.

909
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,650
Okay, thank you very much.

910
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:11,959
Thank you.

911
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:12,700
You're welcome.

912
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,040
Should we sign it
after your boyfriend arrives,

913
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,900
or...?

914
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:17,479
Let's wait for him.

915
00:43:17,479 --> 00:43:18,719
Okay, I'll go to work first.

916
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:19,700
Okay.

917
00:43:25,425 --> 00:43:26,280
Sit down.

918
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,150
You rarely go back home once.

919
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,200
No matter how urgent other things are,

920
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:33,600
just put them away first.

921
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:36,239
It's been a long time

922
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,925
since we had tea together last time.

923
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:41,825
It's from my friend's tea house.

924
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,475
They said it tastes good.

925
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:45,110
Have a try.

926
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,575
It's good, Dad.

927
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,275
Is anything wrong, Dr. Gu?

928
00:44:22,275 --> 00:44:23,363
Are you almost there?

929
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:29,800
The number you dialed

930
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,450
cannot be connected for the moment.

931
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:38,425
It won't take long.

932
00:44:45,925 --> 00:44:48,425
=The Oath of Love=
You said practicing hurts my wrist.

933
00:44:48,575 --> 00:44:50,400
=The Oath of Love=
You asked me to find houses for you,

934
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,363
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
but clicking a mouse also hurts my wrist.

935
00:44:52,363 --> 00:44:53,275
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
Have you thought about that?

936
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:55,053
You're using different muscle groups.

937
00:44:55,053 --> 00:44:56,650
It's kind of a way to relax.

938
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,175
What about staying up late?

939
00:44:58,275 --> 00:45:00,275
What if I die suddenly
from staying up late?

940
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,425
I didn't know
it would take you that long.

941
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:03,800
Dude, it's 100 houses.

942
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,200
You asked me to find you 100 houses.

943
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,825
Or course, it would take me all night.

944
00:45:07,275 --> 00:45:08,625
Actually, I thought about it.

945
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,625
You could have written a simple program

946
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,025
using algorithm.

947
00:45:12,525 --> 00:45:14,900
You can do it as long as you pass
the Computer Level 2 Examination.

948
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,225
I did the math.

949
00:45:16,225 --> 00:45:17,650
If you did it this way,

950
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:18,850
you could go to bed

951
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:19,775
before midnight.

952
00:45:19,775 --> 00:45:21,150
I didn't realize...

953
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,325
You didn't realize the size
of our brains are different.

954
00:45:24,275 --> 00:45:25,225
Sorry to bother you.

955
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:26,050
I didn't mean that.

956
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,075
No interviews.

957
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,300
Don't be mad at me.

958
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,864
I'm a superstar. No interviews.

959
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,775
Go to see Gao Xi.
