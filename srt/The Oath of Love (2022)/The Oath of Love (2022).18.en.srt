You're back.

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,950
Yeah.

20
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,650
Have you heard from Gao?

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,570
What?

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,600
Xi took a few days off suddenly.

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,370
It sounded like

24
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,220
Gu Wei has something to do with it.

25
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,750
Really?

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,250
I'll call Xi and ask her.

27
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,160
Dr. Gu, the director asked you
to come over

28
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,900
and discuss the operation plan
for tomorrow.

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,050
(Salut d'Amour)

30
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,150
(Boyfriend)

31
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,670
(Boyfriend)

32
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,400
I think

33
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,190
the later part is a little weak.

34
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,390
Is it because there are too many parts
in the original music

35
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,870
and we reduced them?

36
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,450
Yes.

37
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,020
To solve this problem,

38
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,390
we can change the rhythm

39
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,520
of this passage a little bit.

40
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,800
But in that case,

41
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,080
your part will become harder to play.

42
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,830
It's okay, Shao Jiang.

43
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,920
I can practice hard,

44
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,520
as long as it comes off well.

45
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,670
Well, let's give it a try.

46
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,350
Okay.

47
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,100
Let's do it.

48
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,320
I'm really tired.

49
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,270
Yeah, we've been practicing all day.

50
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,520
Let's call it a day.

51
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,040
Okay, thank you, Shao Jiang.

52
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,900
No problem.

53
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,550
I'll go pack my things.

54
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,480
I'll pack my things, too.

55
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,220
Okay.

56
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,900
(Gu Wei Eight missed calls)

57
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,420
Hello.

58
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,270
Hello.

59
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,670
I just finished the cello practice.

60
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,000
I didn't see your calls earlier.

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,880
What's the matter?

62
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,160
It's late and you just finished?

63
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,670
Yeah, I've been
playing the cello all day.

64
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,950
My arms

65
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,550
and my legs are sore.

66
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,480
Don't worry.

67
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,830
I'm taking a cab home now.

68
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,920
You've been working hard.

69
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,000
By the way,

70
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,390
be sure to massage your wrists
when you get home

71
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,040
to prevent tenosynovitis recurrence.

72
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,920
I see.

73
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,880
It's mainly because

74
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,670
we changed the arrangement several times

75
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,620
and there were a lot of things to do.

76
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,350
You called me many times.

77
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,510
Is there anything wrong?

78
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,970
Nothing.

79
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,000
Zhixiao.

80
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,950
Let's have dinner tomorrow.

81
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,870
Tomorrow...

82
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,920
But our teacher

83
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,790
wants to see

84
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,270
how we are doing so far.

85
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,070
I don't know the exact time.

86
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,750
It's okay.

87
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,920
I'm not on duty tomorrow anyway.

88
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,800
I'll be at home after 7:00 PM,

89
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,720
waiting for you.

90
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,520
Okay.

91
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,050
Bye-bye.

92
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,770
Mm.

93
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,300
Rest early.

94
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,900
(In-patient)

95
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,760
Hello, Mom.

96
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,700
Gu Wei, where are you?

97
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,370
I'm going home from work.
What's the matter?

98
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,880
There is something.

99
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,760
The daughter of a friend of mine

100
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,040
got chronic gastritis

101
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,950
and wants to seek advice from an expert.

102
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,510
Can you meet her tomorrow?

103
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,470
I see.

104
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,870
We'll talk later.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,820
Bye-bye.

106
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,350
I'm her neighbor.

107
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,070
Hi, nice to meet you.

108
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,220
I'm Lin Zhixiao's senior,
Shao Jiang.

109
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,480
It's been a long time.

110
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
It's really you, Jiang!

111
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,600
When did you get back?

112
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,350
That's why you're my favorite.

113
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,470
I couldn't be happier

114
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,270
if you were my son.

115
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,230
How about this?

116
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,750
Be my son-in-law.

117
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,710
I'm sure you're familiar
with Shao Jiang.

118
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,880
Shao Jiang is not only

119
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,590
Zhixiao's childhood sweetheart,

120
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:50,270
he is also the reason
why Zhixiao studies the cello.

121
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,270
As long as you're not married,

122
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,840
I still have a chance.

123
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,970
Probably Dr. Gu

124
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,410
thinks I'm uncompetitive.

125
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,020
But you saw it,

126
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,450
the memories and habits we have

127
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,050
can't be replaced.

128
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,150
You're so many years apart,

129
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,320
but I'm at her age.

130
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,570
(The subscriber you dialed
is power off.)

131
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,600
(Please redial later.)

132
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,000
Be quiet. Be quiet.

133
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,750
Give it to me.

134
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,670
Don't let Mr. Lin find out.

135
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,080
I have to hurry back later,

136
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,320
lest Mr. Lin should get worried.

137
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,550
Sorry, sorry.

138
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,400
Well,

139
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,640
I had finished early today,

140
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,110
but the teacher kept me and Shao Jiang

141
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,960
and said

142
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,840
we needed more practice.

143
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,500
So I stayed there until now.

144
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,440
My phone is dead.

145
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
It's true. Look.

146
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,880
That's why I couldn't contact you.

147
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,100
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,620
You must haven't eaten.

149
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,320
I packed up some soup for you.

150
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,220
Go have some.

151
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,080
I know you are the best.

152
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,170
Can you also bring me
a portable charger?

153
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,970
Go inside.

154
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,690
Okay.

155
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,220
I'll get you a portable charger.

156
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,320
It looks delicious.

157
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,400
Let me do it today.

158
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,230
Give me a chance to make it up to you.

159
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,020
Okay?

160
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,000
Hold on.

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,850
What's the matter?

162
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,870
I'm clean now.

163
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,480
Mm.

164
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,700
The soup smells so good.

165
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,150
Let me give you the soup you bought.

166
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,750
This is for you.

167
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,250
Mm.

168
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,070
Portable charger.

169
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,820
Thank you.

170
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,030
It's so delicious.

171
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,720
Is it good?

172
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,870
Mm, you should have more.

173
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:14,920
Is it Shao Jiang?

174
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,670
Mm.

175
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,710
He said I left in a hurry today,

176
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,420
and he didn't get a chance to tell me

177
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,000
they went to the jazz bar

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,700
yesterday.

179
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,070
He said his friends missed me

180
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,550
and asked me when we can eat together.

181
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,420
Is it the same group of people
who were with you last time?

182
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,400
Yeah, they're really nice.

183
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,350
I'll introduce them to you next time.

184
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,970
I really like them.

185
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,650
I'm glad you're happy.

186
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,550
Forget the Vietnamese food.

187
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,080
Shao Jiang

188
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,770
can't even stand mint toothpaste.

189
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,420
What's wrong?

190
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,350
Zhixiao, you know what,

191
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,500
I don't eat coriander.

192
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,640
I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

193
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,800
I forgot it.

194
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,800
Do you need me

195
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,910
to pick out the coriander for you?

196
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,590
No need.

197
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,970
Just let it be.

198
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,620
Don't you have to practice
all day tomorrow?

199
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,970
- Mm.
- Mm.

200
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,100
Not only tomorrow,
but also the day after tomorrow,

201
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,500
and the day after that,

202
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
and the day after that.

203
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,770
Shao Jiang and I have to keep practicing

204
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,700
until the last second
of the performance.

205
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,470
The soup is a little cold.
I'll heat it up.

206
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,400
Do you want me to heat yours too?

207
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,000
It's okay. I can eat it.

208
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,720
Dr. Gu.

209
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,280
Mm?

210
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,100
Are you jealous?

211
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,620
Jealous?

212
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,710
Who am I jealous of?

213
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,960
Shao Jiang?

214
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,350
How is it possible?

215
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,800
I told you

216
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,000
the concert is important to your career,

217
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,320
and I will support you.

218
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,350
How would I be so childish?

219
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,700
I know it.

220
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,230
All right, just eat.

221
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,470
Go back after you finish it.

222
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,650
Don't let Lin worry.

223
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
- Mm.
- Mm.

224
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,870
You've been wiping this place
for a while.

225
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,400
It's still a little dirty.

226
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,400
Is it good?

227
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,000
Mm.

228
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,200
Let me wipe it for you.

229
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,620
Good morning.
I'm going to practice the cello.

230
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,250
Are you going to send me
to school today?

231
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,550
Sorry, I have an appointment.

232
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,570
I'm not on your way.

233
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,900
Look at him all dressed up.
Who is he going to meet in a hurry?

234
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,040
Zhixiao.

235
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,710
Why are you pressing yourself
against the door?

236
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,640
No, I'm looking for something.

237
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,350
Go to wash up now.

238
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,220
- Hurry up. Don't be late again.
- Okay.

239
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,370
Okay. Okay.

240
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,250
Zhixiao, you're a little fast.

241
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,470
Okay.

242
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,430
I'll try it again.

243
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,040
Shao Jiang.

244
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,420
Okay, let me hear it.

245
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,070
Stop there.

246
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,710
Let's stop for a second.

247
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,570
I think

248
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,600
it's not about your skills.

249
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,970
You're a little impetuous.

250
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,300
It's okay, let's take a break.

251
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,700
Sorry, Shao Jiang.

252
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,820
It's okay.

253
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,900
What's the matter?

254
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,740
Are you in a bad mood today?

255
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,820
No. No.

256
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,120
Is it because of Dr. Gu?

257
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,770
Did you have a fight with him?

258
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,300
No. We didn't.

259
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,000
Zhixiao.

260
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,220
Let me ask you a question.

261
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,370
Mm.

262
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,120
You...

263
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,950
Have you ever liked me?

264
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,850
Ah?

265
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,870
Have you ever liked me?

266
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,800
I used to like you

267
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,020
when I was in high school.

268
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,400
I've always liked you

269
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,950
since high school.

270
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,320
I just thought you were young
at that time.

271
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,310
I was not sure

272
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,270
about our future,

273
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,200
and I didn't know if I could...

274
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,720
Anyway,

275
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,430
I regret

276
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,100
that I didn't tell you.

277
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,350
Zhixiao.

278
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,710
If I had told you at that time,

279
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,770
would we have been together?

280
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,250
I think we should be together.

281
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,800
There is no if, Shao Jiang.

282
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,220
It was in the past.

283
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,310
I didn't really know

284
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,720
what I want

285
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,320
until now,

286
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,220
and I happened to meet the right person

287
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,700
at the right time.

Actually, what I just said

00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,310
is not exactly accurate.

296
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,680
I think my feelings for you

297
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,200
when I was in high school

298
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,300
were more like
a younger sister's feelings

299
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,590
for an elder brother.

300
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,720
But my feelings for Dr. Gu

301
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,020
are love.

302
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,400

I've been holding it back
for four years.

307
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,820
I finally said it.

My family told me you are a doctor.

315
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,710
I admire doctors,

316
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,670
because I think you're responsible,

317
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,100
and you make people feel safe.

318
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,170
Do you know anything about me?

319
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,850
You have chronic gastritis.

320
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,420
You don't seem to know much about me.

321
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,150
Let me introduce myself.

322
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,240
My name is Lyu Zhiying.

323
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,830
I'm working in a financial company now.

324
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,750
I graduated from Indiana University

325
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,470
and studied business in college.

326
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,410
Sorry, Shao Jiang.

327
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,200
Why are you apologizing to me?

328
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,120
You have someone you love.

329
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,970
Isn't that great?

330
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,350
I'm also doing well.

331
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,900
Sorry, I have to answer this.

332
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,950
Hello, Sansan, what's the matter?

333
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,830
Do you know

334
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,800
what Dr. Gu is doing right now?

335
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,770
He's on a blind date at our cafe.

336
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,680
A blind date?

337
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,880
Yeah, get over here right now.

338
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,270
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

339
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,710
Sorry, Shao Jiang.

340
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,230
It's urgent. I gotta go.

341
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,950
Go ahead.

342
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,350
- Well...
- Just go.

343
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,230
The last thing I need right now

344
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,350
is your comfort.

345
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,700
I'll deal with it.

346
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,000
Go ahead.

347
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,720
Sorry, Shao Jiang.

348
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,500
Sansan.

349
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,570
Zhixiao, look.

350
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,880
Just say the word.

351
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,160
Do you want me to throw coffee at him

352
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,170
or throw him out?

353
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,270
No hurry.

354
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,720
Let's see how it goes.

355
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,250
If he is really on a blind date,

356
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,420
I won't spare him.

357
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,430
He is actually meeting a woman.

358
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,950
Yes, he is going too far.

359
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,000
Sorry.

360
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,550
I think there might be
a misunderstanding.

361
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,200
My family told me

362
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,560
you have chronic gastritis

363
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,950
and want to consult with me.

364
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,920
I don't know

365
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,000
why this is happening now.

366
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,040
My parents didn't keep it from me.

367
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,900
They even showed me a picture of you.

368
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,920
You look more handsome in real person.

369
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,150
I'm sorry.

370
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,320
I didn't know my family would do that.

371
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,100
I'm afraid it's a farce today.

372
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,800
A farce?

373
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,520
How so?

374
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,020
Do you have a girlfriend?

375
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,400
Yes.

376
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,190
I haven't officially

377
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,570
introduced her to my family.

378
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,920
Okay, I see.

379
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,270
Let's change the subject then.

380
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,830
We can still make friends.

381
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,190
Nice to meet you.

382
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,270
Thank you.

383
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,310
They are even drinking coffee.

384
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,320
Don't be mad. Calm down.

385
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,870
And they are all in smiles.

386
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,270
They clinked their glasses.

387
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,830
Easy.

388
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,620
What does your girlfriend do?

389
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,150
Is she also a doctor?

390
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,750
My girlfriend

391
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,950
is really cute.

392
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,370
I'll introduce her to you

393
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,770
if I get the chance.

394
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,950
Hello.

395
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,000
All right, I see.

396
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,880
I'll be right there. Bye.

397
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,750
Zhixiao.

398
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:07,520
Something came up,

399
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
I gotta go.

400
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,470
Don't be impulsive.

401
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,670
Just wait for me.

402
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,710
I got your back.

403
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,640
Do you hear me?

404
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,400
Rest assured.

405
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,830
I can do it myself.

406
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,830
I'd like to see

407
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,420
what he wants to do today.

408
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,470
Don't be impulsive.

409
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,160
Wait for me to come back.

410
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,850
Mm.

411
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,720
What are you doing?

412
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,700
What am I doing?

413
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,950
I'm watching my brother

414
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,970
having a blind date just like you.

415
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,040
Do you see that?

416
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,280
I think my brother

417
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,200
has a thing for that woman.

418
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,920
Too bad for you.

419
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,270
What do you mean?

420
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,170
Are you saying your brother
is really on a blind date?

421
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,650
I heard it from my aunt,

422
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,190
his birth mother.

423
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,570
It won't be wrong.

424
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,720
Calm down.

425
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,960
Let's hear what they are talking about.

426
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,050
I heard that you also have a Ph.D.

427
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,600
Yeah.

428
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,150
Well,

429
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,800
do you think the fact
that I'm a female doctor

430
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,870
gives you pressure?

431
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,620
Of course not.

432
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,900
I appreciate you.

433
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,450
If there's any real pressure,

434
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,520
that's also because
you're too beautiful.

435
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,520
Thank you.

436
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,880
Look at that.

437
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,000
I didn't realize my brother

438
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,570
is also a playboy.

439
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,830
Sure enough,

440
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,280
we have the infidelity gene
in the Gu family.

441
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,640
We make a pass at every girl we meet.

442
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,850
Don't you think there is a problem

443
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,120
with your brother's attitude
toward relationships?

444
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,310
What's the problem?

445
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,650
There's no certainty

446
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,830
about love anyway.

447
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,350
You love someone today,
and you love someone else tomorrow.

448
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,360
It's normal.

449
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,000
Is that how you are treating Sansan?

450
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,470
What are you doing?

451
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,070
I just don't understand the so-called

452
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,570
advanced view points of love you have.

453
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,400
I only know

454
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,920
that when I like someone,

455
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,720
I will be sincere to him.

456
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,310
If two people choose to be together,
they should be loyal to each other.

457
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,830
If he can't even do that,

458
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,040
what's the point of being with him?

459
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,590
Such a relationship is worthless.

460
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,770
I don't need that!

461
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,470
Is she your girlfriend?

462
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,300
Mm.

463
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,850
She is cute and brave indeed

464
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,200
just as you said.

465
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,270
Excuse me.

466
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,160
I have to go.

467
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,920
Go ahead.

468
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:21,720
Best wishes to you.

469
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,590
Thank you.

470
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,520
Zhixiao.

471
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,350
Why are you looking at me?

472
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,400
Am I wrong about it?

473
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,020
I...

474
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,950
Scumbag!

475
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,040
Listen,

476
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,020
I did this for Sansan.

477
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,400
You don't deserve her at all.

478
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,520
Here is a word for you,

479
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
if you have no sincerity,

480
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,830
how can you see the sincerity of others?

481
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,760
Wait, hold on.

482
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,520
What?

483
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,370
Sincerity...

484
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,620
Sincerity?

485
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,300
Are you saying Sansan is sincere to me?

486
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,420
No!

487
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,040
Sincerity...

488
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,200
Sincerity...

489
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:06,970
What?

490
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,200
That girl is pretty.

491
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,520
She is not bad.

492
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,770
You guys were having
a good conversation.

493
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,640
It was okay.

494
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,200
Then why did you go out
since you were having such a good time?

495
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,250
Go back and continue to talk to her.

496
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,070
I'll go back then.

497
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,170
What? Don't touch me.

498
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,830
Don't touch me. What?

499
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,320
My mom asked me to come.

500
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,310
She said the girl was a patient

501
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,370
and she wanted to consult with me
about chronic gastritis.

502
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,560
I didn't know it would be a date.

503
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,310
Didn't you find out after you came here?

504
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,520
I found out after we talked for a while.

505
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,800
Then why didn't you leave?

506
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,920
I didn't want to leave when I saw you.

507
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,560
I...

508
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,750
You're driving me crazy
on purpose, right?

509
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,590
Mm, I did it on purpose.

510
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,200
You're still smiling. What do you mean?

511
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,110
What are you talking about?

512
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,820
Don't hug me.

513
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,720
You're the one who practices the cello
with Shao Jiang every day.

514
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,570
I'm jealous.

515
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,560
Didn't you say yesterday
you weren't jealous?

516
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,120
Didn't you call that childish?

517
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,250
I guess I've spent
too much time with you,

518
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,050
and I've also grown childish.

519
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,470
I'm not childish.

520
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,950
You just called that girl beautiful.

521
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,110
I heard that and I'm angry.

522
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,120
I'll punish you.

523
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,450
No problem.

524
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,370
How do you want to punish me?

525
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,070
Let's go.

526
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,470
Your ice cream.

527
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,470
Thank you.

531
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,600
I don't eat ice cream.

532
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,070
But I want you to eat it.

533
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,200

538
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,760
I knew it's coriander-flavored.

539
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,760
You don't have to try so hard.

540
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,500
It's worth it.

541
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,710
I waited a long time in line for this.

542
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,880
The ice cream is popular.

543
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,800
If you eat it all,

544
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,050
I will have nothing to eat.

545
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,820
I have something to show you

546
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,640
after we go home.

547
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,420
What is it?

548
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,350
You'll find out when you're back.

549
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,870
Where is Zhixiao?

550
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,220
What happened to you again?

551
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,820
Zhixiao threw water at me.

552
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,190
It's your brother who had a blind date.

553
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,160
Why would Zhixiao throw water at you?

554
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,950
My brother wasn't really
on a blind date.

555
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,920
I think she has forgiven him by now.

556
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,970
As for me,

557
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,300
she said she did it for you.

558
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,550
For me?

559
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,370
What do you mean?

560
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,550
What do you mean?

561
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,120
I'll go home and get changed.

562
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,970
Mind the cafe.

563
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,700
Gu Xiao, what do you mean?

564
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,560
Sit down.

565
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,500
What are you doing?

566
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,000
Actually,

567
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,770
I wanted to show you this yesterday.

568
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,640
Well,

569
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,200
I don't understand this.

570
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,950
(Thanks to Lin Zhixiao
for enlightening my present and future.)

571
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,400
(Thanks to Lin Zhixiao)
Signing the name

572
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,830
(Thanks to Lin Zhixiao)
of the one I love

573
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,950
at the end of my paper
is my way of showing my love.

574
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:25,950
Zhixiao.

575
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,000
We met too late.

576
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,220
I was barely involved

577
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,950
in your past,

578
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,850
and you don't know much about my past.

579
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,570
But the good thing is

580
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,750
we have a present and a future together.

581
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,420
We'll have more time

582
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,720
to create

583
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,350
our own memories.

584
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,220
Okay.

585
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,470
It's a rare day today.

586
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,520
The three of us don't work night shifts

587
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,600
and we have no surgery.

588
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,640
Honey.

589
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,760
It's so hard

590
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,000
to have dinner

591
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,280
with our son now.

592
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,220
Mom.

593
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,570
Why do you come home today?

594
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,020
Dad, Mom.

595
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,350
I have something important to tell you.

596
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,250
It's about my girlfriend.

597
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,950
I know.

598
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,700
Her name is Lin Zhixiao, right?

599
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,680
How do you know that?

600
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,280
I called Xi.

601
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,520
She told me about it.

602
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,150
Since you know it,

603
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,050
why did you trick me into a date?

604
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,250
Gu Wei.

605
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,000
We accept that you don't want

606
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,150
to be with Xi.

607
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,400
But your girlfriend

608
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,110
is too young.

609
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,360
She hasn't graduated yet.

610
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,400
Yeah.

611
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,100
She is too young.

612
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,870
When will you get married and have kids?

613
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,350
We don't even know

614
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,110
where her job will be.

615
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,420
How can your father and I not worry?

616
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,400
Dad, Mom.

617
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,120
For me, a relationship

618
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,880
is about affection.

619
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,280
None of these conditions
are important to me.

620
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,910
Fine.

621
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,430
Let's talk about affection.

622
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,470
She is too young

623
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,050
to settle down.

624
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,350
Are you sure

625
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,790
your relationship is stable?

626
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,490
I heard from Xi

627
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,230
that she is a family member
of your patient.

628
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,820
How are you going to handle

629
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,950
the relationship
between the patient and his family?

630
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,150
Dad, don't worry.

631
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,710
I'll take care of it.

632
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,570
Son.

633
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,950
Listen to me.

634
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,430
I've seen this happen

635
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:50,800
all the time.

636
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,370
It's not that she is not good

637
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,760
or you are not good.

638
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,280
There's just too much distance
between you two.

639
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,760
You're a surgeon.

640
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,120
You're too busy,

641
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,360
and she is so young.

642
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,870
Can she understand it?

643
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,560
Can she promise not to be grumpy

644
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,710
and clingy,

645
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,950
and affect your work?

646
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,470
Mom.

647
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,280
I think it needs time and patience

648
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,360
to know each other

649
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,750
and adapt to each other
in any relationship.

650
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,650
I don't expect you to accept her now,

651
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,320
but I hope you can

652
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,520
give us a chance.

653
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,840
If Lin Zhixiao and I

654
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,910
can work through

655
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,420
these objective factors together,

656
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,850
I hope you can accept her

657
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,220
and bless us.

658
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,000
Even we're against it now,

659
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,770
you won't listen.

660
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,650
I'll give you time.

661
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,420
Let's see what happens.

662
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,270
I'm sure you will also like Lin Zhixiao

663
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,450
when you see her.

664
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,070
(I've been busy preparing for the show.)

665
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,150
(Keep practicing and get prepared.)

666
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,950
(Don't slack off.)

667
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,100
(Rest assured, Shao Jiang.)

668
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,870
(Gu Wei)

669
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,250
(Cute)

670
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:11,370
(Clinical value of retrospective analysis
of early and advanced gastric cancer)

671
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,170
Jin Shi and Yin Xi

672
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,970
publicly display their affection
every day.

673
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,370
I'm going to block them,

674
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,430
block them both.

675
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,300
Eat this.

676
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,670
Eric.

677
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,750
I've made it very clear for you.

678
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,280
Sansan.

679
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,170
Weren't we having a great time together?

680
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,840
- Can't we...
- No.

681
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,470
The same person never crossed
the same river twice.

682
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,280
You and I are never
getting back together.

683
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,470
Don't call me again.

684
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,190
Goodbye.

685
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,570
Eric?

686
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,650
It sounds familiar.

687
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,750
Is it the guy working in finance?

688
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,370
Mm.

689
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,300
He still can't

690
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,280
forget about you?

691
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,150
If he is so persistent,

692
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,390
why don't you get back together
with him?

693
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,970
He was too busy to be reached
at that time.

694
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,630
Now he wants to come back to me.

695
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,450
It's too late.

696
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,390
Did you break up with him

697
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,900
just because he was too busy?

698
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,920
Or what?

699
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,470
I can be fine on my own.

700
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,870
Why would I need him?

701
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,390
I'm not like you.

702
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,970
Dr. Gu is also busy now.

703
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,750
I'll bring him food later.

704
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,150
Hello.

705
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,250
May I have a menu, please?

706
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,800
I want this. Thank you.

707
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,620
Okay.

708
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,560
And this.

709
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,300
Okay.

710
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,420
Rice, and this.

711
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,800
Three dishes.

712
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,150
I'd like three to-go boxes, please.

713
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,770
Thank you.

714
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,470
Okay.

715
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,390
Gu.

716
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,950
Organize the theories

717
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,800
we talked about at the meeting today.

718
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,200
No problem.

719
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,470
All right. Bye.

720
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,320
Goodbye.

721
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,080
Hey, Miss Lin.

722
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,320
Are you here to check him up?

723
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,720
No, I brought him some food.

724
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,070
Wei, over here.

725
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,870
Your girlfriend brought you food.

726
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,040
You're so lucky.

727
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,200
Yeah.

728
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,670
She's kind of clingy.

729
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,650
Really?

730
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,670
I miss you.

731
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,100
I brought you some food

732
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,670
to care about you

733
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,220
and show you my love.

734
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,850
It doesn't look like
you made them yourself.

735
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:04,710
I came to you right after class.

736
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,250
I didn't have time to cook.

737
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,120
You haven't answered my question yet.

738
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,470
Am I allowed

739
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,570
to be infatuated with you?

740
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,520
All right, you have my permission.

741
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,700
I won't charge you.

742
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,020
Go ahead and eat. I won't tease you.

743
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,970
These are my favorite dishes.

744
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,520
I'll enjoy every bite.

745
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,040
You'd better eat them all.

746
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,080
Otherwise,

747
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,450
I'll get angry.

748
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,520
Then I must eat them all.

749
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,220
How does it taste?

750
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,800
It's good.

751
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,710
Is it really good or...

752
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,150
But there is only one problem.

753
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,150
What is it?

754
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,570
I wish they were made by you.

755
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,370
All right.

756
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,840
I'll learn how to cook it

757
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,870
and make it for you one day.

758
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:53,920
Okay?

759
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,600
Mm.

760
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,100
Try this.

761
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,600
There is garlic in it.

762
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,600
Well...

763
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,800
Hello, Wei.

764
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,950
Dr. Gu. Director needs you

765
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,420
in the operating room. It's urgent.

766
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,600
I see. I'll be right there.

767
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,320
Zhixiao.

768
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,520
There is an emergency. I gotta go.

769
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,840
I heard it. Go ahead.

770
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,870
Don't worry about me.

771
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,000
Go to work. I'll take care of this,

772
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,470
and I'll go back later.

773
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:25,950
Okay.

774
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,070
I'll leave this to you.

775
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,840
Go ahead.

776
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,560
Okay.

777
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,670
I'll go to work.

778
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,970
He is too busy

779
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,920
to have time for a meal now.

780
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,590
(Did you get off work?)

781
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,300
(I just got off work.)

782
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,770
Do you miss me?

783
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,470
Why are you here?

784
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,850
I'm free now.

785
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,220
I'm here to spend some time with you,

786
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,770
so you won't get bored being alone.

787
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:11,800
Aren't you moved?

788
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:15,920
Go inside.

789
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,520
Mm.

790
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,550
That girl you were
set up with is pretty.

791
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,950

I think you're not the same type.

One is intellectual, the other is cute.

793
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,670
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
Who is intellectual?

794
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,450
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
You.

795
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,950
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
Who is cute?

796
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:37,770
Also you.

797
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:38,670
You...

798
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,420
There is a problem with your grammar.

799
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,930
You said we are not the same type.

800
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:43,550
And you used one, the other.

801
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,870
But I do think

802
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,120
you are not the same type.

803
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,430
You shook her hands the other day.

804
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,500
I saw it.

805
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,550
I was being polite. It's the courtesy...

806
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,200
- ...in human interactions.
- Aren't you too sweet?

807
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,020
Polite?

808
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,800
Do you have to shake hands
with every girl?
