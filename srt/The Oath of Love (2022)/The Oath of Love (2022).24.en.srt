18
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

19
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,000
I can't promise you

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,190
as you want right now.

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,830
Then why did you

22
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,870
come to our house today?

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
You're right.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,270
I shouldn't have come.

25
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,270
If you shouldn't have come,

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,550
just go back early.

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,520
Sorry to bother you.

28
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,080
Hold on!

29
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,440
Take back

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,000
what you brought here!

31
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,630
We don't have the luck to enjoy it!

32
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,470
I'll see what happened to him.

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,600
There should be a misunderstanding.

34
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,520
Where are you going?

35
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,240
Lin Zhixiao!

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,670
Don't be mad.

37
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,000
We don't know what's going on.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,240
Let her ask him.

39
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,270
I think

40
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,470
I deserve an explanation.

41
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
I know you're not someone

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,390
who would change his attitude

43
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,960
for no reason.

44
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,720
Something must have happened,

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,320
right?

46
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,670
You can tell me.

47
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,030
We can discuss it

48
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,910
and work it out together.

49
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,600
There is nothing.

50
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,960
Don't overthink.

51
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,470
Then it's because you suddenly realized

52
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,550
you don't like me that much anymore,

53
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,550
and you want to back off?

54
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,320
No, don't overthink.

55
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,390
Is it Lin?

56
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,910
Does he give you pressure

57
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,750
or

58
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,320
is there something

59
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,190
about me

60
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,750
that's stressing you out

61
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,830
and making you uncomfortable?

62
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,720
No.

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,550
None of these are the reason.

64
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,470
Then why?

65
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,960
Lin Zhixiao.

66
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,190
Can you give me

67
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,960
some time and space to sort it out?

68
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,880
You don't need to ask why

69
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,960
about everything.

70
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,230
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,320
I don't want

72
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,480
to hear you say you're sorry.

73
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,390
Does

74
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,200
that word

75
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,440
mean anything to us now?

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,200
I don't need your apology.

77
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,640
Okay.

78
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,110
I see.

79
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,070
If it's because

80
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,600
I affected your life,

81
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry about it.

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,480
Break up with him!

83
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,110
Lin, what are you doing?

84
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,110
You said

85
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,790
to me yourself

86
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,200
that Zhixiao and Dr. Gu

87
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,040
are adults now

88
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,440
and they'll walk the way of life
on their own.

89
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,880
In principle,

90
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,070
as long as they have thought it through,

91
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,390
we shouldn't interfere.

92
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,830
How can we not interfere?

93
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,640
You saw his attitude

94
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,350
today!

95
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,790
He is unreliable

96
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,760
and irresponsible!

97
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,320
How can I entrust my daughter

98
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,270
to someone like him?

99
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,550
Mr. Lin.

100
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,390
I know you're mad right now,

101
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,390
but Dr. Gu

102
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,790
is not that kind of person.

103
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,160
I didn't communicate well with him.

104
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,270
He might need

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,320
some time.

106
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,110
I misunderstood what he meant.

107
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,070
You don't know him.

108
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,200
Do you know him?

109
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,440
Lin Zhixiao.

110
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,670
Don't waste your feelings

111
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,880
on someone like him.

112
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,510
Since you misunderstood him,

113
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,070
your relationship

114
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,510
should end.

115
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,200
I don't want you

116
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,160
to be badly hurt!

117
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,000
Your father is just angry.

118
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,000
Those are just cross words.

119
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,200
I'm okay. I'm okay.

120
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,200
I'm really good now.

121
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,440
Give me some time.

122
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,720
I want to be alone.

123
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,510
Don't be mad, Lin.

124
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,040
It's bad for your health.

125
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,550
Keep an eye on her.

126
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,790
Don't let her leave the house.

127
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,670
She is not allowed to see him again.

128
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,830
Lin.

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,720
This matter...

130
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,000
Just go!

131
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,160
All right, all right. Don't be mad.

132
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,640
Let's go.

133
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,040
Okay.

134
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,630
(The subscriber you dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.)

135
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,270
I would like to have the check.

136
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:46,950
- All right.
- (Please redial later.)

137
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,440
Where's Gu Xiao?

138
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,600
I haven't seen him all night.

139
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,160
I'm here to contribute
to his cafe's revenue,

140
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,510
but he didn't even show up.

141
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,160
He has something to do today.

142
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,000
Come back tomorrow.
I promise he will be here.

143
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,640
The beautiful manager is saying

144
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,760
I should spend money here every day?

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm not going to fall for it.

146
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,000
Well,

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,270
are you not satisfied with our cafe?

148
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,790
I dare not.

149
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,160
Your cafe is good indeed.

150
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,160
But I mean,

151
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,670
Gu Xiao did a good job

152
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,350
to find such a good girlfriend like you.

153
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:12,920
That's right.

154
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,830
He is something.

155
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,880
Indeed. Indeed.

156
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,790
Then why don't you come here more often?

157
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:16,920
We'll come.

158
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,510
We'll come here tomorrow to support you.

159
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,790
- All right. We're leaving.
- We're leaving

160
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,920
- We'll come back tomorrow.
- Bye-bye.

161
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,510
Bye-bye.

162
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,840
(What did you say?)

163
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,230
(Did you lose the money?!)

164
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,200
(Didn't you say Zhao Laosan)

165
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,230
(made his fortune from this?)

166
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,200
(Didn't you say there are good signs)

167
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,110
(and it can definitely make money?)

168
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,350
(I mortgaged the cafe.)

169
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,910
(How am I supposed)

170
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,960
(to tell my girlfriend?)

171
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,640
(To be honest, Gu,)

172
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,030
(you were the one who begged me)

173
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,760
(to count you in.)

174
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,000
(I didn't force you)

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,880
(to take out the money.)

176
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,670
(You had to do it.)

177
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,320
(I couldn't stop you.)

178
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,670
(I think)

179
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,880
(I deserve an explanation.)

180
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,230
(Lin Zhixiao.)

181
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,590
(Can you give me)

182
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,230
(some time and space to sort it out?)

183
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,230
(You don't need to ask why)

184
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,320
(about everything.)

185
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,000
(Sorry.)

187
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,000
(I'll buy you this one.)

188
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,150
(Start changing now.)

189
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,440
I think the cartoon pattern

190
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,350
suits you well.

191
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,350
Wei.

192
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,840
Here is what you asked for.

193
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
Put it in the trunk for me.

194
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,880
Okay.

195
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,140

199
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,880
Wei.

200
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,000
Why did you ask me

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,150
to pack your stuff in the office?

202
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Do you want to quit?

203
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,110
I took a few days off

204
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,350
to adjust my mood.

205
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,880
You really scared me.

206
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,080
I thought you were going to...

207
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,110
By the way,

208
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,790
Dr. Gao is back at work.

209
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,710
She said she would

210
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,640
find the evidence for you

211
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,760
and prove your innocence.

212
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,710
You know what, Du,

213
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,840
I also have a junior.

214
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,710
Were you not Mr. Liang's last student

215
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,590
before he retired?

216
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,030
He had another student.

217
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,280
It's just he stopped being a doctor

218
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,710
before your internship.

219
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,150
That's why my teacher and I

220
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,470
rarely mentioned him.

221
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,910
Why did he stop being a doctor?

222
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,880
In the first year of his internship,

223
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,640
He gave CPR

224
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
to a patient

225
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,520
for two hours

226
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,470
and wouldn't give up.

227
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,550
As a result, he was complained
by the patient's family.

228
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,030
They said he must give the patient
first aid in a wrong way

229
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,470
and felt guilty about.

230
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,640
Otherwise, he wouldn't

231
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,520
compress the patient's chest
for so long.

232
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,550
According to the hospital regulations,

233
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,440
death can be declared

234
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,790
when rescue proves ineffectual
after 30 minutes.

235
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,550
Even the subsequent investigation

236
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,520
proved him right,

237
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,590
he still couldn't be a doctor anymore

238
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,880
for psychological reasons.

239
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,080
Are you all right, Wei?

240
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,000
You're making

241
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,030
me worry about you.

242
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,110
Do you

243
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,790
have other plans?

244
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,640
Don't be nervous.

245
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,910
I'm just a little sentimental

246
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,230
about the old stuff.

247
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,350
Alright.

248
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,550
I'm leaving.

249
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,350
Have a safe trip.

250
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,900
(In-patient)

251
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,400
Go back.

252
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,550
Why are you back so late?

253
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,230
I called you several times

254
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,110
and you didn't answer.

255
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,350
Your dad has been throwing a tantrum.

256
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,910
Well,

257
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,030
he's waiting for you over there.

258
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,150
Talk nicely.

259
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,470
Don't be hasty.

260
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,840
Sit down and talk to him.

261
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,150
Look at yourself!

262
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,760
Have you been fooling around again?

263
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,640
Did you go to a nightclub?

264
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,790
Father.

265
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,880
Does the sun rise in the west?

266
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
For the first time,

267
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,590
you know I'm your father,

268
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,030
right?

269
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,550
I used to think

270
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,710
you're my father.

271
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,910
Father.

272
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,840
Don't talk about money.

273
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,760
I want to learn
how to do business from you.

274
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,710
Aren't you

275
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,760
already doing business?

276
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,320
You're running a cafe,
or a bar or something,

277
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,320
and you're cocky every day.

278
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,280
Looks like you're enjoying it.

279
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,200
I know that you are angry

280
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,080
about the two million.

281
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,470
The two million...

282
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,350
Well,

283
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,280
do you want to give it back to me now?

284
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,520
I can't.

285
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,320
But I can

286
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,400
make money on my own.

287
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,280
I'll pay you back

288
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,840
when I've earned enough.

289
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,000
Doing business is not something

290
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,520
you can do every once in a while.

291
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,280
I don't think you'll last three days.

292
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,550
I can.

293
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,670
I'll do

294
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,400
whatever you want me to do.

295
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,230
You said that.

296
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,590
Today I'm going to tell you

297
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,910
about the family business

298
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,280
and you need
to grasp the situation soon.

299
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,520
And I need you to go abroad
with me tomorrow.

300
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,000
Tomorrow?

301
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,640
Well,

302
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,280
are you reluctant

303
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,440
to leave those girls?

304
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,110
No.

305
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,440
I'll go with you.

306
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,590
Good.

307
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But there's one thing.

308
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,590
Help Xiao Shan find a job.

309
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,520
Xiao Shan? Who is she?

310
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,440
My...

311
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,150
My manager.

312
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,000
Why should I help her?

313
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,640
She is capable.

314
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,150
She got the job

315
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,030
by sending a resume
and passing the interview.

316
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,550
She runs the cafe well.

317
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,840
(Since you've decided
to start a business,)

318
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,590
(you should do it as soon as possible.)

319
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,150
(If you lose money,)

320
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,470
(it means you made a mistake)

321
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,520
(about hiring me as the manager.)

322
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,910
(You can fire me at any time.)

323
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,230
(I only want you to be happy.)

324
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,150
(Gains and losses don't matter.)

325
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,000
(This cafe)

326
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,840
is for you.

327
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,230
How can I fire you?

328
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,910
I came here

329
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,280
to work.

330
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,350
If you put it that way,

331
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,080
I'll resign.

332
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,590
I lost the cafe.

333
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,400
It's not fair to her.

334
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,830
How did you lose it?

335
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,350
I mortgaged it.

336
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:22,950
Where is the money?

337
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,920
I lost it.

338
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,710
Well...

339
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,070
This will be the last favor
I ask you to do.

340
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,830
Okay, I promise you.

341
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,520
All right, don't cry.

342
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,640
Okay.

343
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,470
I'll go with you tomorrow.

344
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,280

419
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,070
the company chose me

420
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,350
because I have potential.

421
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
She was implying

422
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,680
I'm not good enough now.

423
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,230
I can't slack off.

424
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,800
I have to work harder, right?

425
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:10,950
What's more, I need

426
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,880
to get the paperwork for Germany done

427
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,070
when I get back.

428
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,560
Hurry up and eat.

429
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

430
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,110
You and Lin can rest assured.

431
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,590
I can take care of myself.

432
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,590
I've always believed in you.

433
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,000
Okay.

434
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,070
(Hello, please hold the line.)

435
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,400

436
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,710
(is busy now.)

437
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,560
He hung up.

438
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,350
It's not good.

439
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,560
The patient's family
has been making trouble.

440

The investigation team
of the Health Commission

441
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,310
also sent people to learn the situation.

442
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,230
No.

443
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,230
I'm Gao Boyang.

444
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,830
Is Du back yet?

445
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,470
Send someone to look for him.

446
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,680
Tell him to see me

447
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,680
when he gets here.

448
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:52,300
(Gao Xi)

449
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,380
(Power Off)

450
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,800
He turned his phone off.

451
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,310
Vice President Gao,
are you looking for me?

452
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,920
There you are.

453
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,880
Do you know where Gu Wei went?

454
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,920
Gu Wei?

455
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,760
Didn't he take a leave?

456
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,830
Take a leave?

457
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,920
Who told you that?

458
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,280
He told me himself.

459
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,560
He also said...

460
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,680
That's why

461
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,520
he was talking weird that day.

462
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,710
I'll take care
of the investigation team.

463
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,400
I'll give you half a day off.

464
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,950
Go to find Gu Wei now

465
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,160
and make sure to bring him back
to the hospital.

466
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,640
Okay.

467
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,520
I'll go with him.

468
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:48,760
He turned it off.

469
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,310
Stop calling him. Let's go.

470
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,110
Okay.

471
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,660
(In-patient)

472
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,830
Hasn't Dr. Gu come yet?

473
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,400
We've sent people to look for him.

474
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,110
I think he fled to escape punishment.

475
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,000
Mr. Tang,

476
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,470
I understand

477
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,710
your feelings right now.

478
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,160
But before

479
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,710
the final conclusion is made...

480
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,470
- Well?
- Can you not...?

481
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,040
- Am I wrong?
- No, no.

482
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,640
That's not what I meant.

483
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,710
He hasn't shown up yet!

484
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,470
Look,

485
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,640
the president is here,
the director is here,

486
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,280
the head of the investigation team
is also here.

487
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,470
Where is he now?

488
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,640
You know what,

489
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,280
even if he fled,

490
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,430
we're still going

491
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,710
to get justice for my son.

492
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,110
Mr. Tang,

493
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,310
would you mind letting me finish?

494
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,310
All right. Go ahead

495
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,190
and finish it.

496
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,280
If it's our problem,

497
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,280
we will assume the responsibility

498
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,830
we should bear.

499
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,710
What responsibility can you assume?

500
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,230
Right?

501
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:41,950
Old Tang.

502
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,070
Don't get excited.

503
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,070
After the responsibility is clear,

504
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,000
we will pay you in compensation

505
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,190
as we should.

506
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,160
Compensation?

507
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,430
What a joke!

508
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,160
Do you think we need money?

509
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,640
I'll say it again,

510
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,000
we want to get justice

511
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,190
for my son!

512
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,000
Dr. Gu operated on your son

513
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,230
out of good intentions.

514
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,190
Good intentions?

515
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,070
He is an unscrupulous doctor!

516
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,160
People like him

517
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,350
shouldn't work with you

518
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,310
in a major hospital!

519
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,920
He is an unscrupulous doctor.

520
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,640
Right?

521
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,430
Right.

522
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,430
You're right.

523
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,880
Mr. Tang,

524
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,640
Dr. Gu is an unscrupulous doctor.

525
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,590
Yan.

526
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,110
Vice President Gao.

527
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,110
Let me finish.

528
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,880
Gu Wei is an unscrupulous doctor!

529
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,830
He had nothing better to do.

530
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,830
He spent seven or eight hours

531
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,000
operating on your son.

532
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,520
The operation was complicated.

533
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,040
He brought your son back

534
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,190
from the jaws of death!

535
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,040
He did that

536
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,800
so you can call him
an unscrupulous doctor here!

537
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,880
Not only he is an unscrupulous doctor,

538
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,590
me, Director, Vice President Gao,

539
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,000
we are all unscrupulous doctors.

540
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,680
That's not what I meant.

541
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,190
I think,

542
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,640
Mr. Tang,

543
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,430
when you get sick,

544
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,230
you shouldn't come to the hospital

545
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,830
to see a doctor.

546
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,920
He did the surgery
out of good intentions.

547
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,400
How does he

548
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,680
end up as a fugitive?

549
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,830
He fled to escape punishment?

550
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,710
Who would dare
to be a doctor after this?

551
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,830
Who would dare to cure patients?

552
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,520
Aunt, do you know

553
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,800
how many kids

554
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
who want to go to med school

555
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,040
are stopped by their families

556
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,760
just because the unscrupulous doctors

557
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,710
you just said?

558
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,710
The so-called justice?

559
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,800
Aunt,

560
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,070
do you know

561
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,000
how difficult it is

562
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,950
for a medical student

563
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,760
to graduate,

564
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,400
to work in a hospital,

565
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,280
and to become

566
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,230
a good surgeon?

567
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,160
I know.

568
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
We know better than anyone else.

569
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,070
Mr. Tang,

570
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,070
If I offend you

571
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,070
in any way,

572
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,280
you can complain.

573
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,160
My name is Yan Bingjun.

574
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,280
Are you defending Gu Wei?

575
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,310
I'm not defending Gu Wei.

576
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,470
I'm defending all the doctors.

577
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,470
I'm defending all my colleagues.

578
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,830
Director.

579
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,880
Vice President Gao.

580
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,830
I have an operation to do. I'll...

581
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,000
Go ahead.

582
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,590
Sorry about it.

583
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Dr. Yan is a little emotional.

584
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,350
I know

585
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,590
you are also wound up right now.

586
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,590
But before

587
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,800
the conclusion is made,

588
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,590
even for the sake

589
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,470
of the patients' rest,

590
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,230
I hope you can stop
making a scene in the hospital,

591
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,590
okay?

592
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,110
All right, everyone.

593
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,000
Let's take a break.

594
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,920
We'll practice later.

595
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,280
Lin Zhixiao, you're working so hard.

596
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,640
You're the only one in the orchestra

597
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,110
who signed up to a company first.

598
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,800
Why don't you give us a way out?

599
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,040
It's not like that.

600
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,800
There's a lot of luck involved.

601
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,640
You know

602
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,310
we can't take good luck

603
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,400
for granted.

604
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,560
Zhixiao, someone is looking for you.

605
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,190
Thank you.

606
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,000
Miss Sansan.

607
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,230
Why's the matter?

608
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,190
Did you think it was Dr. Gu

609
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,160
who came here
to pick you up from school?

610
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,160
Are you disappointed to see me?

611
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,470
Don't mention it.

612
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,000
I haven't told you yet.

613
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,590
Dr. Gu...

614
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,040
Dr. Gu has been avoiding me lately.

615
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,600
His meeting with my parents
was messed up.

616
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,360
Well, we are

617
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,040
in the same boat.

618
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,280
What's wrong with you?

619
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,000
What happened to Gu Xiao?

620
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,520
He disappeared.

621
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,630
He sent me a message saying he's sorry,

622
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,910
and I couldn't reach him anymore.

623
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,390
I guess he found someone else.

624
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,120
Look at your eyes.

625
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,910
No.

626
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,630
Did you cry?

627
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,520
No.

628
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,230
I was born

629
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,280
without the default setting
of crying for scumbags.

630
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,670
I've just been up all night

631
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,000
and my eyes are swollen.

632
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,800
There is no need to be upset

633
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,150
about a scumbag.

634
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,190
Give me your phone.

635
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,280
Turn it off!

636
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,280
None of them

637
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,600
can reach us.

638
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,000
Let's go and have a good time!

639
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,630
Okay.

640
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,280
He is not in the hospital, not at home,

641
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,470
not in his parents' place,

642
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,040
and not in his teacher's place.

643
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,630
Where else could he be?

644
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,950
I can't think

645
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,000
of anywhere else.

646
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:09,950
Dr. Gao.

647
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,630
You are so close with Wei.

648
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,150
You two have known each other
for over ten years.

649
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,120
Can't you think of anywhere else

650
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,150
he might be?

651
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,630
You know him better than anyone.

652
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,120
Me?

653
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,630
I thought I knew him well.

654
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,560
Actually, I don't know anything
about him.

655
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,520
I don't know him,
what about Lin Zhixiao?

656
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,390
I already called her,

657
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,320
but somehow she also turned

658
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,630
her phone off.

659
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:43,760
Yeah.

660
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,150
We've been waiting

661
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,320
downstairs for her.

662
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,390
Rest assured.

663
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,150
She's back.

664
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,520
Okay. Okay.

665
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,320
Dr. Gao.

666
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,080
Zhixiao.

667
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,910
What are you guys doing here?

668
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,560
We've been waiting for you.

669
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,670
Gu Wei disappeared.

670
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,800
He hasn't shown up
in the hospital for days.

671
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,280
We're wondering

672
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,390
if you know where he is now.

673
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,840
Sorry.

674
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,430
I don't know.

675
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,080
Zhixiao.

676
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,000
Did you have a fight?

677
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,000
I'll leave if there is nothing else.

678
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,800
Lin Zhixiao!

679
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,560
We also

680
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,150
want to ask...

681
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,040
Aren't you Gu Wei's girlfriend?

682
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:19,560
Such a big thing

683
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
happened to Gu Wei,

684
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,800
what kind of attitude is that?

685
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,840
What happened to him?

686
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,910
Zhixiao, don't you know it?

687
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,760
Gu Wei is in big trouble.

688
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,150
Zhixiao, why are you here?

689
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,760
You know why.

690
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,470
Dr. Du and Dr. Gao

691
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,670
couldn't reach you.

692
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,840
They asked me to find you.

693
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,320
I thought you might be here.

694
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,280
Do you know it?

695
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,230
Is it serious?

696
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,950
Then what are you doing here?

697
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,800
Why don't you

698
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,710
explain to the investigation team?

699
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,080
Why don't you

700
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,950
convince the patient's family?

701
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,950
Why don't you look for evidence

702
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,230
to prove your innocence?

703
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,080
Why don't you

704
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,910
contradict those people who blamed you

705
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,080
and tell them they were wrong?

706
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,080
What's the meaning

707
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,870
in doing these things now?

708
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,320
What do you think has a meaning?

709
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,600
Is there a meaning in standing here?

710
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,840
Come with me now and fix it.

711
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,870
I want to be alone.

712
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,120
Gu Wei, you're unbelievable!

713
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,710
Do you think the world

714
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,280
revolves around you?

715
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,190
You can hide here

716
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:56,950
from all the trouble,

717
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,950
what about other people?

718
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,120
You made us

719
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,000
worry about you.

720
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,560
But you're hiding here, relaxing,

721
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,760
and enjoying your life?

722
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,390
I'm not enjoying this.

723
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,000
I just want to sort out...

724
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,520
What do you want to sort out?

725
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,800
What do you want to sort out?

726
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,950
Listen,

727
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,390
you're being selfish.

728
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,150
You're weak and you're escaping from it!

729
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,000
You don't want to face

730
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,520
these setbacks and difficulties.

731
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,470
Why can't you

732
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,000
have accidents
and setbacks in your life?

733
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,040
Just because you're a genius

734
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,360
and you're incredible?

735
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:19,870
Does it give you the right

736
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,320
hurt other people?

737
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,630
I didn't think in that way,

738
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,800
and I didn't hurt anyone.

739
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,000
You hurt me!

740
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:29,950
Zhixiao.

741
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,230
Don't touch me!

742
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,600
You never wanted

743
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,120
to tell me about this.

744
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,840
Until now,

745
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,320
you still haven't told me.

746
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,390
and you are not going to tell me.

747
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,190
You caught me

748
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,390
off guard

749
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,910
and slapped me in the face
in front of Lin.

750
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:43,430
You even

751
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,560
pulled a disappearing act.

752
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,230
Have you thought about how I feel?

753
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
I was going to tell you about it

754
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,840
when I work it out.

755
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,520
When you work it out.

756
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,040
What if

757
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,470
you can't work it out?

758
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,280
You are going to keep me in the dark,

759
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,280
make me feel puzzled,

760
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,430
and leave me out in the cold, right?

761
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,360
You're going to a new company,

762
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,080
and you're going to Germany...

763
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,760
We made the decision together

764
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,630
to go to Germany.

765
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,800
Who are you

766
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,710
to make the decision for me?

767
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,390
I'm sorry.

768
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,000
Listen, Gu Wei,

769
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,630
as a boyfriend,

770
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,470
you're a total failure.

771
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,710
As a doctor,

772
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,950
you may still be saved.

773
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,840
Don't forget what you told me

774
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,230
and why you want to be a doctor.

775
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,470
I have no respect

776
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,910
for a quitter like you!

777
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,950
Let go of me!

778
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,950
Come to me

779
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:37,870
after you fix it!

780
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,320
Zhixiao!

00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,460
(Steep Slope Slow Down)

782
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,620
(Steep Slope Slow Down)

783
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,150
We've been looking for him.

784
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,800
Don't worry, Vice President Gao.

785
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,230
We'll find him soon.

786
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,040
He won't appreciate it.

787
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,190
You...

788
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,710
What are you talking about?

789
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,430
It's true.

790
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,670
He didn't pick up

791
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,840
any of your calls, did he?

792
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,430
Then...

793
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,000
Gu Wei, you're finally back.

794
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,040
How rare!

795
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,950
Well, did you fail to flee?

796
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,320
You know,

797
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,080
the family of the patient on 16

798
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,600
has been looking for you
all over the world.

799
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,800
Maybe you should take my advice,

800
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,190
you can hide for another three
or five years.

801
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,390
We will have cleaned up

802
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,190
your mess by then.

803
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,320
- Dr. Yan.
- I...

804
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,910
Can't you stop it?

805
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:11,190
I'm sorry

806
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,910
that I've caused you trouble these days.

807
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:20,840
That's it?

808
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,320
Yan Bingjun.

809
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,080
I know

810
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:31,910
my problem

811
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,470
is plaguing everyone in the hospital.

812
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,280
I only thought about myself.

813
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,080
I didn't think about you.

814
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:41,280
It's my fault.

815
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:43,470
I want to apologize to you.

816
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,000
I hope you can forgive me.

817
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,870
Gu Wei, I'm glad
you've thought it through.

818
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:49,600
I'm back this time

819
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,760
to fix the problem.

820
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,470
I'll actively prepare the materials

821
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:54,040
required by the investigation team.

822
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,910
I might also need your help.

823
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,080
Don't worry about it.

824
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,230
Just leave it to us.

825
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,870
There must be something wrong with me

826
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,360
if I get myself involved in this.

827
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,120
Dr. Gu.

828
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,280
The patient on 16
has a massive abdominal hemorrhage.

829

Not just disappointed,

835
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,620
I even wanted

836
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,500
to peel your heart

837
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,660
layer by layer with a knife

838
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,300
and see if it exists.

839
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,740
You could go to jail.

840
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,340
