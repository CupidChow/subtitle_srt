Dr. Gu?

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,040
Do you want to shower first?

21
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,400
This…

22
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,150
is not appropriate.

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,625
Did you just spill your hotchpotch?

24
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,160
I see.

25
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,880
I won't get your house dirty.

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
I'll go shower now.

Tone-up cream.

Lin Zhixiao,

30
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,399
I never thought you look so pretty

31
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:44,575
without makeup.

32
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,080
I am pretty

33
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,425
without makeup, okay?

34
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,125
(Sugar-Free Mints)
Breath freshener.

35
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,919
I have a secret that

36
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,000
I've always wanted to tell you.

37
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,500
I've liked you

38
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,975
for a long time.

39
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,279
Lin Zhixiao,

40
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,880
what are you thinking?

41
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Can you wake up?

42
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,559
Have a good night.

43
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,600
What the heck?

44
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,279
Dr. Gu?

45
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,160
Dr. Gu?

46

I'm here.

47
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,920
Are you still working?

48
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,605
Mm.

49
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,300
I have some things to deal with.

50
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,675
I cooked noodles for you.

51
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,640
Don't forget to eat.

52
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,025
Aren't you hungry?

53
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,279
Not very.

54
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,239
Oh,

55
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,920
when you're done eating,

56
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,760
just leave it there.

57
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,160
Yes.

58
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,279
Got it, Professor.

59
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,399
I know.

60
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:27,920
Yes.

61
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,625
Hi beauty, are you alone?

62
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,679
Cheers?

63
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:43,760
She's not alone.

64
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,550
What are you doing?

65
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:02,375
Excuse me.

66
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,959
You said you're having a date?

67
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,640
Yeah.

68
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,525
An old classmate

69
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:18,200
I haven't seen for years.

70
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,279
All right?

71
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's go.

72
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,399
Wh-what are you doing?

73
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,320
You're needed in the shop.

74
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,880
Go back to work.

75
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,839
What is it?

76
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
I'm the boss.

77
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,880
Do as I asked.

78
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,479
Okay, boss.

79
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,520
But I just don't want to work today.

80
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,950
Fire me if you like.

81
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,925
Okay.

82
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,479
See you tomorrow.

83
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,904
You enjoy it.

84
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,050
But don't drink too much.
Don't get drunk.

85
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,599
Be careful when you come back.

86
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,960
All right, Professor.

87
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,479
Thanks for your help.

88
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,159
We'll talk later.

89
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:21,239
Bye.

90
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,825
Dr. Gu, you're done?

91
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,280
Have you been waiting for me?

92
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:32,525
Mm.

93
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,919
Sorry,

94
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,775
I forgot to tell you.

95
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:36,880
You can rest in my room today.

96
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:38,599
The sheets are

97
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,650
newly changed.

98
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,025
What about you?

99
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:45,525
I… I mean,

100
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:46,799
it's so late.

101
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,000
Aren't you going to bed?

102
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,880
No.

103
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:53,479
It's so late,

104
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:56,325
and you're still working so hard?

105
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,159
It's normal for doctors.

106
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,159
I'm used to it.

107
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,400
I have some files to translate.

108
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:03,875
You go have a rest.

109
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,800
Um…

110
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,350
Let me help you then.

111
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,975
I mean,

112
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,039
I passed CET-4

113
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,719
when I was a freshman.

114
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:16,600
And it was a one-time pass.

115
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,401
I can be of some help.

116
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,280
What are we translating?

117
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,850
Is it on computer or in a book?

118
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,039
In the book, okay.

119
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,575
This? This?

120
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,625
Or this?

121
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,175
Okay.

122
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,450
These are difficult.

123
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,119
It's okay.

124
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,080
I'll look it up.

125
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,225
I'll be quick.

126
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,725
Just wait a minute.

127
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,600
Fluorouracil.

128
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,175
(Fluorouracil)
Fluorouracil?

129
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:10,640
Pyrimidine?

130
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,719
These are all

131
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,479
medical terms.

132
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:17,175
Not like what you learned for CET-4.

133
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:18,599
So it doesn't matter.

134
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,800
Yeah, yeah.

135
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,719
We didn't learn this

136
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,960
in college.

137
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,450
It's okay, just leave it to me.

138
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,599
Go have a rest.

139
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,200
Okay, Dr. Gu, you go ahead.

140
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,275
I'll leave you be.

Dr. Gu,

144
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,200
I cooked egg custard for you.

145
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,250
Eat it before it gets cold.

146
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,640
Too gentle.

147
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,625
This is not you, Lin Zhixiao.

Dr. Gu,

149
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:26,039
I made this for you.

150
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,679
If you don't eat it,

151
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,960
it will be a waste.

152
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,239
This is too much.

153
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,880
Be natural.

154

Don't worry.

158
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,375
I'll be right there.

159
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,760
I have something urgent
in the hospital.

160
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,825
I have to go.

161

I won't be back tonight.

164
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,440
don't forget to close the door

You two haven't changed at all

183
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,500
after coming back from abroad.

184
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,119
It's only three months.

185
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,199
How can we change?

186
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,280
You're still wearing

187
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,439
lovers' clothes every day like before.

188
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,439
So rustic.

189
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,839
Rustic? How?

190
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,319
I think it's great.

191
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,400
Honestly, Jin Shi.

192
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,250
Did Yin Xi force you to wear this?

193
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,719
No.

194
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,050
I wanted to wear this.

195
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,225
Is there any man in the world

196
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,024
who wants to wear a lover's clothes?

197
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,319
There is.

198
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,175
- There is?
- Yeah.

199
00:19:05,175 --> 00:19:06,450
Our Jin Shi does.

200
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,529
So what? So what?

201
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:08,560
Okay, enough.

202
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,640
I haven't seen you for three months.

203
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,475
I can't stand how often
you show affection.

204
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,800
Give me a break.

205
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,040
I think it's pretty.

206
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,950
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

207
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,550
By the way, I haven't asked you yet.

208
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,425
How was yesterday?

209
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,479
What happened yesterday?

210
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:24,425
Nothing, what are you thinking?

211
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:25,760
What?

212
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,880
Things weren't going well with him?

213
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,959
It's okay, tell me.

214
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,250
I can fix it up.

215
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,719
Sansan,

216
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,275
don't you ever give me
this kind of idea again.

217
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,119
We're not the same

218
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,599
kind of people.

219
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,199
Precisely, there's a huge gap

220
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:42,500
between us.

221
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,959
He's so busy

222
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,175
but I can't make any help.

223
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,920
The only thing I can do

224
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,900
is try not to bother him.

225
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,000
It's fine.
I have classes this afternoon.

226
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,075
I'll talk to you later.

227
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,719
I haven't practiced for a month

228
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:01,119
because of my hand.

229
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,900
I have to make up
for what's left behind.

230
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,760
See you.

231
00:20:04,425 --> 00:20:05,280
Let me know

232
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,850
if anything happens.

233
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,599
Bye.

234
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,119
Gossip. Bye.

235
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,119
Bye.

236
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,025
Sansan, Sansan.

237
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,560
What's wrong with Zhixiao?

238
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Who are you talking about?

239
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,800
I'll let her tell you.

240
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,719
- Something's going on.
- Something's going on.

241
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,439
I met someone at the airport.

242
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,160
Who?

243
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,150
- Shao Jiang.
- Shao Jiang.

244
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,359
Shao Jiang is back?

245
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,119
There is gonna be a show.

246
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,025
Zhixiao, long time no see.

247
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,520
How is your hand?

248
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,160
Don't worry, I took medicine
and did rehab.

249
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,280
See? It's recovered.

250
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm resurrected.

251
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,520
The notation I asked you
to keep for me before,

252
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,200
did you keep it for me?

253
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,325
I want to practice now.

254
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,719
Don't be in a rush.

255
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:35,750
You don't know,

256
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,040
our school invited a violinist

257
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,400
who has just won an international award

258
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,225
from abroad to come back for exchange.

259
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,760
I heard he has performances here.

260
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,119
And all his cast members

261
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,479
will be solely decided by him.

262
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,920
The teacher said that

263
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,160
if we do well this time,

264
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,040
we can become his participating members.

265
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,920
Really?

266
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,839
Of course.

267
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,000
Everyone has a chance.

268
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,359
You gotta get ready.

269
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,839
Okay, I'll try.

270
00:21:58,575 --> 00:21:59,875
This opportunity is for

271
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,000
our orchestral team.

272
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:03,920
What does it have to do with you,

273
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,199
triangle girl?

274
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,079
I'm sorry.

275
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,599
I have been transferred back
to the cello department.

276
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,319
Playing the triangle is only temporary.

277
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,560
Besides, my hand is recovered now.

278
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Don't you know it?

279
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:16,125
Your place has been taken.

280
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,959
The cello part is full.

281
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,800
I'm afraid you'll
have to play the triangle

282
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,325
for a while longer.

283
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,319
What do you mean?

284
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,775
Everyone,

285
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:28,760
this is the world-renowned

286
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,425
young violinist,

287
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,319
and your senior, Shao Jiang.

288
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,040
Zhixiao,

289
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,825
once you are admitted
to Huaqing University,

290
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,650
we will ensemble here.

291
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:52,520
Hello everyone, I'm Shao Jiang.

292
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,350
Shao Jiang

293
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:56,599
came to our school for exchange.

294
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:59,075
You must learn from him.

295
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,319
Wei, are you listening to me?

296
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,525
Yeah.

297
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,475
Dr. Yan adopted your plan.

298
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,900
The patient in Bed 47 is really

299
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,339
getting better.

300
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,719
Oh, Wei.

301
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,040
I forgot to tell you.

302
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,560
He bought you a cup of coffee

303
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,725
in the cafeteria today
to express his gratitude.

304
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,175
Um…

305
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:22,400
For this kind of thing,

306
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,225
I didn't bother to let you come back.

307
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,850
So I drank it for you.

308
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:28,280
Wei,

309
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,300
I think Yan Bingjun

310
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,680
is quite professional.

311
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,239
He's just a little arrogant.

312
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,359
But he's a nice guy.

313
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,000
Oh, tomorrow morning's consultation

314
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,920
has been rescheduled to 11:00 AM.

315
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,439
I see.

316
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,920
Lin Zhixiao, you just came back.

317
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,079
You don't have to

318
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,400
participate in this audition.

319
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,675
(Hello, the subscriber you dialed)

320
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,079
(is busy now.)

321
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,400
(Please try again later.)

322
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,250
(I'm sorry, Zhixiao.)

323
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,911
(There are too many things
before the opening.)

324
00:25:14,911 --> 00:25:16,050
(I'll call you later.)

325
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:21,250
(Dr. Gu will only be busier.)

326
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,800
Lin Zhixiao,

327
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,675
what are you thinking about?

328
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:35,275
Shao Jiang.

329
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,325
I smiled at you in the practice room,

330
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,575
but you ignored me.

331
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,825
I thought you'd forgotten about me.

332
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,175
How could I?

333
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,350
It's been a long time.

334
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,079
Long time.

335
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,250
But,

336
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,119
if nothing happened last time,

337
00:26:10,725 --> 00:26:12,199
you would be able to stand on the stage

338
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:13,325
as a cellist, wouldn't you?

339
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,719
It's also a testament to your skill.

340
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,800
Last time it was out of

341
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,350
the teacher's pity for me.

342
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,719
This is

343
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:23,450
their true attitude
and evaluation on me.

344
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:26,319
Zhixiao,

345
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,640
you are rarely so unconfident.

346
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,560
Shao Jiang,

347
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,439
we haven't seen each other
for a long time.

348
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,079
Only a couple of years.

349
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:46,239
I have to make a call.

350
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,400
Hello.

351
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,760
Where are you?

352
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,725
Okay, wait for me.

353
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:04,239
I have a friend with me.

354
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:11,350
I'll take you somewhere.

355
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,800
Hey, Xia.

356
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,040
Shao Jiang, long time no see.

357
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,375
- Long time.
- Long time.

358
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,239
Li,

359
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,920
let's start then.

360
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,300
Yes, come.

361
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,700
This is my friend, Zhixiao.

362
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:27,520
Hello.

363
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,040
Let's play together today.

364
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,425
- Okay.
- Okay, come on up.

365
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,996
Come on.

366
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:37,650
Okay.

367
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,479
We'll start.

368
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,550
Come on.

369
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,650
Here we go.

370
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,475
Come, let's play together.

371
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,079
I'll pass.

372
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:52,239
I'll embarrass myself.

373
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:53,760
It's alright, I'm here with you.

374
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,439
Just have some fun.

375
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:56,760
Come on.

376
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,160
Okay, I'll give it a try.

377
00:28:59,319 --> 00:28:59,950
Come.

378
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,700
(Drink it after work.)

379
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:31,100
(Dr. Gu)

380
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,850
(Dr. Gu)

381
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,160
(The subscriber you dialed)

382
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,640
(is busy now.)

383
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,200
(Lin Zhixiao: Having fun
playing with Jiang!)

384
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,575
How is it?

385
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:18,850
Feels great?

386
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:23,119
I'm just back home.

387
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,775
It'll be my treat, okay?

388
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,079
We had a deal.

389
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:26,800
You…

390
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,439
You can't.

391
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,425
Hello, your dishes are all served.

392
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:32,000
Waitress, can I have Pepsi?

393
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,880
Yes, sir.

394
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,640
One for me, please.

395
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,439
Okay, just a second.

396
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,160
Thanks.

397
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Zhixiao,

398
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,200
make yourself comfortable.

399
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,599
Shao Jiang is our best buddy.

400
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,850
So are you.

401
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,225
How did you guys meet with each other?

402
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:48,719
Xia, we seem to have

403
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:49,640
met each other first, right?

404
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,439
- Yep.
- I've just gone abroad,

405
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,480
and Xia was already at the top

406
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,920
- of the Chinese circle abroad.
- Sir, your Pepsi.

407
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,880
Okay, thank you.

408
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,079
At that time,

409
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,439
he had won all kinds of

410
00:31:58,439 --> 00:31:59,475
international awards.

411
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,875
- Stop it.
- I admired him so much at the time.

412
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,119
I'm impressed.

413
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,000
No, no.

414
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,439
That's in the past already.

415
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,375
Just after that game,

416
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,100
there was a little accident.

417
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
I had a hearing problem.

418
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,599
So I didn't make it my occupation.

419
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,880
Then I came back home.

420
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,239
I'm sorry, I…

421
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:17,199
It's okay.

422
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,359
Anyway,

423
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,959
we are still playing music

424
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:20,719
together,

425
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:21,439
- aren't we?
- Yeah.

426
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,959
- Right?
- We're still playing music.

427
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:23,920
Yeah.

428
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,839
We will go to some other jazz bars

429
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,640
to play in the future.

430
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,040
Come and join us.

431
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,000
That would be

432
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,075
so great!

433
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,160
Oh, right.

434
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,560
We're very curious

435
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,439
on one thing.

436
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,959
Um, Zhixiao,

437
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:41,000
are you Shao Jiang's girlfriend?

438
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:42,040
He…

439
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,839
No, no.

440
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:43,680
This is the first time

441
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,079
he brought a girl to us.

442
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,359
- Isn't it?
- No, no, I'm not.

443
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,439
You've misunderstood.

444
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:48,359
We studied

445
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,959
in the same school.

446
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:52,760
We've just had a reunion

447
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,839
after so many years.

448
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,920
Don't get it wrong.

449
00:32:55,199 --> 00:32:56,280
I'm not.

450
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:57,959
Shao Jiang.

451
00:32:58,239 --> 00:32:59,850
Tell them.

452
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,839
Not for now.

453
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,325
- Not for now.
- Not for now.

454
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,839
- So she will be?
- Yeah.

455
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,439
He likes joking.

456
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:15,079
Don't mind it.

457
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,040
Okay, come on.

458
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
- Come.
- Let's…

459
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
- have another drink.
- Cheers.

460
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:28,640
Are you happy today?

461
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,600
Yeah, very happy.

462
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,719
But I'm not.

463
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,400
Why?

464
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:37,920
You denied it

465
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,850
so hastily.

466
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
You've broken my heart.

467
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,800
I came back for you.

468
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,079
Don't you know it?

469
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,479
Nonsense.

470
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,520
You said this morning that

471
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,599
you came back for the tour.

472
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,400
Do you think I'm a fool?

473
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,599
Did I?

474
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,079
I'm not even eligible to join

475
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,000
the audition of your performance.

476
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,079
Anyway,

477
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,400
since when did you react so fast?

478
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,450
Of course.

479
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,719
I'm not innocent and naive

480
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,959
as I used to be.

481
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:13,350
I have grown up, all right?

482
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,625
And,

483
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,159
I have someone I like now,

484
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,100
but he doesn't seem to like me.

485
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,600
Who is it?

486
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:28,879
Who is so blind?

487
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,100
Tell me,

488
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,080
I'm going to beat him up

489
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,080
to make him sober.

490
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,320
Okay?

491
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,439
Zhixiao,

492
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,750
you look so pretty when you smile.

493
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,275
I hope you'll always be this happy.

494
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,479
Honey, honey.

495
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:31,679
Yeah, what?

496
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,439
You know,

497
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,120
the vegetables are so fresh.

498
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,425
I bought a lot of them.

499
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,639
I'll cook some dishes

500
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,725
when Zhixiao comes back.

501
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,150
(Lin Zhixiao, good night.)

502
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,200
Are you alright?

503
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,280
Yeah, I'm fine.

504
00:36:21,325 --> 00:36:23,080
You are still the same as before.

505
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,879
Trip on the floor, you don't understand.

506
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:26,800
The heroine's skill in TV series.

507
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,840
I did that on purpose.

508
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,600
So I'm your hero then.

509
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:32,225
What?

510
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:33,825
I'm just kidding.

511
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,075
Dr. Gu.

512
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:39,120
Where are you going?

513
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,775
I'm going for a walk after the meal.

514
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:44,700
This is…

515
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,550
Gu Wei. Dr. Gu.

516
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,750
My neighbor.

517
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:49,875
I'm her neighbor.

518
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,550
Hi, nice to meet you.

519
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,000
I'm Lin Zhixiao's senior,

520
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,959
Shao Jiang.

521
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:56,000
Sorry, professional habit.

522
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,199
I don't like shaking hands with people.

523
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,000
Lin Zhixiao,

524
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,800
I heard your voice.

525
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,719
Come home for dinner.

526
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:05,840
Dr. Gu.

527
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,479
Shao Jiang?

528
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:07,719
Auntie, Mr. Lin.

529
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,280
It's been a long time.

530
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:10,840
It's Shao Jiang.

531
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,120
When did you come back?

532
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,280
Two days before.

533
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,250
I wanted to visit you
as soon as I came back.

534
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,800
- Great, great.
- You're getting more handsome.

535
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,120
Hurry up, come on in.

536
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,360
- Dinner is ready.
- Come on in.

537
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,300
Come on.

538
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:22,000
Come on.

539
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,639
Dr. Gu,

540
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,280
do you want to come and join us?

541
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,320
He's had dinner

542
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,275
and is ready to go for a walk.

543
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:29,725
Yes, thanks.

544
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,800
I'm a little hungry.

545
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,159
I can do a rehabilitation

546
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,320
check with Mr. Lin.

547
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,239
That would be great. Come on.

548
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,000
- Please come in.
- Sorry for the trouble.

549
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,975
Come and join us.

550
00:37:41,975 --> 00:37:43,919
You've grown taller.

551
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:45,400
Have I? How is that possible?

552
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,475
The last dish, old duck soup.

553
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:51,320
Let me shred it.

554
00:37:51,825 --> 00:37:53,120
Zhixiao, distribute it to everyone.

555
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,000
Okay.

556
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,760
Mr. Lin, this is for you.

557
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,199
Okay, thank you.

558
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:01,000
And this one…

559
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,080
Give it to Dr. Gu. He's a guest.

560
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:11,325
No need.

561
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:12,879
I have eaten it many times.

562
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,320
I'll have many chances to eat it.

563
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:20,360
Dr. Gu, take it.

564
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,959
Ms. Li didn't cook it
last time you came.

565
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:22,679
This is her specialty.

566
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:23,625
Have a try.

567
00:38:25,275 --> 00:38:27,959
Your favorite sweet and sour pork ribs.

568
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:29,479
- Thank you, auntie.
- I still remember it.

569
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,625
Smells so great.

570
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:34,399
I dreamed of eating this

571
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,900
when I was abroad.

572
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,600
So delicious.

573
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:42,900
- Okay.
- Auntie.

574
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,600
To be honest,

575
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,125
I think you're getting younger.

576
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,000
Really.

577
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,120
If you have any maintenance tips,

578
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,199
be sure to share them with my mom.

579
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,760
She will be thrilled.

580
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
You're still my favorite, Shao Jiang.

581
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,760
If only

582
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,000
you were my son!

583
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,600
I'll be satisfied

584
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,575
in my life.

585
00:39:01,575 --> 00:39:02,450
How about this?

586
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,700
Be my son-in-law.

587
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,360
Ms. Li, what are you talking about?

588
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,719
What's wrong?

589
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,080
I'm just kidding.

590
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,400
It's not funny at all.

591
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,719
Mr. Lin, for you.

592
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:27,925
- Good. Good.
- Mr. Lin,

593
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,719
lotus root is too hard for you.

594
00:39:29,775 --> 00:39:31,080
Drink more soup instead.

595
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,000
Honey, take the doctor's advice.

596
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,700
Is there anything wrong with Mr. Lin?

597
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:38,800
No… nothing.

598
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,639
Stomach ulcer.

599
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,399
An old problem.

600
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:42,800
You know it.

601
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,399
I have something to ask you.

602
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:46,600
Why didn't you call

603
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,080
when you were abroad?

604
00:39:48,325 --> 00:39:49,239
What happened to you?

605
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,479
It's my fault.

606
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:52,360
I was under pressure when I was out.

607
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,479
And I didn't make any achievements.

608
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:54,475
I couldn't relax,

609
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,525
so I didn't contact you.

610
00:39:56,525 --> 00:39:57,280
But this time,

611
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,600
I'll stay for a long time.

612
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:00,040
And I will

613
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
come to visit often

614
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,320
to see you and auntie.

615
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:03,760
That's great.

616
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,600
You're thoughtful.

617
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,639
I know you are a young man

618
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,520
with ambitions and aspirations.

619
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,875
But you have to take care of yourself

620
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,320
when you are outside.

621
00:40:13,675 --> 00:40:14,959
- Exactly.
- Have a good rest between work.

622
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:15,800
- Yeah.
- Right?

623
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,225
Otherwise, your parents
would be worried.

624
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:18,840
- Right?
- Yes.

625
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,525
I will.

626
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,025
Jiang,

627
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,950
since you're back,

628
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,360
keep an eye on Zhixiao

629
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,199
and help her with her studies.

630
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,399
Don't worry about this.

631
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:29,280
Sure thing.

632
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,675
He helped me a lot today.

633
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,560
It's nothing.

634
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,280
Don't just sit, hurry up

635
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,159
and eat.

636
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,225
Eat more.

637
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,120
Jiang,

638
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,679
what's wrong with your hand?

639
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:51,560
It was…

640
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:52,959
rubbed by the

641
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:54,840
the violin case today, it's alright.

642
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,775
Come on, let me see.

643
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,679
Your hand.

644
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,870
It's cut quite deep.

645
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,040
It's okay.

646
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:01,639
Dr. Gu, can you take a look?

647
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,959
It's so convenient
to have a doctor around.

648
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:04,840
Mom.

649
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,520
It's nothing.

650
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,000
How can we trouble Dr. Gu?

651
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,959
I'll manage it myself.

652
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:10,000
That medical kit is still
in the same place, right?

653
00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:11,040
Yes.

654
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:12,725
You know Mr. Lin.

655
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:14,400
He always puts things back
where he took them.

656
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,159
OK, I'll deal with it myself.

657
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:16,959
Can you do it?

658
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:17,719
Yeah.

659
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,280
Jiang is getting

660
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,919
more and more handsome.

661
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,275
Do you remember when he used to

662
00:41:27,425 --> 00:41:29,350
live with us and refused to leave?

663
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,000
He played with Zhixiao every day.

664
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,879
And Zhixiao said to me

665
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:35,500
that she'd marry Shao Jiang
when she grew up.

666
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,239
Ms. Li.

667
00:41:38,975 --> 00:41:40,760
I never said this.

668
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,399
Dr. Gu is still here.

669
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,050
I'm not making things up.

670
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,919
Besides, Dr. Gu is no stranger.

671
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:46,950
You won't mind, will you?

672
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:48,875
See?

673
00:41:48,975 --> 00:41:50,639
I was just telling the truth.

674
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,320
Jiang,

675
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,000
do you remember?

676
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,840
I took a lot of photos of you

677
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,199
when you were young.

678
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:57,075
I don't remember.

679
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:58,080
I do.

680
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,919
See?

681
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,280
Jiang still remembers it.

682
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,950
If you don't,

683
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,800
I'll show you the photo album later.

684
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,700
- No need.
- So you can recall it.

685
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:06,560
- Zhixiao will be unhappy.
- She was very fat then.

686
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,959
She surely doesn't want you to see it.

687
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:08,825
I…

688
00:42:09,479 --> 00:42:10,225
Dr. Gu,

689
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:12,520
do you want to take a look?

690
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:16,275
Mr. Lin, I suddenly remembered

691
00:42:16,275 --> 00:42:17,775
I still have work to do.

692
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,000
So maybe next time.

693
00:42:19,525 --> 00:42:20,360
Yeah,

694
00:42:21,399 --> 00:42:22,159
Dr. Gu is busy with work.

695
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:23,250
- Time is precious for him.
- Yes.

696
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,150
Go back and rest early

697
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,525
after dinner.

698
00:42:26,439 --> 00:42:27,775
Hurry up and eat.

699
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,360
- Go on, eat.
- Come on, eat.

700
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,800
Come, have more.

701
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,250
- Thank you, auntie.
- Make yourself at home.

702
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,100
Are these ribs good?

703
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,525
So good.

704
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,199
Jiang, come here often
when you have time.

705
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:48,425
Of course.

706
00:43:10,575 --> 00:43:11,879
(Tegafur Capsules)
Jiang is really tall

707
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:13,750
(Tegafur Capsules)
and handsome.

708
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,560
(Unresectable locally advanced)
Do you remember when he used to

709
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,520
(or metastatic gastric cancer)
live with us and refused to leave?

710
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,239
And Zhixiao liked him very much.

711
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:19,520
She told me,

712
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,959
"Mom, when I grow up,

713
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,080
(Tegafur Capsules)
I want to marry Jiang".

714
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:23,959
Do you remember?

715
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:25,825
I don't remember. Ms. Li.

716
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,675
Lin Zhixiao.

717
00:43:38,675 --> 00:43:39,525
Yes?

718
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:40,450
=The Oath of Love=
Can I ask you a question?

719
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,250
=The Oath of Love=
No interview.

720
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,350
=The Oath of Love=
Lin Zhixiao, tell me…

721
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,250
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theater)
I'm in a bad mood.

722
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,350
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theater)
Why are you wearing so many clothes?

723
00:43:46,225 --> 00:43:47,249
Your cutie pie

724
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,925
suddenly appeared in front of you.

725
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:49,900
Tell me,

726
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,900
why didn't you ever like or comment on

727
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,975
my WeChat moments?

728
00:43:53,525 --> 00:43:55,975
I did.

729
00:43:55,975 --> 00:43:56,800
You didn't.

730
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,825
I did, you missed it.

731
00:43:58,825 --> 00:44:00,527
No, not at all.

732
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,852
I did.

733
00:44:01,852 --> 00:44:03,450
No, why didn't you?

734
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,550
I didn't?

735
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,300
Don't you lie to me.
I have a good memory.

736
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,777
How good?

737
00:44:09,777 --> 00:44:10,600
Very good.

738
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,158
I have memorized

739
00:44:12,158 --> 00:44:13,900
all your school rules.

740
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:16,869
Don't you really know

741
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:17,999
why I didn't like your moments?

742
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:18,800
What do you mean?

743
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,562
Open your moments

744
00:44:19,562 --> 00:44:20,744
and see what you have posted.

745
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,294
- That something…
- What?

746
00:44:22,294 --> 00:44:24,475
Diseased intestines, ulcerated stomach,

747
00:44:24,575 --> 00:44:25,950
how could I give you a thumb-up?

748
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,647
I feel like watching a horror movie
every time I open it.

749
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:28,396
Okay?

750
00:44:28,775 --> 00:44:30,450
Do you think it's just me?
Let me tell you,

751
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,850
your colleagues have blocked you.

752
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Even Du told me…

753
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:35,968
What?

754
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:38,053
He said your Moments
affect his appetite,

755
00:44:38,053 --> 00:44:39,455
so he blocked it.

756
00:44:39,455 --> 00:44:40,407
Didn't he tell you?

757
00:44:42,775 --> 00:44:43,950
What's wrong?

758
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,550
I'm leaving. I'm not happy.

759
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:47,500
Don't.

760
00:44:47,825 --> 00:44:49,300
I'll go reflect on myself.

761
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,014
- No, no, I'm joking.
- I'll make self-reflection.

762
00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:52,475
I'll like your posts, okay?

763
00:44:52,475 --> 00:44:53,750
Every day.

764
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:55,300
- You promise.
- I'll do it.

765
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,475
Do it now.

766
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:57,899
Now.

767
00:44:58,075 --> 00:44:59,025
Not enough.

768
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,046
Okay now?

769
00:45:02,046 --> 00:45:03,325
- Okay.
- Do not be angry.

770
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:04,800
All right.

771
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,200
What are we having for dinner?

772
00:45:06,775 --> 00:45:07,991
Salmon Salad.

773
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:09,225
I'm on a diet lately.

774
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:11,200
I bought you some.
