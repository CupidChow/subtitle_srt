Are you his family member?

19
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,160
Not yet,

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
but soon will be.

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,910
Then you can come again when you are.

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,510
Since you don't agree,

23
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,310
it's okay.

24
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,550
I'll just come back again

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,040
with Auntie or Zhixiao.

26
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,760
You won't be able

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,760
to say no by then, right?

28
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,310
Gu Wei.

29
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,440
It's up to the patient and his family

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,190
whether he can go abroad for treatment.

31
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,160
What we can do is respect them.

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,190
I know.

33
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,550
Then why don't you agree?

34
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,470
Gao Xi.

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,520
Regarding the hospital regulations...

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,320
Gu Wei!

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,080
You care too much about the patient,

38
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,190
no,

39
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,880
the patient's family member.

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,550
Don't you think so?

41
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,440
I'll go make rounds.

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,750
Okay.

43
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,240
(Lin Zhixiao)
Dr. Gu!

44
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,470
(Lin Zhixiao)
The patient in Bed 29

45
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,320
wants to see you.

46
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,390
Okay, he's coming now.

47
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,630
How is the lovely breakfast I made?

48
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,670
It took me a lot of effort
to prepare it.

49
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,800
No one is eating it.

50
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,880
My feelings are hurt.

51
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,600
A family doesn't hold grudges

52
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,080
overnight, right?

53
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,270
I have to criticize you, Lin.

54
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,630
What was wrong with you yesterday?

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,440
Don't you know

56
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,190
that nothing hurts more than words?

57
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,630
What you said

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
is like a knife

59
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,910
pricking our hearts.

60
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,880
How could we not feel hurt?

61
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,600
And you, Ms. Li.

62
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,800
Lin is a patient.

63
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,240
How could you treat a patient like that?

64
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,960
Right?

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,160
You two

66
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,960
love each other so much,

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and care for each other.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,960
Why do you

69
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
have to fight?

70
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,910
You're like two kids.

71
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,320
I think

72
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,800
you're even less sensible than kids.

73
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,470
So, I decided

74
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,240
that from now on I will make decisions

75
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,470
in this family.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,550
You'll make decisions?

77
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,550
I mean,

78
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,720
there is no rush

79
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,240
to decide whether we should go abroad.

80
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,470
We can make a decision

81
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,320
after we discuss it together.

82
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,360
Okay?

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,000
There you go.

84
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Come on. Let's eat.

85
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,880
It took me a while

86
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,670
to make the porridge.

87
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,190
Don't break my heart.

88
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,740
(I'll meet you at the usual place.)

89
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,000
All right, two kids.

90
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,190
Well,

91
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,630
I gotta go to school now.

92
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,240
You two behave well.

93
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,230
No more fighting.

94
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you hear me?

95
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,640
A good man won't let

96
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,320
the woman he loves shed a tear.

97
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,480
Come on, Lin.

98
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,200
The small steamed buns

99
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,070
smell good.

100
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,790
They do smell good.

101
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,720
How about

102
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,950
having one while it's still hot?

103
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,720
Have one.

104
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,160
Here.

105
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,040
Yesterday,

106
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,950
it was my bad.

107
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,200
I'll never

108
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,160
say that again.

109
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,320
Don't take it to heart.

110
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,110
Am I doing this for myself?

111
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,790
I'm doing this for your good!

112
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,390
I know it's for my good.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,670
Don't cry. Don't cry.

114
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,480
It was my bad.

115
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,350
All right.

116
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,550
All right.

117
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,600
Do me the honor. Have one.

118
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,830
Be careful, it's hot.

119
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,670
It's delicious.

120
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,000
We should eat it while it's hot.

121
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,390
The porridge tastes good.

122
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,830
My waist...

123
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,000
What's wrong with your waist?

124
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,110
Well,

125
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,480
it doesn't feel well

126
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,110
after sleeping on the couch
the whole night.

127
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,390
Just eat.

128
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,110
I'll rub it for you after breakfast.

129
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,670
Really?

130
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,230
Shao Jiang!

131
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,550
Shao Jiang.

132
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,110
Why do you want

133
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,830
to meet me here?

134
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,000
I have a class later.

135
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,390
Well,

136
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,440
can't I meet you

137
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,390
only because I want to talk to you?

138
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,880
Don't be silly.

139
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Of course you can.

140
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,040
Do you remember the time

141
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,950
when you were a sophomore in high school
and I was a freshman in college?

142
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,550
You didn't study hard at that time,

143
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,950
and you dragged me here all the time.

144
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,350
I also skipped school

145
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,110
for you.

146
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,270
I was thoughtless

147
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,510
back then,

148
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,600
and I bothered you a lot.

149
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,670
Zhixiao.

150
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,790
You never used

151
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,600
to say something like this.

152
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,600
At that time,

153
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,110
I was

154
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,350
self-centered

155
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,600
and childish.

156
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,390
I did what I wanted,

157
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,230
and I never thought

158
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,110
about other people's feelings.

159
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,480
You did what you wanted.

160
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,230
So,

161
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,200
you wanted to see me

162
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,670
every day at that time?

163
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,880
Zhixiao, I never felt like

164
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,760
you were

165
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,070
bothering me.

166
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,670
I would love to see you.

167
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,270
Although

168
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,720
we didn't keep in touch
over these years,

169
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,790
I still know a lot of things

170
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,510
about you.

171
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,760
I always thought
you were still the same.

172
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,000
But after I came back this time,

173
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,670
I think you've changed a lot.

174
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,230
Have I changed a lot?

175
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,710
Maybe I didn't change much

176
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,110
over the last four years.

177
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,080
But after Lin fell ill,

178
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,550
I did change a little bit.

179
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,200
I grew up and became mature.

180
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,350
Zhixiao.

181
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,840
I wasn't around in the last four years.

182
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,440
Actually, I went abroad...

183
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,640
You are a musical genius.

184
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,670
Going abroad

185
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,280
to study in one of the top music schools

186
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,840
is a rare opportunity.

187
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,350
If I were you,

188
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,590
I would have also left school right away

189
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,520
to further my study.

190
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,670
No, I mean,

191
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,150
I didn't tell you

192
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,230
before I left

193
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,640
because I thought you were too little

194
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,710
and you had exams to take, so...

195
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,280
But I've always regretted it

196
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,030
over these years.

197
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,520
You don't have to explain
all this to me.

198
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,760
It's okay, Shao Jiang.

199
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
You were not obligated to tell me

200
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,230
that you were going abroad, right?

201
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,670
Instead, I should be thanking you.

202
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,150
I started to like music

203
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,110
because of your encouragement.

204
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,400
You're the reason I was admitted
to the music department.

205
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,080
If it weren't for you,

206
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,840
I guess

207
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,670
I don't know what I would be doing now.

208
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,880
Some time ago,

209
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,840
you took me to the jazz bar

210
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,030
and helped me get back my confidence.

211
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:53,960
I mean it.

212
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,790
I have to thank you for that.

213
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,670
I can't talk to you anymore.

214
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,670
Otherwise,

215
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,760
I'm going to miss the class again.

216
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,880
If I skip class again,

217
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm not going to be able to graduate.

218
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,280
Alright.

219
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,640
I wasn't going to make you skip class.

220
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,640
The reason I asked you out

221
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,030
is still

222
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,470
about Mr. Lin's going abroad.

223
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,710
Well,

224
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,910
what does Mr. Lin think about this?

225
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,150
If he decides to go,

226
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,030
I'll start

227
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,150
getting things ready,

228
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,230
and make appointments

229
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,470
with the experts over there.

230
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,030
Shao Jiang, thank you
for everything you've done.

231
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,880
I appreciate it.

232
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,400
But I think

233
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,470
we still need to discuss it.

234
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,840
I can't give you an answer right now.

235
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,200
Just give us a little more time,

236
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,840
okay?

237
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,760
Okay, I see.

238
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,080
You should go to class now.

239
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,590
I'll pick you up after class

240
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,910
and send you home.

241
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,200
Send me home?

242
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,470
To tell you more

243
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,590
about the details
of getting treatment abroad.

244
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,230
Okay, I'm gonna go to class.

245
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:51,790
Go ahead.

246
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,110
Bye-bye.

247
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,840
Bye-bye.

248
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,880
Zhixiao!

249
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,400
You don't have to treat me

250
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,320
as an outsider.

251
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,200
You can just say and do

252
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,080
whatever you want

253
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,350
like you did as a kid.

254
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,520
Okay?

255
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,440
Okay.

256
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,640
Wei, have you eaten?

257
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,350
Not yet.

258
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,030
You've been working all day

259
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,350
and had two big operations.

260
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,200
Even the iron man can't stand it.

261
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,280
Why don't you take a nap in the lounge

262
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,960
before you go back?

263
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,030
I'm used to it.

264
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,790
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

265
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,400
Come on.

266
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,030
I understand what you said.

267
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,710
I need to discuss it with them
when I'm back.

268
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:57,910
Okay.

269
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,640
Feel free to ask me
what you don't understand,

270
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,200
even if it's a medical problem.

271
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,200
I see.

272
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,670
Go up. I'm leaving.

273
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,350
Shao Jiang.

274
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,000
(Why are you still)

275
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,110
(petting me on the head?)

276
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,150
You messed up my hair.

277
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,000
It's been a habit for years,

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,110
and it's hard to change it.

279
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,200
I'm leaving.

280
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,840
Bye-bye.

281
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,400
(Regarding the patient's condition,)

282
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,960
(I'll only talk to the patient)

283
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,880
(and his family members.)

284
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,960
You're doing it again!

285
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,440
(Are you his family member?)

286
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,590
Not yet,

287
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,400
but soon will be.

288
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,840
Wei.

289
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,350
Something is wrong.

290
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,670
You're a busy man.

291
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,110
But you're not at the hospital
or at home,

292
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,790
instead, you're sitting here
like a statue.

293
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,400
Something is wrong.

294
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,150
What's bothering you?

295
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,080
Tell me about it.

296
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,400
Are you dumped?

297
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,320
I think,

298
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,910
in all likelihood, you're dumped.

299
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,710
Men like you

300
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,000
who fall in love at older ages

301
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,910
are most vulnerable to emotional pain.

302
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,670
Is it because of

303
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,960
Lin Zhixiao?

304
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,470
Don't tell me

305
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,550
it's really because of Lin Zhixiao!

306
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,840
What's going on?

307
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,910
She left you

308
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,320
for that pretty boy?

309
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,200
Well, well, Lin Zhixiao!

310
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,910
Does she have the worst taste in men?

311
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,230
Except for being younger than you,

312
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,030
that lad

313
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,030
is no match for you!

314
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,320
I can't believe it.

315
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,150
No one will think you're dumb

316
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,550
even you don't talk.

317
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,280
Man, it's just a girl.

318
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,880
It's not a big deal.

319
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,110
Listen to me.

320
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,320
I'll make you

321
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,910
get over her totally.

322
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,790
Let's go.

323
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,840
Don't touch me
if you didn't wash your hands.

324
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,150
Wei.

325
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:25,710
What's the use

326
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,200
of getting upset here?

327
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,880
Maybe Lin Zhixiao

328
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,550
is having a good time

329
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,030
with that lad.

330
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,640
And also, Wei.

331
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,520
It's dirty here.

332
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,550
We haven't cleaned it.

333
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,440
I've cleaned up that place for you.

334
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,820
(Dr. Gu)
(Thank you, Dr. Gu.)

335
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,100
(You recalled a message.)

336
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,280
(The medical service there)

337
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
(is top-notch.)

338
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,550
(I think)

339
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,910
(getting treatment there)

340
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,030
(will help Mr. Lin a lot.)

341
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,910
(I'm getting good treatment here,)

342
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,840
(why should I go abroad?)

343
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,150
(There's such a good chance.)

344
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,350
(Of course, we should try it.)

345
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,880
(Other people can't go
even if they want to.)

346
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,440
(I'm telling you, I'm not going!)

347
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,440
(It's worth it no matter
how much money it takes)

348
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,880
(to cure you.)

349
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,400
(If he decides to go,)

350
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,280
(I'll start)

351
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,200
(getting things ready,)

352
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,590
(and make appointments)

353
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,790
(with the experts over there.)

354
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,640
Wei, why are you not enjoying this?

355
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,640
This is how you're preparing

356
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,080
for the opening tomorrow?

357
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,110
No.

358
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,030
I called my friends here to have a party

359
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,150
before the opening.

360
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,150
There's nothing wrong with that.

361
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,110
I mainly threw this party

362
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,880
for you, so that you can have fun

363
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,440
and forget about all your troubles!

364
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,350
All right?

365
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,230
I'm leaving.

366
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,150
No, no, no!

367
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,230
Come over!

368
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,030
Hurry, come on.

369
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,960
Well,

370
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,230
let me introduce someone to you.

371
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,110
This is my brother, a doctor with a PhD!

372
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,910
You can come to him when you are sick!

373
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,400
He is handsome and he can cure!

374
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,200
He can do anything!

375
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,640
You're so handsome.

376
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,590
Gu Xiao, why didn't you

377
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,640
introduce him to us before?

378
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,580
(Lin Zhixiao)

379
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,740
(Lin Zhixiao)

380
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,710
Come on, have a drink.

381
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,150
Have some.

382
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,710
(Lin Zhixiao)
(I'm busy.)

383
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,840
Do me a favor.

384
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,000
- Come on, come on.
- Do me a favor.

385
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,070
- Let's drink together.
- Have a drink with us.

386
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,860
(Gu: I'm busy.)

387
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,040
Gu Xiao!

388
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,830
Get over here!

389
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,640
I'm coming. I'm coming.

390
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,830
I've been working hard all day.

391
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,950
I just got back from the store

392
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,590
and here you are

393
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,070
throwing a party and drinking!

394
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,950
Who will clean this up
for the opening tomorrow?

395
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,430
I will, I'll clean it!

396
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,520
How dare you throw a party!

397
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,110
How dare you drink!

398
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,520
Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

399
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,310
No. No!

400
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,310
My brother is here.

401
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,040
My brother.

402
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,070
Your brother?

403
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,800
Over there.

404
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,950
Handsome, have a drink.

405
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,280
Come on, let's drink.

406
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,310
Have a drink with us.

407
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,880
Come on, come on.

408
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,040
It's okay.

409
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,710
Just have some.

410
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,640
Have some more.

411
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,430
Come on, come on.

412
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,070
Just have a glass of wine.

413
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,430
Just a little bit.

414
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,760
I'll be here

415
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,400
tomorrow morning at 9:00 to check it.

416
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,710
You'll be dead
if you don't clean this up!

417
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,040
Sorry.

418
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,640
Have you been working out?

419
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,590
Your skin looks great.

420
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,230
Yeah.

421
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,110
Here's the wine!

422
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,280
Drink them all today!

423
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,920
What's going on?

424
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,800
What happened?

425
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,110
Gu Xiao.

426
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,680
Why did your brother leave?

427
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,560
My brother left,
so I'll drink with you then!

428
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,470
Okay?

429
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That's more like it.

430
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,830
Come on. Let's go over there!

431
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,680
Let's go!

432
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,880
Tomorrow, tomorrow is the opening!

433
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,590
Have a great time tonight!

434
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,940
(Schedule The cafe opening All day)

435
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,180
(Sansan)
(Congratulations. I'll be there soon.)

436
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,430
There are desserts inside.

437
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,430
- You brought us a gift.
- Sansan.

438
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,000
- Zhixiao!
- You don't have to bring a gift.

439
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,160
Congratulations, Sansan.

440
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,070
Congratulations on the opening.
This is for you.

441
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,400
Thank you.

442
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,760
Wei.

443
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,560
Congratulations.

444
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Sansan, congratulations.

445
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,830
Hello, Dr. Gu.

446
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,430
I'll go in first.

447
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,800
Lin Zhixiao.

448
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,040
Lin Zhixiao!

449
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,310
Dr. Gu, what's the matter?

450
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,520
Let's talk.

451
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,070
About what?

452
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,920
About your father.

453
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,070
Let's go over there.

454
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Are you taking Mr. Lin

455
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
abroad for treatment?

456
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,160
How do you know that?

457
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,070
Mr. Lin's recovering well

458
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,160
after the operation.

459
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,760
After two rounds of chemotherapy,

460
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,400
he is getting better now.

461
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,430
We are supposed

462
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,640
to continue consolidation therapy now.

463
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,070
If you take him

464
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,470
abroad for treatment now,

465
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,110
it will waste a lot of time.

466
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,160
It won't necessarily be a good thing.

467
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,280
First of all,

468
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,470
I'm open to another option.

469
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,540
There are many ways
of inspection over there.

470
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,680
Most importantly,

471
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,640
there are some experimental
targeted drugs

472
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,760
that I think

473
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,800
are suitable for Mr. Lin's condition.

474
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,640
Who told you that?

475
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,590
Shao Jiang.

476
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,880
He told me a lot more.

477
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,470
I don't think he knows much

478
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,640
about medical treatment

479
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
as a layman.

480
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,280
He knows it well,

481
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,000
and he gave me a lot of information,

482
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,190
all authoritative information.

483
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,950
Do you trust him that much?

484
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,560
Why shouldn't I trust him?

485
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,950
He has been looking out for me

486
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,040
the whole time.

487
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,160
The main thing is

488
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,110
I can find him anytime

489
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,280
when I want to ask him something.

490
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,590
Your father's treatment

491
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,590
is a matter of life and death.

492
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,590
Please don't be sentimental

493
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,350
and make

494
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,070
childish and reckless decisions.

495
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,830
What do you mean by that,

496
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,830
Dr. Gu?

497
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,950
Are you saying

498
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm making decisions blindly

499
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,520
without looking out

500
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,470
for my father's health,

501
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,110
right?

502
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,160
I'm saying

503
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,430
you can ask me,

504
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,310
your father's attending doctor,

505
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,400
about his treatment,

506
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,350
instead of listening

507
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,000
to a layman.

508
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,160
Ask you?

509
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,350
You've been so busy, Dr. Gu.

510
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,640
How dare I ask you?

511
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,230
Please come in.

512
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,430
- Take a look around.
- Take a look.

513
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,520
Isn't it great?

514
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,560
Well done.

515
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,590
Do you want this?

516
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,640
Your juice.

517
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,560
Thank you. Thank you.

518
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,400
Do you want to eat this?

519
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Not now.

520
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Sansan. Sansan!

521
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,430
Where is my brother?

522
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,000
Did Lin Zhixiao whisk him away?

523
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,310
What are you talking about?

524
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,160
Who whisked whom?

525
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,640
I'm gonna go find my brother.

526
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,350
You guys have fun here.

527
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,000
All right.

528
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,880
I want you two

529
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,590
to explain it.

530
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,560
Why are you late?

531
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,430
It must be his fault.

532
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,590
My fault.

533
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,830
What did you do, Jin Shi?

534
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I put on makeup this morning
and got late.

535
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,430
I called you yesterday.

536
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,560
You told me you were busy.

537
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,400
Sansan sent me this picture.

538
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,160
I saw it.

539
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,520
You were busy,

540
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,470
busy drinking and having fun.

541
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,520
You are such a good doctor.

542
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,280
What's wrong with drinking?

543
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,350
Can't a doctor drink?

544
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,040
I'm running a bar here.

545
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,160
Who are you to him?

546
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,590
What does it have to do with you?

547
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,160
Gu Xiao.

548
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,640
Yeah.

549
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
I'm no one to him.

550
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,070
I'm nobody.

551
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,640
Dr. Gu, since you're so busy,

552
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,830
I won't bother you

553
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,880
with my family affairs.

554
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,040
And also,

555
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,280
I'm going to take my dad abroad

556
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,590
for treatment.

557
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,640
Shao Jiang has arranged
everything for us.

558
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,950
We can leave at any time.

559
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,430
Whatever you want.

560
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,880
Thank you for your time.

561
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,160
Isn't Lin Zhixiao also here?

562
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,000
Where is she?

563
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,520
- I'm leaving.
- Zhixiao.

564
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,470
What's wrong?

565
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,760
I'm fine. I'm fine.

566
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,000
How dare Dr. Gu treat you like that?

567
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,040
I'll teach him a lesson!

568
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,640
He didn't do anything.

569
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,880
Don't teach him a lesson.

570
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,110
I'm no one to him anyway.

571
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,920
I have no right to be angry or upset.

572
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
You guys have fun.

573
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,880
I'll leave first.

574
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,040
Zhixiao!

575
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,800
Zhixiao...

576
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,160
What are you doing?

577
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,520
Are you taking it out on my glass?

578
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm sorry.

579
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,640
I didn't do it on purpose.

580
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,830
It's on Gu Xiao.

581
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,430
You had to send the picture.

582
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,760
Pay close attention

583
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,310
to Zhang Daguo on Bed 19

584
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,040
when you put him on a drip.

585
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,000
Okay.

586
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,000
Dr. Gu, you're back.

587
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,830
I was just looking for you.

588
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,760
You have a clinical conference

589
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,430
this afternoon,

590
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,040
and a just added operation

591
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,160
at night...

592
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,830
Xu.

593
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,000
It's me, Gu Wei.

594
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
Are you still abroad?

595
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,560
Well,

596
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,920
I'd like to consult with you

597
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,190
about medical treatment abroad.

598
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,520
Yeah, yeah. Please go ahead.

599
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,800
Yes.

600
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,430
Gastric cancer.

601
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,350
Yes, that's right.

602
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,590
Please look it up for me.

603
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,070
Call me

604
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,190
if there's any news.

605
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,470
As soon as possible.

606
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,560
I'm in a hurry.

607
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,800
Go do your thing.

608
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,640
You guys have fun.

609
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,400
Okay. Okay.

610
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,280
Lin Zhixiao and my brother

611
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,880
are adults.

612
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,070
Let them

613
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,400
deal with their own problems.

614
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,190
There are many friends.

615
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:36,950
waiting for us.

616
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,590
Let's go.

617
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,950
(Opening Ceremony)
Be careful.

618
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,680
Bro, I'm leaving.

619
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:56,800
Bye-bye, bro!

620
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,400
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

621
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Take care!

622
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,350
Gu Xiao, I'm leaving!

623
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,110
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

624
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,920
Bye-bye.

625
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,280
Thank you, Gu Xiao,

626
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,110
Call me.

627
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,350
Stay safe. Take care.

628
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,190
Dangdang.

629
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:06,950
Gu Xiao.

630
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,310
Bye-bye.

631
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,350
Stay safe, you guys.

632
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,710
Bye-bye!

633
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,590
Locked.

634
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,940
(San Gu Cafe)

635
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,400
Mr. Gu

636
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,430
is lucky in love affairs.

637
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,880
They are not as pretty as you.

638
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,310
Of course. I know.

639
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,560
What do you think

640
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,830
of me?

641
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,280
You...

642
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,190
Look closely.

643
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,160
Creamer, cube sugar,

644
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,680
granulated sugar, cream,

645
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,190
coconut milk, and fresh milk.

646
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,110
There are 370 boxes in total.

647
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,280
I need you to do the inventory check

648
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,190
in the storeroom.

649
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,070
Okay.

650
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,800
What?

651
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,230
Sexual harassment in the workplace?

652
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,350
You're doing this again.

653
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

654
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,230
Last night.

655
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,230
Last night?

656
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,430
Don't play dumb.

657
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,230
Last night...

658
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,800
I drank too much last night.

659
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,560
After I went back,

660
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,070
I got up and threw up several times
in the middle of the night.

661
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,590
I'm still having a headache.

662
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,680
I really can't

663
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,470
drink that much again.

664
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,760
It feels awful.

665
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,110
But what does it have to do with you?

666
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,680
You...

667
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,590
Did you go home alone yesterday?

668
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,760
Otherwise?

669
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,560
Gu Xiao.

670
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,590
Did you drink too much

671
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,710
and fool around with someone else,

672
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,830
and you mistook her for me?

673
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,160
(Dr. Gu, since you're so busy,)

674
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,400
(I won't bother you)

675
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,430
(with my family affairs.)

676
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,640
(I'm going to take my dad abroad
for treatment.)

677
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,430
(Shao Jiang has arranged
everything for us.)

678
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,920
(We can leave at any time.)

679
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,950
(Whatever you want.)

680
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,070
Hello.

681
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,950
(Is this Miss Lin?)

682
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,190
(I'm Du Wenjun.)

683
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,310
Dr. Du.

684
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,710
(What's the matter?)

685
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,190
Well,

686
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,430
our hospital thinks

687
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,300
(Notes)
the preparation for treatment abroad

688
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,000
(Notes)
can't be done

689
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,880
(Notes)
overnight.

690
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,310
Out of consideration
for the patient's condition,

691
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,560
we suggest Mr. Lin Jianguo

692
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,190
get hospitalized for treatment first.

693
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,640
It is not too late to make plans

694
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,520
until the referral

695
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,950
is properly arranged.

696
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,040
Dr. Du.

697
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,710
Who

698
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,400
asked you to say that?

699
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,710
Hurry, what else should I say?

700
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,520
I...

701
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,280
Thank you for reminding me, Dr. Du.

702
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,190
I see.

703
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,980
(Lin Zhixiao)

704
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,800
Dr. Gu.

705
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,760
Does that mean

706
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,070
yes

707
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,190
or no?

708
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,680
It's okay. Go to work.

709
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,760
All right.

710
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,040
The patient's wound has been coated

711
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,000
(Keep Quiet)
with anti-inflammatory drugs.

712
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,920
Let me know

713
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,880
if anything happens.

714
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,190
Okay.

715
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,950
Dr. Gu Wei.

716
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,880
Lin Jianguo's here for chemotherapy.

717
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,040
Do you want to take a look?

718
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,280
No hurry.

719
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,680
I'll go after finishing the rounds.

720
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,830
Okay.

721
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,760
What was wrong with my brain?

722
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,880
I checked again and again,

723
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,640
but I still forgot

724
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,830
the melamine spoon.

725
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,310
It's okay.

726
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,680
I'll go out and buy one later.

727
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,800
Well, I'll go back

728
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,760
to get it.

729
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,160
Are you going back for a spoon?

730
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,400
I'll go back.

731
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,760
Come here, Zhixiao.

732
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,160
Give Shao Jiang

733
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,350
a call later.

734
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,560
He went to perform in other cities.

735
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,070
It'll be a while before he gets back.

736
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,800
I know.

737
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,590
But you can still call him.

738
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,000
I mean,

739
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,760
let him

740
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,350
contact the foreign experts.

741
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,280
I think we shouldn't

742
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,800
give up this option.

743
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,590
Let's prepare for it at the same time.
What do you think?

744
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,590
Okay.

745
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,470
I want to take the chance

746
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,070
of Mr. Lin's chemo

747
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,280
and think it over

748
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,280
before making a final decision.

749
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,160
Also get

750
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,310
your visa documents ready.

751
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
It will save us some time

752
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,760
if we decide to go.

753
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,710
And we can leave at any time.

754
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,830
I see.

755
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,640
Okay.

756
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,680
Take good care of Lin.

757
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,310
I'm gonna go back.

758
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,560
Don't worry. Go ahead.

759
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,710
Dr. Gu.

760
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,190
Go to work.

761
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:54,950
Okay.

762
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,000
Do you want an apple? I just peeled it.

763
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,710
No, thanks.

764
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,760
I have ward rounds to make.

765
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,800
What's wrong with you?

766
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,040
What's wrong?

767
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,040
You look like you're in a bad mood.

768
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,360
Is it because of

769
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,430
Lin Jianguo again?

770
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,470
I had a bad attitude that day.

771
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
Don't take it to heart.

772
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,950
How would I?

773
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,800
I just think

774
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
a doctor only needs to provide

775
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,120
professional advice

776
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,040
and shouldn't

777
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,600
get emotional about the patient.

778
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,230
But if you want,

779
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,870
I'll talk to his family

780
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,120
and advise them

781
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,760
not to interrupt treatment to go abroad.

782
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,360
Never mind.

783
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,800
Don't give them

784
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,600
too much pressure now.

785
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,430
I still have an operation.

786
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,320
I'm leaving.

787
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,870
Okay.

788
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,280
Mr. Lin.

789
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,520
Don't be in a daze.

790
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,520
Have some apples.

791
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,120
I can't eat.

792
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,150
Have some at least.

793
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,710
How are you feeling
after the chemo this time?

794
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,360
I feel dizzy and nauseous.
I have no appetite.

795
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,430
These are

796
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,600
normal reactions to chemotherapy.

797
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,040
But if you don't eat,

798
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,190
you'll have insufficient nutrition.

799
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,230
If you still can't eat,

800
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,760
we'll give you nutritional support.

801
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,870
It's okay.

802
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,950
I'll do something

803
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,190
to make Mr. Lin eat more.

804
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,320
Look, the doctor told you

805
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,670
to eat more.

806
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,710
Right?

807
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,670
Have some.

808
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,630
Lin Zhixiao, come out.

809
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,600
Okay.

810
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,600
I'm gonna go out for a second.

811
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,040
What's the matter, Dr. Gao?

812
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,000
Lin Zhixiao.

813
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,000
Every doctor in this center,

814
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,390
regardless of his or her major,

815
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,600
will definitely be responsible

816
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,000
for every patient.

817
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,670
Your father is no exception.

818
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
I just don't get it.

819
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,360
Why wouldn't you trust us

820
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,910
but other people

821
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,360
blindly?

822
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,470
Mr. Lin,

823
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
what are you thinking about?

824
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,430
What do you want to eat?

825
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,320
I'll get you everything
whether it flies in the sky

826
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,800
or runs on the ground, okay?

827
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,710
Don't bother.

828
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,040
I have no appetite.

829
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,390
No way.

830
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,120
The doctor said
you need to eat something.

831
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,470
How about this?

832
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,560
I'll go out
and buy different kinds of food,

833
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,280
then you can choose for yourself, okay?

834
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,190
Vegetarian wonton, then.

835
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,600
All right.

836
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,560
I'll go get it for you now.

837
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:31,910
Wait for me!

838
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,840
The remaining quantity of cream is four.

839
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,670
Four.

840
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,320
The remaining quantity
of caramel is five.

841
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,430
- Gu Xiao.
- Five.

842
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,080
The remaining quantity
of Nanshan bean is four.

843
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,950
Did you drink too much

844
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,040
and fool around with someone else,

845
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,150
and you mistook her for me?

846
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,040
The remaining quantity is two.

847
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:57,910
Two.

848
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,870
The remaining quantity
of Baileys Irish Cream is four.

849
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,040
Four.

850
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,630
The remaining quantity
of Orange Bomb is five.

851
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,600
Five.

852
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,120
Okay.

853
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,950
That's all in stock.

854
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,320
All right. Go get busy.

855
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,760
Okay.

856
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,800
Well, well, Xiao Shan.

857
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,390
What's wrong with you again?

858
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,710
It all came back to me.

859
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,320
It was you.

860
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,470
Why did you lie to me?

861
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,430
You're crazy.

862
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,080
I have no time for you.

863
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:42,540
(In-patient)

864
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,630
Here comes the vegetarian wonton.

865
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,560
How long has your mom been gone?

866
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Why hasn't she come back?

867
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,120
She said she'd clean up at home.

868
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,360
It could be a while.

869
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,950
It's okay.

870
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,120
Since there is no spoon,

871
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,560
I'll feed you
with the bamboo chopsticks.

872
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,080
Okay?

873
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,910
Okay.

874
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,390
Taste it.

875
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,710
Careful.

876
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,360
Okay.

877
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,560
Is it hot?

878
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,190
How is it?

879
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,150
This is good.

880
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,800
Have one more.

881
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,800
Miss Lin.

882
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,800
You have a paper to sign.

883
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,630
Okay.

884
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,190
Eat on your own.

885
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,670
I'll check it later when I'm back.

886
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,760
- Okay.
- Eat them all.

887
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,600
Okay. Okay.

888
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,150
The vegetarian wonton is good.

889
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,280
I'll eat it again tomorrow.

890
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,760
Did you eat them all?

891
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,950
Yes.

892
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,430
No way.

893
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,190
How can you

894
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,320
eat vegetarian wonton every day?

895
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,800
I'll get you something else tomorrow.

896
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,150
Zhixiao. Zhixiao.

897
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,080
Put the bed down.

898
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,000
- I want to have some sleep.
- Okay.

899
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,360
Come on.

900
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,360
Lie down.

901
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,600
Okay.

902
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,230
- All right?
- Mm.

903
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,600
Have a rest.

904
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:11,840
Dr. Gu.

905
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,760
Let's have dinner together after work.

906
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,870
After a day of surgery,

907
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,760
I want to go back and get some rest.

908
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,000
You guys go without me.

909
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,320
Okay.

910
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:47,950
Lin Zhixiao.

911
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,150
Lin Zhixiao.

912
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,300
=The Oath of Love=
When my dad was sick,

913
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,140
=The Oath of Love=
why did you

914
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,050
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)

915
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:11,500
ask Chen Xiaowei

916
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,100
to take care of my dad?

917
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,140
You talked about Chen Xiaowei
when you came,

918
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,180
and every time

919
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,300
I walked by the reception desk,

920
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,020
you and Chen Xiaowei

921
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:17,900
were whispering.

922
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,260
You were having a great time

923
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:18,940
talking to her.

924
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,020
Her eyes twinkled

925
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,340
every time she saw you.

926
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:21,940
(That's because I'm handsome.)

927
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,940
Her voice

928
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,500
still hurts my brain.

929
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,660
(That's because I'm handsome.)

930
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,660
Handsome?

931
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,580
You think you're handsome, don't you?

932
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,340
Will you look in the mirror?

933
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,860
I'm the only one who wants you, okay?

934
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,420
