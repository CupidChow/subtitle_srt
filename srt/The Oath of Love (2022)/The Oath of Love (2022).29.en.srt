18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,240
What's wrong, Zhixiao?

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,040
I'm just…

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,520
I'm just thinking

21
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,360
that my father is so thin.

22
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,840
How...?

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,360
How has he got so thin?

24
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,640
Ice cream.

25
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,560
Don't eat too much.

26
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,160
I know.

27
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
I eat it only because you want to.

28
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,760
What happened to your eyes?

29
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,760
I'm trying the wedding dress today.

30
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
I want to look better.

31
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,080
So I wear false eyelashes

32
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,560
but they poked my eyes,

33
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,160
so they are red.

34
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,200
If you don't know how to make up,

35
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,080
then don't do it.

36
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,160
You won't look better with makeup.

37
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,920
How can you say that
to your daughter?

38
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,080
I'm the Prettiest Girl

39
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,600
of CN, okay?

40
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,480
Okay, okay.

41
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:57,960
Be careful.

42
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,240
It's… about to drip.

43
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,880
Clumsy.

44
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,920
I think

45
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,360
Gu Wei's out of luck

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,400
to marry you.

47
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm your daughter,

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,680
okay?

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,960
It's hard to say.

50
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,880
You've kept me worried
since you were a child.

51
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,240
Look at your bag.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,720
It's always messy,

53
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,120
since childhood,

54
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,080
so hard to find something.

55
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,080
You're not like me at all.

56
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,160
It is an orderly mess.

57
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,440
I can find my stuff myself.

58
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,440
Okay, okay.

59
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,960
And,

60
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:35,960
don't ever

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,880
eat those unhealthy and junk food

62
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,160
anymore.

63
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,880
You are going to start a family,

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,240
pay attention to what you eat.

65
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,920
Healthy food

66
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,680
don't taste good.

67
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,720
I don't like it.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
Bizarre talk.

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,000
In our home,

70
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,280
whatever happens,

71
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,680
your mother and I can

72
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,560
cover it for you.

73
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,920
You will be an adult to start a family.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,120
You can't be self-willed anymore.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,400
You have to pay attention

76
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,240
to your behaviors.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,680
What?

78
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,040
Tired of me talking?

79
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,720
You'll understand

80
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,520
when you have kids.

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,520
All parents are doing this

82
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
for the sake of their child.

83
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,040
Okay, fine.

84
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,160
You can say these things

85
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,240
to my child.

86
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,520
I'll have some leisure time.

87
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,200
Do you want me to teach your child?

88
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,520
Yeah.

89
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,400
What will you do?

90
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,120
I'll supervise you.

91
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,520
When my child goes
to elementary school,

92
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
you can teach him disciplines.

93
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,360
Is it a tempting thing to do?

94
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,120
At that time,

95
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,240
you can continue your

96
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,280
honorable mission as a dean.

97
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,480
You teach

98
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,120
your own child.

99
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,960
How can you give orders
to your parents?

100
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,680
Yes, I can.

101
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,800
I want you to do it.

102
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,320
I want you to teach my child
until he goes to

103
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,760
elementary school, junior high,

104
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,480
and high school.

105
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,880
You are also responsible
for his college entrance exam.

106
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,800
If he doesn't pass,

107
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,520
I'll blame you for it.

108
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,480
Are you trying to ruin
my reputation in my later years?

109
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,640
Zhixiao,

110
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,640
grow up.

111
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,880
Don't be like a child anymore.

112
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,000
I can't stay with you forever.

113
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,800
No, I want you to stay with me forever.

114
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,760
Not only me,

115
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,200
I want you to stay

116
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,360
with my child forever.

117
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,840
Okay, okay. I will.

118
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,240
Silly girl.

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,360
Don't cry.

120
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,560
I'm not crying.

121
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,240
The ice cream is too cold.

122
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,280
Don't cry. You will look ugly.

123
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,800
There, there.

124
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,360
Don't cry.

125
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,560
I'm not crying.

126
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,680
Why are you being

127
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,800
so sentimental?

128
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,440
Am I?

129
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,160
Yes.

130
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm not.

131
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,320
Let's go. Let's go.

132
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
Gu Wei and your mother

133
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,400
are still waiting for us in the store.

134
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,080
Aren't you going to practice walking

135
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,880
on the red carpet?

136
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,160
Why didn't you practice
with me earlier?

137
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,000
What's the difference doing it now?

138
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,960
Come on.

139
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,120
Be a happy bride.

140
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,000
And this, this.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,720
This, in the front.

142
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,480
Sansan,

143
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,200
can you

144
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,000
stop crunching

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,960
potato chips?

146
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,280
I'm writing the wedding vows.

147
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,040
You're distracting me.

148
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,280
I can't write a word.

149
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,840
How to write this?

150
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,360
Blame me for eating potato chips?

151
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,160
You have to write it well,

152
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,880
I'm telling you.

153
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,440
This is a big thing in your life.

154
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,640
You didn't study hard in school,

155
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,120
who can you blame now?

156
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,680
Move over.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,280
What should I do?

158
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,920
What are you doing?

159
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,760
What should I do?

160
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,720
Stop.

161
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Lin Zhixiao, I'm telling you,

162
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,920
I know you too well.

163
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,160
This is your marriage,

164
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,680
not ours.

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,800
I can't write for you

166
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,880
for something so important.

167
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,320
You have the time

168
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,360
tangling with us,

169
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,960
why not hurry up and write?

170
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,680
Think about it,

171
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,040
what will you do if you don't

172
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,160
remember your vows

173
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,000
on the stage tomorrow?

174
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,400
I didn't ask you

175
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,440
to help me write it.

176
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,880
I just want to know

177
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,520
if you have any

178
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,880
experience to share?

179
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,000
Do we look

180
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,320
we have the experience to share?

181
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sorry, we're single.

182
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,080
You're right.

183
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Should I just

184
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,520
ask Gu Wei?

185
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,560
I'll ask him.

186
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,320
No, no.

187
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,520
Lin Zhixiao, are you crazy?

188
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,000
Why?

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,920
Have you ever seen a groom teaching

190
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,480
a bride to write her wedding vow?

191
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,200
And don't you know that

192
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
it's not auspicious

193
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,680
for the groom to meet

194
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,520
the bride before the wedding?

195
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah.

196
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,400
You're right.

197
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,600
What should I do then?

198
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,240
I can't write

199
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,520
a word now.

200
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,760
Is Gu Xiao

201
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
with him?

202
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,880
Text Gu Xiao right now,

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,920
and ask him to check

204
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,880
what Gu Wei is writing.

205
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,560
Go, Pikachu!

206
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,280
I'm counting on you.

207
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,440
All right. All right.

208
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,880
Ask him secretly.

209
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,280
Okay.

210
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,040
Gu Wei,

211
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,320
are you sure you will spend

212
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,200
the rest of your life with Lin Zhixiao?

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,520
Yeah, what's your problem?

214
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,960
No…

215
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,600
(Take a photo of Gu Wei's
wedding vows now!)

216
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,240
No problem.

217
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,840
What do you want?

218
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,320
Just take a look.

219
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,280
Look what?

220
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,920
Do some learning.

221
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,240
Is it you or

222
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,000
Xiao Shan wants to see it?

223
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,240
It… is me.

224
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,760
Just a look.

225
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,040
In case I need it someday.

226
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,640
Let me check.

227
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,640
Forget it.

228
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,240
Get lost.

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,320
Just one look.

230
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,640
- One look…
- Stop.

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,720
You want to report to Xiao Shan,
don't you?

232
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,000
Come on, we're brothers.

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,840
Just one look.

234
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,320
If you were so curious,

235
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,480
you wouldn't have been to

236
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,040
a third-rate university in Australia.

237
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,800
Gu Wei,

238
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,240
my curiosity was cultivated

239
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,120
in that, that university.

240
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,160
Get out.

241
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,400
I'll go. I'll go.

242
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,240
Just a glance, bro.

243
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,920
What can you do?

244
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,840
I've just found that

245
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,080
Gu Xiao is never useful

246
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,400
when we need him.

247
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
I have to do it myself.

248
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,040
What to do? How to write?

249
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,680
I don't know

250
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,880
how to start.

251
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,120
It's my showtime.

252
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,360
Only I can help you.

253
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,880
You can't write,

254
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,000
but you can copy it online.

255
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,440
Are those reliable?

256
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,720
Okay, write it yourself.

257
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,520
Okay, it doesn't matter.

258
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,280
I'll write it myself.

259
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,880
I didn't count

260
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,760
on you two.

261
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,280
It's a bit greasy.

262
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,320
I…I…I…

263
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,600
Can you two be quiet?

264
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
I need a quiet environment.

265
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,880
Okay?

266
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,760
I have stopped eating.

267
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,490
Shh…

268
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,720
Just write.

269
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,880
It's not my fault.

270
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,000
She's illiterate.

271
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,720
You are illiterate.

272
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,560
I heard what

273
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:15,880
you said.

274
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,720
- I mean those on the Internet…
- Shh.

275
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,440
(What are you doing?)

276
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,040
(Writing wedding vows?)

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,440
We are getting married tomorrow.

278
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,640
Do you have anything to say to me?

279
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,000
You will be

280
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,640
my wife from tomorrow.

281
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,600
Gu Wei.

282
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,960
Gu Wei.

283
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,960
Gu Wei.

284
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,240
I miss you, too.

285
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,480
See you tomorrow.

286
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,800
See you tomorrow.

287
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,840
Slow down.

288
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,160
I know. Don't worry.

289
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,440
Mr. Lin, Ms. Li.

290
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,520
What are you doing?

291
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,320
What are you saying behind my back?

292
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,480
Nothing.

293
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,200
You girls are so beautiful today.

294
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,920
Hi, Uncle, Auntie.

295
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,880
Hello to you.

296
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,440
Little bride.

297
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,000
You will be an adult soon.

298
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,520
I am an adult.

299
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,600
Since no one is there,

300
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,680
let's rehearse.

301
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,960
Okay.

302
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,040
Let's go.

303
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,760
Go.

304
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,960
Come on, Mr. Lin.

305
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,680
Chest out, chin up.

306
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,840
Don't be nervous later.

307
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,240
I won't.

308
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,320
Music.

309
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,800
Ready, go!

310
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,760
Why does Mr. Lin

311
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,280
walk like a soldier?

312
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,520
Auntie, stand here.

313
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,880
Mr. Lin.

314
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,960
How does it feel?

315
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,480
Like sending you to school
when you were little.

316
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,400
What do you mean?

317
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,200
I was holding

318
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,600
your hand back then.

319
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,960
But it's a little different.

320
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,280
How different?

321
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
I sent you to school

322
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,560
and then picked you up.

323
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,320
Now…

324
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,240
Talking nonsense again, are you?

325
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,960
I mean,

326
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
if you don't come back,

327
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,080
it means you're happy.

328
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,120
Be careful when you walk.

329
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,280
Don't step on the dress.

330
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,400
Don't look down upon me.

331
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,520
I'm good in high heels.

332
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,640
I can jump.

333
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,040
Look.

334
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,680
Okay, okay. I know.

335
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,880
You'll make yourself a fool if you fall.

336
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,680
Have you memorized what to say?

337
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,160
Don't worry, the oath is here.

338
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,960
I'll show you.

339
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,120
Sansan, Yin Xi.

340
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,200
Where is my oath?

341
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,960
You have it with you.

342
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,920
No.

343
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,320
Do you have it?

344
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,440
No, I don't.

345
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,880
I'll go look for it.

346
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,720
Wait.

347
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,680
I'll go with you.

348
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,440
Auntie, we're leaving.

349
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,360
- Look around.
- Okay.

350
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,560
Look carefully.

351
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,200
Why are you

352
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,680
always so careless?

353
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,120
Lin Zhixiao,

354
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,680
I'm impressed by you.

355
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,240
I'm impressed by myself.

356
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,840
I'm at the site.

357
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,920
I'm going to ask the waiters

358
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,320
if they picked it or not.

359
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,000
You look for it in the room.

360
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:54,960
Hi.

361
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,920
Found it?

362
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,840
Okay, good.

363
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,120
I'll go

364
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
find you later.

365
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,280
Okay.

366
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,640
Shao Jiang.

367
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,360
It's been a long time.

368
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,520
Long time.

369
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,000
Shao Jiang.

370
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,480
Are you not gonna play
a congratulatory song today?

371
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,400
Congratulatory song?

372
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,320
Yin Xi.

373
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,080
I'm the loser in the competition

374
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,640
with Dr. Gu for Zhixiao.

375
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
I came to the scene today

376
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,760
and brought a red packet.

377
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,000
I've been as generous as I can.

378
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Now you want me to play the violin?

379
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,760
That's too miserable for me.

380
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,240
Besides,

381
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,760
there is someone else

382
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,800
who had a similar experience.

383
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,960
Hello.

384
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,080
Hi.

385
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,920
What are you talking about?

386
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,120
Nothing.

387
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,240
It seems that Zhixiao

388
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,600
has a clear direction

389
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,200
where to throw the bouquet.

390
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,840
Well.

391
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,280
Let's see if I'm lucky.

392
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,160
Good luck.

393
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,240
I'll do my best.

394
00:18:59,320 --> 00:18:59,640
Shao Jiang.

395
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,840
Dear guests and friends.

396
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,440
Yin Xi.

397
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:02,920
The wedding is about to start.

398
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,640
I should be going.

399
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,720
I'm leaving, bye.

400
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,090
- Bye.
- Please go to the viewing area and sit.

401
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,400
Dad.

402
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,600
Don't worry, Dad.

403
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,000
Don't worry, Dad.

404
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,720
Now

405
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,320
in front of everyone present,

406
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,960
bride and groom,

407
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,800
please make your vows of love.

408
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,160
Lots of people have asked me

409
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,840
what my future wife

410
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
looks like.

411
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,160
I've tried to picture her many times,

412
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
but I failed every time.

413
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,760
Until the day I met you,

414
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,360
I figured it out.

415
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,400
I want that person to be you.

416
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,840
You said I'm outstanding,

417
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,680
smart, and have many advantages.

418
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,560
But only I know that

419
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,320
you,

420
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,320
Lin Zhixiao,

421
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,760
are the person

422
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,560
out of my reach.

423
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,680
(You're kind and brave.)

424
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,680
(My great happiness)

425
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,640
is to spend the rest of my life with you.

426
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,040
Lin Zhixiao.

427
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,920
Dr. Gu, are you alright?

428
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,640
(If all encounters)

429
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,680
(are reunions)

430
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,400
(after a long separation,)

431
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,760
(I believe)

432
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
(in the first 30 years of my life,)

433
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
(we've already met each other)

434
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,160
(at some point,)

435
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,400
(but we just didn't know)

436
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,080
(each other's name.)

437
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,160
(Otherwise,)

438
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,680
why did I fall in love with you

439
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,600
so naturally

440
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,920
and quickly?

441
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,720
(If we count it)

442
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,160
(since my freshman year,)

443
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,160
(then I've known you for three years.)

444
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,440
(I've thought about a hundred times)

445
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,720
(how I should make my life)

446
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,920
(more fulfilling.)

447
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,400
(I know what I have)

448
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,240
(is limited,)

449
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,880
and I don't want to feel empty

450
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,000
when I stop breathing.

451
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,320
From today,

452
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,000
I'll grow old with you.

453
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,560
Even if we can't
travel around the world,

454
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,400
I still feel content.

455
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,800
I hope

456
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,120
when we get old,

457
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,560
you can tell me

458
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,400
that marrying me

459
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,040
was the best decision

460
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,880
you ever made.

461
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,320
If we're

462
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,680
too old to remember anything,

463
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,370
I hope that

464
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,470
loving you

465
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,920
is the last thing I'll forget.

466
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Zhixiao, your vow.

467
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,680
I used to think that the world is big,

468
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,920
and I'm walking slowly,

469
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,640
so I could never meet

470
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,600
the right person for me.

471
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,320
I feel so lucky

472
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,840
to have met you.

473
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,280
(Since we got together,)

474
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,960
(we had happy times,)

475
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,480
(fights)

476
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,800
(and also troubles,)

477
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,680
(but we got through)

478
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,120
(each of them,)

479
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,920
(didn't we?)

480
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,880
When my dad

481
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,360
was wheeled into the operating room,

482
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,840
I'd never have thought

483
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,120
that his attending surgeon

484
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,680
would be my life partner.

485
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,480
(Gu Wei Gastroenterology Center)

486
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,280
(I've always felt)

487
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,760
(we're very different.)

488
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,360
You're mature and stable,

489
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,800
but

490
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,240
I'm clumsy.

491
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,080
I can even fall on flat ground.

492
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,680
You like to be neat and clean,

493
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,680
and keep everything organized,

494
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,680
but I like a spicy hot pot

495
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,760
and street food.

496
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,840
I often leave things everywhere.

497
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,040
My dad and mom call me

498
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,200
a hopeless destructor.

499
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,520
But even though

500
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,840
we're so different,

501
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
I still love you.

502
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,800
I remember

503
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,400
the day I fell for you.

504
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,720
(On that day,)

505
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,160
(when I looked up,)

506
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,160
(I looked right)

507
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,680
(into your eyes unexpectedly.)

508
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,320
(My mind went completely blank,)

509
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,400
(and I felt I was falling into)

510
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,360
a giant floating bubble.

511
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,240
Even if life repeated many times,

512
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,960
in that spring,

513
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,560
I still wanted to meet you.

514
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,720
Gu Wei, from now on,

515
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,880
you're mine

516
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,960
and I'm yours.

517
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,720
I'll hold your hands like this

518
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,960
for the rest of my life

519
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
and never let go.

520
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,400
I swear

521
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,200
I will be as patient as your brother,

522

Zhixiao.

554
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,760
What you said was really touching.

555
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,480
Really?

556
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,080
Yes.

557
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,440
I didn't know you could say these

558
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,920
without the script.

559
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,040
So you wrote your vow

560
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,960
in vain.

561
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,560
This...

562
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,480
You prepared this yesterday?

563
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,680
Let me see.

564
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,000
Don't look at it.

565
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,240
It's fine.

566
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,360
- What's wrong?
- Don't look.

567
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,120
It is bad.

568
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,880
Can't I read my wife's vow?

569
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,200
Let me see.

570
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
I mean it. Don't look.

571
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,720
Dr. Gu.

572
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,760
Do you know?

573
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,960
Your existence

574
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,840
is God's way of telling us

575
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,960
that good-looking person
can be annoying, too.

576
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,280
What? What?

577
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,760
Why did you even mention God?

578
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,000
Let me see.

579
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,480
When I first met you, I was thinking,

580
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,280
oh, my God,

581
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,920
how could someone like you exist?

582
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,560
You pull a long...

583
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,120
You pull a long face all the time,

584
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,840
the way you talk indicates
a lack of emotional intelligence,

585
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,440
you were never loved as a child,

586
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,320
your schoolmates cut you off,

587
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,520
and you can't empathize at all.

588
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,240
If I hadn't shown up

589
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,800
and saved you,

590
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,520
you'd have to

591
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,680
always stay single.

592
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,840
Don't read it anymore.

593
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,320
Of course,

594
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,720
I'm not saying these

595
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,120
to discourage or blackmail you,

596
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,040
but hope you understand

597
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,800
that you've spent all of your luck

598
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,160
to meet me.

599
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,080
So remember to be nice to me

600
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,680
for the rest of our lives.

601
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,360
I'll also treat you right

602
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,600
and love you with all my heart.

603
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,480
Your lovely wife,

604
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,280
Lin Zhixiao.

605
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,040
It occurs to me

606
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,760
that now we should be going to

607
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,040
throw the bouquet.

608
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,280
- Should we?
- Let's go.

609
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,480
Throw the bouquet.

610
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,120
Let's go.

611
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,240
You'll have to wait for at least 13 years.

612
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,440
Yin, let's take a rain check.

613
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,840
Go home tonight

614
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,720
and urge Yin Xi.

615
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,360
- Yes.
- Don't bring it up again.

616
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,840
Then, bye-bye.

617
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,120
- Bye-bye.
- Take care.

618
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,240
Dad, Mom.

619
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,720
Dad.

620
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,800
There, there.

621
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,560
You're a big girl now.

622
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,800
Listen.

623
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,320
From today,

624
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,120
you'll not only be our daughter

625
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,440
but also Gu Wei's wife,

626
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,440
and his parents' daughter-in-law.

627
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,080
You'll also be a mom.

628
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,320
So learn to be mature

629
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,400
and don't be clingy.

630
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,360
I know.

631
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,560
Good girl.

632
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,200
Mom.

633
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,680
Oh, right.

634
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,080
I have a secret for you.

635
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,760
Your dad has got

636
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,800
a wedding gift for you.

637
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
We hid it

638
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,600
in your bridal suite.

639
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,000
Have a good look for it.

640
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,520
Alright.

641
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,400
OK.

642
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,600
Let's go then.

643
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,240
Dad, Mom, don't worry.

644
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Take care.

645
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,480
Be well.

646
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,000
We're leaving.

647
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,400
Letters.

648
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,510
(On the wedding day)
All letters to me.

649
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,280
(To my dear daughter Lin Zhixiao)
There are so many.

650
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,440
(To my dear daughter Lin Zhixiao)

651
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,200
(Dear Zhixiao,)

652
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,240
(hope you're well.)

653
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,040
(The night is dark.)

654
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,280
(I went to check on you.)

655
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,600
(Dear Zhixiao,)
(You're sleeping deeply in your room.)

656
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,360
(I sat next to you)

657
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,440
(quietly for a little while)

658
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,440
(and didn't disturb you.)

659
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,640
You've worked hard
planning for your wedding.

660
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,520
Since you

661
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,160
decided to marry Gu,

662
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,480
your mom has been rushing me

663
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,080
to prepare a wedding speech.

664
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,720
I've put it off till now.

665
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,560
And

666
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,720
I'm afraid I can't express it

667
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,040
in public,

668
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,800
so I'm writing to you

669
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,200
instead.

670
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,320
W-What is this,

671
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,000
Mr. Lin?

672
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,320
Birthday gift.

673
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,880
Why do you give me puzzles

674
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,080
as a birthday gift?

675
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,320
It's in your 100-things-to-do list.

676
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,120
Do a puzzle with Dad.

677
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
Multiply 950 pieces by three.

678
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,440
When am I gonna finish this?

679
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,720
I was really ignorant

680
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,960
as a child.

681
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,720
It's fine, take your time.

682
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,080
I'll do it with you.

683
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
Don't you

684
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,320
like hamburgers?

685
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,000
Come on, eat.

686
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,680
Don't eat too much.

687
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,240
I know.

688
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,960
I eat it only because you want to.

689
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,760
Look at the middle.

690
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,640
OK.

691
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,200
One, two, three.

692
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,200
(Scenes from the past)

693
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,680
(replayed in my mind.)

694
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,960
(Except for the moment)

695
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,880
(when the nurse put you in my arms
outside the delivery room,)

696
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,840
(the first scene came to my mind)

697
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,480
(was that afternoon)

698
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,360
(a few days ago.)

699
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,960
(I wonder if you still remember it.)

700
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,120
Ms. Li.

701
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,320
Well, go light on the food.

702
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,880
You're getting chubby.

703
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,560
Hands off.

704
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,200
How could you say that about your wife?

705
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,040
Moreover,

706
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,600
well...

707
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,040
why did I fall for you?

708
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:57,920
What?

709
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,520
I'm beautiful

710
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
but you're just old.

711
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,800
You must have saved the galaxy

712
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,000
in your last life.

713
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,160
So in this life, an alien from
the external galaxy

714
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,080
came to Ms. Li for revenge?

715
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,200
It's said a happy couple

716
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,240
can give birth to a pretty child.

717
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,360
I feel

718
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,040
we're a happy couple.

719
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,880
Why did we...?

720
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,800
What do you mean?

721
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,960
What do you mean?

722
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,120
Isn't our daughter pretty?

723
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,160
Aren't I pretty?

724
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,760
Isn't she pretty?

725
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,400
Not bad. Not too bad.

726
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,840
Not bad? Just not bad?

727
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,360
Pretty, very pretty.

728
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,760
You're getting prettier.

729
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,880
It's too late.

730
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,920
I won't listen.

731
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,720
See you.

732
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,680
Too late.

733
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,920
Gu Wei.

734
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,960
If your child

735
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,240
isn't very pretty,

736
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,120
is it your fault

737
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,200
or Zhixiao's fault?

738
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,680
My fault, my fault.

739
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,600
Definitely my fault.

740
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,840
How could our child

741
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,160
be not pretty?

742
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,840
Look at you, look at me.

743
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,120
Look at our pretty faces.

744
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,240
How could our child not be pretty?

745
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,760
Our child must be very good-looking,

746
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,440
alright?

747
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,080
What's more, do looks matter?

748
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,480
No.

749
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,360
What matters?

750
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,000
Thoughts.

751
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,760
Right.

752
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,280
IQ, it's IQ.

753
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,800
An intelligent brain like mine, okay?

754
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,600
You're right.

755
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,400
You're absolutely right.

756
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,480
What's that look?

757
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,640
What's that look?

758
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,840
You're always right.

759
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,720
Gu.

760
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,600
Look at Gu Wei.

761
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,920
Look how honey-tongued he is.

762
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,560
What about you?

763
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,440
Since we got together,

764
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,760
you said nothing to please me.

765
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,280
I didn't?

766
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,800
I'm saying something nice to you.

767
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,920
Ms. Li.

768
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,280
You're getting prettier

769
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,720
as you age.

770
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,600
Really.

771
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,840
So gross!

772
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,720
I can't stand it.

773
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,880
Don't feel unconfident.

774
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,840
- That was a compliment.
- I'm not.

775
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,280
I think you're telling the truth.

776
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,320
Dr. Gu.

777
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,640
Compliment me.

778
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
You're pretty, too.

779
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,080
How am I pretty?

780
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,200
Let me think.

781
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,600
That's a tough question for Dr. Gu.

782
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,640
You smell good.

783
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,360
I smell good?

784
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,800
So gross.

785
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,440
You made me say that.

786
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,800
And now you're accusing me.

787
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,200
What do you want?

788
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
- Compliment me, too.
- It was good.

789
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,120
You're just

790
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,720
very handsome.

791
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,680
Mr. Lin, you're handsome, too.

792
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,080
That's pretty much it.

793
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,200
I can even dance

794
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,000
in your dimples.

795
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,280
Gu Wei, do you

796
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,040
have dimples?

797
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,000
- He does.
- Let me see. Smile.

798
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,880
Big... big smile.

799
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,040
- Why are you faking it?
- He does have dimples.

800
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,000
He does have dimples.

801
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,160
He does. Look.

802
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
Birds of the same kind

803
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,200
live together.

804
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,640
(That was)

805
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,040
(just a normal)

806
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
(slice of time.)

807
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,200
(But the man you love,
and the woman I love)

808
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,080
(are both with us.)

809
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,200
(It felt great.)

810
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,920
(Maybe one day,)

811
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,920
(I won't be involved)

812
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,160
(in such a happy moment of yours,)

813
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,600
(but that doesn't mean)

814
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,560
(my love for you disappears)

815
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,440
(or that you feel)

816
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,000
(less happy.)

817
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,720
(Life is both a long)

818
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,040
(and short journey.)

819
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,000
(I can only keep your company
for a limited period of time.)

820
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,200
(But you're worthy of being loved.)

821
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,240
(For your journey ahead,)

822
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,680
(you'll find something more)

823
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,760
(and better.)

824
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,920
This is...

825
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,200
This is the chess

826
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,880
your grandpa taught you to play.

827
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,160
I remembered.

828
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,640
You can also use it

829
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
to teach your child.

830
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,680
Look.

831
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,960
Even if he's gone,

832
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,520
we can always have something
to remember him by.

833
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,200
Right?

834
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,280
(Dignity of a Teacher)

835
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,400
Zhixiao.

836
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,440
(The third year From Lin Jianguo
To my dear daughter Lin Zhixiao)

837
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,120
(I'll always bless you.)

838
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,640
(And I'll)

839
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,160
(always protect you)

840
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,640
(The fourth year)

841
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,960
(with the man)

842
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,040
(I'm entrusting you to today)

843
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,760
(in the days)

844
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,480
(that I'm still with you.)

845
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:27,400
(The sixth year From Lin Jianguo
To my dear daughter Lin Zhixiao)

846
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,760
(The seventh year From Lin Jianguo)
(Seven years later)

847
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,760
Are you ready?

848
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,400
Yes, we are!

849
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,560
Then I'm gonna throw it.

850
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,240
- OK.
- Come on.

851
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,040
Be quick.

852
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,000
Three, two, one.

853
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,200
When will you get married,

854
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:02,600
Dr. Gao?

855
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,760
Invite us to your wedding.

856
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,960
I will.

857
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,760
I came to see how Chinese people
get married.

858
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,680
Let's...

859
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,760
Let's do it together someday.

860
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,360
(Yeah, yeah.)

861
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:16,840
(Really.)

862
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,080
(Do you get married like this?)

863
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,040
(We hold the ceremony in a church.)

864
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,880
(I want to get back)

865
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,080
(together with my girlfriend.)

866
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,400
I will make it.

867
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,920
(Before,)

868
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,880
(I used to)

869
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,800
(love you in the way)

870
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,920
(that I felt was right,)

871
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,640
(but I)

872
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,960
(never asked you)

873
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,600
(what you wanted.)

874
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,680
I hope my daughter can get married soon.

875
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,280
Yeah.

876
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,280
I hope I can

877
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,560
find my Mr. Right soon.

878
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,840
Now you have to

879
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,960
film me.

880
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,520
What does it have to do with you?

881
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,560
Everything is likely

882
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,440
- to happen.
- Qiuqiu.

883
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,840
Tell Dr. Gu

884
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,520
if you...

885
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,120
if you do what the doctor said

886
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
and eat properly?

887
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,840
Yeah, did you quit sugar?

888
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,600
I don't know.

889
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,600
Thank you, President Gao.

890
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,160
Thank you.

891
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,680
Didn't you tell me

892
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,880
this is your...?

893
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:15,920
OK, OK.

894
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,440
Happy wedding.

895
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,680
Happy wedding.

896
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,160
You were smiling in a silly way.

897
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,680
Right?

898
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,480
I'm moved by this

899
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,120
every time I see it.

900
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,840
To my dear daughter Lin Zhixiao.

901
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,680
Dear Zhixiao, Gu.

902
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,640
Without knowing it,

903
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,040
seven years have passed.

904
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
If you're now together,

905
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,680
opening the last

906
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,320
letter I wrote,

907
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,480
well, first of all,

908
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,440
congratulations

909
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,600
on surviving the "seven-year itch".

910
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,440
It's said that

911
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,920
the seventh year is a hurdle to marriage.

912
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,680
I'm relieved to know

913
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,400
that you're still together.

914
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,680
Like I said

915
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,920
before you got married,

916
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,640
love

917
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,320
doesn't have to be studied

918
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,680
or honed,

919
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,640
as long as you believe it,

920
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,440
and are willing to give.

921
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,320
But you have to work on your marriage.

922
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,000
When I married

923
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,160
your mom,

924
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,400
your grandpa gave us a saying.

925
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,600
Now I'm giving it to you.

926
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,520
Don't forget your original intentions.

927
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,600
Now

928
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,920
are you happy?

929
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,640
Dad.

930
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,480
Don't worry about us.

931
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,920
We're very happy now.

932

We feel happy every day.
