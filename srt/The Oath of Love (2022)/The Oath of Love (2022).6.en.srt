18
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,100
Thank you.

19
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,080
Excuse me. May I ask you

20
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,319
if you saw

21
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,900
a middle-aged man,

22
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,650
and...

23
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:11,850
About 55 years old

24
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:13,240
and 1.78 meters tall.

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,759
He weighs about 65 kilos.

26
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,450
He is thin,

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,150
and wearing...

28
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,116
He's wearing a plaid shirt

29
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:23,125
and a navy-blue coat.

30
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,679
He has a side-part hairstyle,

31
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,175
and he is wearing a pair of glasses.

32
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,080
He...

33
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,759
No.

34
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,000
You should look somewhere else.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,800
I didn't see him.

36
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,080
Thank you. Thank you.

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,800
Thank you.

38
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,175
I didn't realize

39
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:37,700
I don't even have

40
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,475
a picture of Mr. Lin on my phone.

41
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,150
Don't worry.

42
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,600
Let's keep looking.

43
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:45,475
I'll go over there.

44
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,275
Are you traveling,

45
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,825
or are you on a business,
or are you going back home?

46
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:00,279
I'm going home.

47
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,199
To see my wife.

48
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,199
My wife is going to give birth soon.

49
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,250
- Really?
- Um.

50
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:06,559
Congratulations.

51
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:07,679
Thank you.

52
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,559
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?

53
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,900
I don't know.

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,750
I have a daughter.

55
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,720
Yeah?

56
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,550
How old is she?

57
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,625
She will graduate
from college next year.

58
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:35,775
She learns music.

59
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,175
Cello.

60
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:40,880
She is really good at it.

61
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,000
Really?

62
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,550
She is going to be

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,150
a professional cellist

64
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,300
and perform

65
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,720
in the Golden Hall

66
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:52,000
in Europe.

67
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,479
Your daughter is really good.

68
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,500
A girl studying music

69
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:01,080
is gentle and sensible.
You should have a daughter.

70
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,725
A daughter is thoughtful and warm,

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,160
just like a cotton-padded jacket.

72
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,520
I hope you'll also have a daughter.

73
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,279
Yes, yes.

74
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,360
I also want a daughter.

75
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,320
I like girls.

76
00:04:08,475 --> 00:04:09,700
Lin Jianguo!

77
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, no.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,900
Who is that?

79
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:18,450
My daughter.

80
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,475
What are you doing here? Lin Jianguo!

81
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,320
Listen to me, Lin Jianguo!

82
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,559
If you disappear again,

83
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,425
I'll just...!

84
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,160
It's a good thing that we found him.

85
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,760
Calm down and talk to him.

86
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,100
I'll let the hospital know.

87
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,839
Go back to the hospital with me!

88
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,559
Let's go.

89
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,175
What are you doing now?

90
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,559
What else do you want to do?

91
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,440
Hello, Du.

92
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:42,119
We've found Mr. Lin.

93
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:43,750
- I'm hungry.
- Don't worry.

94
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,119
I want to eat something first
before I go back.

95
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,675
What time is it now?

96
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:49,275
Where are you going to eat?

97
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,160
KFC is open.

98
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:52,279
I saw it.

99
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:54,075
Do you have any idea
what you're going to do tomorrow?

100
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,079
You're going to have surgery.

101
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,440
You should fast now!

102
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,725
No KFC!

103
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,025
Then I won't have surgery.

104
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,239
You can't strap me
on the operating table, can you?

105
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:01,880
Lin Jianguo!

106
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,975
Watch your attitude!

107
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:04,214
Let him eat whatever he wants.

108
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,325
In his condition,

109
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:06,605
he can't have surgery tomorrow.

110
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,079
I'll tell the hospital

111
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,075
to postpone the surgery.

112
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,239
Let's go!

113
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,350
What a "gentle" daughter.

114
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,440
Enjoy yourself.

115
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:52,550
Thank you.

116
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:58,250
Here. Let's eat.

117
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,125
I never liked

118
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,450
fast food before.

119
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,359
It's good to eat it

120
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:15,559
once in a while.

121
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:20,575
Why don't you eat?

122
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,675
Go ahead and eat.

123
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:25,480
Don't you like hamburgers
and this kind of stuff?

124
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,239
Come on.

125
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,900
All you think about is eating!

126
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,799
You always call me
irresponsible and ignorant.

127
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:33,550
What about you?

128
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,125
Did you lead by example?

129
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,225
Do you know that Mom
stumbled in the hospital

130
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:38,359
because she was too worried about you?

131
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:40,225
Her knees are still bruised!

132
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,650
Do you think it's really cool

133
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,119
of you leaving on your own?

134
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,000
Do you think that being capricious

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,200
makes up for the fact

136
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,681
that you followed the rules
when you were young?

137
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,480
You shut your phone and went back home.

138
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,880
You even left a note.

139
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,920
Now you want to eat!

140
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,525
How can you eat now?

141
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,850
You liked this a lot

142
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:25,775
when you were a child.

143
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,375
You even wrote it down on your wish list

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,225
that you wanted to eat KFC with me.

145
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:35,700
What did I write on my wish list?

146
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:38,550
When you were in the third grade,

147
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,679
your teacher asked you to write down

148
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,225
100 things you wanted to do with me.

149
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,375
You also drew little flowers on it.

150
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,640
Have you forgotten about it?

151
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:54,200
It was a long time ago.

152
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:55,920
I've forgotten.

153
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,320
In class today,

154
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,799
the teacher asked us to write down

155
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:03,825
(100 Things I Want to Do with My Dad)
100 things I want to do with my dad.

156
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,075
Fly a kite together.

157
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:08,325
Climb mountains together.

158
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,200
Eat ice cream together.

159
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,400
Go to KFC together.

160
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,399
Dad, I want

161
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,225
to hang it on the wall, is it okay?

162
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,300
Then you can see it every day.

163
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:22,239
It was on the wall back home.

164
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,900
Later we moved.

165
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,559
I forgot it.

166
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,079
I was supposed to take it.

167
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:33,715
I want

168
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,119
to go back and get it before surgery.

169
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,125
I don't remember what else there were...

170
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,975
I think there were eating ice cream,

171
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:44,725
going to a show,

172
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:50,359
and...

173
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:57,440
I don't remember.

174
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,000
I forgot.

175
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:15,520
I know I have cancer.

176
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,750
I heard it.

177
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,400
Well, it doesn't make any difference

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,975
whether I heard it or not.

179
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,150
I know

180
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,590
my own body.

181
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,875
There is a risk of surgery.

182
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,400
It's full of uncertainties.

183
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:39,375
Our old schoolmaster,

184
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:40,880
Mr. Chen,

185
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,150
died

186
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:49,039
on the operating table.

187
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,575
Zhixiao.

188
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:05,850
I've been busy working these years

189
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:10,675
and I haven't had time
to do these things with you.

190
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,359
In the blink of an eye,

191
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,725
I don't even know
what you like to eat now.

192
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:18,559
If you don't

193
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,275
like this,

194
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,800
let's do something else, okay?

195
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:29,119
I'll go to the toilet.

196
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,159
Don't cry.

197
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,775
Mr. Lin wouldn't
want to see you like this.

198
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,100
My relationship

199
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,275
with him has always been like this.

200
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:27,039
I said all kinds of terrible words,

201
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,800
and I just gave him a scolding.

202
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,750
Don't cry.

203
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:46,039
When you cry,

204
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,600
you will have mood swings

205
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,875
that can raise your blood pressure.

206
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,039
Therefore, I think you should

207
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,575
control your moods.

208
00:11:58,599 --> 00:11:59,925
What are you saying?

209
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:02,250
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

210
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:05,239
You see,

211
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,275
you're flushed

212
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,000
from your increasing blood pressure

213
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,550
and your body is twitching.

214
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,479
And your face

215
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:19,119
is getting worse.

216
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,960
It's very scary...

217
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,200
Are you still a human being?

218
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,625
How can you comfort people in this way?

219
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,825
I'm crying like this,

220
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:31,125
and you called me ugly.

221
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,675
If you think I'm ugly,

222
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:34,595
you don't have to comfort me.

223
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,400
Why are you here

224
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,760
calling me ugly

225
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,640
and insulting me?

226
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,375
I...

227
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,239
Don't cry.

228
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:07,119
Be good.

229
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,039
Don't cry.

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,960
I-I'm here.

231
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,450
You got me.

232
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:16,425
Don't cry.

233
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,725
Dr. Gu.

234
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,125
Um?

235
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,450
Don't you have a cleanliness issue?

236
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:43,550
I think you cured me.

237
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,000
Don't cry.

238
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:57,225
Let's get back now.

239
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,750
Ms. Li is still waiting for us
in the hospital.

240
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:04,950
Tidy yourself up.

241
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,200
Don't let Mr. Lin see this.

242
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,900
Um.

243
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,400
Dad.

244
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,275
Gu Xiao, you're back.

245
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,479
It's too depressing in their family.

246
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,520
Gu Wei left halfway through the meal,

247
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,225
leaving me and Aunt
staring at each other.

248
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,750
I'm not even full.

249
00:16:58,025 --> 00:16:58,725
Ah?

250
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,300
I'll ask the maid to make you something.

251
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,550
How can you

252
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,199
not eat enough at night?

253
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:04,920
Exactly.

254
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:05,920
Lady.

255
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,479
Yeah.

256
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:08,439
Make him something digestible.

257
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:09,400
Okay.

258
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,239
Never mind.

259
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,439
I'll do it.

260
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,839
I'll cook for you myself.

261
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,719
Mom, I'll go with you.

262
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:14,550
Stop.

263
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,760
Sit down.

264
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,575
Why don't you

265
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:27,760
take the job I arranged for you?

266
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,239
I don't want to. It's boring.

267
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,040
Boring?

268
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,520
Then tell me what you can do.

269
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,319
I don't know.

270
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:37,520
I have no idea.

271
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:39,725
I don't think you can do anything.

272
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,925
How much money have we spent

273
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,479
and how many strings have we pulled

274
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,925
for you since you were a child?

275
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,275
But you fool around all day

276
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,125
and hang out with those girls.

277
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:56,350
I learn that from you.

278
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,520
Nonsense!

279
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,145
I'm not talking nonsense.

280
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,725
My friend sent me a picture of you

281
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:03,205
at the club the other day.

282
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:05,475
He also sent me a message on WeChat.

283
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:06,875
Let me show you.

284
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:08,520
All right.

285
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:11,040
I'm having a serious conversation
with you.

286
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,900
Sit well!

287
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,040
No problem.

288
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,520
Put your phone away!

289
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:18,475
Done.

290
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,575
You just came back
from your uncle's place.

291
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,250
Look at Gu Wei.

292
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,400
He became a doctor at a young age.

293
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,525
He is also an attending doctor,
and an associate professor.

294
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:35,375
Look at yourself.

295
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:37,199
Your surname is also Gu.

296
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,680
Why are you two so different?

297
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,000
Can't you be more like your brother?

298
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,880
Like him?

299
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,959
He's 30 years old
and doesn't have a girlfriend.

300
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,475
He's isolated himself from women.

301
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,150
Just be content with it.

302
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,506
You have no idea how worried my aunt is.

303
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,200
If I'm more like him,

304
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,880
you'd better not rush me
to get married every day

305
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,719
and complain about

306
00:18:58,719 --> 00:18:59,959
not having grandchildren.

307
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,400
I'm not worried about that.

308
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,719
I'm just afraid it won't be a few days

309
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,200
before I have too many grandchildren.

310
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,920
It won't happen.

311
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,925
I'm very careful.

312
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,325
But I'm afraid

313
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,325
you would bring me back
a younger brother or sister someday.

314
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,160
You...!

315
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,640
Honey.

316
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,880
You're not doing anything
out there, are you?

317
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,725
What did our son mean by that?

318
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:25,650
What do you mean by asking that?

319
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,975
He's talking nonsense.

320
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:28,199
Cut it out.

321
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,760
I'm talking about your work.

322
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:36,520
Don't change the subject.

323
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:38,050
Listen,

324
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,520
if it weren't for me to look after you,

325
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,800
you would be living in the street now.

326
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,160
You're useless,

327
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:44,479
and all you can do is talk nonsense.

328
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:46,880
You looked after me?

329
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,400
You threw me in Australia
for five years.

330
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,520
You looked after me?

331
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,920
I meet you twice a year
since I was a kid.

332
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,439
You're like a shopping mall.

333
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,719
You looked after me?

334
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:56,680
Do you think I didn't look after you?

335
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,640
What you eat, wear, and use,

336
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,239
was any of them not from me...?

337
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,640
You only spent some rotten money.

338
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,719
Do you have to talk about it
all the time?

339
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,160
Fine!

340
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,920
I'll cancel your credit card.

341
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,040
Let's see if you need my rotten money!

342
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,800
Go ahead!

343
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,225
Cancel them all!

344
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,160
I don't need your money!

345
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,520
You started to pick on me
after I came back.

346
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,400
Aren't you too annoying?

347
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,520
You wouldn't even let me eat.

348
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,479
It's perfect for us

349
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,239
to meet twice a year!

350
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:21,439
We don't need to meet more often!

351
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,100
What's going on?

352
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,400
Get out of here
if you don't want to see me!

353
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,400
Get out!

354
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,425
Fine!

355
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:28,479
Why are you fighting?

356
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:30,239
Son, you haven't eaten yet.

357
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,275
Let him go!

358
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,000
Wait, what's wrong with you?

359
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,500
He is just a kid.

360
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,160
Can't you just be more tolerant?

361
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:50,550
Mom!

362
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:52,975
I've been waiting for you for a while.

363
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,479
Well,

364
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:56,150
your dad only scolded you a bit,

365
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,025
just put up with it.

366
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:58,265
What did you have to argue with him?

367
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,075
Where are you going at night?

368
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,520
I'll stay at a hotel for a few days.

369
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,920
Do you have money?

370
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:08,040
I...

371
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,920
Take it.

372
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,319
I didn't ask for it.

373
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,575
I know.

374
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,079
Let me know after you get there.

375
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,920
Order some food, and don't go to sleep

376
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
being hungry.

377
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,075
I see. Thank you, Mom.

378
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:26,275
Drive slowly.

379
00:21:26,425 --> 00:21:27,319
I'm leaving, Mom.

380
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:27,920
Go ahead.

381
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,239
What are you doing back?

382
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,850
- What are you doing back?
- Ms. Li.

383
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,300
Don't come back!

384
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,460
Go away. Go away!

385
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,839
All right, Ms. Li.

386
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,239
He's been out all night.

387
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,625
Why don't you let him in first?

388
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,000
Don't worry about it.

389
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,975
I'll get the nurse to check him later.

390
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,725
He is back.

391
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:00,239
We found him.

392
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:01,800
Go in first.

393
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,050
Do your legs still hurt?

394
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:23,040
Change your clothes yourself.

395
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,275
Sorry, Dr. Gu.

396
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:35,319
It's almost morning.

397
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,675
You've been up all night.

398
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:38,425
Go back and have a good rest.

399
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,475
I'm fine. I'm not very tired.

400
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,050
Is there anything else I can do?

401
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,520
All you and Aunt Li need to do

402
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:47,800
is to have a good rest

403
00:22:48,175 --> 00:22:49,439
and refresh yourselves.

404
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,350
Thank you.

405
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,675
I'll go in first.

406
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:58,250
Um.

407
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,119
Help!

408
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,359
Why are you down there?

409
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:55,575
Because I fell in the water.

410
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,075
What else do you want to draw?

411
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,500
Qiuqiu, do you want to sleep?

412
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,950
Let me get you to bed

413
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,229
after you finish this, okay?

414
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,950
Yes, Captain.

415
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,075
Yes!

416
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,359
You can see such news all the time.

417
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,280
Don't take it seriously.

418
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:15,500
Zhixiao is here.

419
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,600
Mr. Lin.

420
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,199
Um.

421
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:19,525
You know what?

422
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,500
I made the most nutritious soup

423
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
for you this time.

424
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,601
Drink it all.

425
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:25,400
Do you hear me?

426
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,520
Don't spill a drop.

427
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,725
I'll get mad if you do.

428
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,880
With your cooking skills,

429
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,200
I can image

430
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,800
that it won't taste very good.

431
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
How can you say that?

432
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,599
You have stereotyped ideas

433
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,450
about me.

434
00:25:36,825 --> 00:25:39,520
The doctor said
you need to fast an hour later.

435
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,850
Drink it now.

436
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:43,300
How is it? Is it good?

437
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,800
It's okay.

438
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,500
You're doing this again.

439
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,475
What do you mean it's okay?

440
00:25:48,475 --> 00:25:49,725
Just admit that it's delicious.

441
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:50,760
You pretend to not enjoy it, right?

442
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,839
I said it's okay.

443
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,400
There's still a distance
from being delicious.

444
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:54,760
Then you can cook and show me

445
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,560
what's delicious.

446
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,520
I don't have time.

447
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,319
I'm having surgery.

448
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,875
- I...
- You've never

449
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,040
made anything good
before you're having surgery.

450
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,160
It has been Ms. Li cooking.

451
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,520
Li... she...

452
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,640
I'll make you soup when I get better.

453
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,520
You can brag all you want.

454
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,675
- All right. All right.
- I...

455
00:26:07,675 --> 00:26:09,650
You two have the same gene.

456
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,500
You can't live one day without arguing?

457
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,325
Is that so hard for you?

458
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:12,925
Yes, it is.

459
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:13,820
Yes.

460
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:09,119
This is Lin Jianguo on Bed 9

461
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,500
of the In-patient Department.

462
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,640
Lin!

463
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,520
We'll be waiting for you outside!

464
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:29,040
Ms. Li, what are you doing?

465
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,600
I'm fine.

466
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:33,200
I'm sure Lin will be all right.

467
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,599
Why are you crying again?

468
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,225
No, no. I'm fine.

469
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:37,800
It's okay. He'll be fine.

470
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:40,920
Dr. Gu said he will be fine.

471
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,079
It's okay.

472
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,520
- You're crying again.
- No.

473
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,880
No. I'm not.

474
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,079
Have a seat.

475
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,199
Let's sit down and wait for him.

476
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:51,600
(In The Operation)

477
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:33,025
Lin Zhixiao, don't worry.

478
00:28:33,575 --> 00:28:34,850
You and your father

479
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:37,000
will have plenty of time

480
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,040
to do what you want to do.

481
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,500
I'll do my best.

482
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,700
I know.

483
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:46,000
I believe you.

484
00:29:01,422 --> 00:29:03,800
(Operating Room)

485
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,125
Ms. Li.

486
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,280
Dr. Gu said

487
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,225
the operation

488
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,475
is gonna take three hours.

489
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,719
Are you just gonna
keep staring at the door

490
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,475
until you see through it?

491
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,275
I can't see through it.

492
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,625
I can't help but worry a little bit.

493
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,225
Well, Ms. Li.

494
00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:32,850
You're strong and beautiful.

495
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,325
Why did you spend

496
00:29:34,325 --> 00:29:35,500
your whole life

497
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
on that old fogey?

498
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,175
Your father wasn't bad
when he was young.

499
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,600
He was handsome.

500
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,500
Although he is a little old now,

501
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,700
he still has the style.

502
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,640
You are so beautiful.

503
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,475
How did he win your heart?

504
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,875
Your dad was no different

505
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,839
from now.

506
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:03,550
He has

507
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,925
always been mean

508
00:30:05,925 --> 00:30:07,445
and he offends people easily.

509
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,375
But he has been

510
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,325
really good to me.

511
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:16,040
Whenever the school gave out anything,

512
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,775
he would bring it to me.

513
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,750
I liked listening to music at that time.

514
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,150
Your dad saved all his salary

515
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,825
to buy me tapes.

516
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:25,500
At that time,

517
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,450
you know when we bought bags of rice,

518
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,050
we had to carry them
upstairs one by one.

519
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,075
Your dad was skinny back then.

520
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,775
He just

521
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,375
carried the rice upstairs,

522
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:35,325
gasping.

523
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,079
When something happened,

524
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,400
he would show up right away

525
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,775
whenever your grandparents
asked him to come.

526
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,425
You married him

527
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,545
just because of rice and tapes?

528
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,100
Or what?

529
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,575
Zhixiao.

530
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,200
Listen,

531
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,275
now there are people

532
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,100
paying too much attention to appearance.

533
00:30:58,479 --> 00:30:59,750
What appearance is about?

534
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,625
Looks don't matter.

535
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,150
Sweet words are even less important.

536
00:31:05,575 --> 00:31:07,094
Do you know what's important?

537
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,675
The heart.

538
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,575
Turns out I made the right choice.

539
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:25,100
Your father has

540
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,325
never done anything bad to me

541
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,925
in decades.

542
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,700
What can I not be satisfied with?

543
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,900
I think my life is worth living.

544
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,025
It was my luck

545
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:42,150
to meet Lin.

546
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:45,239
Of course, it was your luck to meet him.

547
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,680
If you hadn't met him,

548
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,700
would you have had
such a lovely daughter?

549
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,079
Well.

550
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,575
You get that from me.

551
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,200
Ms. Li.

552
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:57,400
Don't worry.

553
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:59,500
Lin will be all right.

554
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,275
When he gets out,

555
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,050
he will give us lectures every day.

556
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,210
We're gonna have to live with it.

557
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,500
Right.

558
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,375
(In The Operation)

559
00:32:16,975 --> 00:32:18,400
How is him, Doctor?

560
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,000
The operation was a success.

561
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,875
He'll be sent to the ward
when he wakes up from anesthesia.

562
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,975
Right?

563
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,800
I knew it! I knew it!

564
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,000
Everything is fine!

565
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,350
- Ms. Li!
- He's fine!

566
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,400
Your dad is lucky.

567
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,475
He wants me to look after him
for a few more decades.

568
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:34,000
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

569
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,400
I'll go in first.

570
00:32:38,925 --> 00:32:40,900
You'll be fine, Lin.

571
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:42,599
I knew he would be fine.

572
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,900
After all, he had so much energy

573
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,875
when he quarreled with me.

574
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,875
(Thank you, Dr. Gu!!)

575
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:12,750
(Doctor's Office 2)

576
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,100
Dr. Gu.

577
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,875
Dr. Gu.

578
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:27,950
Dr. Gu.

579
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,760
Mr. Lin, how are you feeling today?

580
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,350
Do you have nausea?

581
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,120
I feel bloated.

582
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,025
Bloated.

583
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:35,520
It's normal.

584
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,375
If you don't feel

585
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,639
nausea,

586
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,120
you can have more rice soup tomorrow.

587
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,490
But don't have too much at a time,

588
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,250
and don't make it too sick.

589
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,570
You can have it more often.

590
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,500
Okay, I got that, Dr. Gu.

591
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,675
Mr. Lin, let me check the wound.

592
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:47,500
Okay.

593
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,050
Does it hurt?

594
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,300
A little bit.

595
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,525
Here?

596
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:55,879
Yes.

597
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,275
Okay, I see.

598
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,500
The incision is healing well.

599
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:00,975
You two have been doing great.

600
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,320
Don't be like a baby.

601
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,600
Sorry, Dr. Gu.

602
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,825
Sorry to let you see this.

603
00:35:07,825 --> 00:35:09,520
That's the way he is.

604
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,750
If it weren't for you,

605
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,625
he wouldn't have recovered so quickly.

606
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:14,675
Mr. Lin, you don't look like

607
00:35:14,675 --> 00:35:16,170
someone who would do housework at home.

608
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:17,760
I...

609
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,925
Who said I don't do housework?

610
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,639
I...

611
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,425
He cooked once in a while.

612
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,600
Yes, I cooked.

613
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,975
But Aunt Li would
prepare the ingredients,

614
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,100
and you only need to cook them, right?

615
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,360
Mr. Lin, see?

616
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,719
Even Dr. Gu sees

617
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,150
that we spoil you a lot.

618
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,250
Come on, old boy.

619
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,775
Lin Zhixiao, come with me.

620
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:41,550
Have some.

621
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,840
(Analgesic Plasters
for Bone Hyperplasia)

622
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,075
I think you need this.

623
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:50,550
This is what Lin is using.

624
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Dr. Gu.

625
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,375
You're not using this, are you?

626
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,600
Right.

627
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,975
You're getting on in years.

628
00:35:55,975 --> 00:35:57,000
Take care of yourself.

629
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,080
I just think you and your mother

630
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,560
did a lot to take care of the patient.

631
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:02,560
You two VIP guards

632
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,375
almost become role models in the ward.

633
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,719
The nurses even
asked other patients' family

634
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,950
to learn from you.

635
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,800
It's all because of Ms. Li.

636
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,525
She takes good care of Lin,

637
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:13,924
so I just do it like her.

638
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:17,400
Are you also being so nice
to your boyfriend?

639
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,150
My boyfriend?

640
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:19,775
Um.

641
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,025
My boyfriend's probably still on his way

642
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:24,266
to meet me.

643
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,040
Anyway, when he gets here,

644
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,080
I'll definitely ask him

645
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,800
where he has been all these years

646
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,850
and why he doesn't show up.

647
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,325
By the way,

648
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,100
I've often seen you
play air cello in the ward.

649
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,919
You haven't practiced in a while, right?

650
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:37,760
Yeah.

651
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,100
Our school will
hold a show a few days later.

652
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,959
I want to run for the cellist.

653
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,500
But I haven't practiced for a long time.

654
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,026
I don't know if I can pull it off.

655
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:48,000
I can help you with that.

656
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,050
I'll see you in the lobby
tomorrow morning.

657
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,900
Help me?

658
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,750
Um.

659
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,075
Okay.

660
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,000
What's this?

661
00:37:19,775 --> 00:37:21,850
Charity organizations
come to the hospital regularly

662
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,610
to perform for the patients.

663
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,050
Have a try.

664
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,120
Me?

665
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,000
You said you don't have a place
to practice.

666
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,725
There are so many people now.

667
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,625
Think of it

668
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:37,000
as a rehearsal of the show.

669
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,625
Can I do it?

670
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,300
You already encouraged me once

671
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,350
with your music.

672
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,575
Now it's time to encourage yourself.

673
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:55,925
Go ahead.

674
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:39,879
Thank you.

675
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,275
Lin Zhixiao.

676
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,600
Sir.

677
00:40:13,025 --> 00:40:14,400
That was good.

678
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,225
We have agreed

679
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,300
that you will be the cellist

680
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:19,450
for the show.

681
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,439
Come on, keep practicing.

682
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:23,425
Try to do better in the show.

683
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,250
Thank you!

684
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,075
I'll waste no time

685
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:29,600
to practice more!

686
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,080
I won't let you down!

687
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,700
Good.

688
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,399
Thank you!

689
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:33,280
Keep practicing.

690
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,879
- Goodbye!
- Okay.

691
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:34,760
- Goodbye.
- See you.

692
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,175
Oh my God!

(58.com Recruitment website)

694
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,675
Sansan, I made it!

695
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,500
Hello.

696
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,350
You made it?

697
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,200
Of course. Who I am?

698
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,879
I'm Lin Zhixiao, a talented cellist.

699
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,959
You're so good.

700
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:25,100
You've been taking care
of your dad in the hospital

701
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,650
and you still made it.

702
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,159
You are really talented.

703
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:28,825
By the way,

704
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,325
how is Mr. Lin doing these days?

705
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,675
Mr. Lin is doing great.

706
00:41:32,675 --> 00:41:34,000
Even Dr. Gu said

707
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,399
he is recovering well.

708
00:41:35,399 --> 00:41:36,375
Don't worry.

709
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:37,225
That's great.

710
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:39,550
Actually, thanks to Dr. Gu,

711
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,700
he encouraged me to join

712
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,950
a nonprofit organization
that performs at hospitals.

713
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,660
So I went to perform
with them every day,

714
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:47,950
and it felt like

715
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,575
a live show.

716
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:50,900
I felt great.

717
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:54,300
Why do I think

718
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,425
you've been talking
about Dr. Gu too often?

719
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,975
You talk about

720
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,325
Dr. Gu all the time now.

721
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:01,760
What's going on between you two?

722
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,725
Nothing.

723
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:04,625
Dr. Gu is my dad's attending doctor.

724
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:05,671
It's normal.

725
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:08,600
Zhixiao, are you blind?

726
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,900
With such a good-looking doctor
standing in front of you,

727
00:42:11,325 --> 00:42:13,425
do you still have no reactions?

728
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,525
What are you talking about? I...

729
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,600
I don't have time to think

730
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,850
about such things right now.

731
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:22,300
Now Mr. Lin has had his surgery.

732
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,659
Do you have time to think about it now?

733
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,520
What's his personality like?

734
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,900
Does he have a girlfriend?

735
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,025
You're getting

736
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:31,439
more ridiculous.

737
00:42:31,575 --> 00:42:32,280
The conversation is over.

738
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,040
I'll go to the hospital.

739
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,775
Bye.

740
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,925
Nonsense.

741
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,625
Something is going on between you two.

742
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,675
Who?

743
00:42:56,879 --> 00:42:58,600
Dude, you scared me.

744
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,650
How do you know I'm here?

745
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,950
From your Moments.

746
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,500
Your habit of giving away

747
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,679
your location

748
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:06,560
is not good.

749
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,280
How dangerous it would be

750
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,725
if some creepy guy

751
00:43:08,725 --> 00:43:09,765
targets you!

752
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:16,725
Aren't you the creepy guy

753
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,159
who targets me?

754
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,875
Aren't we friends?

755
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,625
Drinking buddies. You said it.

756
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,360
You call me a creepy guy.

757
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,250
It hurts me.

758
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:35,300
What are you busy with?

759
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:39,100
Are you looking for a job?

760
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,879
You should ask me for help.

761
00:43:41,879 --> 00:43:42,675
I can help you.

762
00:43:43,919 --> 00:43:44,750
You?

763
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:46,725
You don't have a job yet.

764
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:49,825
I'm above
working for other people, okay?

765
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:51,800
In this case,

766
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,760
the young master of the Gu family

767
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,520
is going to do something big.

768
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,525
Yes.

769
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:58,800
I'm going to start my own business,

770
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,520
and

771
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,475
the start-up capital is ready.

772
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,375
I urgently need talents.

773
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:04,525
Well,

774
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:05,959
are you interested

775
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:08,199
in doing something great with me?

776
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:16,663
I have a question for you.

777
00:44:16,663 --> 00:44:17,375
=The Oath of Love=
What?

778
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:18,725
=The Oath of Love=
What was your entrance exam score?

779
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:20,488
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
I don't mean to brag.

780
00:44:20,488 --> 00:44:21,825
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
I got a high score on the exam.

781
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,700
(Lin & Gu's Sweet Little Theatre)
I studied hard in the last three months.

782
00:44:23,775 --> 00:44:25,775
and it was 160 points higher.

783
00:44:25,775 --> 00:44:27,125
What was your score?

784
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,525
160 points higher?

785
00:44:28,525 --> 00:44:29,150
Yes.

786
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,625
160 points higher than
what I got on the third mock exam.

787
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,325
I didn't do well

788
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:36,175
on the college entrance exam.

789
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:37,366
- How much did you get?
- I didn't do well.

790
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,675
A lot lower than my score
on the third mock exam.

791
00:44:39,825 --> 00:44:41,825
I think it was above 700.

792
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,325
Above 700.

793
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:46,925
Yes.

794
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:48,400
It wasn't great.

795
00:44:48,775 --> 00:44:50,375
But it's okay. It's over.

796
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,500
Fortunately, I received
the admission letter

797
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:54,175
from the medical school in the end.

798
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,625
You haven't told me your score.

799
00:44:58,625 --> 00:44:59,575
160 points higher.

800
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:00,800
How much was it?

801
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,850
No interviews.
