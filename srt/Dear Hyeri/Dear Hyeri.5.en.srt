But Jung Hyun Oh, we've been dating for eight years.

57
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,600
If you really didn't want to marry me, you didn't need to date me for eight years.

58
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,240
You should've broken up with me at a reasonable point, in a reasonable place,

60

It takes a child to be born and start elementary school in that time.

75

We're breaking up like this after all that time? In one breath?

- Yes.

155
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,860
You should take them!

We can't take care of them!

161
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,550
You used to adore them. Now, you're scared to take them?

162
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,190
I'm busy trying to put food in my mouth.

163
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:13,150
How are we supposed to take care of them?

164
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,420
You take care of them.

165
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,150
You have the most money!

166
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,490
Frankly, you took all of our dad's money.

Hey! Are you serious right now?

169
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,950
You never did anything for Dad.

170
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,510
When Dad was dying, you looked the other way!

171
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,980
- It's okay, Hye Ri.
- And now...

172
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,980
You have me.

173

Don't do that. That's dirty.

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,920
You've always been smart. You remember me!

186
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,010
You're Eun Ho, right?

187
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,670
Then, are you Hye Ri?

188
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,080
Yes, I'm Hye Ri.

189
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,050
Hye Ri.

190
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,780
Do you want to go with grandma?

191
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,870
Want to go live with grandma?

192
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,770
Unni, you know what? I came in last in class.

193
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,530
Hey, you need to study.

194
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,410
You can't do that when you study with a stranger's money.

195
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,370
I'm sorry.

196
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,700
But Unni, why is Grandma a stranger?

197
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,940
She is.

198
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,110
Do you know how complicated the family tree is?

199
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,200
She still raised us, so we basically owe her.

200
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,800
Plus, we'll move out. I signed the lease on a place.

201
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,220
You'll live downstairs, and I'll live upstairs.

202
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,270
What are you talking about? Why would we leave?

203
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,600
Hye Ri, if we don't leave, will you live here forever?

204
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,840
Yes. Of course.

205
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,780
Grandma will be bored without us.

206
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,570
Listen to me, Ju Hye Ri.

207
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,600
No one in this world is generous without wanting something in return.

208
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,820
That's not true. Grandma is generous and doesn't expect anything in return.

209
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,530
And it's not like she's being generous.

210
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,260
She just loves us.

211
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,350
Love? It's just debt.

212
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,350
Unni! You're so weird.

213
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,430
I don't understand anything you're saying.

214
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,580
A graduation trip?

215
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,100
You should go. You should definitely go to those things.

216
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,880
Go on the graduation trip.

217
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,160
You have no friends because you don't go to things like that.

218
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,480
I don't want to go.

219
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,440
I really don't.

220
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,050
Why don't you want to go?

221
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,960
I like being home better.

222
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,560
I don't have any friends there.

223
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,090
You can make friends there.

224
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,500
How can you have no friends even as you're graduating college?

225
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,050
Go make some.

226
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:55,090
That's how you can be helpful when you start working.

227
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,800
I told you you need to be independent now.

228
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,200
I found a place you can live in, Ju Hye Ri...

229
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,390
But I really-

230
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,220
Go.

231
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,850
I'll assume you're going.

232
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,880
I can send the money to this account, right?

233
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,310
But I really don't want to go, Unni.

234
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,780
I don't need friends.

235
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,500
I'm not going.

236
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,580
All I need is you, Unni.

237
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,270
Ju Hye Ri!

238
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,340
How long are you going to be like this?

239
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,430
You need to be independent!

240
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,960
Work hard at something! Make connections!

241
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,800
You need to get ready to be a part of society!

242
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,730
Stop complaining and go.

243
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,180
Go make friends!

244
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,430
Yes, hello?

245
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,680
I'm sorry.

246
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,160
Could you say that again?

247
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,360
Ju Hye Ri is missing.

248
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,000
Hey, Eun Ho.

249
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,300
Hye Ri hasn't been answering her phone since yesterday.

250
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,360
Did something happen?

251
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,380
Hye... Hye Ri...

252
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,530
A, a college student who left for a graduation trip,

253
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,030
went missing last night.

254
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,480
[As of 2/20/2019, the missing person declaration period is over]

255
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,600
Grandma.

256
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,980
Grandma, are you there?

257
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,600
Grandma, you know...

258
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,200
we'll wait for Hye Ri a little longer, as you said.

259
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,810
Grandma.

260
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,010
Grandma?

261
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,510
Grandma...

262
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,760
Grandma!

263
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,050
Grandma!

264
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,270
Grandma!

265
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,830
[3/4/2012: Working in the parking lot will make me so happy]

266
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,700
Working here is not possible.

267
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,380
We don't need anyone else.

268
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,980
One person is enough.

269
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,500
I'm also not allowed to get paid somewhere else.

270
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,510
I already belong to a company.

271
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,030
Then why do you want to do this?

272
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,040
Can you just let me sit there?

273
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,060
Well...

274
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,000
- That'd be difficult.
- My sister really wanted to do this.

275
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,320
Though I don't know why.

276
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,220
Sunbae, what?

277
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,250
I want to do the morning radio.

278
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,590
I know there's an opening. Plug me there.

279
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,800
I can't work at night.

280
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,750
Hye Ri!

281
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,260
I'm busy. Don't call me at this hour from now on.

282
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,500
Don't ever ask why.

283
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,550
- The administrative office.
- Yeah.

284
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,890
I wanted to live that life.

285
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:58,660
Doing the work she might have done here.

286
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,680
If I lived like her, who was truly happy,

287
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,020
could I be happy as well?

288
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,950
So did you become as happy as Hye Ri, Eun Ho?

289
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,520
No.

290
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,560
I lived as her for three years,

291
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,900
but not at all.

292
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,770
Actually, Eun Ho...

293
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:31,310
you came to see me many times as Hye Ri.

294
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,070
But the fact that you don't remember mean you have

295
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:39,100
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

296
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,540
Doctor, do you mean...

297
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:52,780
I'm no longer pretending to be Hye Ri,

298
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,110
but I've really become her?

299
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,080
Is that why I wrote that letter to myself when I was Hye Ri?

300
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,120
Could I read the letter?

301
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,730
Hello, Eun Ho. My name is Ju Hye Ri.

302
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,820
I am your other identity.

303
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,320
I'm writing because I want to tell you something.

304
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,580
I found happiness,

305
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,140
and I don't want to let it go.

306
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,570
Because...

307
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,680
I have someone I love.

308
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,900
But in my dreams, you seemed really unhappy.

309
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,020
So I'm asking you,

310
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,480
even if you're the owner of this body,

311
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,250
please let me have it because I'm happy.

312
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,660
Please don't take me away from myself.

313
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,670
Because...

314
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:04,220
I'm much happier than you are.

315
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,800
Look. You can see here

316
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,390
how you were as Hye Ri.

317
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:20,770
When you first came to me, I recorded you with your consent.

318
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,580
Let me see it.

319
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,200
Are you sure?

320
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,000
Yes. I want to see it.

321
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:34,940
Then what happens to me, Ju Hye Ri?

322
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,540
Do I disappear?

323
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,780
Do I go away?

324
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,890
Eun Ho has only existed in my dreams.

325
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:48,800
Doctor, I'm happy now.

326
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,110
I don't want to abandon Hye Ri.

327
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,930
At least, in the present,

328
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:57,540
I am much happier than Eun Ho from my dreams.

329
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,020
Doctor.

330
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,560
Yes, Eun Ho. Go ahead.

331
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,190
Did Ju Hye Ri seem...

332
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,920
happy to you, too?

333
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,220
What did the doctor say?

334
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,100
What? Is it serious?

335
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,060
No.

336
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,740
Wasn't that Shin Joong on the phone?

337
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,140
- Yeah.
- What did he say?

338
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,200
Today is Department Head Oh's last day.

339
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,360
Really? I thought he was retiring at the end of the year.

340
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,290
Yeah, but it must have been decided last month.

341
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,910
So after the holiday, you'll be taking over the 9 o'clock news.

342
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,840
Not sure.

343
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,090
What do you mean not sure?

344
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,190
I think it's leaking.

345
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,750
This? I found it on the street.

346
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,270
Wait, for real?

347
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,930
Would it be fake?

348
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,920
Why did you have to pick up a broken one?

349
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,190
That's probably why it got thrown out. Then I found it.

350
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,340
It wouldn't have been thrown out otherwise.

351
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,560
That seems logical.

352
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,100
Excuse me. Did Ju Hye Ri not come to work again?

353
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,430
No. She didn't.

354
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,710
She usually does.

355
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,390
Did she not come in yesterday, either?

356
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,980
No.

357
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,360
You can't reach her, either?

358
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,450
No, I mean...

359
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,850
Ju Hye Ri doesn't have a phone.

360
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,660
I thought so, too, but remember when she passed out in the restroom?

361
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,680
At that time- hold on a second.

362
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,470
This was on the floor next to her.

363
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,200
- It's a phone.
- Yes.

364
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,710
But it won't turn on, even after I charged it.

365
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,990
I don't know whose this is.

366
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,490
But I can't ask unless she's here.

367
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,580
Hye Ri doesn't have a phone, and I don't have her address...

368
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,500
Can I bring that to her?

369
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,940
I do know her address.

370
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,880
Sure. Of course.

371
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,030
Thank you.

372
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,930
Excuse me!

373
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,640
If you see Hye Ri, could you tell her something from me?

374
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,130
Like what?

375
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,920
That she's dead meat.

376
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,930
Okay.

377
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,130
You hungry? Want me to make you something?

378
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,180
Are you hungry? Want me to make you something?

379
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,040
Yes.

380
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:23,050
I want something delicious.

381
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,110
Got it. I'll make you something delicious.

382
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,350
Something high in calories.

383
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,120
Not that.

384
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,790
Do you know how puffy your face looks onscreen these days?

385
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,370
Like you eat late at night every night.

386
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,970
What's this?

387
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,500
Nothing.

388
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,260
Are you knitting these days?

389
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,410
You must have a lot of time on your hands.

390
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,130
What? No.

391
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,770
So, what are you going to make me?

392
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,380
Tomato and egg stir fry?

393
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,930
Wow.

394
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,670
Sounds good.

395
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:32,750
[Golden Holiday Special Live Broadcast]

396
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:37,090
Special live broadcast of "The Country Right Now, And Us" for the holiday weekend.

397
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,870
Hello, we are at the Square Rest Stop.

398
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,520
This is a place for people traveling for the weekend

399
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,240
to stop and rest for a while.

400
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,010
Yes. The rain that started at the top of the holiday weekend

401
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,390
have subsided outside the Seoul region.

402
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,590
Rain is planned to resume tomorrow morning,

403
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,950
but right now,

404
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,360
it's busy here with people enjoying the long weekend.

405
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,670
Should we chat with one of those people?

406
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,450
Please call Yoo Ra.

407
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,500
The main writer. Yoo Ra.

408
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,320
Call her.

409
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,280
She's not picking up my calls.

410
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,570
Oh, well, that's...

411
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,150
She did arrive here...

412
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:27,160
I mean, she's not here. No, she wasn't able to...

413
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,660
Then...

414
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,170
could you deliver this message

415
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,730
to Yoo Ra what I'm about to say?

416
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,470
Yes. If you tell me, I can deliver the message...

417
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,850
I was...

418
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,870
told I'd be the main emcee.

419
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:48,390
But I didn't even get the first greeting.

420
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:51,060
I keep being asked to do interviews,

421
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,650
or to laugh at dumb jokes.

422
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,170
That's...

423
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,810
not how you do this.

424
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,390
And her.

425
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,280
That Baek Hye Yeon.

426
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,220
I've been doing this for 15 years longer than her.

427
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:12,410
But my role is smaller than hers.

428
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:18,080
What do you think will happen if you keep doing this?

429
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,290
Do you have a phone?

430
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,800
Unfortunately, I get no joy out of the selfishness of civilization.

431
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,730
Sunbae, I'm scared.

432
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,570
That sunbae...

433
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,610
How should I say this? I think she might kill me.

434
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,800
She wouldn't kill me, would she?

435
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,190
Or, Sunbae, I think that Sunbae might beat me up.

436
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:09,150
Sunbae, I've been bullied a lot, but I've never been beaten up.

437
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,830
Am I going to get beaten up? It'd be my first time. I'm scared.

438
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,080
Sunbae, is she always that scary?

439
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,170
You know...

440
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,400
my heart is beating so fast.

441
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,600
But...

442
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:30,630
how do you contact someone with a broken phone

443
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,130
or doesn't have one at all?

444
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,700
How would I know that?

445
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,020
Hello.

446
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,930
I'm looking for the contact information of an employee at the parking booth.

447
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,550
Yes. Sure.

448
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,520
I'm aware.

449
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,960
Are you crazy?

450
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,530
I'm asking you. Are you crazy?

451
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,210
- Well...
- What did you say when you called me a month ago?

452
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,920
"Unni, we're doing a holiday special live broadcast.

453
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,130
We'll tour rest stops around the country, end up in Busan, and raise money.

454
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,800
It's a very well-intentioned program.

455
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,900
Unni, I want you to be the main emcee on it.

456
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,680
What do you think, Unni?"

457
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,840
If we stand in line, does that make me the main emcee?

458
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,100
- It's not like that...
- Answer me, Yoo Ra.

459
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,760
Is that what you call a main emcee?

460
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,750
Because I don't think so. How do I say this?

461
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,870
We might both be the main emcees,

462
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,530
but Baek Hye Yeon is actually hosting.

463
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,710
But what about me?

464
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,400
I feel like I'm just being extra next to her.

465
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,830
Excuse me.

466
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,380
- Me?
- Yes.

467
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,730
Mi Rae says she won't do it.

468
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,400
- Do what?
- She says she won't host anymore.

469
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,490
She's so pissed about you that she won't do it.

470
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,050
But as you know, we're toast without her.

471
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,170
She says she'll skip all the rest stop footage from now on.

472
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:08,330
Well, fine, I can deal with that.

473
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,790
But if she misses filming tomorrow,

474
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,740
we're completely toast.

475
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,350
So I'm asking you.

476
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,770
Please convince Mi Rae.

477
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,000
I begged, but it didn't work.

478
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,500
Please help me out.

479
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,800
This is a special holiday live broadcast of "The Country Right Now, And Us."

480
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,350
We're at Mangjoong Rest Stop.

481
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,660
We're much closer to the beaches of Busan.

482
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,880
What's the weather like in Busan right now?

483
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,320
It's very clear in Busan.

484
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,260
Could you introduce yourself first?

485
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,360
Oh, yes. Me? I...

486
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,450
We've met before.

487
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,950
I've seen you before. For sure.

488
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,500
Yes.

489
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,170
Hello. You don't need to go in person to experience Busan's weather.

490
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:09,600
- Because the age we are living in...
- Damn it.

491
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,810
- has highly developed technology.
- Is he on Media N Seoul right now?

492
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,080
AI is changing our world...

493
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,830
- Did he get permission?
- But we are still living in an analog reality.

494
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:25,340
Should I have gotten my makeup done?

495
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,720
Excuse me.

496
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,310
Me?

497
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,650
Excuse me.

498
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,730
You said you knew me earlier.

499
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:45,880
Of course, I do. I've seen you talking to Ju Eun Ho's sister.

500
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,300
Well...

501
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,330
who's Ju Eun Ho?

502
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,110
We'll gather in the lobby at 10 a.m. tomorrow and go to the studio together.

503
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,680
[Ju Eun Ho]
Got it!

504
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,400
[Ju Eun Ho]
Great work! Thank you!

505
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,300
Do you live with your family?

506
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,360
No, I live alone.

507
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,420
I guess you can say I'm an only child.

508
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,730
Hey.

509
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,340
You know...

510
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,700
I've done the 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, and 9 o'clock news.

511
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,400
As in, I have as much, no...

512
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:55,880
more recognition than you.

513
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:01,200
But do you know what that Press Director bastard called me and said?

514
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:06,610
That I should be thankful to be on TV.

515
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,920
Why?

516
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,140
Because I'm old.

517
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,450
But everyone gets old.

518
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,110
Including you.

519
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,200
I'm saying...

520
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,300
you'll meet a hoobae like yourself and fuming just like me in a few years.

521
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,400
I'm sorry,

522
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,100
but I have no intention of sharing a room with you.

523
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,860
Excuse me, Sunbaenim.

524
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,890
Why? What?

525
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,220
I won't share a room with you. I won't complain.

526
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:02,240
But could you please do the broadcast tomorrow?

527
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,030
I'll ask the Press Director if we can split the lines.

528
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,580
I beg you, Sunbaenim.

529
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,780
Hey, it's me.

530
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,280
Where are you?

531
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,730
Can you maybe...

532
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,730
come here right now?

533
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,540
Do you usually not sleep?

534
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,440
How can you sleep for 12 hours at a time?

535
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,270
Maybe you have a sleep disorder, not a panic disorder.

536
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,290
Is it morning or not?

537
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:53,100
Morning? It's evening.

538
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,680
Well, I...

539
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,710
What? What?

540
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,900
Did I wake up at some point?

541
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,780
- Did I...
- What are you talking about?

542
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,950
I thought you were dead. I kept checking to see if you were breathing.

543
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,540
Where did you find those clothes?

544
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:21,920
I don't know. My clothes were damp, and I found them in your closet.

545
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,600
Oh, I meant to get rid of your clothes, but I...

546
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,240
It's fine. Get out. It's dirty.

547
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,280
Go where? Hey!

548
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,370
Just get out.

549
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,580
I just woke up. Where-

550
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,830
It's dirty. Get out!

551
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:39,070
- Go, go, go.
- I'm cold.

552
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,990
Hey, do you have a scrubber?

553
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,330
- There isn't one in the kitchen?
- No. Not there.

554
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,210
Then, I don't have one.

555
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,350
Geea, for real?

556
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,380
Let's go.

557
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,900
- Where?
- To get a scrubber.

558
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,220
Did you finish cleaning?

559
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,690
Your place is so dirty. So, so, so dirty.

560
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,640
How can you be like that? Do you only wash your face in that house?

561
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,970
How could you not have a scrubber?

562
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,710
Hyun Oh, I'm hungry.

563
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:37,450
Of course, you are. But I'm not hungry at all.

564
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,420
Why? I ate plenty of dust.

565
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,150
Make me something delicious.

566
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,290
No.

567
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:47,870
You absolutely cannot eat anything at this hour.

568
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,480
Young man, try this.

569
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,400
Not you, young lady.

570
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,440
Young man, try it.

571
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,330
You had two already, young lady.

572
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,880
I'll take it.

573
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,300
How is it? It's good, right?

574
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,800
- Want one?
- I'll take one.

575
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,090
Thank you.

576
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,520
You're so good-looking, young man.

577
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,870
I feel like I've seen you somewhere.

578
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:18,990
Live Issue-In or something? Right?

579
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:28,520
I'm on it, too. Can I have that pork cutlet?

580
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,540
Give me some! I want some, too!

581
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,760
Let's go over there. You like ice cream, right?

582
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,940
I want the pork cutlet more!

583
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,630
Let's go. Let's go.

584
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:49,230
Try some pork cutlets!

585
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,660
[Busan]

586
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,200
[453,000 won]
Aigoo, thank you.

587
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,990
Thank you.

588
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,500
We have so much food. I feel so rich.

589
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,260
You need to eat all of this.

590
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,940
You once told me I just need to take fresh vitamins.

591
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:29,920
I mean, just eat it all so it doesn't go to waste.

592
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,490
Really?

593
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,070
Stop that.

594
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:35,380
I don't want to.

595
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,810
- I fell!
- Are you okay?

596
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:42,050
- Hey!
- Karma.

597
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:43,380
Really?

598
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,540
- Totally karma.
- Make me something delicious.

599
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,750
- Okay.
- What are you going to make?

600
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:50,720
- Something as good as how hard you fell.
- Can you make pork cutlets?

601
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,490
Careful.

602
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:56,140
One, two... one, two...

603
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,540
- Is it good?
- Yes, so good.

604
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,980
You eat well, Ju Eun Ho.

605
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:10,490
When will you start taking care of yourself? When you're dead?

606
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:14,260
No, I'll do it right now.

607
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:21,730
I'm going to start glowing right now. I'll totally be...

608
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:26,110
Why are you laughing?

609
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:28,520
Am I already prettier?

610
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,510
Yes, right.

611
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,740
You should go on a diet, though.

612
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,100
What diet?

613
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,930
Ahead of the first weekend of May, called the "Golden Holiday,"

614
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:42,430
- flight and train reservations are on the uphill.
- It's Shim Eun Young.

615
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:46,580
The whole country is predicted to be busy with tourists and vacationers.

616
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:50,440
- That's right.
- With cars headed out early for the road,

617
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,190
- the highways are congested...
- She must be back.

618
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,500
- The extreme traffic...
- How old is Shim Eun Young?

619
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,130
Fifty-three.

620
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,660
I'm so jealous. A main news anchor at that age?

621
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,300
It has subsided briefly, and early morning...

622
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,300
- You also do that someday.
- It is projected to increase again.

623
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,290
Yeah. You, too.

624
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:10,750
- Southbound direction, tomorrow morning...
- What?

625
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,390
When you go on the 9 o'clock news soon...

626
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:16,110
do it forever like her.

627
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:18,860
To prevent large-scale traffic accidents, police...

628
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,140
And wait.

629
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,600
- Until...
- Please be careful especially during long drives.

630
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,220
I take the seat next to yours.

631
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,190
I'm Shim Eun Young. Thank you.

632
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,930
If you keep eating that much, you won't get to sit anywhere.

633
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:42,890
Hey!

634
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,320
You got here faster than I expected.

635
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,530
I was in Daegu for a broadcast.

636
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:16,180
Come in.

637
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:24,770
Wow. Nice room. Your special must have money.

638
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:27,240
I paid for it.

639
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,920
I got kicked out.

640
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,850
By who?

641
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:32,350
Why?

642
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,520
Just because. It just happened.

643
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,810
Why? D-Did something happen?

644
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,330
No. Nothing.

645
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:43,700
Then why did you call me?

646
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,490
Just because.

647
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,890
I want you to touch me.

648
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,880
I mean, sure.

649
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,890
Where did Kang Ju Yeon go?

650
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:14,920
Are you sure you told him the right call time?

651
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,360
Yes.

652
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,080
I'm sorry.

653
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,450
I'm sorry.

654
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:25,780
- Ju Yeon!
- I'm sorry.

655
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,180
We were worried!

656
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,020
Get in! Just get in. Let's go.

657
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,920
Where were you?

658
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,940
To Seoul.

659
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,660
- What, Seoul?
- What?

660
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,370

[Busan Beach]

662
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,720
The holiday weekend special live broadcast of "The Country Right Now, And Us."

663
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,770
Hello, I'm Announcer Kang Ju Yeon.

664
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:50,040
We are here today at a special stage built on the beach.

665
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,820
Many people are here at the beach to enjoy the holiday.

666
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,050
The holidays might be full of excitement and anticipation,

667
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:02,930
but some of our neighbors are experiencing hardship and spending the holidays alone.

668
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:08,840
What did he say?

669
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:14,400
"Someone like you in that spot at your age."

670
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,550
He said I should be relieved.

671
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,970
I should've been kicked out a long time ago,

672
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:24,840
but I'm only here because I managed to hang on.

673
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,320
He's a Press Director for the Announcer Department.

674
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,880
Does he know how the world is changing when he runs his mouth?

00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,560
Press Director can be harsh. He has a temper.

00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,600
I have a temper, too. I do, too!

No. I want to know so badly how you manage to get programs.

00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:18,300
How did you manage to climb up so high at your age?

685
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,000

00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:34,020
is the rumor really true?

690

You know what the rumor is, right?

691
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:38,580
The rumor about you.

00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,200
Unni, stop drinking. Let's go. Let's go now.

693
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,330
Let's just go.

694
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,680
Yes, Sunbaenim.

695
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,470
It's true. Why? Are you jealous?

696
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,160
What?

697
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,230
At least, there are rumors about me. Are you jealous of me?

698
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,950
Is she...

699
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:11,810
crazy?

700
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,440
But Sunbaenim...

701
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:20,400
even if that rumor is true,

702
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,430
I've never done anything against my conscience.

703
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,260
Never.

704
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,980

00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,230
Who knows that?

706
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:34,460
I do.

707
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,400
It's my body.

708
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,300
Sunbae, aren't you getting off?

709
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,200
Also, Sunbae.

710
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,840
I haven't been okay this entire broadcast.

711
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,950
You probably didn't notice at all.

712
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:43,640
That's probably why you didn't try that hard to comfort me.

713
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,670
But you know...

714
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,170

- What?

00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,900
What should we have for breakfast?

720

721
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:25,670
Hyun Oh?

722
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,570
When did you get up?

723
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,310
W-Where did you go?

724
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:50,290
I went to get groceries.

725
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,290
Wow, no matter how much stuff I buy for your place,

726
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:57,000
I keep needing things.

727
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,480
Your place is so cluttered, but there's nothing useful.

728
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,050
What did you get?

729
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,750
Just some stuff.

730
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:15,170
You should have gotten that. The fried mushroom stuffed with shrimp.

731
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:16,960
It's so good.

732
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:20,570
I went to every store in the area looking for it.

733
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:25,400
But I couldn't find it. Where can I get it? It goes so well with pork belly.

734
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:27,720
Right?

735
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:31,460
You always want anything with pork belly.

736
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:34,280
You love pork belly.

737
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,610
Should we just go get pork belly?

738
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,020
What?

739
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:45,040
Okay. Let's just go get pork belly right now.

740
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:47,630
You mean it, right?

741
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:51,980
I'll go change right now. You mean it, right? Yay!

742
00:57:58,550 --> 00:57:59,810
Hello?

743
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,710
Oppa...

744
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:04,950
What's wrong, Moon Soo Jeong?

745
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,850
Oppa, what do I do?

746
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:11,170
Moon Soo Jeong, calm down.

747
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:13,980
So... well...

748
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:19,070
Hyun Oh, we're at the hospital.

749
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,040
Grandma Mi Ja got hurt.

750
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,020
It's nothing serious.

751
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,350
Hello?

752
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:27,090
Where should we go?

753
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,630
The stone grill pork belly place we went to before?

754
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:32,880
I don't know if it's still there.

755
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,000
It's been four years. It might be gone.

756
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,700
- Right, Hyun Oh?
- I have to go.

757
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,270
Goodbye.

758
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:20,440
So long.

759
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,800
That's the end of it, Eun Ho.

760
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:39,270
Hyun Oh...

761
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:41,490
Hyun Oh, don't go. Don't go.

762
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,010
Don't go. Please?

763
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:46,370
I'm not getting married, Ju Eun Ho.

764
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:48,150
But you want to.

765
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:52,350
No, I won't. I'll never bring up marriage again.

766
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:55,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hyun Oh.

767
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,130
No.

768
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,960
No, Eun Ho.

769
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,750
You're going to bring it up again.

770
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:06,670
Then, more time will have passed.

771
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,340
So...

772
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:14,130
let's stop here, Ju Eun Ho.

773
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,090
Eun Ho!

774
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,790
Ju Eun Ho!

775
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:15,290
Eun Ho.

776
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,460
Get sick.

777
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,680
Just like this...

778
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,130
Get sick sometimes, Eun Ho.

779
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:50,790
[I know. If you come back, it will hurt very much.]

780
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,400
Please, Eun Ho.

781
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,890
Will you, Eun Ho?

782
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,910
No.

783
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:27,170
[No.]

784
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,700
I'll never...

785
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,880
be sick again.

786
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:43,780
♫ All the seasons we spent together ♫

787
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:46,240
I'll be healthy no matter what happens.

788
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,430
♫ Inside the quiet anticipation ♫

789
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,300
You'll see...

790
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,810
♫ Time passes ♫

791
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,620
how well I'm doing.

792
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:01,810
♫ The moment I thought would never ♫

793
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:09,800
♫ It came to us soundlessly ♫

794
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:11,560
Goodbye.

795
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:14,960
That's how we say bye, right?

796
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:21,490
♫ Inside my quiet heart ♫

797
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:26,250
[Let's put ourselves...]

798
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:37,750
♫ In the soft sunshine weather, we were on that road standing there ♫

799
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:42,730
[away in a bookcase and never take us out again]

800
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:49,930
♫ Our today, full of sunshine ♫

801
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,870
Why are you crying?

802
01:03:51,900 --> 01:04:00,580
♫ I hope we stay somewhere so deep ♫

803
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,560
You're supposed to say goodbyes with a smile.

804
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:07,900
♫ I thought you would come back ♫

805
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:17,600
♫ Like a leaf in the wind, you turned away ♫

806
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:23,870
♫ I don't recognize my own face or words ♫

807
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:28,880
♫ I say things I don't mean ♫

808
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,700
♫ The moment I sent you away ♫

809
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:43,900
♫ In the soft sunshine weather, I stayed there forever ♫

810
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:48,720
♫ Holding onto the things I never said ♫

811
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:54,700
♫ Our today, full of sunshine ♫

812
01:04:54,700 --> 01:05:00,820
♫ I hope we stay somewhere so deep ♫

813
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,090
♫ After every moment ♫

814
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,800
So long, Jung Hyun Oh.

815
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:10,900
♫ How can I say all this? ♫

816
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:18,960
♫ You shined a light in my dark heart ♫

817
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:25,020
♫ You held my hand tightly ♫

818
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:32,280
♫ In the soft sunshine weather, we were ♫

819
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,340
♫ I want to go back, and I want to say ♫

820
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:40,990
♫ You're the reason I breathe ♫

821
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:47,000
♫ There's only one of my story in the world ♫

822
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,200
♫ So I can be completed by you ♫

823
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:58,290
♫ In all time ♫

824
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,500
♫ You and me ♫

825
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:21,910
[Let's keep us in our hearts and never miss each other]

826
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:27,020
[Goodbye]

827
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:34,970
[Dear Hyeri]

828
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:40,710
What kind of woman would marry me?

829
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:47,250
Taking care of the grandmas should be my job.

830
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:51,880
It's bearable for me here,

831
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,980
but to others, it's hell.

832
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,350
Do you...

833
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,950
even want to get married?

834
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,370
You do want it, right?

835
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:09,100
But that woman...

836
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:12,910
must not be someone who would fit in here.
