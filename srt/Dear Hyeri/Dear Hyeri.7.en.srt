00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,440
It was next to you when you passed out last time.

182
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,110
I kept it. Take it.

183
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,150
Was this...

184
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,440
on?

185
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,260
It is yours, right?

186
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,200
No. It's my sister's.

187
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,740
I don't remember why, but I must have had it that day.

188
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,470
You had your sister's phone on you.

189
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,380
But why don't you remember...

190
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,790
I know.

191
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,150
I'm not sure about that, either.

192
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,690
Then, Hye Ri.

193
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,290
I wanted to get in touch with you

194
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,970
so I called the administrative office.

195
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,820
But they said your employee record-

196
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,400
I don't have that.

197
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,010
How can you not...

198
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,300
I don't know. I must not be registered yet.

199
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,610
Maybe it was omitted.

200
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,780
I see.

201
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,250
So, it was omitted.

202
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,710
Kang Ju Yeon.

203
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,600
You accept things very quickly.

204
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,370
That's because...

205
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,580
it's coming from you, Hye Ri.

206
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,980
You also seem like a very curious person.

207
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,480
That's because...

208
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,370
you got me curious, Hye Ri.

209
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,250
Good morning!

210
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,960
It's not that he didn't make it.

211
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,360
He gave up the 9 o'clock news because of you!

212
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,730
- W-What?
- That punk met the Press Director privately

213
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,090
and traded your 12 o'clock spot for his 9 o'clock!

214
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,060
Please let Jung Hyun Oh audition, Press Director.

215
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,300
You know how good he is.

216
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,020
Hey.

217
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,100
Yes, Press Director.

218
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,830
You two are so desperate for each other. But just keep it between you two.

219
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,370
Stop trying to insert me into it.

220
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:54,080
You know, Jung Hyun Oh could ask me for a favor. Fine.

221
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,310
I can give it to him. Why? Because he's a star.

222
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,750
But...

223
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,780
how dare you?

224
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,130
Get out.

225
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,630
So?

226
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,170
I'll drop out of the 12 o'clock news. Starting today.

227
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,360
And?

228
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,630
So, put Jung Hyun Oh back on the 9 o'clock news.

229
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,530
If the 9 o'clock anchor seat was something

230
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:38,530
I could plug in and out as I wish...

231
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,830
then plug back in and out,

232
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,030
none of this would have ever happened, Eun Ho.

233
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,800
Sunbae, you could go to the Press Director and appeal it.

234
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,170
I'll quit.

235
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,070
The decision has already been made. If your change of heart

236
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:04,150
could make the Press Director change the hire,

237
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,420
I would have never bowed down to that bastard in the first place.

238
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,330
You did already?

239
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:18,860
I did. I tried everything.

240
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,890
Nothing worked.

241
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,410
You know what I'm hoping for now?

242
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,000
- What?
- That Jeon Jae Yong messes up the news.

243
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,490
That's given.

244
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,990
He's not good. He was so bad as a reporter that he got demoted.

245
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,180
No, no, no, no.

246
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:45,420
I hope he does so badly, beyond my wildest imagination,

247
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,280
that Soh Chin Guk hangs onto my leg, saying, "I'm sorry, Team Leader Kim.

248
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,850
Give me Jung Hyun Oh. Please!"

249
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,590
I'll make him beg, Eun Ho.

250
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,930
Yes, Sunbae. Make that dream come true.

251
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,750
If you need me, I can do-

252
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,810
No, no, no, no. I don't need you, Eun Ho.

253
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,440
Right. But if you need me in the future...

254
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,130
Please get out of my office now, Eun Ho.

255
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,520
[So Chin Guk]

256
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,430
[Jeon Jae Yong]

257
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,920
Welcome.

258
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Aigoo, hello.

259
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,290
As for me, I'm about to be the face of the PPS 9 o'clock news,

260
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,530
Anchor Jeon Jae Yong.

261
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,900
Sure. Would you like to order?

262
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,490
What?

263
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,200
Yes. Order. I should order.

264
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,000
Then I'll have...

265
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,870
an etoupe chocolate cheesecake ppucino.

266
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,180
Hey.

267
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,280
He's going to do the 9 o'clock news with that diction?

268
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,350
What does Soh Chin Guk see in Jeon Jae Yong?

269
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,020
Because he's a reporter.

270
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,790
I told you. They take care of their own.

271
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:30,700
A large size etoupe chocolate java chip frappucino.

272
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,520
One. Just one cup of coffee.

273
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,670
Hyun Oh just looks like a massive fool.

274
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,370
What is Jung Hyun Oh up to now, anyway?

275
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,660
Aigoo. Hey, Hyun Oh, you're here.

276
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,880
Hey, smile.

277
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,390
Dude, smiling is good for you. Smile!

278
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,600
Team Leader, do you think I can smile in this situation?

279
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,570
The higher-ups suddenly...

280
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,170
asked me why you're taking up

281
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,790
that big office when you're not even doing the 9 o'clock news.

282
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,000
They said you need to vacate immediately.

283
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,390
They said it made no sense a deputy has a big office anyway,

284
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,770
saying it was "A waste of space and time."

285
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:32,070
When the country is struggling, saving little space where we can is patriotism.

286
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,790
Sure, sure.

287
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,810
Don't sigh, Hyun Oh.

288
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,710
Everything is screwed. What's the use of sighing?

289
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,320
Smile!

290
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,390
Smile like me. Me?

291
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,900
Smiling makes me feel better about everything.

292
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:55,310
My insides feel like they're rotting, but I feel alive on the outside.

293
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,190
Plus, isn't it nice?

294
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:03,350
How long has it been since you worked in a bustling office alongside other people?

295
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,590
Also,

296
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,930
this is a really nice desk.

297
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:12,200
It's so nice that we kept it empty this whole time.

298
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,000
I see. It's such a nice desk that you kept it empty?

299
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,230
Of course. Look.

300
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,880
It's close to the night duty room over there, and look...

301
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,270
It's very close to your ex-girlfriend's desk.
[Announcer Ju Eun Ho]

302
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,180
Team Leader.

303
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,480
I'm sorry, but can you stop and go away?

304
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,250
Sure.

305
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,110
Hey, man, smile. Smile.

306
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,690
The higher-ups asked me suddenly why Jung Hyun Oh was taking up that big office

307
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,240
when he's not even doing the 9 o'clock news.

308
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,300
Saying it's a "Waste of time and space."

309
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,920
Hello, viewers. This is the PPS Friday 12 o'clock news.

310
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,870
We'll start with news from the industrial...

311
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,080
Hey, Ju Eun Ho.

312
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,100
Why? What's up?

313
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,690
Why were you crying in the office?

314
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,110
Because Hyun Oh didn't make the news?

315
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,700
When did you see that?

316
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,230
I'm always watching you from somewhere.

317
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,840
Ji On.

318
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,330
Could you repeat after me?

319
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,650
What?

320
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,200
Noo-na. Sun-bae.

321
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,720
If you don't like those two words, maybe just "hey" or "you."

322
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,870
Are you okay now?

323
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,010
I thought you didn't want to talk to me anymore.

324
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,740
Why are you talking to me again?

325
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,390
I'm quite used to the loneliness without you.

326
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,370
Because I'm totally over you now.

327
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:59,800
You're just a person to me now, like the rest of humanity.

328
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,520
I'm able to have a conversation with you now.

329
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,140
Wow. That's good news.

330
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:11,370
But now that I think of it, couldn't you go on a date with me?

331
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,040
Gosh, you said you're over me. What date?

332
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,830
Just person to person. Human to human.

333
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,870
No thanks.

334
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,390
We kissed, so let's call it even.

335
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,520
Call it even with that?

336
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,120
Starting off with news of corruption in the industrial sector.

337
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,910
According to the transportation survey, the corruption issue of a corporation surfaced.

338
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,940
Team Leader.

339
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,350
I went to Media N Seoul to say I'm not doing it.

340
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,730
I know.

341
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,280
But you had a good reason, then.

342
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,800
You were the anointed 9 o'clock news anchor.

343
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,510
How do I put this? We were able to...

344
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,960
say no to them casually yet inoffensively.

345
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,620
But you now?

346
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:04,040
You're just a kid barely doing the morning daily program.

347
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,480
Right?

348
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,770
Right.

349
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,710
Currently, you're the least busy person in our office.

350
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,300
- No. Ju Eun Ho must be less busy.
- No, no, no.

351
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,400
Hey. You're less busy.

352
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,000
That's impossible.

353
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,160
Don't worry about it.

354
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,440
Apples to apples. I recommended both of you.

355
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,360
So, get to Media N Seoul by 1 p.m. tomorrow.

356
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,360

Take Eun Ho to Media N Seoul by 1 p.m.

359
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,630

365
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,500
- You don't like fishing?
- No. I don't.
