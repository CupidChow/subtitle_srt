00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,300
Because now that I know you like me,

182
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,150
I feel a lot more pressure.

183
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,560
That makes sense.

184
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,520
Yes. As you know, I don't like you at all.

185
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,300
But Sunbae...

186
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,700
I do like you, but...

187
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,680
I won't insist that you like me back.

188
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,200
I just love your family so much.

189
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,940
Liking someone who doesn't like you might hurt you.

190
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,760
No. I'm strong about this kind of stuff.

191
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,100
Then, let me be more clear.

192
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,670
I don't want to be the bad guy who hurts someone.

193
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,540
But Sunbae, I can't give up yet...

194
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,080
Eun Cho Rong, please respect someone else's feelings, too.

195
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,880
Until now, I considered it a little bit.

196
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,970
But not anymore.

197
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,290
Eun Cho Rong, we will never get married.

198
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:42,520
So, please don't bring up marriage again anywhere.

199
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,680
Okay, Sunbae.

200
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,180
I'll do that.

201
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,870
Then, let's get back to work.

202
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,910
But Sunbae...

203
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:10,160
you're so gentle even after saying such cruel things.

204
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,470
I don't need to be cold to you.

205
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,070
Where are you headed? The office?

206
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,800
Yes. I'm going to the office.

207
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,310
By the way, Grandma Mi Ja wants us to gather later.

208
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,060
What do you think she wants to say?

209
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,290
Not sure. I don't know.

210
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,730
They say there's some improvement.

211
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,870
Unbelievable.

212
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,900
That's unbelievable.

213
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,090
What is? Me getting better?

214
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,430
You've been rubbing me the wrong way this whole time.

215
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,990
Do you want me to die? Or-

216
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,860
Unni! She's crying tears of joy.

217
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,270
Don't go too far.

218
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:04,280
Then, I can relax now and have a smoke.

219
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,460
No smoking.

220
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,830
But she's allowed to drink! Why not me?

221
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,670
Grandma Young Ja has a very clean liver.

222
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,240
But what did the doctor say to you?

223
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,280
That I should stop smoking.

224
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,640
Yes, that's right.

225
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,980
Aigoo, after you got cancer,

226
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,270
Hyun Oh's nagging got worse.

227
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,610
Hyun Oh, don't worry.

228
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,050
I'm a lot better, so-

229
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,370
How does cancer get better?

230
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,640
You need to keep getting treatment.

231
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,640
Hey. If I just stay-

232
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,340
Unni! Unni!

233
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,900
Grandma!

234
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,150
What do I do?

235
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,770
What?

236
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,220

00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,020
Hurry. Hurry up and leave!

239
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,190
And don't call me again. Got it?

240
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,170
Hey, Shin Yeong, this is-

241
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,390
Damn it.

244
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,120
I've been everywhere.

247
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,740
No way. I haven't held this hand in forever.

248
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,170
Aigoo, so nice and warm.

249
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,290
She used to be cute. What happened to her?

250
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,780
I don't know.

251
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,830
I don't know when it happened, either. It's a real mystery.

252
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,680
- Honey, want more rice?
- Yes.

253
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,400
We should raise a glass on a day like this.

254
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,750
We have an expensive bottle that Hyun Oh brought back from a business trip!

255
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,610
- Grandma, no.
- Why not?

256
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:22,460
- I'm healthy!
- No.

257
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,400
Why is he so straight-edge now?

258
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,520
Do Hyeong, ever since Mi Ja got cancer,

259
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,150
he's lost his mind.

260
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,680
- Completely.
- No.

261
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,700
I think it happened after he didn't get the 9 o'clock anchor job.

262
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,270
No. I think it happened after Eun Ho disappeared.

263
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,050
Stop it.

264
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,390
Give it to me. Hyung, I'll do it.

265
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,110
You can't do that?

266
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,450
Why not?

267
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,430
Give it to me. I'll do it.

268
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:04,610
I heard some people can open a bottle with paper.

269
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,400
I think I can do that.

270
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,830
Sunbae, I think the opener is the problem.

271
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,530
No, no. That's...

272
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,700
Is it that difficult?

273
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,150
Aigoo.

274
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,120
Come in.

- Yes.

00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,630
I have a question.

278
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,580
Go ahead!

279
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:42,020
What does it mean if an announcer is taken off all of their programs at once?

280
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,480
- That's...
- I know.

281
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,880
That means she quit.

282
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,540
Aigoo, Hye Yeon.

283
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,800
What? It's true.

284
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,370
Am I wrong?

285
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,700
I think you're right, Hye Yeon.

286
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,490
Why do you ask, Ju Yeon?

287
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,120
But Department Head,

288
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,610
if they quit, their job wouldn't show up on their profile.

289
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,800
Is that so?

290
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,950
I know about that, too. That means she's taking a sabbatical.

291
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,510
Hye Yeon, we don't have sabbaticals here.

292
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,150
No, but PPS does.

293
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,760
It's very appealing to me.

294
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,050
Sunbae, that means she's taking a leave.

295
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,510
A very long one.

296
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,290
But why? Do you need a break, too?

297
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,720
If so, can you let me know? I want a break, too.

298
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,530
No. I don't want a break.

299
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,190
- Thank you, Department Head.
- Sure.

300
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,300
Huh? Why are you thanking him?

301
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,150
I answered everything. You should thank me.

302
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,690
So, in that spirit...

303
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,570
- By the way, Department Head.
- Oh, what else?

I heard you came to see me.

Hello. I'm Kang Ju Yeon from Media N Seoul.

I'm Jung Hyun Oh. I think we've met once before.

I'd like to know first

320
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,610
what your relationship is with Ju Eun Ho,

321
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,450

322
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,170
why you're asking me that.

323
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,920
Then, can I ask you, too?

324
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,300
Sunbaenim, what is your relationship to Ju Eun Ho?

325
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,890
We're colleagues.

00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,290

Why are you saying "Seriously"?

328
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,220
Because I've seen you and Ju Eun Ho

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,700
Who are you to ask me such questions?

331
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,840
As I've said before, I'm from Media N Seoul-

332
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,120
No.

333
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,530
I'm asking who you are to Ju Eun Ho.

334
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,940
I'm in a relationship with Ju Hye Ri,

335
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,700

336
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,500
Her other personality? What are you talking about?

337
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,040
Ju Eun Ho said she has Dissociative Identity Disorder.

338
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,420
I only found out recently.

339
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,800
- Then how did you-
- Ju Eun Ho told me herself.

340
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,050
She told you directly?

341
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,210
Then, you and Eun Ho...

342
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,050
What did you say? A relationship?

343
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,140
I'm in a relationship with Ju Hye Ri,

344
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,950

345
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,390
So...

346
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,700
Eun Ho has multiple personalities,

347
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,200
and her other personality is Ju Hye Ri.

00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,890
But Ju Hye Ri...

349
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,780
- Isn't that her younger sister's name?
- Yes.

350
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,800
That's what Ju Eun Ho said, too.

351
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,590
That her other personality is her younger sister.

Yes. I'm dating her younger sister.

355

But you're saying that younger sister...

356
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,960
is Eun Ho.

357
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,510
Then, you're saying you were dating Eun Ho. No?

358
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,340
That's true, but...

359
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,660

360
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,260
and worked in a parking lot.

361
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,300
Her name is Hye Ri.

362
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:35,960
Sunbaenim, did you not know about this at all?

363
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,530
I-I'm really not Ju Eun Ho...

364
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,270
What are you saying, Ju Eun Ho? Stop it!

365
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,610
I said I'm not Ju Eun Ho!

366
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,240
Hey, Ju Eun Ho!

367
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,740
We had feelings for each other.

368
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,900
Fine.

369
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:10,760
Even if she has multiple personalities, it's still Eun Ho.

370
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,960
Eun Ho had feelings for someone else?

371
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,140
What's odd about that?

372
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,750
Because...

373
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,430
that...

374
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,630
- Because Eun Ho-
- She likes you?

375
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,760
I have feelings for her.

376
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,520
Do you mean...

377
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,580
you like Eun Ho, or Ju Hye Ri?

378
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,780
To be precise,

379
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,930
I like Ju Hye Ri, who is inside Ju Eun Ho.

380
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,450
So, that's Eun Ho.

381
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,020
I would prefer that, too, Sunbaenim.

382
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,550
I wish the person I met was Eun Ho.

383
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,990
Because...

384
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,740
no matter how long I wait,

385
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,260
Hye Ri won't show up.

386
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:09,570
So, I looked for Eun Ho, and she had disappeared.

387
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,310
That's why I came here.

388
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,020
I thought maybe you knew...

389
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,550
where Ju Eun Ho was.

390
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,780
Where she is and what she's doing.

391
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,940
Do you happen to know?

392
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,600
I want to see Ju Eun Ho.

393
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,500
I want her to be Hye Ri, but if not,

394
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,020
I'd at least like to see Eun Ho

395
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:43,010
and I have so much to tell her.

396
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,400
Eun Ho took a leave of absence a month ago

397
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,480
and hasn't been back since.

398
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,470
I can't reach her, either.

399
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,540
I see.

400
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,330
Did Eun Ho...

401
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,720
say she liked you?

402
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,480
As I've said, Sunbaenim,

403
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:28,560
Eun Ho never told me she liked me.

404
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,630
Hye Ri, who is inside Eun Ho,

405
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,450
and I shared feelings for each other.

406
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,060
So, are you broken up?

407
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,720
No.

408
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,860
Hye Ri just disappeared.

409
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,820
So, if she comes back,

410
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,310
will you date her again?

411
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,150
Yes.

412
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,870
Is that surprising to you, Sunbaenim?

413
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,770
No.

414
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,680
I'm surprised by too many things.

415
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,950
I can't just pick one.

416
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,520
But more than that...

417
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,020
the fact that you and Eun Ho were together, I just-

418
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:31,220
Dissociative Identity Disorder. It's a disorder per its name.

419
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,160
An illness.

420
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,270
That means...

421
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,920
Ju Eun Ho was very sick.

422
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,570
The fact that she disappeared so suddenly

423
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,480
means she was in a lot of pain.

424
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,930
Sunbaenim...

425
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,090
don't you care about that at all?

426
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,680
Do you not care that Ju Eun Ho was in pain?

427
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:04,350
Do you only care that she dated me in that state?

428
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,740
I'm asking because I'm curious.

429
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,890

00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,930
what's important to you?

431
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,510
Are you sick?

432
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,320
Yeah. I'm sick.

434
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,790
Yeah? Tell me.

Hello, Jung Hyun Oh?

438
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,690
Oh, yes. Hello.

439
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,960
Doctor, I'm a colleague of Ju Eun Ho.

440
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,910
Yes. How can I help you?

441
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:27,320
I mean, I actually...

442
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,260
used to be Eun Ho's boyfriend.

443
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,020
I heard that she has Dissociative Identity Disorder.

444
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:40,010
Did you come in to hear about Ju Eun Ho?

445
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,520
Eun Ho is alone. She doesn't have a guardian. So I-

446
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:50,500
No. I'm sorry, but we do not provide information on our patients.

447
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,680
I have an obligation to keep my conversations with patients confidential.

448
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,380
- Eun Ho-
- Hyun Oh.

449
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:03,000
As I've said, I cannot help you with that.

450
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:17,450
But if you're okay with it, how about we talk about you?

I'm heartbroken.

00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:51,850
You mean your heart is in pain, right?

455

Yes. My heart.

457
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,010
So...

458
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,280
I had a girlfriend I broke up with four years ago.

459
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,950
She...

460
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,430
She has Dissociative Identity Disorder.

461
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,480
But I heard about it

462
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,600
from a man whom she dated as her other personality.

463
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,710
I know.

464
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,830
I have no right.

465
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,740
But Doctor.

466
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,930
Honestly, I didn't want to break up with her.

467
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,670
You mean you didn't want to break up with your girlfriend.

468
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,100
Correct.

469
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,770
If I could, I wanted to be with her forever.

470
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,210
But I had to break up with her.

471
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:56,950
After that, she developed Dissociative Identity Disorder.

472
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,590
She lived as a different person.

473
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,710
And I had no idea.

474
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:10,380
When you found out, how did you feel, Hyun Oh?

475
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,470
I was shocked.

476
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,670
But what was equally shocking was the fact...

477
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:21,500
that as her other personality, she was with another guy.

478
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,340
I mean...

479
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,770
how can I be only thinking of myself in this situation?

480
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,880
Do you feel that you're selfish?

481
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:41,870
I want to know why she's sick.

482
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,980
Is it because of me?

483
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,900
Is it my fault that she has this illness?

484
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,370
Because...

485
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,460
it feels too much like my fault.

486
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:59,570
I see. It sounds like this has been very difficult for you.

487
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,180
But Dissociative Identity Disorder

488
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:07,410
might be widely known to be related to past trauma or stressful incidents,

489
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:10,780
but many other factors affect it as well.

490
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,680
So, we can't determine that it was your fault.

491
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,810
Did I cause her to struggle and suffer?

492
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:24,230
Is that why she's sick? Is this all because of me?

00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,800
I understand that you want to help Eun Ho.

495
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,810
But what we're talking about is related to Eun Ho.

00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:41,310
I need to talk about it with Eun Ho first and get her consent

00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,950
she doesn't tell me any of this.

500
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:59,270
Hyun Oh, it seems like you're worried

501
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:04,670
that breaking up with her may have really hurt Eun Ho.

502
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,780
Yes. I am.

503
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:17,080

How do you treat Dissociative Identity Disorder?

507
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,930
Does she need to be hospitalized? Take medication?

508
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,730
If necessary. But the most important thing

509
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:40,150
is to talk it through and let the wounds heal.

During the treatment process, when Eun Ho needs help,

511

just knowing that someone is by her side

512
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,630

541
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,970
You doubt so much.

542
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:10,610
Hurry up and tell me.

543
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:16,400
It's all the way over at Media N Seoul. Outside. Very spacious.

544
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,320
But you know, Hyun Oh, I've definitely heard before

545
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,490
that Ju Eun Ho's sister went missing...

546
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,350
You left.

547
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,130
Yes, Kang Ju Yeon.

548
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:35,300
Ju Hye Ri is not here today again.

549
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,490

Does Ju Hye Ri look like this?

552
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,580
Yes, she does, but...

553
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,920
her vibe is different.

554
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,300
But who are you?

555
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,240
I'm looking for Ju Hye Ri.

556
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,600
When did she start working here?

557
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,480
Are you a detective? Did something happen to Hye Ri?

558
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,040
No. I'm Announcer Jung Hyun Oh from PPS.

559
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,750
If you search for my name online, my face will pop up.

560
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,710
Yes.

562

I know Hye Ri personally.

563

565
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,880
Maybe three or four years ago?

566
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,360
Don't you know what eight years mean?

567
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,950
It takes a child to be born and start elementary school in that time.

568
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:22,370
We're breaking up like this after all that time? In one breath?

585
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,840
Anchovies, too. Peppers are perfectly seasoned.

586

587

It turned out good.

588
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,880
Ju Eun Ho was very sick.

589
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,400
The fact that she disappeared so suddenly...

590
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,640
Hyun Oh, it seems like you're worried

591
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:50,200
that breaking up with her may have really hurt Eun Ho.

[Police]

718
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,160
Good evening.

719
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,350
Aigoo, what brings you here?

720
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,690
Ju Eun Ho...

721
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:09,320
Aigoo. You got here quickly.

722
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,630
She was living alone in a tent-like mountain cabin.

723
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,200
I felt so bad for her.

724
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:19,390
Since there wasn't any activity, you might've thought she was deceased.

725
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:22,130
She's been living in the middle of nowhere.

726
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:25,110
Of course, there wasn't any activity.

727
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:33,140
You can sign here and take her home.

728
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:35,400
[Guardianship Transfer]

729
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,820
You can sign here and take her home.

730
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,130
Who...

731
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:52,090
What do you mean?

732
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:55,250
Ju Hye Ri, who went missing ten years ago.

733
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:36,920
[Dear Hyeri]

734
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,830
I'm just curious.

735
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:07,550
What should I call you?

736
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:13,360
Anyway, you're not Eun Ho, right?

737
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:19,290
Should I call you Hye Ri?
