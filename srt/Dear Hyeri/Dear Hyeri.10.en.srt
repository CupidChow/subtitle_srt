00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,010
I can drink.

184
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,930
So I'm going to drink for you.

185
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,600
You know something else? I've been acting like I don't know, but...

186
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,820
there's something I already know.

187
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,730
I think you and Hye Ri broke up.

188
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,500
Right?

189
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,340
You know...

190
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,290
how can I not know?

191
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,380
Because all I do is stare at your face.

192
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,180
As for the exact timing, I'm not sure.

193
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,730
Maybe a month ago?

194
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,670
Your face has darkened since then.

195
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:40,030
Considering everything you've said so far,

196
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,550
I think Hye Ri broke up with you.

197
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,780
Because she was two-timing you.

198
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,660
Right? One heart, two hearts...

199
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:59,440
You were blindsided by her two-timing and learned of your breakup.

200
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,800
I'm right, huh?

201
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,900
Hye Yeon.

202
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,200
What, Sunbae?

203
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,340
A person...

204
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,190
only has one heart.

205
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,670
It's true.

206
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,150
A person...

207
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,160
really only has one heart.

208
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,550
By any chance...

209
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,520
do you recognize me?

210
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,940
We've met before.

211
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,870
I-I'm really not Ju Eun Ho...

212
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,650
Oh, really? Then who are you?

213
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,630
Of course. You might not remember.

214
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,190
Eat slowly. I'm going to go upstairs for a second.

215
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,450
Jung Hyun Oh.

216
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,900
[Hye Ri]

217
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,910
[Hye Ri]

218
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,790
Hello?

219
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,790
Kang Ju Yeon.

220
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,260
This is Hye Ri's...

221
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,520
I mean, this is Announcer Ju Eun Ho's...

222
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,860
- No, Hye Ri-
- It's Jung Hyun Oh.

223
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,420
Sunbaenim, why are you picking up this phone?

224
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,720
Because Eun Ho...

225
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,900
is back.

226
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,850
Where is she right now?

227
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,930
Is Hye Ri okay? Where was she?

228
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,410
What is she doing right now? Can I talk to her?

229
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,660
S-Sunbaenim.

230
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,590
Sunbaenim!

231
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,600
She's healthy and safe.

232
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,240
Bye.

233
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,770
[Kang Ju Yeon]

234
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,350
[Kang Ju Yeon]

235
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,770
Thank you.

236
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,130
She's asleep.

237
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,570
- Then-
- I see...

238
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,610
She's asleep?

239
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,100
Who's asleep?

240
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,360
I want to know.

241
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,800
Is Hye Ri...

242
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,900
Hye Ri right now...

243
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,160
or Announcer Ju Eun Ho?

244
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,650
He doesn't know. Hyung, you don't know, right?

245
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,560
But...

246
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,770
who are you?

247
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,200
I'm Moon Ji On. Who are you?

248
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,640
I'm Kang Ju Yeon.

249
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,330
I'm an announcer with Media N Seoul.

250
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,740
I didn't get in there.

251
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,430
Which cohort? I'm in the 34th cohort at PPS.

252
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,840
34th?

253
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,450
When did you start?

254
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,240
March 2019?

255
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,240
Then, we started the same year.

256
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,410
I started in 2019, too.

257
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,400
But I'm 35.

258
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,280
I see...

259
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,700
I'm 32.

260
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,840
You look young.

261
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,530
Since we started the same year, I can talk to you informally, right?

262
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,610
No, you can't.

263
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,510
So, Hyung.

264
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,290
Can I ask what's going on?

265
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,270
I already explained it to you earlier.

266
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,840
Yes, I understand that much.

267
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,550
Ju Eun Ho has Dissociative Identity Disorder

268
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:57,140
and worked in the Media N Seoul parking lot under the name "Ju Hye Ri."

269
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,810
That's where she met me.

270
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,700
She was seeing me.

271
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,500
- For how long?
- A month.

272
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,310
A month? Wow.

273
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,200
A month.

274
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,620
You might as well say you weren't together.

275
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,250
What do you mean "might as well not be together"?

276
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:28,070
A totally blank white canvas is better than

277
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,100
one drop of paint on it.

278
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,550
So?

279
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,040
Is Hye Ri okay?

280
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,110
As I've said, she's healthy and safe-

281
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,930
No.

282
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,510
Which personality is she right now?

283
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,900
If it's Hye Ri,

284
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,190
I think I should be Hye Ri's guardian.

285
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,740
No, no, no.

286
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,010
How can you trust someone she's dated only for a month?

287
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:08,880
I never dated Eun Ho, but I've known her for five years.

288
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,510
I think I should be her guardian.

289
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,110
Even if I only dated her for a month,

290
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:18,280
I have the right to be her guardian since we loved each other.

291
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,100
Excuse me!

292
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,180
A guardian shouldn't have personal feelings. They should just be a guardian.

293
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,600
- So, I-
- No.

294
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,660
I think a guardian should have personal feelings.

295
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,220
Then, do you hire caretakers based on love?

296
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,750
Yes. I hired my mother's caretaker based on love.

297
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,500
Don't talk about your mom. That's cheating. Should I talk about my mom?

298
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,600
- My mom left-
- Do we need to talk about this?

299
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,510
Why do we need to pick a guardian?

300
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,950
Ju Eun Ho is an adult.

301
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,600
- But you said she's not well-
- Yes, you said she's sick.

302
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:58,150
Yes. In that case, I dated her for eight years. I loved her.

303
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:02,900
And now I have no personal feelings. So, I should be her guardian.

304
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,370
Right?

305
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,910
Right?

306
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,210
So...

307
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,230
you can go.

308
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,550
Go, please.

309
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,540
I'm 37 years old. I'll guard her.

310
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,800
By the way, where's Hyun Oh?

311
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,570
He didn't come home last night.

312
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,930
What?

313
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,670
What's wrong?

314
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,950
Give him a call.

315
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,840
I already called him to tell him to take you to the hospital,

316
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,450
but he didn't pick up.

317
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,350
What?

318
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,960
I think Jung Hyun Oh's gone crazy.

319
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,260
What's wrong, Producer?

320
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,990
He just called me...

321
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:15,780
to say he won't be at meetings for a while.

322
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,580
What? Is that really that strange, Producer?

323
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,940
It is. For the Deputy, it's strange.

324
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,380
Wow, this has never happened to me before.

325
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,060
What is this? Writer.

326
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,720
Why is he doing this?

327
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,990
Why are you asking me?

328
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,350
I thought you were like family. You must know what's going on.

329
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,280
Why he's acting like this all of a sudden.

330
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,250
Don't you know family members always keep things from each other?

331
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,250
Oh, is that right?

332
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,010
Shall we go?

333
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,710
Wait here for a second.

334
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,720
Let me go talk to him.

335
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,550
- I said I'll call you-
- Hye Ri.

336
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,100
Wait.

337
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,890
Talk to me first.

338
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,120
Is that Hye Ri or Eun Ho?

339
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,280
We're headed to the doctor.

340
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,870
I'll tell you when we're back.

341
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,630
But actually...

342
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,270
it doesn't matter to me.

343
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,430
It really doesn't matter to me.

344
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,860
No matter who Hye Ri is.

345
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,150
It doesn't matter to me, Hye Ri!

346
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,270
Because...

347
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,840
all I need is for you to be there.

348
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,200
- Excuse me, Kang Ju Yeon-
- Even if it's not by my side,

349
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:18,720
if you're alive and well, it's enough for me.

350
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,740
You don't have to love me.

351
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,990
Even if you go back to the woods, it's okay with me.

352
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,180
If you want, I can come with you.

353
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,970
I can leave everything behind and come with you.

354
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,800
I'm not afraid to do that, Hye Ri.

355
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:47,590
Hey, Ju Yeon. Hye Ri can't have this conversation right now-

356
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,200
Because, Hye Ri,

357
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,870
I didn't fall for you because you were somebody.

358
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,590
Just because...

359
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,730
you came to me as I am.

360
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,910
That's why...

361
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,150
I liked you, Hye Ri.

362
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,830
So...

363
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:28,110
♫ My heart changes with your gaze ♫

364
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:35,060
♫ If I could feel every moment ♫

365
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,860
♫ That's enough ♫

366
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,940
♫ Sometimes it'll feel like I'm here, sometimes not ♫

367
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,100
♫ I'll be your background ♫

368
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:53,180
♫ I'll protect you ♫

369
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:58,930
♫ I'll build a wall around the new you ♫

370
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:06,660
♫ So, you won't get hurt in this cruel world ♫

371
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,280
I missed you, Hye Ri.

372
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,590
♫ I'll be your shadow, barely noticeable ♫

373
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:20,620
♫ I'll protect you forever ♫

374
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:26,390
♫ I will only be for you ♫

375
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,970
♫ I'll be by your side ♫

376
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:35,090
♫ We will be happy ♫

377
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,850
This is the item I brought up last time.

378
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,660
We shelved it because it was too heavy for Issue-In...

379
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:46,080
To celebrate your comeback, why don't we-

380
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,860
put it out there. Yup.

381
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,260
It's a good idea.

382
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,870
Sunbae?

383
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,310
Excuse me, Sunbaenim?

384
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,380
One second.

385
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,820
Jung Hyun Oh.

386
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,270
I want to speak with Kang Ju Yeon.

387
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,780
Excuse me, Sunbaenim!

388
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,400
Oppa!

389
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,530
What? What is it? What's up?

390
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,460
Get it together. What's wrong with you?

391
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,300
Right.

392
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,800
How have you been?

393
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,720
Just...

394
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,660
okay.

395
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,830
Are you hurt?

396
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,960
Are you feeling okay?

397
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,650
Yes.

398
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,520
I'm okay.

399
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,070
So, right now...

400
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:39,180
are you Hye Ri?

401
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,250
Or Eun Ho?

402
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,980
I'm...

403
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:01,280
What? Hey, Jung Hyun Oh.

404
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,720
I thought you were taking the day off.

405
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,900
I'll make it a half-day.

406
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,400
Geez, I guess everyone's just doing whatever they want to do.

407
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:16,740
Why are you showing up on your day off, saying it's a half-day off?

408
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,680
What's wrong with you? Huh?

409
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,230
Did you eat something bad?

410
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,370
Hey, hey! Stop!

411
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:34,000
It hasn't even been two months!

412
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,070
Are you crazy?

413
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,160
Hyung.

414
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,150
Hyung!

415
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,860
Can we talk?

416
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,490
Say it.

417
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,220
I went to Giyidong, too.

418
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,000
What did you say?

419
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,640
Shim Jin Ah told me she saw Ju Eun Ho there while filming.

420
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,920
So?

421
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,630
What do you mean "So"?

422
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,430
You had already taken Eun Ho home when I got there.

423
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,050
So?

424
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:29,640
So...

425
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,190
I went to the forest.

426
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,280
The forest?

427
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,350
That forest where Ju Eun Ho was apparently living.

428
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,570
Do you know why Ju Eun Ho

429
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,660
went into that forest?

430
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:18,400
No.

431
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,500
She wanted to get rid of herself.

432
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,690
She even hurt her own arm, and she wanted to...

433
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,620
get rid of herself.

434
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:35,860
If it were me, I would've hated being here.

435
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,000
I would have especially hated my name, "Ju Eun Ho."

436
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:46,750
I think that's why she hurt her arm to look like Ju Hye Ri

437
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,610
and was staying there.

438
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,380
You know, Ju Hye Ri was like that.

439
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:04,430
She didn't care about anything else except being loved by Kang Ju Yeon.

440
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:10,280
Rather than this place where nothing worked out for her, no matter how hard she tried.

441
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,330
Where she was always heartbroken because of you.

442
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:18,690
The other side is much better.

443
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,340
I think Eun Ho...

444
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,970
wanted to be fully Hye Ri.

445
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,040
That's why she left everything behind and ran away.

446
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,830
But Hyung,

447
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,060
do you know...

448
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,390
what I found...

449
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:53,640
in that cabin?

450
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:27,830
She wanted to leave everything behind,

451
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:31,220
but she took that with her.

452
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,150
Hyung.

453
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,780
I'm...

454
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,080
so jealous of you,

455
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,970
but I also don't like you.

456
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:51,330
I've always thought that you don't deserve her

457
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:54,610
and that I'd get a chance at some point.

458
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:57,050
Someday, if I kept waiting.

459
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:03,440
But Ju Eun Ho couldn't leave you behind even if she left everything else.

460
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:09,230
Even when she gave up her all,

461
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,830
she couldn't give you up.

462
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,270
Maybe you don't deserve her, but Ju Eun Ho...

463
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,000
Eun Ho...

464
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,340
For her, it's only you.

465
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,590
Hyung...

466
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,410
It must be so nice, really...

467
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,040
To be loved like that.

468
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,150
Here.

469
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,250
Geez.

470
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:09,010
You have to get it for me, okay?

471
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,930
Are you crazy?

472
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,760
I'm not crazy!

473
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,730
I drew it because you said you'd get it for me.

474
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:23,520
You should keep your promise.

475
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:27,100
Fine, fine.

476
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,120
I'll get it! I'm going to.

477
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,060
I'm...

478
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:06,190
I'm Eun Ho, Kang Ju Yeon.

479
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:13,600
But...

480
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,730
I wanted to be Hye Ri so badly.

481
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,600
So...

482
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:29,620
were you trying to be Hye Ri?

483
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,050
Yes.

484
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,160
I wanted to know why she was happy.

485
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:49,100
[One month ago]

486
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:13,910
[Giyidong Village]

487
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,890
I've always...

488
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:43,440
wanted to ask Hye Ri.

489
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,370
Ju Hye Ri.

490
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:57,830
Are you happy?

491
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,710
If you're happy,

492
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,780
I'm going to try

493
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,860
living as you.

494
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,510
If I try,

495
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,310
it could happen, right?

496
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,380
Like I've always done.

497
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,580
But Ju Hye Ri.

498
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,050
I really want to know.

499
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,080
You have nothing.

500
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,810
But why...

501
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,670
Why...

502
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,560
are you happy?

503
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:42,130
Hey! What's wrong?

504
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:45,350
What's going on?

505
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,110
But...

506
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,300
in the end, I came back not being able to become Hye Ri.

507
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:04,950

508
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:06,850

509
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,850
Eun Ho, I'll be back.

510
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:17,030
Okay. Make sure you take an umbrella.

511
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,780
I've never been happy.

512
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,660
Eun Ho.

513
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:33,430
Not one second.

514
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:38,660
I love that. Can you do it again?

515
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,060
Eun Ho, you don't know how to say no.

516
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:44,080
Do it again. Do it again.

517
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,340
Should I leave a little later?

518
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,440
Yes. Just a little.

519
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,010
Okay. Move over.

520
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:52,310
Just a little longer.

521
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:54,110
Okay.

523
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:02,000
is special.

524
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,500
What? What's special about it?

525
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,420

01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,130
don't think...

532
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:09,720
I could be Hye Ri, Ju Yeon.

533

It really doesn't matter to me.

534
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,110

Maybe today...

536
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:25,180
is the end for us.

549
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:08,850
Who?

550
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:10,490
Me?

551
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:12,970
Yeah.

552
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,950
I want...

553
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:20,220
you to always be by my side.

554
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:24,810
Can you do that, Hyun Oh?

555
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:27,430
Yes.

556
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,080
Of course.

557
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:33,330
How long will you love me?

558
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,910
I'm going to date you my whole life.

559
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:40,930
No, not dating.

560
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,350
Loving me.

561
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:49,460
How long will you do that for?

562
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:55,910
Forever.

563
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:03,660
Hey. So, the pot next to that,

564
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:07,120
is it once a month or twice? How could it-

565
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:19,190
♫ I love you, I love you ♫

566
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:25,630
♫ I always want to be by your side ♫

567
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:32,130
♫ I love you, I love you ♫

568
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:38,460
♫ I love you so much, every moment ♫

569
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:44,800
♫ The sad air, your cold tone ♫

570
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:49,700
♫ I miss you and your smile ♫

571
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,760
I'm going to get out here, sir.

572
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:58,900
♫ Our times are not over ♫

573
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:04,200
♫ I promise I'll be by your side always ♫

574
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:10,630
♫ I love you, I love you ♫

575
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:17,100
♫ I always want to be by your side ♫

576
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:23,560
♫ I love you, I love you ♫

577
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:31,150
♫ I love you so much, every moment ♫

578
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:57,430
♫ I love you ♫

579
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,410
I thought...

580
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:07,890
I've never been happy, not even for a second.

581
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,420
But?

582
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:16,300
But no.

583
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:20,180
I was so happy today.

584
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:23,490
Oh...

585
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,530
Because I'm by your side?

586
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:34,180
What?

587
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,070
Why are you smiling?

588
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:41,140
Because I...

589
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:46,490
Because you like me so much?

590
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:38,590
If he came back to me,

591
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:45,270
I'll tell him.

592
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,680
I'll have to tell him.

593
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:52,630
♫ All the seasons we spent together ♫

594
01:09:54,300 --> 01:10:03,800
♫ Inside the quiet anticipation, time passes ♫

595
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:09,850
♫ The moment I thought would never come ♫

596
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:20,100
♫ It came to us soundlessly ♫

597
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:30,120
♫ Every second of the day, inside my quiet heart ♫

598
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,690
♫ Slowly, the waves rise ♫

599
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:42,050
♫ In the soft sunshine weather ♫

600
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:45,920
♫ We were on that road standing there ♫

601
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,670
♫ Holding onto the things we never said ♫

602
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:56,660
♫ Our today, full of sunshine ♫

603
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:02,900
♫ I hope we stay somewhere so deep ♫

604
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:09,680
♫ I miss us every moment ♫

605
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:15,990
♫ I thought it would be obvious ♫

606
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:25,670
♫ Like a leaf in the wind, you turned away ♫

607
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:31,960
♫ I don't recognize my own face or words ♫

608
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:40,690
♫ I say things I don't mean, the moment I sent you away ♫

609
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:48,080
♫ In the soft sunshine weather ♫

610
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:52,000
♫ I stayed there forever ♫

611
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,720
♫ Holding onto the things I never said ♫

612
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:02,670
♫ Our today, full of sunshine ♫

613
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:08,970
♫ I hope we stay somewhere so deep ♫

614
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:14,880
♫ I miss us every moment ♫

615
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:21,700
♫ How can I say all this? ♫

616
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:27,010
♫ You shined a light in my dark heart ♫

617
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:33,050
♫ You held my hand tightly ♫

618
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:38,260
♫ In the soft sunshine weather ♫

619
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:40,420
I'll tell him.

620
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:44,060
♫ I want to go back, and I want to say ♫

621
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:47,730
Thank you, my love.

622
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:52,640
Thank you for coming to me

623
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:57,340
as I am.

624
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:01,330
♫ So I can be completed by you ♫

625
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:07,540
♫ In all time ♫

626
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,900
♫ You and me ♫

627
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:19,370
[Dear Hyeri]

628
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:27,130
I missed you.

629
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:33,030
Even though you see me every day?

630
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:35,490
Yes.

631
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:39,290
Even though I've seen you every day.

632
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,790
Me, too.

633
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:46,480
I missed you every day.
