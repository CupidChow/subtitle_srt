This is the first time I'm bringing a guy to my place.

10
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,230
Yeah, I thought so.

11
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,020
No! I was popular! I wasn't that bad!

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,210
I bet you weren't popular. I bet you were pretty bad.

13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,220
And you? Were you popular? Were you super lucky?

14
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,620
Of course. It would be strange not to be popular with this face.

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,970
So what?

16
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,960
You've dated a lot of girls, then?

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,980
A lot of them?

18
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,940
Not that many.

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,740
I've dated a lot of guys.

20
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,900
Of course, you're the first one I've dated for over three months.

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,300
Whoa, should I be thankful?

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,130
Of course, you should be!

23
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,250
I told myself if I met a guy who could handle me

24
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,820
for more than three months, I would marry him.

25
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,560
Because that kind of guy isn't common.

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,890
Anyway, I would marry a guy like that and have one kid.

27
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,780
Maybe two is better? A boy and a girl?

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,340
That sounds good.

29
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,500
But honestly, I think it would be better if the girl looked like me.

30
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,610
Because your face, honestly,

31
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,260
would look better on a guy than a girl. Right?

32
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,820
I'm not getting married, Ju Eun Ho.

33
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,900

No.

We really brought it as is.

You shoved food in your mouth on the way, didn't you?

99
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,900
No. I didn't shove any food in my mouth.

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,520
No.

110
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,200
- We really weren't trying to rip you off-
- I...

111
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,600
own two buildings in this area, including this one.

112
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,560
There's a gambling den in each one.

113
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,180
There are dozens of bastards who owe me money.

114
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,750
But they all pay me back on time, without exception.

115
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,900
- Right.
- But...

116
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,510
you're the only ones who are always late. Always.

117
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,010
But aside from being late,

118
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,290
now you're trying rip me off?

119
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,200
Go find the money.

00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,070

129
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,940
Yeah.

130
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,860
I'll pay. I'll pay in full next month!

Hey, Mr. Jung.

143
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,630
Welcome. Would you like to order...

144
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,220
I'm ordering my 100,000 won.

145
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,090
The 100,000 won, which I didn't get this month.

146
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,790
Aigoo, aigoo!

147
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,460
I thought you were inside!

148
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,130
Where's my father?

149
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,900
Where's my father? He's not in there, right?

150
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,360
No, no, Hyun Oh. The smoke...

151
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,600
- Wait.
- Hyun Oh...

152
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,390
Father!

153
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,240
- No.
- Wait.

154
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,860
This is the orphanage you'll stay in until you're 18.

155
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,100
Hyun Oh.

156
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,020
Are you okay?

157
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,150
No.

158
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,530
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help.

159
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,770
And this place is a little far.

160
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,890
I think you'll need to switch schools.

161
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,700
Do you have everything?

162
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,340
Yes.

163
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,310
Where do you think you're going after stealing my money?

164
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,000
So, everything's burnt down to the ground.

165
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,880
Yes.

166
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,120
I don't have a penny.

167
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,130
Also, as far as I know,

168
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,610
if the debtor passes and I relinquish my inheritance,

169
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,630
my responsibility to pay the debt goes away.

170
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,510
Correct. That's the law.

171
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,080
Then...

172
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,800
- you don't need to come see me anymore.
- Correct.

173
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,930
But we don't live by the law.

174
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,930
Your dad owes me 100 million won.

175
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,730
With that money, I could buy an apartment on the city's outskirts.

176
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,260
How can we give that up?

177
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,370
I'll get it back eventually, no matter what.

178
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,180
There's not much I can do right now.

179
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,130
I'll have to turn 18 before I can earn real money.

180
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,400
My part-time job only pays for my allowance.

181
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,840
I heard you're going to an orphanage.

182
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,010
Don't you get kicked out when you're 18?

183
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,180
Even if I get kicked out,

184
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,230
they can protect me right now.

185
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:45,500
Your dad said your dream was to become someone who comes out on TV.

186
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,440
Yes. That's correct.

187
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,340
Then you'll need to go to college.

188
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,600
Like Seoul National University?

189
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,270
I can't go to Seoul National University,

190
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,900
but I'm trying my best.

191
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,980
When I become an adult and find a job,

192
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll pay it all back little by little.

193
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,700
I will...

194
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,210
cancel your debt.

195
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,800
Instead, I have a condition.

196
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,570
What is it?

197
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,310
Come live in my house.

198
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,790
Pardon?

199
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,850
It'll be much nicer than the orphanage.

200
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,440
If you come and live with me,

201
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,000
I'll pay your college tuition,

202
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,660
and pay for academies if you'd like.

203
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,780
I'll provide everything other parents do.

204
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,430
Why?

205
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,060
Nothing is free.

206
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,900
That's right. There is no such thing as a freebie.

207
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,470
So, if I raise you like that,

208
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,450
there is something you must do down the line.

209
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,970
What is that?

210
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,900
Five women, including myself, will raise you.

211
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,540
Just give back as much as you receive later.

212
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,200
Give back?

213
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes. Repay the kindness.

214
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,880
You know the magpie that brought calabash seeds, right?*
(Referring to a Korean folktale)

215
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,450
Like that magpie, when we are old and frail,

216
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,880
you can repay our kindness.

217
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,400
Yes! I won!

218
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,310
What?

219
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,770
Is he the hostage who'll take care of you ladies in your golden years?

220
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,370
Oh, my, you're so adorable.

221
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,850
So naughty.

222
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,570
Don't you call a boy adorable.

223
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,800
You could say "pretty boy" or "nice-looking." That would be better.

224
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,950
Why is that child so skinny?

225
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,640
He looks like he's going to faint.

226
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,810
That's not good.

227
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,400
I need to make good use of him.

228
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,750
Hey, Shin Yeong, where's the alcohol?

229
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,240
Give me more alcohol.

230
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,370
Hi!

231
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,490
Have you eaten?

232
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,800
Aigoo, you're so skinny.

233
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,550
Oh, what's your name?

234
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,690
I'm Jung Hyun Oh.

235
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,840
We set up a room for you.

236
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,730
Want to go see?

237
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,180
- I'll take him.
- Okay.

238
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,930
Follow me.

239
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,690
Go.

240
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,560
Is this where I'll stay?

241
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,760
Why? We're letting you sleep and eat for free.

242
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,790
Were you expecting a palace?

243
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,290
No.

244
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,300
Thank you.

245
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,720
By the way...

246
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,080
the Moon family isn't dead yet, right?

247
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,410
Those rats...

248
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,800
Will they be able to pay me back?

249
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,080
Soo Jeong.

250
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,020
Oppa!

251
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,340
Where's Ji On?

252
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,530
He went to look for our dad.

253
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,680
Dad hasn't been home.

254
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,900
How about you? Have you eaten?

255
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,590
No. I'm hungry.

256
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,050
Let's go inside.

257
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,050
I'll make you something.

258
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,780
Oppa, we don't have any food in the house.

259
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,390
We skipped meals yesterday, too.

260
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Mr. Moon hasn't been home.

261
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,410
Is that so?

262
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,750
I can't get in touch with that bastard.

263
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,900
I was wondering if I should go take his kids.

264
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,270
But they came on their own.

265
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,770
How much does Mr. Moon's family owe?

266
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,050
They've paid back almost all of it.

267
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,410
Unlike you.

268
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,770
Ji On and Soo Jeong are still too young.

269
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,300
At least until they can get part-time jobs...

270
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,870
What?

271
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,260
You want me to raise them, too? No way.

272
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,130
One is enough for us.

273
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,990
No.

274
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,550
Please just feed them three meals a day.

275
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,500
Then, Ji On and I will make sure to pay everything back later.

276
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,200
- I promise.
- Do you think

277
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,110
we're running a charity here?

278
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,740
I mean...

279
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,700
taking me in is a charity business.

280
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,520
But we're going to pay you back.

281
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,330
So, it's closer to a loan business.

282
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,350
It shouldn't be too difficult.

283
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,620
You're just doing what you normally do.

284
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,150
On top of that,

285
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,980
you have hostages who will pay back the money Mr. Moon didn't pay.

286
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,940
Doesn't it make the deal sweeter?

287
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,760

Honey.

303

This is all just work. You need to deal with it.

Work or whatnot, just hand over the drinks and leave.

Why would I run?

380

Yeah.

381

385

How about you, Noona? What are you going to do?

386
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,440
I don't know.

387
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,600
I have nothing to do.

388
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,950
Maybe I'll just be a leech.

389
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,140
What if that hyung comes back?

390
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,930
Then I'll leave.

391
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,200
I've done my work, so I'll leave.

392
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,350
And the rest will be yours.

Unni, where should I put this?

So, start your own family soon.

That's what those grandmas wish for.

397

- But Noona.
- Yeah.

398
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,880
What kind of woman would marry me?

399
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Taking care of the grandmas should be my job.

400
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,700
It's bearable for me here, but it's hell to others.

401

I can't drag someone else in here.

Okay. I'll be right there.

408
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,540
must not be someone who would fit in here.

Morning, noon, seven o'clock, and the nine o'clock news.

411
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,430
Amazing.

00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,710
Make sure you do that, Ju Eun Ho.

413

- It's cool, right?
- Yes.

414
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,780
Very cool.

415
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,030

- This is...
- It's the same as the one you lost, right?

Yeah.

419

It's identical.

420
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,120
Nice, right?

421
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
I found it in Japan.

422
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,370
Your mom got it in Japan, right?

423
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,040
No way. She probably got it in Namdaemun.

424
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,840
Look at this.

425
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,380

It's completely identical.

427
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,360
Yes!

428
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,460
Hey. You'll never find another girlfriend like me.

429
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,340
A girlfriend who actually buys the exact thing you lost just because you said so.

430
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,020
There's no girlfriend like that in the world.

431

Yeah. Thank you so much.

Then, Jung Hyun Oh, get me something like that next time. You will, right?

434

00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,430

546
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,810
Reporters are lining up for the 9 o'clock news.

547
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,700
I can't fill both the male and female slots with announcers.

548
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,630
Not possible. What about my people?

549
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,620
Why?

550
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,720
You want to drop out?

551
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,910
If you give up the 9 o'clock news, I'll secure Ju Eun Ho's spot.

552
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:05,020
But you're not going to do that, right?

553
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,590
So, just...

554
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,100
- fire Ju Eun Ho from the 12 o'clock-
- I'll drop out.

555
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,460
What?

556
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,330
I'll drop out.

557
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,490
So, please...

558
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,390
let Eun Ho continue on the 12 o'clock news, Press Director.

559
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,970
Damn it.

560
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,980
Hey, Sunbae.

561
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,300
Did something happen that I don't know about?

562
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,920
You know Hyun Oh didn't make the 9 o'clock news, right?

563
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,420
Yeah, I do.

564
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,880
It's not that he didn't make it.

565
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,540
He gave up the 9 o'clock news because of you!

566
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,370
W-Wh...

567
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,800
- W-What?
- That punk met the Press Director privately

568
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,660
and traded your 12 o'clock spot for his 9 o'clock!

569
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,980
Gosh, damn it!

570

Kim Mi Yeon, knock before you-

574
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,330
I heard you gave up the 9 o'clock news.

575
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,570
Oh. I didn't give it up. I didn't make it.

576
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:35,050
No, I heard you gave it up so I could keep the 12 o'clock news.

577
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,770
Do you owe me something?

578
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,290
No. It's not that-

579
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,730
Did you take out a loan in my name? Do I need to pay it back?

580
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:47,730
Is it because you feel guilty about it?

581
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,370
- It's not like that.
- How much is it?

582
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,810
I'll pay it back.

583
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:54,110
So, stop this bullshit and take the 9 o'clock news. Please.

584
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,930
I told you. It's not like that.

585
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,870
Then what?

586
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,270
Do you still feel pity for me?

587
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:06,220
Am I still that pitiful to you?

588
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,960
Am I so pitiful that you gave it up to say, "Take this, you pitiful little thing"?

589
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,500
Trading the 9 o'clock news for the 12 o'clock news?

590
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,140
Hey.

591
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,910
How generous of you.

592
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,080
No matter how bad you feel for your ex-girlfriend,

593
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:26,200
how can you give up something you've wanted all your life so easily?

594
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,030
Jung Hyun Oh, you don't need to do that for me.

595
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,570
Just live the life you want.

596
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,900
- Eun Ho.
- I...

597
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,500
know that I was embarrassing to you as a girlfriend.

598
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,670
But there's one thing I worked hard at while I was with you.

599
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,370
It wasn't anything special.

600
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:49,240
I couldn't be of any help for your bright future,

601
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:52,580
but I tried not to be an obstacle.

602
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,180
- Listen to me.
- That one thing.

603
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,580
I worked so hard at that one thing, but it was so difficult.

604
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:06,190
As you know, I'm way below average, no matter how hard I work.

605
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:11,490
I was always an obstacle to you, but I worked really hard at it.

606
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,590
So, you...

607
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,900
You can't do this to me.

608
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,950
So, don't be generous to me. Take what's yours. Got it?

609
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,970
- Ju Eun Ho.
- You shouldn't be generous to your ex.

610
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:40,000

00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,980
Kleenex messes up my makeup.

721
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,900
I'll get you a new one.

722
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,380
Sunbae, you know...

723
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,480
You know what really pisses me off?

724
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,580
This.

725
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,400
[Announcer Baek Hye Yeon's secret rendezvous with Anchor Kang Ju Yeon of Media N Seoul]

726
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,270
Look at my face here.

727
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:19,140
It's such a shitty photo, right?

728
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,140
Is that...

729
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,200
why you're crying?

730
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,630
I mean, it's such a bad photo of me.

731
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:30,200
it's such a bad photo of me.

732
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,970
Sunbae, what do I do?

733
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,180
Are you okay with being off the news?

734
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:43,810
Of course, I'm not okay.

735
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:46,590
But what can I do? They told me to drop out.

736
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,160
But Sunbae.

737
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,360
The thing I don't understand is,

738
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,230
why does everyone want me to apologize?

739
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:01,000
Who do I owe an apology to for walking down a hotel hallway with a guy?

740
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Shouldn't the reporter, who took a private photo of me like some paparazzi, apologize to me?

741
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,920
When did the public have the right to know about my private life?

742
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,400
Fine. Let's say they do.

743
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,500
But what did I do wrong here?

744
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,160
Hello, it's Baek Hye Yeon.

745
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,750
Let me first explain what happened that night.

746
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:29,080
I went inside my hotel room to have a drink with Kang Ju Yeon.

747
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,020
My room was a suite, so it was bigger.

748
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:36,390
I wanted a bigger room, so I paid for my own. (Not sponsored!)

749
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:40,420
Kang Ju Yeon and I had a drink in my room.

750
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:45,370
Unlike my clean, demure, innocent, and wholesome image,

751
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:50,970
I disappointed you by canoodling with a man in a hotel room.

752
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:53,990
I am so sorry.

753
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,430
I will never go to a hotel where a reporter is waiting around in the hallway

754
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:03,730
and invite people over to my room to have a drink.

755
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,820
End of apology.

756
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,900
Aigoo, Hye Yeon...

757
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:34,200
What happened?

758
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,420
Did you get fired?

759
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,390
Oh, yes. I did.

760
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:43,870
You should have controlled yourself.

761
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:48,420
Is it so bad that I walked down a hotel hallway with a male sunbae because I wanted a drink?

762
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,940
You're right.

763
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,570
It's not bad.

764
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,420
But by the way,

765
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,510
you didn't say that you booked a suite because I kicked you out.

766
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,720
- You could have.
- Why would I?

767
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,210
Your image would be even worse than it is now.

768
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:23,360
I really dislike you, Baek Hye Yeon.

769
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:30,340
No need to tell me. You were very clear during the last special.

770
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,790
Still, I feel bad for you...

771
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,050
that you might end up like me.

772
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:42,450
Are you saying that I'll get cut from Night 7 someday?

773
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,970
Are you cursing me that I'll get old,

774
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:48,110
and be pushed out by younger people?

775
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:50,740
I already got fired from Night 7.

776
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,870
It's not a curse.

777
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,610
It's something that happens often.

778
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,610
But...

779
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,270
I'm sorry.

780
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,200
I was very rude.

781
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,700
I have such a short temper.

782
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:31,160
No thanks.

783
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,410
I already forgot all about it.

784
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,760
Sure.

785
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,480
- So, we're cool.
- No, we're not.

786
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,580
I'll bring it up every time I see you.

787
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:46,820
Also, Sunbae...

788
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:52,420
I'm so fed up here because I had to write a bullshit apology.

789
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,200
When I was on the 9 o'clock news,

790
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,450
I once posted my kid's favorite song on social media

791
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:05,840
during election season and had to apologize.

792
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:11,810
What did a song about children's hopes and dreams do?

793
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:16,510
One of the parties had used it as a campaign song.

794
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:25,800
People who do the news must maintain political neutrality.

795
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,150
But a hotel?

796
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,780
In the middle of the night? With a man?

797
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,570
Hey.

798
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:42,050
How will people focus on the news if they're bothered by your private life?

799
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,180
Right.

800
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,470
Your apology...

801
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:50,610
is meant for people who watch Night 7.

802
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:55,050
You sounded like a legendary crazy bitch in your apology.

803
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,700
Rewrite it.

804
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,640
What was that?

805
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,300
Was it that bad?

806
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:15,280
Hye Ri.

807
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,100
You still haven't seen her?

808
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,800
She didn't come in today, either.

809
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:31,590
I see.

810
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:34,250
Got it.

811
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:19,540
Hye Ri.

812
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,260
Hello.

813
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,400
Kang Ju Yeon.

814
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:45,610
[Dear Hyeri]

815
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:47,140
Hello.

816
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:51,960
I'm Announcer Kang Ju Yeon from Media N Seoul.

817
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,680
I didn't get to say hello earlier.

818
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:59,950
Hello, I'm Ju Eun Ho from PPS.

819
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,200
Yes. Nice to meet you.

820
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,560
Nice to meet you.

821
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,000
Um...

822
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,350
E-Excuse me.
