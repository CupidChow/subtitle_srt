[Child actors were filmed under safe conditions with parental consent.]

9
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,570
It's breast cancer.

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,300
What?

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,020
Breast cancer?

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,980
Unni! Breast cancer?

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,220
Cancer?

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,800
I have a broken leg

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,520
plus cancer.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,050
Then, how long did they say you have?

17
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,940
If I don't do chemotherapy and radiation,

18
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,960
less than a year.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,900
So, what do you want to do?

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,700
I just want things to be as is and live my life.

21
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,790
No...

22
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,600
Crazy girl, don't you want me to live my life?

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,480
No. I don't want you to die.

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,920
I'm not dead yet!

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,790
I can't go on without you.

26
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,620
I can't go on if you die, Unni.

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,740
What are you talking about? Who's dying?

28
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,640
Go to the hospital now.

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,630
I don't want to.

30
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,040
Unni, it's cancer.

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,020
You need to be hospitalized and get treatment.

32
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,510
I don't want to.

33
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,540
Why are you being so stubborn?

34
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,320
Grandma, I looked it up.

35
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,800
If you change your diet and exercise, you'll get better soon.

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,010
But you eat whatever you want.

37
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,730
You don't exercise. How are you going to get better?

38
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,760
Just get hospitalized.

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,500
I'll go with you when I get off from work later.

40
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,660
Hyun Oh, I like it here.

41
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,370
Even if I die, I want to die here.

42
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,880
Grandma, you can't argue your way through this. You're sick.

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,170
Unni, if you die...

44
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,030
I'll die with you.

45
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,760
Me, too!

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,210
I'm going to die with you.

47
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,100
Let's do that.

48
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,640
Let's all die together.

49
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,340
If we smoke all of these at once, we could die.

50
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,970
What's wrong with you?

51
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,040
No. I'm going to die, too. If Grandma dies, I will, too!

52
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,440
Hey. If you die, what do I do?

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,010
Figure it out, ugly.

54
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,160
I'm not that ugly!

55
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,890
Ji On is good-looking.

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,100
This guy I dated briefly ages ago looked a lot like Ji On.

57
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,270
Stop being so silly!

58
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,240
Grandma, don't be so stubborn. Just go to the hospital.

59
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,540
- You have to get treated.
- I said I don't want to.

60
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,040
Grandma, I'm so worried sick that something's going to happen to me!

61
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,650
I won't stay at the hospital.

62
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,540
But I'll get treatment.

63
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,650
Then, go to the hospital with me later.

64
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,160
I want to hear what they say.

65
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,350
I have one wish.

66
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,640
What is it?

67
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,850
Tell me. I'll do anything. What is it?

68
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,490
Please get married, Hyun Oh.

69
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,260
What?

70
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,710
Please get married.

71
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,440
That's my wish, Hyun Oh.

72
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,300
What kind of wish is that? Give me something else.

73
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,810
I want you to get married

74
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,630
and have a happy family.

75
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,360
Unni.

76
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,080
Hyun Oh will have a happy family on his own.

77
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,070
It doesn't have to be your wish.

78
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,550
Grandma, I don't have a woman to marry even if I wanted to get married.

79
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,150
Is that so? Why?

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,200
- So, Grandma, something else-
- Me.

81
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,390
I'll marry Sunbae.

82
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,640
Can I marry him?

83
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,700
What?

84
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,310
What's wrong with her?

85
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,200
Could you explain yourself, Eun Cho Rong?

86
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,920
That was a pretty intense joke.

87
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,510
Sunbae, I wasn't joking.

88
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,070
I said it because I really want to marry you.

89
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,050
Marriage isn't that easy, Cho Rong.

90
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,470
I know it's not. A wedding is the biggest event in a person's life.

91
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,100
You raised your hand knowing that?

92
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,300
This isn't a class president election.

93
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,500
I raised my hand because it was a perfect chance for me.

94
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,710
How is it a perfect chance?

95
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,840
I've really wanted to marry you.

96
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,960
Why do you want to marry me?

97
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,240
Do you even like me?

98
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,710
No.

99
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,270
Then, stop messing with me. Get back to work, Eun Cho Rong.

100
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,200
I love your family, Sunbae.

101
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,150
What did you say?

102
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,910
I lived with only my older sister.

103
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,620
And when Grandma Hae Ja got sick...

104
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,410
That was...

105
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,270
Seven years ago.

106
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,370
You remember?

107
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,340
I'm moved.

108
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,240
Why are you so moved by that?

109
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,110
Anyway, I came to live here seven years ago.

110
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,170
That's when I figured it out.

111
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,430
Figured out what?

112
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,010
That it makes me happy to live in a bustling family.

113
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,610
That I want to be a real part of this family.

114
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,680
Eun Cho Rong.

115
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,630
It still sounds like you think marriage is easy.

116
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,190
You've seen your sister take care of the Grandmas until now.

117
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,160
It might look easy to you, but it's not.

118
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,720
It becomes different if you marry and become a real part of the family.

119
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,850
What you mentioned might be a benefit, but you'll need to give as much in return.

120
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,380
The Grandmas will get older and will require more care.

121
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,210
They raised me, so I think it's okay for me.

122
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,960
I think it's something I have to do.

123
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:15,190
But I think it's nonsense for my spouse to have to do it with me.

124
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,810
Just because you like a bustling family.

125
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,450
Choosing such a hard path for that reason...

126
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,220
Sunbae.

127
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,040
I had a grandmother growing up.

128
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,580
We lived together for maybe 10 years.

129
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,160
She had dementia.

130
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,120
After my sister went to work, I took care of her. I was 9.

131
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,110
I changed her diapers and everything.

132
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,430
Do you think I liked that or not?

133
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,860
Sunbae, I liked it.

134
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,840
Because I still had my grandma with me.

135
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,280
She was alive. That was enough for me.

136
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,380
That was your biological grandmother.

137
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,340
Are you with the Grandmas because you're related to them, then?

138
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,750
Sunbae, this is my dream.

139
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,870
I want to marry you and become your spouse.

140
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,260
I want to become a real part of this family.

141
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,850
I won't ask you to like me. I'll be fine on my own.

142
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:39,870
As long as I can live in this house as your spouse and be a part of this family.

143
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,440
Eun Cho Rong.

144
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,040
Yes?

145
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,060
Still, I don't think this is right.

146
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,650
Sunbae, don't you want to do anything Grandma Mi Ja wants?

147
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,780
All you can do is get married.

148
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,820
I'm saying that I can do that for you. That I want it.

149
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,500
Sunbae, I don't think you have much choice in the matter.

150
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,480
We need to get this done, Sunbae.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,190
Yeah.

152
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,600
Oh, he was good.

153
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,330
I'm fine.

154
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,300
Yes, Sunbae.

155
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,370
Let's grab dinner soon.

156
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,130
The person you are calling is on another line. After the beep...

157
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,190
Hey, Jung Hyun Oh!

158
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,110
Hey, I heard you're getting married.

159
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,200
Finally! What happened? Tell me!

160
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,170
Well, Sunbae...

161
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,050
When is it? This year?

162
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,060
Marriage? Eun Ho.

163
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,880
I'm not doing that.

164
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,520
I'm not doing that stuff, Eun Ho.

165
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,510
Hey, what happened? Tell me the story.

166
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,180
Sunbae, I...

167
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,060
No.

168
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,690
It can't be.

169
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,540
No...

170
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,230
It doesn't make any sense. No.

171
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,700
It's not possible. I must have heard wrong. Yeah...

172
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,520
It's not possible. It's not...

173
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,480
Hey, where are you going?

174
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,910
Right, I must have heard wrong. I must have...

175
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,820
Hey, Ju Eun Ho.

176
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,480
- It's not possible.
- Hey, Ju Eun Ho!

177
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,440
What are you mumbling about?

178
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,860
Hey! Aren't you supposed to be doing the news?

179
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,170
Hello, viewers.

Next, we report on restrictions on Brazil's steel importation.

183
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,360
The Brazilian government recently announced additional tariffs on

184
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,330

185

There's been an uptick in protective trading overseas.

The Brazilian government, in particular,

190
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,270

Yes. If so, how will this decision by the Brazilian government

208
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,240
impact the global steel market?

whether you had another woman or not is none of my business since we broke up.

270
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,930
But why did we break up? You know better than me.

271
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,410
You told me as soon as we started dating.

272
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,700
"I'm never getting married. If you bring it up, we're over." That's why...

273

I dated you for eight years and never brought it up.

But as soon as I brought it up,

275

I don't care if you get married or not.

284

The word's already out. The important thing is,

285
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,710

He just didn't want to marry me.

00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,930
- What?
- Huh?

360
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,520
What?

361
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,560
Huh?

362
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,790
Oh, nothing. Well... nothing...

363
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,950
Ju Yeon must have something to say to you.

364
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,800
Like what?

365
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,120
Department Head, we're done.

366
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,440
I told you Kang Ju Yeon has a girlfriend.

367
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,530
I mean, then, maybe he's having some kind of problem...

368
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:01,130
and wants to get advice from you or not. Maybe, maybe not?

369
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,470
Sunbae, you have a problem, right?

370
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,970
What?

371
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,110
You have a problem you can't talk about, right?

372
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,580
Why would you want to get this with me otherwise?

373
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,300
Doing this was my wish, you know.

374
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,040
I think I'll be okay.

375
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,740
What do you mean?

376
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,470
I thought I wouldn't be okay.

377
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,000
But the more I think, I'll be okay.

378
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,940
If I keep waiting,

379
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,210
she'll show up again.

380
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,070
Sunbae?

381
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,990
What are you talking about?

382
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,650
So, is that your problem?

383
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,550
When she shows up,

384
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,390
I'll treat her really well.

385
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,670
That's how...

386
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,640
I'm going to win her over.

387
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,800
Because...

388
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,640
I have one heart.

389
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,150
My heart...

390
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,800
only has space for one.

391
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,650
Wow, why don't I get any of that?

392
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,140
No matter how bad the disease is,

393
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,200
I don't think that's going to change, Hye Yeon.

394
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,870
So, Sunbae.

395
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,800
You could be more specific with your subject or object? Okay?

396
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,320
One more time.

397
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,380
Hey, Hye Yeon.

398
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,480
This udon is so good.

399
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,120
I mean it.

400
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:11,580
Thank you for recommending this udon shop. I mean it.

401
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,380
I think I might...

402
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,450
cry while eating this.

411
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:12,860
Hey! I said aren't you going home? Do you know what time it is?

412
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,270
Hey, I'm hungry!

413
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:27,250
Hey, are you aware that we only first spoke today?

414
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,570
You talked to me for the first time since we started working two months ago,

415
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,420
asking me to go home together.

416
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,690
But can I ask why we're not going home and still digging around this field?

417
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,630
Huh? Huh?

418
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,240
Hey!

419
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:50,180
This stop is Joongsan. Myunghui University station.

The doors are on your right.

421
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,980
All I need to know is this.

422
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,600
Why are you looking around this field?

423
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,220
Did you lose something?

424
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,560
I lost a necklace.

425
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,340
A necklace?

426
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,390
Did your girlfriend get it for you?

427
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,060
I don't have a girlfriend!

428
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,590
Fine, no need to get pissy.

429
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,630
I think I'm going home.

430
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,460
Because it's been four hours since the competition ended.

431
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,540
That's one more hour than how long the competition was.

432
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,210
Therefore, I'm leaving.

433
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,020
Also, let me give you one last piece of advice.

434
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,760
If you still haven't found it, you never will.

435
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,510
Bye.

This stop is Eungwang. Transfer available to line 3.

437

What? Is he crying?

438
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,990
Why are you crying?

439
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,500
How did your crying button go off? Who, what, where, why?

440
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:00,070
Was the necklace pure gold? 24K or something like that?

441
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,390
The necklace was...

442
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,870
just like my mom.

443
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,810
By chance...

444
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,600
did your mom pass away?

445
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,410
Damn it!

446
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,050
Hey! Then go home and tell her!

447
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,720
"Mom, I lost the fated necklace that's like you during an athletic competition.

448
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,340
Please get me another one!"

449
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,850
She left home.

450
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,830
She left home...

451
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,070
and never came back, I see.

452
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,600
Then, what should we do? Should I get one for you?

453
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,810
I'm sure we could find something similar. Can I get it for you?

454
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,490
Actually, I have one wish.

455
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,810
It's to leave this field.

456
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,510
I want to go away. Change locations.

457
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:21,100
I'll get one for you. Can I leave now?

458
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,550
Also, why are you crying?

459
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,850
We're not close. Why are you crying in front of me?

460
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,380
So, let me get one for you. I still have some of my first paycheck.

461
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,160
Here.

462
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,590
Let's go get meat.

463
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,290
What?

464
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,330
Let's go get meat.

465
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:09,040
I spent all my energy on crying.

466
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,380
You don't want to?

467
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,790
I mean...

468
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,710
you were just crying, and now you want meat...

469
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,830
I'll pay.

470
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,440
I like sirloin, chuck flap tail, and skirt steak.

471
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,690
I'm all about special cuts. Let's go.

472
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,150
Do you usually cry so easily?

473
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,640
No!

474
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:47,260
So, if I draw you a picture of that necklace, can you get me an identical one?

475
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,010
You really want me to get it?

476
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,550
Of course! You said you will!

477
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,500
Did you actually iron this?

478
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,160
Yes, I did.

479
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,340
I feel like it's wrinkly.

480
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,820
That's just a feeling.

481
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,540
You didn't iron it, did you?

482
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,250
I did.

483
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,800
With what?

484
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:19,940
The warm sunshine, cool breeze, fresh air, and...

485
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,450
You just washed it and hung it out to dry.

486
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,930
Same thing, Hyun Oh.

487
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,160
Damn it. Where's the iron?

488
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,670
Are you ignoring the sun?

489
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,140
Belittling the breeze? Underestimating the fresh air?

490
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,470
Geez, come on.

491
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,900
Where's the iron?

492
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,770
I knew it. I have one that's definitely ironed!

493
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,290
You did! You had one ironed!

494
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,500
You had one ironed. Eun Ho was just testing me.

495
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,860

- Yes.

Very much.

Dear listeners, hello.

510
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:45,410
I've been with you for the last four years through "Every Morning with Ju Eun Ho."

511
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:49,940
I apologize for being late this morning.

512
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,670
I was distracted and missed several subway stops.

513
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,660
But listeners, want to know something?

514
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,410
What is this?

515
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,060
Is that an incident report for radio?

516
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,190
Were you late or something?

517
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,840
I've lived my life as best I could.

518
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,820
- I've worked hard.
- Why do you keep messing up?

00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,880
Why does this kind of thing keep happening to me?

520

Hey, Eun Ho...

521
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,870
I'm not talking about being late.

- My life is just...

W-What about Eun Ho?

528
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:44,350
Is the broadcast and the incident report all a joke to you?

529
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,570
On top of that, you were late to the radio this morning?

530
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,830
I've given you enough chances.

531
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:55,200
Step down from the 12 o'clock news immediately and quit radio, too.

What does Jung Hyun Oh like about an idiot like you?

535
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,220
Why would he drop out of the 9 o'clock news, trying to defend you?

536
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,730
What does he see in you?

537
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,720
I don't think I can get married, Grandma.

is that both he and I have hearts.
