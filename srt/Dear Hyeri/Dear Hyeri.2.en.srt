Isn't that a bit too fast?

157
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,390
I once read a web novel.

158

164
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,410

165
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,250
Can you stop moving like that?

166
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,900

00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,830
Excuse me.

00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes?

172
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,390
The woman who works here...

173
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,420
Yes, go on.

181
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,330
Sure.

182
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:29,380
Hey, I honestly don't understand.

183
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,650
Why are you hiding?

184
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,670
If you kissed him, doesn't that mean your relationship has progressed?

185
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,700
You see, for experts, once they obtain physical affection, their next step...

186
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,570
is avoidance.

187

What could possibly go wrong?

544
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:23,170
Geez, where exactly did you leave it?

545
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,730
I don't know.

546
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,370
Oh, just go through everything?

547
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,020
Hey...

548
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:49,860
But why is the door open?

549
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,450
Who was responsible for locking up?

550
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:56,950
Hey! Do your job right!

551
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,380
Will you wake up after something goes wrong big time?

552
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,470
Do you want to die?

553
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,190
Pick up. Pick up!

554
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,270
Hurry and pick up.

555
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:57,980
Pick up!

556
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:03,060
Why aren't you picking up?

557
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,550
At this rate...

558
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:10,290
[Announcer Ju Eun Ho]

559
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,170
Is everything going smoothly?

560
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,190
My fish.

561
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,940
My precious fish.

562
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:34,360
We're out here filming at the crack of dawn.

563
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:39,750
But what if this doesn't go viral?

564
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,340
I'll just...

565
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,520
I'll just kill Jung Hyun Oh.

566
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,990
Mi Yeon, you're not picking up.

567
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,440
I'm trapped inside the refrigerated truck, unfortunately.

568
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,800
Someone should come and open the doors for me.

569
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,200
But before that, Mi Yeon...

570
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,970
If you're asking what this is, yes, it's a dead person.

571
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:08,110
I still checked just in case he was still alive, but he's already dead.

572
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,220
I want to call the police.

573
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,690
But before that, I'm stuck in a refrigerated truck.
[Frozen at -18°C (-0.4°F)]

574
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,940
So, Mi Yeon, can you get me out of here?
[Norway]

575
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,800
It's getting colder and colder in here.

576
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:27,890
Trying to get 10 minutes of screen time with just a tiny photo of myself at that.

577
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,000
Can't believe I'm trapped inside a refrigerated truck.

578
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,560
And if I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have agreed to this.

579
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:37,470
Why? Because I had so much to think about.

580
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,580
I should report this, right?

581
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,210
By the way, I'm sure you know this.

582
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:46,330
If this gets exposed to outsiders, it's the end for us.

583
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,050
Why?

584
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,030
Why is it the end?

585
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:52,760
Why can't this be exposed to outsiders? What's going on?

586
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,490
My life is about to end.

587
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,250
I'm about to die here.

588
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,750
But why? Why in the world?

589
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,940
Why isn't this woman answering me?

590
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,500
What is she doing right now?

591
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,920
She's not helpful at all, my gosh!

592
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,570
I don't know the other staff members' numbers.

593
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:18,580
Wow. Wow...

594
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,110
Wow, what do I do?

595
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,550
It all will go swiftly if I call the police.

596
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:27,550
I can get out of here.

597
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,810
That person can get out of here, and our program will crash–

598
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,770
Crap!

599
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,300
Would you save me?

600
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:45,140
Would you save me?

601
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,450
Ju Eun Ho, you know...

602
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:48,810
Know what?

603
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,860
You learned how to swim.

604
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:54,130
Are you crazy?

605
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:55,930
I believe you even learned the butterfly stroke.

606
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:59,230
That's good enough to survive on your own.

607
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,340
Hey! Can't you just indulge me?

608
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,580
Humor me and say you'll save me?

609
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,750
Foster some independence, Eun Ho.

610
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:11,050
Why expect help when you've fallen into the water?

611
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:14,910
Please! Find your own way out, okay?

612
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,350
Hey! Don't you love me?

613
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:23,420
Geez, you're heavy! Get off of me.

614
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,610
No! I won't let go.

615
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,620
Answer me. Would you save me?

616
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,650
Seriously!

[Jung Hyun Oh]

620
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,450
I'll wait exactly 10 minutes.

621
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:19,020
Then I'll call the police. Why?

622
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,550
Because I'll get out of here alive, no matter what it takes.

623
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:25,570
I'm not...

624
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,960
going to die.

625
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,370
I won't die.

626
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,700
It's this truck! The number matches!
[112 (Police)]

627
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,200
Oh, it's you, Chan Woo!

628
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,260
Did Mi Yeon contact you?

629
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,900
Yes, PD Kim told me to come.

630
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:07,050
As expected, Mi Yeon didn't abandon me.

631
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:12,750
Gosh, I was so scared in here.

632
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,660
Are you okay? It wasn't too cold?

633
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:18,460
Yes, I'm all right. I have a lot of fat in my body.

634
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:22,920
I was a bit cold, but something was scarier.

635
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,140
You heard, right?

636
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,320
Th-There's...

637
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,600
Hey, you should consider it a real honor.

638
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,520
Because I would save you.

639
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,490
You're still going on about that?

640
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:26,810
You told me to crawl out by myself while I'm drowning.

641
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,690
But if you were drowning,

642
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:33,030
I would save you even if I didn't know how to swim!

643
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,620
Why would you save me?

644
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,090
Find a way for you to survive.

645
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:40,870

[Dear Hye Ri]

674
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:09,610
I can't hold back if I'm curious about something.

675
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:12,500
So let me ask you one thing.

676
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,010
Go ahead.

677
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:18,120
I contacted Kim Mi Yeon.

01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,580
