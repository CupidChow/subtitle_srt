186
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,020
Thank you. Hello.

187
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:37,140
It's a very long story to explain.

188
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,790
But you're definitely Hye Ri.

189
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,300
[Ju Eun Ho]

190
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,900
Wow.

191
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,530
Wow.

192
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,670
Anyway, you know,

193
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,940
I'm your sunbae.

194
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,430
By a lot.

195
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,520
Also,

196
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,590
it's top secret that I worked in the parking lot.

197
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,290
Totally top...

198
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,870
top secret.

199
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,400
Okay?

200
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,600
Okay.

201
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,960
I look forward to working with you.

202
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,480
Welcome to PPS, the joy of a new tomorrow.

203
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,870
I'm Baek Hye Yeon from Media N Seoul, a future created by the media.

204
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,270
Thanks for having me, Sunbaenim.

205
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,980
How can she say goodbye like this?

206
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,040
How can she just change companies without a word?

207
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,970
Hey. She's not picking up my calls at all.

208
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,140
She texted me saying,

209
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,070
"Oppa, I'm going to PPS, the joy of a new tomorrow.

210
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,680
Thank you so much for everything."

211
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,830
At least she texted you. She didn't reply to me at all.

212
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,800
Ju Yeon, has she said anything to you?

213
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,480
She did, right?

214
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,640
What?

215
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,120
From Hye Yeon.

216
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,260
What did she say to you?

217
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,310
I...

218
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,930
What did she say?

219
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,070
I...

220
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,920
feel weird.

221
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,990
What are you talking about?

222
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,970
We asked you if you've heard from Baek Hye Yeon.

223
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,150
Why are you explaining your feelings?

224
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,840
Ju Yeon, you're not sad, are you?

225
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,480
No, I'm not sad...

226
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,170
It just...

227
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,770
doesn't matter to me if Hye Yeon is here or not.

228
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,850
I can reach out and see her anytime.

229
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,530
I'll just call...

230
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,420
[Baek Hye Yeon]

231
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,970
- Hello?
- The person you are calling is not available...

232
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,500
Please leave a message after the beep.

233
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,390
Maybe she's on-air.

234
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,330
She started today. Do you think she's on air?

235
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,490
It went to voicemail in three seconds...

236
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,540
Ju Yeon, going to voicemail in three seconds

237
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,340
is called being blocked in our industry.

238
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,250
- Blocked?
- Blocked.

239
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,360
I know that much.

240
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,420
[Stepping toward a new tomorrow]
Unni, what is going on?

241
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,850
Can't you tell?

242
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,440
Are they convincing the Deputy to do the news?

243
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Probably.

244
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,270
But why does it look like they're bullying him in my eyes?

245
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,830
Because it is bullying.

246
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,310
What?

247
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:19,060
Geez, he won't take it when it's given to him?

248
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,530
He's acting like someone died because of him.

249
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,150
Geez.

250
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,850
Oppa.

251
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,170
Jeon Jae Yong is doing better.

252
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,240
He woke up and moved his eyes. It's true.

253
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,430
Okay.

254
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,740
It wasn't your fault.

255
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,150
No.

256
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,420
It feels like it was all my fault.

257
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,990
No. It really wasn't.

258
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,160
Also, this is a broadcast station.

259
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,890
Things keep going whether someone dies or not.

260
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,990
I know it's brutal, but you're the only one who can do it.

261
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,590
Because you're so good. So...

262
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,050
I know.

263
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,980
I'm the only person who can do the news right now.

264
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,830
I know that I need to do it.

265
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,280
Fine. I know that's how a broadcast station is, Soo Jeong. But...

266
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,190
I can't do it.

267
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,920
I really can't do it.

268
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,970
I don't know why I feel this way.

269
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,960
I understand everything with my head. I get it, but...

270
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,120
why can't I do it?

271
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,880
Why can't I, Soo Jeong?

272
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,590
Apparently, Hyung went inside to hide and shut the door.

273
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,070
Go after him.

274
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,100
No one's able to convince him.

275
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,800
Also, we'll have an empty desk starting today.

276
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,740
- If you-
- What's the point? He wants to be alone.

277
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,560
- What do you mean?
- Also...

278
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,620
I'm a girlfriend who respects him needing time.

279
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,420
Respect or whatever. For him-

280
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,830
He needs you, Sunbae.

281
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,820
He locked the door. No one can go in. Who else could go in?

282
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,730
Why are you trying to drag out someone who's locked himself in?

283
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,710
They want photocopies.

284
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,290

Sunbaenims.

287
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,340
Huh? That's not right.

288
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,380
I heard them asking you.

289
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,840
I need to...

290
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,360
prepare for the news, and you're free.

291
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,900
You're not doing anything.

292
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,590
People who have nothing to do should take on these things, no?

293
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,710
Look, I'm subbing for 7 o'clock news.

294
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,520
You're just a sub.

295
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,260
I'm the regular.

296
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,900
Who do you think is busier?

297
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,920
I think the sub is busier.

298
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,990
I was so busy when I subbed. Right, Sunbae?

299
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,660
Excuse me. Who are you?

300
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,020
I'm Baek Hye Yeon, who newly joined

301
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,330

Nice to meet you.

303
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,910
- I'm...
- I know you.

304
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,790
Shim Jin Ah. Right?

305
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,710
You know me?

306
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:06,720
Of course. You were so famous at our company... No, my ex-company.

307
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,090
Me?

308
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,260
Why?

309
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,620
For being so bad.

310
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,810
For being so terrible.

311
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,530
Hey. How dare you say I'm bad?

312
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,850
Who do you think you are?

313
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,600
Are you classless, too?

314
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,330
Damn it. Announcers have no class these days.

315
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,040
Just so you know,

316
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,780
I may lack class,

317
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,200
but I enunciate better than you.

318
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,580
Pronunciation is important for announcers.

319
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,770
How come they keep calling?

320
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,710
She's right.

321
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,030
So, will you apologize?

322
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,680
For trampling on my dream and her dreams with your pronunciation.

323
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,340
Will you apologize...

324
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,410
for everyone's dream here?

325
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,160
Will you apologize?

326
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,100
Why, why, why? Why did you call me?

327
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,540
Hey. How come you don't pick up?

328
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,980
Get to the point.

329
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,410
Want to meet today?

330
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,600
I broke up with Kim Yeon Ji.

331
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,160
Really?

332
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,190
Yeah, let's meet.

333
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,630
I'll show you a fun time.

334
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,090
But Choi Soo Hyeon.

335
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,710
I really didn't have that much fun when we met up.

336
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,240
Come to your senses, Choi Soo Hyeon.

337
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,260
Why is that? You've been hanging out with me this whole time.

338
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,740
In that case, f*** off.

339
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,010
Hello, Sunbaenim.

340
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,470
Oh, hi.

341
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,350
Where are you headed?

342
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,810
You're still here doing this?

343
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,430
Who is this?

344
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:33,450
Our team couldn't even have a meeting today because you were all swarming here.

345
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,240
We had a lot to discuss with our deputy today.

346
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,000
Our youngest must've lost it from too much work.

347
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,510
Have you been day drinking?

348
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,810
No, I'm not drunk.

349
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,620
PD, you get drunk and cause trouble.

350
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,400
- Hey, let's go.
- PD!

351
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,660
I haven't been able to ask the Deputy anything...

352
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,770
Hello, Press Director. Hello, Team Leader.

353
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,830
The Director of the Culture and Education Department is here.

354
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,530
I wonder why.

355
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,990
I'm here because I heard Jung Hyun Oh is

356
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:11,050
refusing to do the news with only an hour left till the 9 o'clock news.

357
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,880
No.

358
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,420
I should say I'm doing a favor by being here.

359
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,320
Hey. What can you possibly do?

360
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,250
I can...

361
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,010
open the door. Like this.

362
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,140
But Press Director and Team Leader.

363
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,500
If I convince Jung Hyun Oh, what will you do for me?

364
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,020
You...

365
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,790

I'm not trying to interrupt your alone time.

377

I told you. If you don't come out when you should, I'll come get you.

You were very scared, huh?

Yes.

384
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,720
I thought someone might've died because of me.

385
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,860
No, it wasn't because of you, Hyun Oh.

386
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,630
They say...

387
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,890
Yeah?

388
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,690
They say a misfortune turns into a gem.

389
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,660
Yeah.

390
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,790
How would this ever become a gem?

391
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,450

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,270
Hurry up and give it to me. Hurry.

548
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,500
Geez.

549
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,450
Straw, too. Straw.

550
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,680
Straw, too. Here, here.

551
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,750
Stick it in. Stick it in.

552
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,820
Yummy. Yum yum.

553
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,480
Do you have any banana milk?

554
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,930
Choco is best mixed with banana.

555
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:20,150
Banana, banana. I think I'll feel unhappy without banana milk.

556
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:23,220
Got it. Let me go get it. All good?

557
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,470
Okay.

558
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,970
I got banana milk, so stop torturing her.

559
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:36,180
Banana? Banana, banana.

560
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,780
I love bananas.

561
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,530
Banana. For me. Banana.

562
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,610
Yummy, yummy.

563
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:49,530
Hyun Oh, I heard you did a great job on the news.

564
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,320
Of course.

565
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,290
That's not a seat for those who don't do a good job.

566
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,070
That must mean that's your seat now.

567
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:03,100
Press Director Soh? Transitioning is his talent.

568
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,770
No.

569
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,590
Dining and dashing is his talent.

570
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:11,280
I told him no way in hell, so don't worry.

571
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,680
All good?

572
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:18,240
No, Hyun Oh, you're a better fit for that role.

573
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,670
I wish I could say that to be a bigger person, but no.

574
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:24,050
You be a bigger person. I'm not interested in that.

575
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:28,700
I love being the face of the company. Therefore, I will keep that seat.

576
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:33,470
- Hey, Jae Yong.
- What? Huh?

577
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:36,850
As the team leader of the Announcer Department, do you think he should stay?

578
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,370
- Is that what you want to say?
- No.

579
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:43,940
I was going to ask you if I can go home now.

580
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,030
That's what I wanted to say.

581
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,850
No. No way. You need to stay with me.

582
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,790
Seriously!

583
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:55,790
I've been by your side since yesterday.

584
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,730
Sure.

585
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,570
In that case, you stay, Ju Eun Ho.

586
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,580
No, I have the 7 o'clock news. I can't.

587
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,290
Oh, yeah? Then, Jung Hyun Oh, you stay.

588
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:14,300
No. I need to do the 9 o'clock news until you return.

589
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,540
Oh, is that right? Then...

590
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,240
Isn't today the weekend?

591
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,960
Damn it.

592
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,810
Damn it...

593
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,180
What did you say, Ju Yeon?

594
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,790
I'd like to prepare to audition for the 8 o'clock news.

595
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,370
- Why?
- Well...

596
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:54,400
I've gotten a couple of offers to audition.

597
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,880
Yeah, but you said no each time, didn't you?

598
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,670
But I want to do it now.

599
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,830
Thank you, Ju Yeon. Thank you so much.

600
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:10,840
Are you that happy, sir?

601
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,880
Of course! This is great!

602
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,490
This is the best news I've heard in a long time.

603
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:18,360
Now that Baek Hye Yeon is gone...

604
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,510
After Hye Yeon left...

605
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:25,470
I had been down a bit.

606
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:29,590
Gosh, that girl.

607
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,290
So cold. She's so cold.

608
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,560
How could she just throw her resignation and walk away?

609
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,750
She doesn't even keep in touch.

610
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:47,760
Did Hye Yeon block your call, too, sir?

611
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,440
Block?

612
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,660
No, I talked to her yesterday.

613
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,590
You just said you don't stay in touch.

614
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:01,540
I was talking about today. No word today.

615
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,540
[Baek Hye Yeon]

616
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,590
The customer can't answer the call right now.

617
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:44,970
Whoa, PPS, the joy of a new tomorrow, gives out the newest-model laptops.

618
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:49,710
Media N Seoul, a future created by media, used sucky desktops.

619
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:51,490
I'm glad I moved over.

620
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:53,840
Good job, past self.

621
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,520
I compliment you. Impressive.

622
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,510
Hey, there.

623
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,790
Yes, Hye- sunbaenim?

624
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,510
Phone, please.

625
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,160
Baek Hye Yeon, did you block my number?

626
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,690
Yeah, Sunbae. Why?

627
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,760
- Why, you ask?
- Sunbae, I'm allowed to block you.

628
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,600
It's quite common.

629
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:27,010
Cutting off and blocking are necessary skills in our busy modern world, Sunbae.

630
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:29,110
Why was I the only one you blocked, then?

631
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:31,040
To forget you.

632
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,300
Listen, you said it doesn't make a difference whether I'm there or not.

633
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,670
You said the world isn't ending, so you don't care.

634
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:44,340
So, shouldn't I start forgetting about you now?

635
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,450
I thought, shouldn't I give up on you now?

636
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,680
That's why I blocked you.

637
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,040
Why?

638
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,990
Does it sting more than you imagined?

639
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,490
Yeah.

640
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:01,890
It stings a lot, Hye Yeon.

641
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,930
Endure, Sunbae.

642
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:06,870
That's the only option. What can you do?

643
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:09,760
It's not like you'll date me now.

644
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,300
That's true, but...

645
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:17,930
Sunbae, I hope you're happy.

646
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:24,130
Well, let's eat together sometime.

647
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,410
But if I get a boyfriend, I can't.

648
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:29,170
Because I know now.

649
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:31,560
A person only has one heart.

650
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,700
Anyway, that's all, Sunbae.

651
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,660
Please be happy.

652
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,060
I hope we'll meet again.

653
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,880
But if I get a boyfriend, I can't see you.

654
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:47,920
Because I'm a woman of integrity.

655
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:51,570
I have newfound integrity.

656
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,530
It just worked out that way.

657
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:56,370
I think I'm quite popular here,

658
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:58,680
so I'll look for people here.

659
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:03,160
Well, if you're interested, I could think about it

660
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,720
but not much room for reconsideration. It's not too bad here.

661
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:13,760
So, you never had another personality again after that?

662
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,010
No. Hye Ri never came back.

663
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,430
Then, the emotional issues you had, Eun Ho...

664
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:27,070
The emotional issues that caused your Dissociative Identity Disorder

665
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,590
has been resolved.

666
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:33,620
But Eun Ho,

667
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:38,440
if you face those emotional issues again,

668
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:43,520
there is a chance you will meet Hye Ri again.

669
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:48,180
But there's nothing to worry about.

670
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:52,940
Because you can just get treated again.

671
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,710
But Doctor.

672
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:00,760
If I saw Hye Ri again,

673
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,450
I think I'd be happy to see her.

674
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:08,500
Is that right?

675
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,810
But for the sake of my future,

676
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:13,430
we better not meet again.

677
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,630
Yes.

678
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:18,580
We'll keep trying, Eun Ho.

679
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,720
But Doctor...

680
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,410
I'd like to say bye to Hye Ri.

681
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,500
- Say bye?
- Yes.

682
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,780
You told me about good breakups.

683
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:38,700
If so, I would like to say a good farewell to Hye Ri.

684
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:43,260
That's a good idea.

685
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,310
Really?

686
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:46,840
Yes.

687
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,080
Eun Ho, your anxiety and worries,

688
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,870
guilt and unspoken gratitude.

689
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:59,980
I think it's a good idea to say bye to Hye Ri

690
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,180
to get closure.

691
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,500
Then, I'll say goodbye to Hye Ri

692
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,090
by meeting people who knew her.

693
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,970
Hye Ri.

694
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:18,010
You were my first patient when I opened my clinic.

695
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,870
I may have been clumsy,

696
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:26,750
but I was happy that you were healed, Hye Ri.

697
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:30,780
Thank you.

698
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:36,360
Goodbye, Hye Ri.

699
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,960
Wow, what a mess.

700
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,160
I haven't seen a group shot like this in a long time.

701
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,470
All right.

702
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:06,170
You all know Hye Ri.

703
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,970
I don't really know her.

704
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:12,880
I've arranged a meeting to say goodbye to Hye Ri today.

705
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,190
What's this nonsense?

706
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:20,700
So, I invited everyone who knew Hye Ri

707
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,250
to say "goodbye" and "farewell."

708
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,460
It's time for us to say goodbye.

709
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,840
Yes, speak, Min Yeong.

710
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,440
When will you serve food?

711
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,710
If you can each share a word with me since you know Hye Ri,

712
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,970
that would be amazing.

713
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:41,820
Because this moment...

714
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:46,550
Unnis, I don't think she's quite right in the head.

715
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:51,600
- What is she saying? Personality? Goodbye?
- Don't you miss Hye Ri?

716
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,830
I'm a little stuck here.

717
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:56,180
- Why are we doing this in our house?
- Through all of you...

718
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:00,740
- It is a little weird to do this here.
- What are your thoughts?

719
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,700
- No.
- What do you think?

720
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,800
- What do you think about how I feel?
- I think that's cute.

721
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,930
What did you say?

722
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,890
"That"?

723
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:23,090
Who said it? "That"? "That"? Who was that?

724
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:24,640
- Who-
- Look at me, look at me.

725
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,030
Come to. Stop. Breathe.

- Dip one for me.
- Honey.

730
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:43,580
So? What do you want to say to Hye Ri?

731
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,360
Are you talking to me?

732
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,950
I've never met her. I swear.

733
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:52,240
Shit. Just do it, man.

734
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,380
Goodbye.

735
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,210
Next, you.

736
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,820
You think I met her?

737
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,320
Okay.

738

And you?

Thank you for breaking up with Ju Yeon.

741
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:20,890
Well, it's not like it'll work out between him and me,

742
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,370
but how should I say? You opened the door slightly.

743
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,270
To our future.

744

- Later...
- No.

There's no later, Ju Yeon.

767
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:14,230
We should go, Eun Ho.

768

This is so delicious.

773
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,690
Not to your food. Talk to me.

774
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:49,780
Did you make this or order this?

775
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,470
I ordered it.

776
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:54,930
So, can you please talk to Hye Ri?

777
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:59,370
So, like a final goodbye?

778
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:01,360
Would you?

779
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:05,980
Next time, order dumplings, too, Hye Ri.

780
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,430
Hey, why are you doing this to me?

781
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:11,400
Boiled dumplings, not fried dumplings.

01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,130
Hey, didn't you eat today? Is this your first meal?

783

You know what?

784
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:27,860
I don't want to say goodbye to Ju Hye Ri.

785
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:38,320
I've never parted ways with Ju Hye Ri. And I don't need to.

786
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,930
Parting ways between friends is cutting each other off.

787
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:43,360
But I didn't cut Ju Hye Ri off.

788
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,770
So, I can't say goodbye, Hye Ri.

789

You told me to call you unni last time.

Get married, Hyun Oh? I don't believe...

Marry me. I think I should marry you, Ju Eun Ho.

This is so cringe. I can't stand it. Goosebumps...

Why do you think we love someone?

816
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:35,980
Looking at it in a row like this, it's really scary.

817
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:41,660
I'm going to smoke a bunch when I get to hell.

But Unnis, you know what?

819
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:51,620
I'll follow you to hell if you end up there.

820
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:55,680
Why do you think you'd end up in heaven?

821

Because I'm the prettiest.

I like her a lot.

Why do you like her?

- Yes, yes.

and the possibility of evidence tampering...

To this, the ruling party has expressed a solemn stance.

I don't want to.

906
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:06,920
You...

907
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:13,210
You're supposed to kiss at a place like this.

908
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:16,880
I really don't want to.

909
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:19,830
Just do it.

910
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:29,420
Can't you close your eyes?

911
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:34,910
I don't want to. I really love your face as you come closer to me.

912
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:12,000
In the end, to like the same things and become happy together.

913
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,960
That's why we love.

914
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:19,390
Giving our all.

915
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:21,360
Us.

916
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,400
You know something?

917
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:41,130
Unni, you're my favorite.

918
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,540
What about you, Unni?

919
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,520
Yes. Of course.

920
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:57,740
I feel the same, Ju Hye Ri.

921
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:00,660
I like you...

922
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:03,810
and myself...

923
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,250
the best.

924
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:32,000
[Dear Hyeri]

925
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:25,300
[Thank you for watching "Dear Hyeri"]
