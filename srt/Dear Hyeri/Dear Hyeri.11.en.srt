00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,310
So? What do I smell like?

10
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,950
1/6 of your fabric softener, 1/6 of your shampoo.

11
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,830
And?

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:02,060
1/6 of where you were yesterday, 1/6 of the hand cream you use.

13
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,410
I don't use hand cream.

14
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:10,460
1/6 of the drink you just had, 1/6 of the incense you use at home.

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,450
I don't burn incense, either.

24
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,430
How long has it been since you did laundry?

25
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,500
I'm only two days behind.

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,170
The weird thing is, you're so messy, but you change your clothes every day.

27
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,950
Am I supposed to change every other day, then?

28
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,950

00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,750
N-Nothing. Anyway, so... so...

31
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,180
Are there people who don't change daily?

32
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,350
Yeah. Plenty.

33
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,280
Every other day. Once every three days.

34
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,510

And?

60
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,830
Because of the guilt,

61
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,420

Why?

102
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,550
Because the pepper was spicy.

103
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,320
You know, I ran into him in the emergency stairwell earlier,

104
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,810

132
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,520
That's right. I was sick.

133

You didn't lose your memory. It was a different identity.

134

That's right. This unni went through a lot.

135

There's only one thing that I truly understand.

That you're 37.

138

That's right. You really didn't look 28.

139
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,100
I'm pretty insightful about those things.

140
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,230
And no matter how I look-

141
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:39,090

142
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,130
Okay, 31.

So what?

146
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,660
Could you call me "unni"?

147
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,240
No.

148
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,280
When you started,

149
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,850
I told you I was older than you, but you spoke informally to me.

150
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,710
That's right.

151
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,740
Do you remember that?

152
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,770
Well, roughly, but...

153
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,340
Are you going to stop coming here now?

154
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,400
Yeah, I can't anymore.

155
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,510
But you were a little bored without me, huh?

156
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,630
Not a little. A lot.

157
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,370
I thought of you more than Kang Ju Yeon.

00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,180

159
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,110
If I had been thinking about Kang Ju Yeon, I wouldn't have come to you first.

161
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,620
When I spent time with you...

162
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,680
I was very happy.

163
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,860
Actually, I don't have any friends.

164
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:46,150
Hey, why wouldn't a famous announcer have any friends?

165
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,930
You must have a lot more cooler friends than me.

166
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,080
You don't pick friends because they're cool.

167
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,830
You just pick them. Unconditionally.

168
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,280
You just blend with the people you connect with.

169
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,240
Hey.

170
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,690
You surely sound like you're 37.

171
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,180
So, please call me "unni" from now on.

172
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,460
You're more old-fashioned than I thought.

173
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,090
How did you know? My hoobaes call me an oldie all the time.

174
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,540
Among the oldies I know,

175
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,340
you're my favorite.

Why do you ask?

178
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,910
So, I can cheer you on.

179

Why not? I'm a good cheerleader.

Are you coming to work again?

182
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,970
No. I just came to say hi to Min Yeong.

00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,610
I see.

184
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,820
I need to live as Eun Ho from now on, not Hye Ri.

185
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,940
Right.

186
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,900
You're right. Of course.

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,600
Yes?

189
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,660
Do you know what a "good breakup" is?

190
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,570
What's good about a breakup?

191
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,670
I learned about it in counseling.

192
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,110
We all need good breakups.

193
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,500
So, what's good about breakups?

194
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,920
There's no such a thing, Hye Ri.

195
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Yes, there is.

196
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,920
When you break up, you spend plenty of time with that person,

197
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,170
and take your time being sad.

198
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,330
You genuinely support each other,

199
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:27,370
you bravely confront the breakup without avoiding it, and you say goodbye.

200
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,610
That's a good breakup.

201
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,010
Why are you telling me that?

202
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,770
Do you want to have a good breakup?

203
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,630
That's how I want to break up with you, Kang Ju Yeon.

204
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,670
Because Hye Ri...

205
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,830
must have really liked you, Kang Ju Yeon.

206
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,620
What do you think?

207
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,600
Keep going.

208
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,690
Team Leader, I am officially coming back to work starting today.

209
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,200
Yay!

210
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,950
Yay.

211
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,850
Is the company your living room?

212
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,100
You just come and go freely?

213
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,200
Geez, I used up the vacation days that I saved up.

214
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,540
Right.

215
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,920
Sure.

216
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,720
Hey!

217
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,860
If you came back just a week later,

218
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,600
I might have never seen you again!

219
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,410
But I came back!

220
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,570
Yay!

221
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,710
Hyungnim!

222
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,850
Hyungnim! Open the door!

223
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,900
I saw something amazing!

224
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,400
Hyungnim, I saw something totally, totally amazing this morning!

225
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,020
Hey, don't open the door!

226
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,260
What did you see? What was it?

227
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:17,520
Did you see me? Are you shocked that I'm back? Is that it?

228
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,100
No, seeing you wasn't an amazing thing.

229
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,300
It was amazing to see you and Jung Hyun Oh holding hands-

230
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,220
E-Eun Ho?

231
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,370
Sunbae, where can I go now?

232
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,260
I don't care about morning or evening now. I'll do whatever you want.

233
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,530
What should I do?

234
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,750
You can leave.

235
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,380
I can do the news.

236
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,970
Early morning is good, too. If you want me here at 4 a.m., I can be here at 2.

237
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,640
Is there an opening? Did anyone quit?

238
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,200
I said leave.

239
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,190
- I will, but...
- I said leave!

240
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,990
Yes, Team Leader. I'll go right now. Yes, sir.

241
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,640
Hey!

242
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,100
Yes. Please speak, Team Leader.

243
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,550
You know...

244
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,770
as for Hyun Oh...

245
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:12,190
he can start on Current News at Ten next week.

246
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,300
What about it?

247
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,280
I'm saying he'll still be next to you.

248
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,140
Once he starts Current News at Ten, he'll switch his spot.

249
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,390
Just until then-

250
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,300
Sunbae, what do you take me for?

251
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,590
I'm a cool lady.

252
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,980
Aigoo! You're so cool that

253
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,990
you went dark for a month because you heard your ex was getting married?

254
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,400
Aigoo.

255
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,970
Good for you!

256
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,300
A good breakup?

257
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,760
Yes, a good breakup.

258
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,470
So, you want to meet up with Kang Ju Yeon?

259
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,360
Yes, for a good breakup.

260
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,320
Isn't that just a date?

261
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,390
No. Why? I can't?

262
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,310
Should I not go?

263
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,270
No, you should go.

264
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,480
Oh, really?

265
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,010
Of course.

266
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,480
You know I'm a good boyfriend, right?

267
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,630
You're okay before dating,

268
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,790
but once we're dating, you turn into a giant poop.

269
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,360
What are you two talking about?

270
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,280
Poop. Why?

271
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,380
Poop?

272
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,970
Maybe it's because I didn't turn this on for a month.

273
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,160
Do you know the extension for the repair department?

274
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,190
Yes, I do.

275
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,290
Hey, do you know the extension for the repair department?

276
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,400
5574.

277
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,020
The number you're calling does not exist...

278
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,620
It says the number doesn't exist.

279
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,680
Then, I don't know.

280
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,070
Damn it.

281
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,760
I'm a little confused. Are you on good or bad terms?

282
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,420
Damn it.

283
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,280
H-Hello?

284
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,270
This isn't working.

285
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,610
I know the number. You want it?

286
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,160
It's 5573.

287
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,460
I knew you would know.

288
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,450
What? Are you back for real?

289
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,750
Would I be back for fake?

290
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,990
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

291
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,790
I'm fine.

292
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,580
Don't worry, Moon Ji On.

293
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,070
How about Hyung?

294
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,540
What about him?

295
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,670
What happened with him?

296
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,870
It went well.

297
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,560
Gosh, I knew it would end up that way eventually.

298
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,870
Speaking of, Ji On.

299
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,920
What?

300
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,000
Call me "noona" or "sunbae."

301
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,720
Fine!

302
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,260
Eun Ho...

303
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,580
noona.

304
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,140
Eun Ho sunbae.

305
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,680
What is wrong with you?

306
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,870
It's grossing me out since it's been a while, but I can get used to it.

307
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,970
I'll work on it.

308
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,210
Hello, this is the announcer department.

309
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,580
My computer is broken.

310
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,480
I was on vacation and didn't turn it on for a month.

311
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,370
Yes.

312
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,620
[Ju Eun Ho]

313
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,850
It's already fixed.

314
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,410
Thank you.

315
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,710
What?

316
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,300
Did your laptop magically get fixed while you were gone?

317
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:47,430
I take back calling you poop. My boyfriend is gold.

318
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,670
I took your laptop myself,

319
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,690
fixed it, and brought it back.

320
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,750
Oppa, when do you get off work?

321
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,390
I want to leave right now,

322
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,390
but I have so much to do.

323
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,660
What?

324
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,900
What?

325
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,560
Why are you so pretty?

326
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,100
Me? Right now?

327
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,930
You're so pretty right now.

328
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,910
Let's run away together.

329
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,220
I can't. I have a meeting.

330
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,110
I can. I don't have a meeting. So let's run away.

331
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,730
Eun Ho.

332
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,060
If you're getting paid, you should put in the work.

333
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,670
Do you know how tough it is to run a company?

334
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:47,300
At times like this, you and I should be-

335
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,580
Darn it.

336
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,830
What is this? Are we in high school or something?

337
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,540
Wow, did you do this in high school?

338
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,380
I studied so hard that I didn't dream of doing this.

339
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,470
And now, you're making your 37-year-old boyfriend do this?

340
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,650
Isn't it fun?

341
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,890
But...

342
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,710
But what are you wearing?

343
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,800
What do you mean? I'm wearing my clothes.

344
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,960
You're wearing a skirt, though.

345
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,920
- And?
- Hey.

346
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,970
What if someone saw you climbing over this wearing that?

347
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,200
No one saw me. What the heck?

348
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,800
Geez, seriously.

349
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,230
And we shouldn't walk. We should run.

350
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,140
Why? Why do we have to run?

351
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,370
To feel like we're playing hooky.

352
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,070
Oh, yay!

353
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,450
You run fast!

354
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,370
Pasta with shrimp meat and mushrooms?

355
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,840
It was so good!

356
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,430
It was good, right?

357
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,200
What should I wear? What would be nice?

358
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,400
You're going to change?

359
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,030
Of course! I'm meeting up with Kang Ju Yeon.

360
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,260
I shouldn't look too shabby.

361
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,230
Maybe a dress? I'll look younger.

362
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,460
Kang Ju Yeon is a lot younger than me. I was so surprised.

363
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,870
Hyun Oh, what do you think of this?

364
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,890
It's okay with me.

365
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,200
What is? Meeting Kang Ju Yeon?

366
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,400
Yes. I'm really fine, Eun Ho.

367
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,060
I know. You said you were.

368
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,410
Ever since I said I was going to see him,

369
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,270
you've said you're fine a hundred times.

370
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,140
But it's a little...

371
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,770
bit late in the evening, you know.

372
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,430
It's 11 p.m.

373
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,550
And the dress is a little off, no?

374
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:01,200
We're meeting at 11 p.m. because that's when he's done.

375
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,500
And I want to wear a dress to look young.

376
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,670
Yes, you do look young. You're so pretty, my Eun Ho.

377
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,420
The best.

378
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,900
What are you doing?

379
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,080
It's a little late. I'll drive you.

380
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,220
Kang Ju Yeon is picking me up.

381
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,850
He is?

382
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,900
Did you wait long?

383
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,410
No, I didn't wait at all.

384
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,190
Where should we go? Is anything open at this hour?

385
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,150
Yes. I looked it up.

386
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,450
Is the sushi not good?

387
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,260
No, well...

388
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,650
How should I say this? The rice is just so good

389
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:17,740
that I don't want the taste of the sashimi to ruin the taste of the rice.

390
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,640
Because if I really want to enjoy the taste of the rice,

391
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,670
the sashimi shouldn't be there.

392
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,940
Do you know this?

393
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:34,480
The meaning of "sushi" is a handful of rice, little water, sugar, vinegar, salt...

394
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:43,740
It would've been nice if you just said you wanted pork belly from the beginning.

395
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,370
But the list you brought didn't have a pork belly place.

396
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,280
Also, it's our last date today.

397
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,800
I thought pork belly was not right.

398
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,670
So, today is the end for us, huh?

399
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,280
I'm so jealous of Jung Hyun Oh.

400
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,780
He must be so happy.

401
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,870
But right now, I'm only thinking about you, Kang Ju Yeon.

402
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,270
Hye Ri called me Ju Yeon, not Kang Ju Yeon.

403
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:33,560
Okay. Then, right now, I'm only thinking about you, Ju Yeon.

404
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,350
I should drive you home. I'm sorry.

405
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,380
It's okay. You said you needed to go back to work.

406
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,700
They need it before tomorrow morning, so it has to be now.

407
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,840
We're in the same field. You don't think I get it?

408
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,280
Right.

409
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,720
Are you sad?

410
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,400
"I liked you a lot, Kang Ju Yeon."

411
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,580
"I was very happy...

412
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,590
while liking you."

413
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,910
Hye Ri said that to me right here.

414
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,610
Did I?

415
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:54,210
You're the first person I really liked.

416
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:01,100
I really, really liked you a lot.

417
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,880
While liking you,

418
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,730
I was so happy...

419
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,220
Hye Ri.

420
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,200
Thank you so much.

421
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,660
I'm...

422
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,390
so sorry that I'm not the person...

423
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,360
you loved.

424
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,090
I'm...

425
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,940
so sorry that I can't be the person...

426
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,710
you love, Ju Yeon.

427
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,690
Thank you for everything, Ju Yeon.

428
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,220
Ju Yeon, aren't you going to say goodbye to me?

429
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,920
No.

430
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,250
I will.

431
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,590
Then, can we shake hands?

432
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,050
Yes.

433
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,620
You went through a lot.

434
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,350
Now, you can go back to work. They're waiting for you.

435
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,950
Hey, you know what?

436
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,060
It's past 2 a.m.

437
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,620
I know. That's why you came to pick me up.

438
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,700
Hey, I left after 11 p.m.

439
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,120
We haven't been out even for three hours.

440
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,370
I know. I do, but it's so late.

441
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,670
Right, Kang Ju Yeon? Isn't it so late?

442
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,920
It's not time for a date.

443
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,740
It's time to go back to the office and work.

444
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,870
I don't think of 2 a.m. as work hours.

445
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,810
Hey, you said you got it.

446
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,550
You're not acting like you do.

447
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,150
No, I get it!

448
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:26,130
What are you saying? "Good breakup." I totally get it.

449
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,940
So, Kang Ju Yeon, get back to work.

450
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,000
Hey, you're not cool about this at all.

451
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,790
What are you saying? I'm such a cool guy.

452
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,970
Who's cooler than me in this world? Ta-da-da-da.

453
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:58,320
Ta-da-da? Stop it. Your face is cool.

454
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,380
You're right. My face is so cool. Look.

455
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,860
No, it's not.

456
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,970
You look like...

457
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,750
You look in shock.

458
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,300
Unni.

459
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,290
You said you were getting better.

460
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,610
Why are you taking your funeral portrait?

461
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:24,330
Well, I'm just preparing in advance.

462
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,460
Don't worry. You'll all get a photo.

463
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,690
Why? Am I dying, too?

464
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,180
You said you'll die with me if I die.

465
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,300
We still have a bottle of alcohol that Hyun Oh got on his business trip.

466
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,650
I have to drink that before I die.

467
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,660
Hey, Grandma! You have a bottle I got from a business trip, too.

468
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,260
That's right. I'm going to drink that, too, before I die.

469
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,000
Wow, such amazing goals, everyone.

470
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,390
But where is Hyun Oh?

471
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,470
He should already be here.

472
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,760
I know. Why isn't he here?

473
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,880
[Ju Eun Ho]

474
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,620
[Program poster]

475
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,750
You're going to pass this around?

476
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,120
Yes. Newsroom, Current Affairs, Entertainment, Radio.

477
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,020
Am I missing anything? Culture and Education, too. What do you think?

478
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,310
But why?

479
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,410
Shin Joong isn't getting me anything.

480
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,450
So what should I do? The thirsty one should dig up a well.

481
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,820
I'm going to dig up a big, deep one.

482
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,390
Fine, dig it up.

483
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,880
A deep one.

484
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:30,030
But if Shin Joong finds out you're passing this around-

485
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,480
He'll be remorseful.

486
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,240
"I should've paid more attention to Eun Ho."

487
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:41,150
Or, "If I leave Eun Ho unattended for a moment, she takes a shit."

488
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,330
What? Are you embarrassed of me?

489
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,740
No.

490
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,800
You're so cute.

491
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,800
Damn it!

492
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,550
What are you saying?

493
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,280
You're crazy.

494
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,830
What do you mean? I'm just telling the truth.

495
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,510
Hey, what's up?

496
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,330
Right.

497
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,400
Got it. I'll be right there.

498
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,690
I need to go.

499
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,440
What is it? Where are you going?

500
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,590
We're supposed to get meat in Majangdong today. Where are you going?

501
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:26,610
They got some new pork belly in today, and we're supposed to go get it. Where are you going?

502
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,770
Yeah. That was the plan, but I-

503
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,940
What? Why?

504
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,350
Hey.

505
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,970
Want to go somewhere with me?

506
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:52,660
Here we go! One, two, three!

507
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,480
Looks good. Let's reset and take a few more.

508
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,690
I'm just so confused.

509
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:06,900
Who's that vixen standing next to Hyun Oh?

510
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,620
I told you. Ju Eun Ho.

511
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,890
Unni, how do I look?

512
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,200
Don't my eyes look moist and nice?

513
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,480
So, who's Ju Eun Ho?

514
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,970
I told you. It's Hyung's girlfriend.

515
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,580
Well, this just bothers me.

516
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,710
She's not Hyun Oh's wife.

517
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:33,030
Why is his girlfriend taking a group photo with us?

518
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:39,820
Unni, stop being so old-fashioned.

519
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,030
I like it.

520
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,250
I don't care.

521
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,820
I just want this to be over so I can smoke.

522
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,020
Last one. Look to the front.

523
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,370
Grandma, your hands are shaking too much.

524
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,410
Good, good, hold her like that.

525
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,460
Here we go!

526
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,170
One, two, three!

527
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,560
Hey...

528
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,380
what is your name?

529
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,050
Oh, yes, I'm Ju Eun Ho.

530
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:37,320
So, I heard you don't have parents.

531
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,160
No, I don't. Just like Hyun Oh.

532
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,120
Then, do you... do you have a house?

533
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,610
No, I don't. Like Hyun Oh.

534
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,270
Are you good at housework?

535
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,930
I'm really bad at it.

536
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:58,020
So, Hyun Oh always came over to cook, do laundry, clean...

537
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,000
Is this an interview or something?

538
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,150
I know. So tough.

539
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,300
I don't even need to be against it.

540
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,230
That's right, Grandmas.

541
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:14,410
Who asks those questions these days? Not even in elementary schools.

542
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,110
Really? Have the times changed so quickly?

543
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,310
That's right. And Grandma, I came here

544
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:24,610
because Hyun Oh said he has four grandmothers. That's why I came.

545
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,660
I lived with my grandma as a child.

546
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,130
Pretty good. She seems pretty decent.

547
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:34,260
Right? I'm really decent.

548
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,870
I'm a catch.

549
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,580
Was she always that shameless?

550
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,270
I told you she's different.

551
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,510
She's shameless in a different way.

552
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,330
But Grandmas, as I see it...

553
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,500
you drink. You smoke.

554
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,510
You spit... wow...

555
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:05,080
Are you all healthy, ladies?

556
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,350
If things are going to be like this,

557
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,990
your future might be very gloomy.

558
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,810
Just a gentle suggestion...

559
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,590
That's enough for today. Let's wrap it up for today.

560
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:20,370
Hey, hey. I didn't get to ask her anything yet!

561
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:25,270
I know. But that's enough for today. Can I take her upstairs now?

562
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,250
Oh, my. Take her upstairs and do what?

563
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,440
To do what?

564
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,020
You're so silly!

565
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,580
Wait, why does that Unni keep laughing?

566
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,890
Because she's happy. She likes you a lot.

567
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,750
You like her?

568
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,060
Oh, my.

569
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,040
What are these, Jung Hyun Oh?

570
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,970
It's the grandmas...

571
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,990
Every time a shop closed in the neighborhood,

572
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:13,220
they went and bought stuff like that.

573
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:18,750
Why do they display them in your room?

574
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,910
Like, how a cat brings mice to their favorite person?

575
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:27,370
- Because they like you?
- Yes.

576
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,640
You know, Hyun Oh...

577
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,610
I thought you'd have a pianist mom, a violinist sister,

578
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,490
and a dad with a corporate job.

579
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,470
Everyone thinks that.

580
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,240
But it's not true.

581
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,500
So, when did you plan on telling me the truth?

582
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,540
Right now.

583
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,640
You know, Jae Yong...

584
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,630
If I could understand half of what you were saying,

585
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,680
or empathized with,

586
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,900
or accept, or was convinced, or-

587
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:33,090
Hyungnim, my phone just keeps ringing...

588
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:37,670
The CEO of the donut shop keeps calling me.

589
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,800
So, you're talking about...

590
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:54,020
the donut shop owner you shut down with your erroneous reporting five years ago, right?

591
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,420
Yes, Hyungnim.

592
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,470
My erroneous reporting shut down that donut shop.

593
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:03,700
I got the wrong info and spewed bullshit about how carcinogens were in their donuts.

594
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,400
That's why they shut down.

595
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,310
And what happened to me?

596
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,910
I got a pay cut and a demotion...

597
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,820
Hey, man.

598
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,740
That was it for you.

599
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:20,640
But how about him? He had lost everything!

600
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,180
That's right, Hyungnim.

601
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,140
So, I went over there and got on my knees to apologize.

602
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,460
It didn't change anything, but...

603
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,750
I also drained my savings and gave it to him.

604
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,520
I know money isn't everything, but...

605
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,780
I issued a correction, but...

606
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,020
Of course, people didn't care about the correction...

607
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:40,710
But Hyungnim, he keeps calling me.

608
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,100
What do I do?

609
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,910
- Get out, bastard.
- I will!

610
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:45,960
- Get out!
- Okay, okay.

611
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,510
Get out!

612
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,640
- But Hyungnim, what if he keeps calling-
- Go!

613
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,590
Hyungnim! Open the door!

614
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,190
He keeps calling!

615
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,150
Yes, Kim Shin Joong speaking.

616
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,090
Press Director?

617
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,840
What's going on?

618
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,930
What did you say, Team Leader?

619
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,350
You have a news offer.

620
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,980
Nonsense.

621
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,690
Up until yesterday, you said you didn't have anything for me.

622
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,310
So, I was going to pass out my resume to all the departments-

623
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:32,440
It's a 2-week substitute.

624
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,490
Still, that makes no sense. Soh Chin Guk hates me.

625
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:37,590
It's the 7 o'clock news.

626
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,990
This is getting stranger by the minute.

627
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,800
Fine. Who is it with?

628
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,590
Alone.

629
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:54,980
What?

630
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,790
You don't want it?

631
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,760
How?

632
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,320
How, how, how, how?

633
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,510
You're subbing for two weeks.

634
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:16,320
You don't need to get too excited.

635
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,200
How is it me when Shim Jin Hwa exists?

636
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,600
How could it be me?

637
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,780
First of all, Jin Hwa is terrible.

638
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,740
So, Soh Chin Guk was chewed out because of that.

639
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:32,920
So, my guess is that he'll try you out for the 7 o'clock and see the feedback...

640
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:38,210
What is this stupid dance?

641
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,720
Hey. Get out.

642
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,000
Stop dancing and go!

643
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,730
Close the door!

644
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:04,140
Why is it my fault that Shim Jin Hwa is terrible?

645
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,170
You put her in there.

646
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,800
I know. I know that.

647
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:13,210
Got it, then.

648
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:16,010
I heard Ju Eun Ho is back.

649
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:19,120
So?

650
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:23,560
You know Choi Jin Mi is on sick leave from 7 o'clock news, right?

651
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,040
And?

652
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,060
It's for two weeks.

653
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:33,410
Do you think Ju Eun Ho would do it if we asked?

654
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,770
You want Eun Ho? Why?

655
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,030
She'll just be subbing.

656
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:42,840
She's done news before. It's good to have experience.

657
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:47,040
And I don't really have anyone else around.

658
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,500
What do you mean?

659
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,920
There's a guy who got cut from the 9 o'clock,

660
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,060
an ideal newsman who's now watering the office plants. Jung Hyun Oh.

661
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,770
Choi Jin Mi is a woman. It should be a woman.

662
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:07,190
You think Ju Eun Ho would do it?

663
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,030
Would she do it for us?

664
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,090
I don't know.

665
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:17,400
I think she'll answer before you ask. That she'll do it.

666
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,610
Really? Then, can you ask her, Team Leader Kim?

667
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,470
But Press Director...

668
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,550
Yeah, what? Tell me.

669
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:30,650
We'll do our best, but...

670
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:34,280
Of course, you will. I trust you. But what?

671
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,860
We will do our very best.

672
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:41,400
I got it. What's wrong with you?

673
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,750
We will do our very best, so....

674
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,590
Press Director.

675
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:54,340
Please do not play around with my people again.

676
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:58,040
- What?
- Making them be your golf caddies,

677
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,240
making them work at your family events,

678
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,100
begging for scoops,

679
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,790
telling Eun Ho that she's old and incompetent.

680
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:07,500
Insisting we were wrong when we were right,

681
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,950
kicking someone out after one mistake.

682
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,350
I've been...

683
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,640
watching by the sidelines since I'm powerless and incompetent.

684
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,090
And?

685
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,690
Do you have any power now?

686
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:23,650
No.

687
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:25,760
I have courage.

688
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,040
The courage to say what I want.

689
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:36,100
Press Director, please don't play around with my people's dreams again.

690
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,920
An adult should have better things to do

691
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,020
than to play around with young people's dreams.

692
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,610
Thank you, Press Director.

693
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:16,750
So?

694
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,080
7 o'clock news.

695
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,640
I'm doing the 7 o'clock news! Daebak!

696
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,060
Whoa.

697
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,520
What?

698
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,280
Wo-o-ow!

699
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,980
Right, Hyun Oh. You can't just exclaim once. How many times?

700
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,430
Three times. Wo-o-ow!

701
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,900
That's right.

702
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,230
So, we're going there now, right?

703
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:41,150
There? Going where?

704
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:44,260
Where we had our first date. The Hill of Pinwheels.

705
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:48,560
We said we'd go there together when I got the 7 o'clock news.

706
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,570
Don't you remember?

707
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:54,750
I remember. I do, but I don't want to go there.

708
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,830
Why not? You said it looked like a painting!

709
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:01,810
Eun Ho, it was featured in a drama. Now, it's crowded.

710
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:02,820
I'm not going.

711
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,560
Hey, we missed the sunset because we were having garitguk.

712
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,150
Do you know how pretty the sunset is there? Like a kimchi pancake in the sky.

713
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,630
It's amazing, and I didn't get to see it!

714
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:16,760
Eun Ho, it's so pretty that...

715
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,240
Yes?

716
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,300
it was featured in a drama.

717
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,200
- Yeah.
- I'm a star.

718
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:26,150
People will recognize me there, and...

719
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:30,490
Hey. That kind of faded when you didn't make the news.

720
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,070
Can't you just come with me?

721
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,950
What do you mean? I still got it.

722
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:37,010
I really want to go back there.

723
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:41,510
I didn't get to see the sunset there...

724
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,970
Do you want me to come with you, Eun Ho?

725
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,510
Damn it, no!

726
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,970
Hyun Oh, want me to come with you?

727
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:55,620
No, I'd hate that. Not today.

728
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:58,320
Eun Ho, I'll come with you-

729
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,290
Hey, pick up your phone. It's so loud.

730
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:06,260
No! I can't pick up this call! Not ever!

731
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:17,510
I want to go to the Hill of Pinwheels with you!

732
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:21,100
[Quiz King]

733
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,340
Participant Yoo Hee Jeong, please choose.

734
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,660
Tree or flower?

735
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,970
I choose flower.

736
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,260
You chose quickly.

737
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,480
I'm not the indecisive type.

738
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,100
Will you not regret this?

739
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,920
No. I do my best not to regret any decision.

740
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,480
Then, I hope you don't regret this one, either.

741
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:52,900
Participant Yoo Hee Jeong has chosen "flower."

742
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,360
Sunbae.

743
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,970
Can we talk for a second?

744
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,950
I don't know. I'm a little tired today.

745
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:13,710
But still, I'd like to...

746
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,070
What do you want to say?

747
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:32,980
Your wish was for something to happen, right?

748
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,550
Is that what you wanted to say?

749
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:44,380
What was it?

750
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:47,500
Paper cup? Something like that.

751
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:49,640
Yeah.

752
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,500
Paper cups hanging from the office ceiling.

753
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,270
Right.

754
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:58,920
And the world ending.

755
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,250
Yes.

756
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,290
For the world to just end.

757
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,720
And?

758
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,460
And what if...

759
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:17,840
I disappeared? What would it be like for you?

760
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,730
If you disappeared?

761
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:29,230
What would it be like for me?

762
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,380
I'm not sure.

763
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:43,790
So, it doesn't really matter to you, Sunbae,

764
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,960
whether I'm here or not?

765
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,160
Yeah.

766
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:55,430
I don't think it would be that much different.

767
00:54:58,270 --> 00:54:59,780
I see.

768
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,820
Why do you ask?

769
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:07,810
Nothing, Sunbae.

770
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,960
I'll head out.

771
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,240
Thanks for your time.

772
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:16,350
Bye.

773
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,320
Hello, hello.

774
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,610
Hello, hello.

775
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,230
Sunbae.

776
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,770
You look like you're in a good mood.

777
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:23,900
Of course, Sunbae. I've been waiting for today.

778
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,220
Hello. I'm Producer Yoo Seong Ha.

779
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,050
Hello, I'm Ju Eun Ho. Looking forward to working with you.

780
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,050
Why don't you have a seat?

781
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,640
Should I?

782
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,380
Hey, Ju Eun Ho.

783
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,600
Nothing.

784
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,010
Get ready.

785
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:41,300
Okay.

786
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,270
Hey, Ju Eun Ho.

787
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,550
What, Sunbae?

788
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,970
You better be successful.

789
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:18,360
I'm going to. I will, for sure. I'm confident.

790
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:22,160
All right. Good, then.

791
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:27,510
But Sunbae, why are you bringing that up?

792
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:31,360
If you're successful,

793
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:34,240
that makes me happy.

794
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,990
Satisfied?

795
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,510
The drug cartel that smuggled methamphetamines from overseas

796
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,370
were caught by police.

797
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:00,910
The Seoul Police Narcotics Unit...

798
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,200
Looking pretty good.

799
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,130
Aigoo, hello.

800
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,620
One minute to go.

801
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:23,430
Hello, viewers. This is the Monday 7 o'clock news.

802
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:27,210
The drug cartel that smuggled methamphetamines from overseas

803
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,130
were caught by police.

804
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:33,140
The Seoul Police Narcotics Unit has arrested

805
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:37,650
25 people for trading and using drugs...

806
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:41,890
That's it for today. Thank you for watching.

807
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:47,610
Thank you!

808
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:48,830
Good work.

809
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:51,250
Good work.

810
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,390
Good work.

811
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:01,680
Hey, Ju Eun Ho. Nice job.

812
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:07,890
I have good news and bad news.

813
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:09,720
Which do you want to hear first?

814
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,430
Either one. Everything is good news to me right now.

815
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:14,860
What is it?

816
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:18,170
Fine, then. The good news first.

817
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:20,740
Press Director Soh wants to go out for dinner.

818
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,350
Darn it, dinner? Out of nowhere?

819
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,420
No, I can't. I have plans.

820
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:28,880
Next.

821
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,270
The bad news...

822
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,860
He wants you to prepare for an audition.

823
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,380
For the new programming for 7 o'clock.

824
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:17,740
Jung Hyun Oh, it's now. Right now.

825
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:19,910
What is?

826
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:23,870
Press Director Soh wants me to prepare for an audition for the 7 o'clock.

827
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:24,990
Why is that now?

828
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:29,060
That's why we need to leave for the Hill of Pinwheel right now.

829
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,190
Damn it. You won't go?

830
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,780
Are you guys going by yourselves?

831
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:42,450
Can I come with you guys?

832
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:46,510
Damn it. Why are you under my desk?

833
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:55,510
I threw away my phone, but it's still ringing.

834
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,470
But you guys, isn't it scary?

835
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:07,040
How can a phone keep ringing?

836
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,370
I threw it out,
[Donut shop owner]

837
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,780
I put it there-

838
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:15,800
Hello? Go ahead.

839
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,750
What's this about?

840
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,890
No, I'm listening.

841
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:23,860
Right now?

842
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,500
Got it.

843
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,890
What the heck!

844
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,840
It's the donut shop owner's son. He wants to see you.

845
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:38,270
B2, in front of area A11. Go meet him.

846
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:41,370
No, I can't. I-I-I-can't go.

847
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:44,990
You should go. Hyun Oh, we should go, too.

848
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:48,130
Let's hurry so we can catch the sunset.

849
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:52,120
You will go with me, won't you?

850
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,540
Jung Hyun Oh, can you please save me?

851
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,710
Can you help me, Hyun Oh? I can't go.

852
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,970
I think he's going to do something to me.

853
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:07,210
But Hyun Oh, you're a star. If he sees you, he might forgive me.

854
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:13,340
I don't know. Would he really?

855
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:17,220
I am a star but not the face of PPS.

856
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,440
No, no, you're the face.

857
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,400
Instead of the logo on top of our building,

858
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,750
I think you should be on it because you're the face of PPS.

859
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:34,080
So, I was wondering, can you go in my place, the face of PPS, Hyun Oh?

860
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,010
You never know. If you go, he might forgive me.

861
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:40,450
Hey, I had him first. Get in line!

862
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:44,750
Hyun Oh, I'm so scared.

863
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:48,200
- Hey! Get in line, I said!
- I don't want to.

864
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,040
One second.

865
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,790
One second.

866
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:58,010
So, I just need to go and listen to him, right?

867
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,700
Yes! That's right!

868
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,420
Daebak.

869
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,880
Hey, Jung Hyun Oh. Did you just choose Jeon Jae Yong over me?

870
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,520
No. Eun Ho, I choose you.

871
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,240
Go ahead to the Hill of Pinwheels. I'll be right behind you.

872
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:21,560
Oh, yay! I'll go change.

873
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,150
Eun Ho!

874
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:32,770
Hyun Oh, thank you so much. I think I'm in love with you.

875
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:35,040
Stop! It's okay. No thanks.

876
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,090
I'm not interested in boy love.

877
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:39,190
This is very unpleasant. Please let me go.

878
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,880
No, I don't want to. Also, boy love?

879
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,120
Want to do that with me?

880
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:54,560
Wow.

881
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,960
Hey, Eun Ho.

882
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,820
Hyun Oh, the sunset is so pretty.

883
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:51,580
Is the sunset already-

884
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:54,100
No, I'll be right there.

885
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,120
I'll be right there. Of course.

886
01:04:57,890 --> 01:04:59,110
Yeah.

887
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,370
I mean-

888
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:11,710
Hello?

889
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,330
Hello?

890
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:19,020
Jung Hyun Oh, why aren't you saying anything?

891
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,530
Hyun Oh.

892
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:24,860
Hello?

893
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:27,840
Hyun Oh!

894
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,930
[Eun Ho]

895
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:35,160
Damn it. You...

896
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:40,110
I came here to kill you.

897
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:43,400
And you're really dead.

898
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,790
Hyun-

899
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:12,930
[Dear Hyeri]

900
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:17,490
So, you never had another personality again?

901
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:21,370
No. Hye Ri never came back.

902
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:24,610
Then, the emotional issues you had, Eun Ho...

903
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:29,370
The emotional issues that caused your Dissociative Identity Disorder

904
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:31,580
has been resolved.

905
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,370
But Eun Ho,

906
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:39,220
if you face those emotional issues again,

907
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:44,080
there is a chance you will meet Hye Ri again.

908
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:47,270
But Doctor.

909
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,490
If I saw Hye Ri again,

910
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:56,910
I think I'd be happy to see her.
