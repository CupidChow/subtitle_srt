1
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,870
His Majesty's passion

2
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,729
won't be extinguished so easily.

3
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,070
The human heart is the hardest to fathom.

4
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,630
His Majesty has pampered Consort Ling for so long.

5
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,510
He's just furious for the time being

6
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,750
but once calm, he might think of her again.

7
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,880
Then we busied ourselves for nothing.

8
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,790
Look at you.

9
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,800
So foolish that it's adorable.

10
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,950
One ant hole may cause the collapse of a thousand zhang dike,

11
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,150
A hundred feet room can be burned down with just a lighting of fire.

12
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,990
Nothing can be down overnight.

13
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:40,390
His Majesty has been sleeping at Hall of Mental Cultivation lately.

14
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,320
Tell me about it.

15
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,630
His Majesty was so angry last time

16
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,270
after coming back from Palace of Eternal Spring.

17
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,150
Since…

18
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,230
Since then,

19
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,829
he hasn’t gone to Palace of Eternal Spring again.

20
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:52,990
It's been so many days,

21
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,910
His Majesty is still angry.

22
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,470
That day at Palace of Eternal Spring…

23
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,110
Hailancha, follow me.

24
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,630
Yes.

25
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,350
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

26
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,870
Your Majesty!

27
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,270
Forward!

28
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,430
Back. Back. Back!

29
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,670
Erqing confessed her affair with Your Majesty

30
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,550
on the day that the late Empress passed away.

31
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,590
It’s the reason that caused the Empress

32
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,930
lost her hope and killed herself.

33
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,550
So, she must die!

34
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,910
Lost her hope and killed herself.

35
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,770
Lost her hope and killed herself.

36
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,790
Your Majesty.

37
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,590
Your Majesty!

38
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,070
Follow up!

39
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,190
Your Majesty!

40
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,770
You only rode the horse

41
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,270
and didn’t say anything.

42
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,430
I am not as smart as Fuheng,

43
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,370
I can’t figure out what you are thinking.

44
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,350
Hailancha.

45
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,950
I made a mistake.

46
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,830
I owe a person.

47
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,230
Your Majesty,

48
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,150
everyone makes mistakes.

49
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,630
Why are you so hard on yourself?

50
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,550
No.

51
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,590
This is a mistake

52
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,350
I can never make up for.

53
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,070
Your Majesty,

54
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,800
we can't go back to the past.

55
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,470
If it’s a mistake can’t be made up for,

56
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,600
then you should try to forget about it.

57
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,550
No.

58
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,850
You don't understand.

59
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,230
Rongyin

60
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,470
became my legal wife at the age of fifteen.

61
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,590
Yet I just left her wither away

62
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,550
in the Forbidden City like a flower in blossom.

63
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,310
Your Majesty.

64
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,040
You're shouldering

65
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,670
the hopes of all people of Great Qing.

66
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,190
How can you have the time and energy

67
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,150
to nurture the harem’s feelings.

68
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,310
As Your Majesty's consorts,

69
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,470
they must learn to make themselves happy,

70
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,390
or else they will live in misery,

71
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,990
but that isn't Your Majesty's fault.

72
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,710
But she wasn't just any woman,

73
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,910
she was my first wife.

74
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,590
We vowed to be together for the rest of our lives.

75
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,470
But she bailed

76
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,470
halfway.

77
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,350
Before Consort Ling questioned me,

78
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:39,550
I had been very disappointed by Rongyin's sentiment.

79
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,790
She was a perfect wife.

80
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,790
But she wasn't a competent Empress.

81
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:50,070
Her shoulders were just too weak.

82
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,760
The Empress' phoenix crown

83
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,670
made her unable to breathe.

84
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,470
Her death

85
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,030
was perhaps the best relief for her.

86
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,430
But to me,

87
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,470
it's a scandal I must cover.

88
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,030
Now I see

89
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,920
that it’s not her who was too sentimental,

90
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,110
it’s me who was too ruthless.

91
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,830
Go ahead.

92
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,390
Stop.

93
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,080
Give me your tag.

94
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,790
I am a eunuch from Imperial Hospital.

95
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,190
I was ordered to dispose of old medicines.

96
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,030
Open it.

97
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:48,909
Yes.

98
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,590
These are all medicines damaged by insects.

99
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,710
We were supposed to throw them all away.

100
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,310
But Imperial Doctors don’t want to waste them.

101
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,470
So they asked me to deliver all these

102
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,310
to Chongwen Gate to sell at a discount

103
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,070
and use the money we make on daily expenditures of the Imperial Hospital.

104
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,670
Officer, it’ll be sunset soon,

105
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,190
I am in a rush to leave the palace.

106
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,870
Please allow me to pass.

107
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,310
Greetings to Your Majesty.

108
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,030
Hailancha, go check

109
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,230
what’s in the sack.

110
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,870
Your Majesty,

111
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,520
it's perfectly fine caterpillar fungus.

112
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,110
How dare you

113
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,830
mix the precious caterpillar fungus in here.

114
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,490
Your Majesty, don’t be angry!

115
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,870
I deserve to die.

116
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,770
Who are you transporting out the medicines for?

117
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,510
It’s Doctor Ye. Ye Tianshi!

118
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,230
Go investigate the Imperial Hospital!

119
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,960
I’ll see the so-called insects

120
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,390
are people or ghosts!

121
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,170
Good fortunes for Your Highness!

122
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,090
Good fortunes for Your Highness!

123
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,110
This is?

124
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,630
This is a parrot Lord Syge

125
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,750
brought for you for entertainment.

126
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,390
It was trained for a long time

127
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,920
just to learn this one line.

128
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,870
This cousin of mine is always a yes-man.

129
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,990
He’s even worried the leaf from the tree

130
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,920
would fall on his head and hurt him.

131
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,870
Can’t believe such a person

132
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,830
has learned to kiss ass!

133
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,110
After the Silkworm Ceremony,

134
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,550
your father's elder brother, Lord Rodo,

135
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,870
came to visit as well,

136
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,510
hoping Your Highness can help him with promotion.

137
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,110
This is all understandable.

138
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,190
This is from Prince He.

139
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,270
Prince He? How?

140
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,670
Such a precious parrot

141
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,310
can only be afforded by the most knowledgeable bird expert,

142
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,350
the most absurd prince

143
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,030
of the Asin Gioro clan

144
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,110
Your Highness, if Prince He wanted to gift you,

145
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,270
why wouldn’t he just give it to you directly?

146
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:22,950
Come.

147
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,030
Greetings to Your Highness the Empress.

148
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,750
What is it?

149
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,090
Your Highness,

150
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,150
Guard Suolun just brought a group of people,

151
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,880
angrily marching toward the Imperial Hospital.

152
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,190
I was worried something might happen,

153
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,670
so I rushed here to report.

154
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,630
Imperial Guards are all young and strong with good control of the sword.

155
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,910
If they frighten the Imperial Doctors,

156
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,310
who would dare to treat illness and save people in the future?

157
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,840
Your Highness, so you mean…

158
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,150
You're the head eunuch of Imperial Household Department.

159
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,590
Whatever happen in the Forbidden City

160
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,120
should be at your disposal.

161
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,510
I obey Your Highness' will.

162
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,510
I take my leave.

163
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,610
Your Highness,

164
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,390
the people in the palace sure know how to read which way the wind is turning.

165
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,590
After Silkworm Ceremony,

166
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,550
even Chamberlain Wu becomes more obedient.

167
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,710
He's not someone I promoted after all.

168
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,230
I don’t quite trust him.

169
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,230
Three bowls of water boiled down to half a bowl.

170
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,070
Once a day, for half a month.

171
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,870
Guard Suolun.

172
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:34,750
What…

173
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,110
What happened?

174
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,670
Take him!

175
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,070
What? What’s going on?

176
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,270
What did I do?

177
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,590
What are you doing?

178
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,150
We'll find out very soon whether you have committed a crime.

179
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,710
Search.

180
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,630
Wait.

181
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,800
What are you searching for?

182
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,630
Officer Suolun,

183
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,870
what's going on?

184
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,390
Those herbs are very precious. Don't touch them,

185
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:06,990
Officer Suolun!

186
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,470
We found one bunch of insect-damaged medicines in the backyard

187
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,550
and nothing else.

188
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,870
So it’s because of that bunch of medicines?

189
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,960
Officer Suolun,

190
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,350
those herbs were all damaged by insects.

191
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,870
The people in the palace are all nobles,

192
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,870
Who would use those damaged medicines?

193
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,150
I had someone take them out

194
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,470
with good intention.

195
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,310
How did it become such a fuss?

196
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,230
Doctor Ye, of course I trust you.

197
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,070
But someone mixed in

198
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,670
precious caterpillar fungus into it on purpose.

199
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,630
This is a theft of palace medicines.

200
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,630
Not a small crime.

201
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,990
Caterpillar fungus?

202
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,390
Why didn't I see it?

203
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,870
Well, officer Suolun!

204
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,830
Officer Suolun!

205
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,230
Officer Suolun!

206
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,040
Chamberlain Wu!

207
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,150
What are you doing here?

208
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,150
Imperial Household Department is in charge of the palace matters.

209
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,910
And the one who’s involved in the medicine transport was a eunuch.

210
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,110
As the supervisor, I can't just turn a blind eye.

211
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,250
We've already searched here.

212
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,950
You have searched,

213
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,710
but I haven't.

214
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,950
You mean,

215
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,150
you don't trust Imperial Bodyguards?

216
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,110
Oh, I don't dare.

217
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,710
But Imperial Bodyguards and His Majesty

218
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,630
mainly manage those upright matters,

219
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,070
you won’t be able to figure out

220
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,390
the tricky things in the palace.

221
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,190
Servants,

222
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,110
Search the entire place.

223
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,510
Including the doctors’ office.

224
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,630
Since precious medicines got out,

225
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,790
we need to examine the ledger

226
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,030
with the medicines in and out in the last year.

227
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,590
Open your eyes and look closely.

228
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,630
No any penny should be missed! Hurry!

229
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,470
Yes.

230
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,830
What is with the sighing?

231
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,250
Since the incident at Palace of Eternal Spring,

232
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,110
His Majesty hasn't come to our Palace.

233
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,350
It's all my fault.

234
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,870
If I were too impulsive back then…

235
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,350
You were so decisive,

236
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,170
and now you changed your mind?

237
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,960
Of course I don't regret it,

238
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,440
but I'm afraid you might regret it.

239
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,390
In the past, no matter how busy His Majesty was,

240
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,030
he'd come and see you.

241
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,790
But now…

242
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,230
Since you can’t change it,

243
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,830
then don't regret over something that has happened.

244
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,830
Waste of time.

245
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,510
Yingluo.

246
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,590
Maybe you should apologize to His Majesty.

247
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,200
His Majesty is still angry with me.

248
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,950
If I go apologize now,

249
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,270
I’ll be kicked out

250
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,130
from Hall of Mental Cultivation.

251
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,830
Why bother to look for that kind of humiliation?

252
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,110
But we can't just wait.

253
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,050
I'm just not going.

254
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,790
If you really don't care,

255
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,170
then why did you draw the branch crooked?

256
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,630
I'm drawing a willow tree.

257
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,710
Unbelievable!

258
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,890
Take them away.

259
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,190
Your Majesty,

260
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,950
I know your appetite isn't good,

261
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,830
so

262
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,670
all the dishes are cooked by vegetables.

263
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,520
Like this mushroom stewed with cabbage, honey cake,

264
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,910
fruit congee and Egg soup. All very mild.

265
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,750
Your Majesty.

266
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,030
If you don’t like any of them,

267
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,350
try this preserved egg with candied mushroom.

268
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,030
It’s tasty and tender.

269
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,110
Or,

270
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,430
at least eat some fine noodles.

271
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,750
Otherwise, I’ll be worried.

272
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,830
The dishes were cooked by Zhang Dongguan, weren’t they?

273
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,490
Your Majesty, did you forget?

274
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,710
Zhang Dongguan was sent to Palace of Everlasting Joy.

275
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,270
No wonder I don’t like the dishes.

276
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,590
Your Majesty is indeed right.

277
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,390
Chef Zhang’s Suzhou cuisine

278
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,110
is top-notch!

279
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,640
Especially that Suzhou meat dish.

280
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,190
That delicious broth and that lingering sweetness.

281
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,990
No one is his match in the palace.

282
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,950
Your Majesty, if you’d like,

283
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,970
maybe we can go to Palace of Everlasting Joy?

284
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,990
Who said I am going to Palace of Everlasting Joy?

285
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,510
She poisoned the wife of a duke of the first rank in the palace.

286
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,840
She doesn’t care about my opinions at all!

287
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,750
And she doesn’t even feel sorry.

288
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,590
A woman like her…

289
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,110
Your Majesty, please don’t be angry!

290
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,030
So because Consort Ling is arrogant,

291
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,110
you shouldn’t leave

292
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,030
Chef Zhang to her.

293
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,110
But Consort Ling has a weird temper,

294
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,150
we really don’t know how to serve her,

295
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,410
so it’s hard for us to get Chef Zhang back.

296
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,750
How dare you to slander Consort Ling?

297
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,990
I deserve to die. Deserve to die.

298
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,470
Your Majesty,

299
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,589
so are you going to Palace of Everlasting Joy or not?

300
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,230
I'm going!

301
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,750
Why should I leave the best chef

302
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,589
to her?

303
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,750
Reporting to Your Majesty.

304
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,230
Her Highness the Empress says she has an urgent matter.

305
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,350
She's asked you to come to Palace of Receiving Celestial Favor.

306
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:30,990
Well…

307
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,510
Wu Shulai,

308
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,030
tell everything you found out to His Majesty.

309
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,670
Go on.

310
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,190
I want to know as well

311
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,390
how Imperial Hospital's embezzlement is linked to Consort Ling?

312
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,190
Your Majesty,

313
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,590
I checked through the medicine ledgers of the last whole year.

314
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,390
Ye Tianshi has been checking Consort Ling's

315
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,510
wellness pulse all along.

316
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,750
And he's prescribed tonic to restore her body.

317
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,630
I compared the ledger

318
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,750
with the medicine used.

319
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,190
Not only ginseng and wolfberry were used in large amounts,

320
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,350
but also…

321
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,710
Continue.

322
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,670
Consort Ling

323
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,650
has been taking contraception soup.

324
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,390
Your Majesty, Consort Ling receives royal favor.

325
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,630
She shouldn’t have done this in theory.

326
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,710
I think

327
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,040
she may have her reason.

328
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,510
Your Majesty, don’t be angry.

329
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,870
Let’s find out the truth.

330
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,470
Don’t scare her.

331
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,510
Greetings to Your Majesty.

332
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,040
Get lost!

333
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,870
Your Majesty.

334
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,630
What’s really in the tonic

335
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,880
you’ve been taking?

336
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,350
Judging from your face,

337
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,730
you're acknowledging it.

338
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,510
Why?

339
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,990
Your Majesty.

340
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,390
About this…

341
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,310
I am asking. Why?

342
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,590
You won’t say?

343
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,010
I’ll say it for you.

344
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,110
Since you were at the Summer Palace,

345
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,310
you’ve decided to

346
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,070
get rid of Noble Consort Chun

347
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,470
to avenge Rongyin,

348
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,470
is that correct?

349
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,230
Yes.

350
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,250
You tried your best to win Empress Dowager's favor,

351
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,560
but actually you were targeting at me,

352
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,310
right?

353
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,190
Yes.

354
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,800
You kept your distance,

355
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,160
but didn’t reject me entirely,

356
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,750
so that you could catch my full attention.

357
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:40,950
No.

358
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,850
You tried to clear your obstacles

359
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,560
to earn the right to compete with Noble Consort Chun.

360
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,560
Is that correct?

361
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,270
Yes.

362
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,190
As you wished.

363
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,870
Su Jinghao is dead.

364
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,950
You don’t need to

365
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,430
use me anymore.

366
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,070
So you've gone cold completely.

367
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,790
Right?

368
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,710
Say it!

369
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,430
Is that correct?

370
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,930
Since Your Majesty knows it already,

371
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,070
why bother ask?

372
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,910
I want to hear you say it personally.

373
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,390
Yes.

374
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,150
Your Majesty is right.

375
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,910
I wanted to avenge the late Empress,

376
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,950
so I became your consort.

377
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,310
In order to ruin Noble Consort Chun,

378
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,910
I did my best to win your heart.

379
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,790
Since I've taken my revenge now,

380
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,630
Your Majesty

381
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,310
holds no value to me anymore.

382
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,230
I of course don't need to continue to fawn on you.

383
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,030
Since you don’t need me anymore,

384
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,310
why did you make the mink fur hat for me?

385
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,430
I feel guilty!

386
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,230
What did you say?

387
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,240
Because Your Majesty treated me too well,

388
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,230
so well that I felt guilty.

389
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,030
But you still keep taking the contraception soup.

390
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,710
Because I mean

391
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,830
nothing to you.

392
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,390
I’m just a pawn

393
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,280
that’s been used by you.

394
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,080
Do you feel you are mistreated, Your Majesty?

395
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,070
The late Empress was mistreated even more.

396
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,710
Wei Yingluo.

397
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,920
What do you want to say exactly?

398
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,470
Pain. Once it starts, it's forever.

399
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,550
Side by side, but unaware

400
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,710
the parting of death that is grief above all grief.

401
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,630
Compliance to lose yourself.

402
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,150
Your Majesty personally made a poem of grief for her.

403
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,070
The poem is so sincere and touching.

404
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,470
The world will only know

405
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,440
Your Majesty's devotion to the late Empress.

406
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,430
But no one knows

407
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,030
how she died.

408
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,830
Stop talking!

409
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,630
Your Majesty has done it.

410
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,630
Why don’t you dare to hear it?

411
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,670
There are so many women in the world.

412
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,910
Why did you favor Hitara Erqing?

413
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,390
She was the late Empress's sister-in-law.

414
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,830
New Year's Eve.

415
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,960
Her Highness the Empress suffered the pain of losing her child,

416
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,590
and received such grave humiliation.

417
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:30,710
it was a situation that’s simply intolerable!

418
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,390
You finally spoke your true mind.

419
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,720
Am I really a despicable person

420
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,150
who takes advantage of his subject’s wife and forgets loyalty over a woman

421
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,230
in your eyes?

422
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,710
Your Majesty really doesn’t feel guilty about it?

423
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,310
I don’t!

424
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,590
Right or wrong,

425
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,650
Your Majesty should know better.

426
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,600
When the Empress was alive,

427
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,070
Your Majesty used her.

428
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,910
After the Empress died,

429
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,950
you still wouldn't let her go.

430
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,440
Thirteenth year in Qianlong's reign.

431
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,630
Imperial Hanlin Academy, Ministry of Rites and Imperial Clan Court

432
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,390
all suffered heavy rebukes

433
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,870
over the late Empress' funeral.

434
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,990
Fifty-three officials in

435
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,390
Liangjiang, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hubei and Hunan

436
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,030
were severely punished because they didn’t report

437
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,990
they came to the capital to attend the funeral.

438
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,310
Many Eight Banners relatives in Shengjing, Ningxia and Hangzhou

439
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,190
were punished by hair-shaving, death sentence or removing from their posts

440
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:06,250
because they violated against the national mourning.

441
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,990
Your Majesty went on a slaughter campaign.

442
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,560
Other than your guilt toward the Empress,

443
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:16,790
you really didn’t use it as a pretext to fulfill your political purpose?

444
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,430
These words must have been hidden in your heart for so long.

445
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,190
Yes.

446
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,150
I have always wanted to seek an answer from you

447
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,430
for the late Empress.

448
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,230
When I ascended to the throne,

449
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,070
I obliged public sentiment

450
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,310
and ruled with leniency,

451
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:44,750
so as to pacify the wounds brought upon by the late Emperor's harshness,

452
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:48,910
make the officials content with their duties,

453
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,110
and have people live a peaceful life.

454
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,350
Thirteen years passed,

455
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,790
the officials all get used to relying on my leniency,

456
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,390
each and every holding sinecure

457
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,840
and ignoring their duties.

458
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,670
I needed a sword

459
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,630
to show my authority and purge officialdom.

460
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,110
And the late Empress

461
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,030
was my sword.

462
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,430
Your Majesty.

463
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,750
Fuca Rongyin lived

464
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,030
as Great Qing's Empress.

465
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,270
Even in death,

466
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,950
I put her to her last use.

467
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,710
You are really too heartless.

468
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,870
Wei Yingluo.

469
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,030
I treated you so well

470
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,890
that you forget one important matter

471
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,870
that I am an Emperor.

472
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,610
Emperors are usually heartless.

473
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,150
I can allow no one to challenge my authority.

474
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,030
Since you entered the palace, you’ve belonged to me,

475
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,830
no matter you are willing or not.

476
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,880
You will be confined to the Forbidden City

477
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,350
for your entire life.

478
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,550
Until you get old.

479
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,510
Until you are dead.

480
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,550
By the way,

481
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,280
You needn't take

482
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,610
the medicine anymore.

483
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,310
You won’t need it again.

484
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,230
Yingluo, Chamberlain Li just told me,

485
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,230
there was medicine theft in the palace.

486
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,230
Imperial Hospital was searched thoroughly.

487
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,890
Doctor Ye has been jailed too.

488
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,470
Can you tell me

489
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,190
what happened exactly?

490
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,720
What did you say?

491
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,590
His Majesty arrested Doctor Ye.

492
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,570
He committed a mistake. Why is it related to you?

493
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,950
Yingluo. Tell me!

494
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,490
I have been taking contraceptive medicine.

495
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,170
His Majesty found out.

496
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,030
Are you crazy?

497
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,870
All the consorts of the palace

498
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,730
wish to give birth to a royal heir.

499
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,510
Why are you still standing there?

500
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,110
Go and beg His Majesty!

501
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,360
Tell him you were confused.

502
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,550
Tell him…

503
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,190
I don’t know what you should say.

504
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,040
But just go and beg His Majesty!

505
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,110
Come on!

506
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,590
Mingyu.

507
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,070
It's too late.

508
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,950
His Majesty favors you so much.

509
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,230
It’s not too late.

510
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,910
I told His Majesty

511
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,590
about my revenge.

512
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,910
Yingluo.

513
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,590
How can you say such a thing?

514
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,870
I couldn’t help.

515
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,390
This is all you’ve got to say?

516
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,170
I’ve always had a question in my head.

517
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,110
I just wanted an answer.

518
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,640
Since I’ve opened my mouth,

519
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,270
why not ask all the way?

520
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,910
Now you're happy?

521
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:00,110
Then, did His Majesty say how he will punish you?

522
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,240
I think this Palace of Everlasting Joy

523
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,350
will become a true cold palace from now on.

524
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,790
Your Majesty.

525
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,350
I am very tired.

526
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,590
I want to be alone.

527
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,110
Yes.

528
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:24,270
Your Majesty, why are you standing alone here?

529
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,510
Empress.

530
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,390
Empress.

531
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,240
Have you ever blamed me?

532
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,030
Why are you asking?

533
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,430
Be honest to me.

534
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,750
I have.

535
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,990
Then,

536
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,850
have you ever hated me?

537
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:13,030
I’ve blamed you and complained about you,

538
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,870
but I’ve never hated you.

539
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,230
Why?

540
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,310
If Rongyin were still alive,

541
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,590
she would hate me for sure.

542
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,190
Your Majesty is the owner of Great Qing.

543
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,110
The Empress is the master of the Imperial Harem.

544
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,710
Emperor and Empress are never a common couple.

545
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,070
If they spend all day indulged in

546
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,790
sentiments and love,

547
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,239
it would court the laughter of others.

548
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,489
Your Majesty, forgive me.

549
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,679
I wasn't blaming the late Empress.

550
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,590
It's just that everyone should have self-awareness.

551
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,350
I received Your Majesty's grace

552
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,430
and thus I must manage the family for you well.

553
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,030
If not, I would be ashamed to see you.

554
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,250
How could I blame or complain.

555
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,550
But Consort Ling said

556
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,830
that I’m ruthless.

557
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,830
Your Majesty did nothing wrong

558
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,110
with the country, the justice and the righteousness.

559
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,790
Your Majesty toils day and night to manage state affairs.

560
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,470
You can't even manage to take care of your royal body.

561
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,200
The establishment and the existence of the harem

562
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,680
are for taking care of Your Majesty and producing heirs.

563
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,590
not bring troubles to you.

564
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,070
Others say the palace is lonely.

565
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,430
But does it mean one can do as they wish

566
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,070
if leaving the palace?

567
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,730
In every fields and industry,

568
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,110
men are busy with work

569
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,910
and women are busy with housework, working hard day and night.

570
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,110
Compared to them,

571
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,650
the consorts shouldn’t complain at all.

572
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,750
The late Empress was the example to the harem,

573
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,070
but she acted unfilial to her parents with her self-inflicted death.

574
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,710
With all due respect,

575
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,750
you owe nothing to Empress Xiaoxian.

576
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,110
It was she who disappointed your trust.

577
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,590
I know,

578
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,870
Rongyin

579
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,650
didn’t like to be restrained.

580
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,040
Everybody longs for

581
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,110
freedom.

582
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,680
Your Majesty, you are the ruler of all,

583
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,590
the one with most authority,

584
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,520
but you don't have a day of freedom.

585
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,710
Real freedom is paid with irresponsibility.

586
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,470
Your Majesty, Consort Ling can hate you.

587
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,530
Late Empress could blame you.

588
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,950
But I won’t.

589
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,070
Even if

590
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,550
I caused Lord Naerbu's death?

591
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,010
For my father's incident,

592
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,750
I did blame you.

593
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,570
But I felt so sorry after I calmed myself.

594
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,110
Even if everyone in the world hurts your feelings,

595
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,710
I am your Empress,

596
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,950
I won’t hurt you.

597
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,350
Otherwise,

598
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:40,000
I would be no difference from the late Empress and Consort Ling.

599
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,950
Empress.

600
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,390
No one has ever said these words to me.

601
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,790
You're the first.

602
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,040
Your Majesty, even if everyone misunderstands you,

603
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,390
I will always stand by your side.

604
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,830
Understand and support you.

605
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,310
You are the lofty son of heaven.

606
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,110
No one has right to criticize you.

607
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,190
Starting today,

608
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,710
you can all leave.

609
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,110
Master, you…

610
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,150
Where do you want us to go?

611
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,390
Go to Imperial Household Department

612
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,990
and ask Chamberlain Wu to assign you new tasks.

613
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,470
My palace

614
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,190
will never need servants again.

615
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,630
Master,

616
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,630
don’t say that.

617
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,190
Such a big palace,

618
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,790
of course you need servants.

619
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,710
From now on,

620
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,120
His Majesty will never come again.

621
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,390
Don't doubt my words.

622
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,390
My palace

623
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,010
can’t offer you protection anymore.

624
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,470
If you want to go,

625
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,510
just leave now.

626
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:03,670
Master.

627
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,870
but every palace

628
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,470
has a set number of servants.

629
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,110
I’ve said that I don’t need them.

630
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,950
None of them.

631
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,760
If you don't leave, you will remain

632
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,400
and suffer with the Master.

633
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,870
Your Highness,

634
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,040
I have the reputation of betraying my old Master.

635
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,710
Where can I go?

636
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:05,990
I think I’ll continue to serve you in the future.

637
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,450
You are quite down-to-earth.

638
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,070
Zhenzhu.

639
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:31,910
You can go.

640
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,470
No.

641
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,910
I will stay with Sister Mingyu

642
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,810
and continue to serve you.

643
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,990
There's laundry in the backyard.

644
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:42,670
No one's here anymore. I will go and hang them up.

645
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,910
I will go back to work too.

646
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,190
You come with me.

647
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,120
Your Highness the Empress, Consort Ling is here.

648
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,530
Greetings to Your Highness the Empress.

649
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,190
Consort Ling, how come you look

650
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,710
so pale today?

651
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,750
Your Highness,

652
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,360
I’ll be straight to you.

653
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,160
Everything has been

654
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,110
under your control, right?

655
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,440
Consort Ling is quite confused

656
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,550
to say such a peculiar thing.

657
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:02,110
Did I ask you to take contraceptive soup?

658
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,310
No.

659
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,840
Did I ask you to fight with Noble Consort Chun?

660
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,710
No.

661
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,990
Did I order you to kill Hitara Erqing?

662
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,550
No.

663
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,470
Everything was done willingly by me myself.

664
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,190
This whole time,

665
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,630
you’ve never asked me to do anything.

666
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,190
You kept your hands clean

667
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,030
and easily got rid of your sworn enemy Noble Consort Chun.

668
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,870
In the end, you gave me the final blow.

669
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,350
Consort Ling,

670
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,690
you are not sick. You've contracted hysteria instead.

671
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,350
I am getting more confused

672
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,430
by what you're saying.

673
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,350
Him.

674
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,910
Isn't he your most trusted supervisor?

675
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:49,790
No.

676
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,630
Starting today,

677
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,790
he will be Your Highness' most loyal dog!

678
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,150
Consort Ling. What do you mean?

679
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:01,230
I should have known much earlier

680
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,400
that it was just your first step

681
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,350
to send Hupo to me,

682
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,430
bringing about His Majesty's fury and suspicion.

683
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,870
Then by taking advantage of the medicine theft case,

684
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,590
you exposed that I have been taking contraceptive soup,

685
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,320
and revealed the reason why I entered the palace.

686
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,790
As proud as His Majesty,

687
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,750
no matter how I explain,

688
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,630
he wouldn’t forgive me whatsoever.

689
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,110
But, how did Your Highness find out

690
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,510
that I’ve been taking contraceptive soup.

691
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,470
Unless you’ve put a spy

692
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,590
by my side.

693
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:36,710
Yingluo,

694
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,230
you suspect I'm the spy?

695
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,870
Only you

696
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,150
and Doctor Ye knew

697
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,310
that I took contraceptive soup.

698
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,030
Mingyu is quick-tempered

699
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,150
and I was afraid she couldn't keep the secret.

700
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,950
So every time I took the medicine,

701
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,510
I evaded her.

702
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,310
Since the first day you entered Palace of Everlasting Joy,

703
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,240
I’ve let you take care of everything with full trust.

704
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,110
I never expected that

705
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,790
this is how you’ve repaid me.
