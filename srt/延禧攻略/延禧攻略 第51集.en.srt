1
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,440
Do you know what other relief centers did?

2
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,950
Either they exploited the local businessmen,

3
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,190
or used grassroots or bark as food materials instead.

4
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,270
And suppressed by their military force,

5
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,310
the victims dared not to say anything.

6
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,830
My father was the most foolish,

7
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,830
visiting wealthy locals one by one,

8
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,930
But he couldn't make threats,

9
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,990
so he reaped very little.

10
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,310
So he put up all his own assets,

11
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,270
even the fields and mansion Your Majesty granted him,

12
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,430
and he sold them all!

13
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,590
He even sold

14
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,760
the homestead in his hometown!

15
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,710
That was a homestead passed down generation to generation!

16
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,430
When the victims aired their grief,

17
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,070
my father wouldn't use military force.

18
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,160
He was afraid to harm those bare-handed victims.

19
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,710
But they almost beat him to death!

20
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,470
Because the victims’ violence angered the soldiers,

21
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:50,070
causing the casualty later.

22
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,110
It’s not that he is incompetent.

23
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,230
He couldn't bear it, he just couldn't.

24
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,430
I know.

25
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,310
Your Majesty.

26
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,120
I know you are in a difficult position,

27
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,640
so I don't dare to ask for forgiveness.

28
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,760
But on the account of his devotion,

29
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,470
please spare his life.

30
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,470
Your Majesty.

31
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,829
I have only begged you once in this life.

32
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,790
Spare him. Please!

33
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,070
Your Majesty.

34
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,310
I'm begging you.

35
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,030
Alright.

36
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,910
I

37
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,290
won't kill him.

38
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,990
Rise.

39
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,589
-Your Highness. - Empress.

40
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,120
-Your Highness. - Empress.

41
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,790
Prince He of the First Rank!

42
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,720
May I talk to you?

43
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,670
Your Highness! You are not recovered yet!

44
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,640
Don’t stand in the wind.

45
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,430
I know you have with you the royal decree

46
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,870
to go and spare my father.

47
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,790
Empress.

48
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,790
I’m useless.

49
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,670
I couldn't wash away Lord Naerbu's wrongful accusation.

50
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,310
No.

51
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,890
You have tried everything you can to look for evidence.

52
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,270
And you had many people offended because of my father’s incident.

53
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,930
I’ll remember your kindness.

54
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,550
It’s my pleasure to do something for you.

55
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,350
I need you to do me another favor.

56
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,630
Zhen'er.

57
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,470
This is?

58
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,710
My father will be exiled to Ningguta which is a bitter cold place.

59
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,710
I prepared clothing and medicine for him.

60
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,830
His leg is injured.

61
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,070
There will not be any good doctor on the way.

62
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,030
And he has no time to nurse the injury.

63
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,710
I just hope these medicines can come to use.

64
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,850
Empress, don’t worry.

65
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,230
I will surely bring these to him.

66
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,870
Is there anything else

67
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,600
you'd like to tell Lord Naerbu?

68
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,590
Tell him that I feel so sorry

69
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,370
that I can't send him off personally.

70
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,210
Please let him take good care!

71
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,750
Yes.

72
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,310
Your Highness, let's return.

73
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,550
Zhen'er.

74
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,310
Do you think the clothing we prepared for Father

75
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,510
will be thick enough?

76
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,290
Your Highness,

77
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,990
you prepared leather and fur for winter.

78
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,720
Of course they are thick enough

79
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,990
But Ningguta is really cold.

80
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,830
Very cold.

81
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,270
Open up.

82
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,110
Lord Naerbu.

83
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,510
Lord. His Majesty spared you from death

84
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,159
and changed it to exile.

85
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,970
Hurry and thank the grace!

86
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,430
Lord?

87
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,670
My decree was late.

88
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,210
I already sent an order

89
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,470
to prepare a good funeral.

90
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,930
If you want to arrange it personally,

91
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,550
I can agree to it too.

92
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,710
Did Your Majesty kill my father?

93
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,070
No.

94
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,650
Then it was Empress Dowager's doing.

95
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:48,950
Empress.

96
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,670
Your father

97
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,030
Committed suicide!

98
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,790
My father was loyal and foolish.

99
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,910
But he was a human and he cherished his life.

100
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,390
In order to live,

101
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,730
he once laid down his pride to come beg me.

102
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,790
Now he was clearly falsely accused.

103
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,790
why would he

104
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,670
commit suicide?

105
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,910
Empress,

106
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,510
he has already left.

107
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,910
There's no point in pursuing this.

108
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,030
Your Majesty.

109
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,549
My father was wronged and became

110
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,309
the most corrupted official in everyone's eyes.

111
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,390
In the prison, he committed suicide.

112
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,110
Should his daughter tolerate this

113
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,570
without saying anything?

114
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,350
You clearly knew that he wasn't corrupted

115
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,170
and used all he had to make up for the deficit.

116
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,710
In the end, he still needed to pay with his life.

117
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,030
He worked hard being a great leader

118
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,990
for more than twenty years.

119
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,490
In the end, he lost his reputation

120
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,310
and was cursed by everyone.

121
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,190
Is there still justice in this world?

122
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,630
Empress,

123
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,830
I know that you are very sad.

124
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,630
You can blame and hate me

125
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,110
but not Empress Dowager.

126
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,550
Your Majesty,

127
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,870
do you think that Empress Dowager is unselfish?

128
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,470
Empress.

129
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,150
No matter how sad you are,

130
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,560
you shouldn't be rude to Empress Dowager.

131
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,190
Empress Dowager’s nephew also participated in the corruption.

132
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,230
Before my father was arrested,

133
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,750
Empress Dowager's elder brother and his wife came to the palace to plead for clemency.

134
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,150
Once this is investigated,

135
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,990
it will implicate the family of Empress Dowager.

136
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,630
Hence, Empress Dowager, without any hesitation,

137
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,560
made my father a sacrificial lamb!

138
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,510
Are you done?

139
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,470
Your Highness, don't say anymore.

140
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,190
Will His Majesty dare listen to

141
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,670
what I’m going to say?

142
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,590
At this point,

143
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,830
what else wouldn’t I dare listen to?

144
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,710
Your Majesty.

145
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,240
The palace officials are mediocre, incompetent, greedy and cunning.

146
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,890
It's the same in the seemingly lovely harem.

147
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,550
Everyone's acting,

148
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,610
chanting out a tune of a world in prosper with justice and clarity,

149
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,390
and ganging up to lie to you and trick you.

150
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,470
Even if you are diligent and hard-working,

151
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,750
you still can't protect your subject who is falsely accused.

152
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,280
And you can't eliminate all those greedy corrupted officials.

153
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,070
Li Yu.

154
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,350
The Empress is sick.

155
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,810
Ask the Imperial Doctor to treat her.

156
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,510
Yes.

157
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,530
His Majesty doesn't dare to listen anymore?

158
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,350
Your Highness, I'm begging you. Stop talking!

159
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,270
Empress.

160
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,480
The world is far from being satisfactory.

161
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,370
You are overly-aggrieved today.

162
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,390
I can forgive you this time.

163
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,350
If you speak and do anything recklessly again,

164
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,750
I will not spare you.

165
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,320
Chamberlain Li,

166
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,670
the Empress isn't ill.

167
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,070
Nonsense.

168
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,350
The Empress contracted hysteria.

169
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,360
She's already started raving, how is she not ill?

170
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,950
But I took her pulse.

171
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,510
She's really very lucid.

172
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,390
If she were fine,

173
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,120
how would she contradict and offend His Majesty?

174
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,950
His Majesty feels guilty

175
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,110
so he pardoned her.

176
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,950
So I should treat it as hysteria?

177
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,390
Yes, do that!

178
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,890
Your Highness,

179
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,550
in order to investigate this case,

180
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,070
you haven't slept in days.

181
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,310
Now that It’s resolved,

182
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,610
you should go home and take a rest.

183
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,510
Resolved? Clearly they killed him because

184
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,410
they were afraid that the secret would be revealed.

185
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,630
The person is gone.

186
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,270
There’s no point to reinvestigate the case.

187
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,990
Your Highness should take care.

188
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,790
It was not your business in the first place anyway.

189
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,550
Zhen'er. What are you doing here?

190
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,360
Prince He of the First Rank.

191
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,950
I am…

192
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,630
I am heading to Imperial Household Department to retrieve something.

193
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,430
You are always tending closely to the Empress.

194
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,510
How come you were sent to run errands?

195
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,310
Prince He,

196
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,870
I really am going to Imperial Household Department

197
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,390
according to the Empress’s order.

198
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,650
Please let me through.

199
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,350
Prince. The palace gates will be locked soon.

200
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,710
Let's leave now.

201
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,310
Wait for me at Gate of Divine Prowess.

202
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,710
I still have things to do.

203
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,910
Your Highness? Your Highness?

204
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,430
Wait! Your Highness!

205
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,320
Prince, what are you doing?

206
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,170
What happened to the Empress?

207
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,310
Tell me!

208
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,150
You don’t have to pretend in front of me!

209
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,390
Prince He, Her Highness the Empress disappeared.

210
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,030
I’ve looked all over Palace of Receiving Celestial Favor and Imperial Garden.

211
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,510
But no sign of her!

212
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,350
I dare not tell others.

213
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,150
So I can only search alone.

214
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,870
Let's split and look for her.

215
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,230
We must find the Empress

216
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,730
before others notice.

217
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,590
Your Highness!

218
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,070
You're here.

219
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,410
What are you doing?

220
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,910
Come down now.

221
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,510
Do you think

222
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,750
I’d jump off from here?

223
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,950
Empress.

224
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,110
Come down now.

225
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,350
What are you trying to do?

226
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,870
I’ve spent the whole day here,

227
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,470
looking at the scenery afar.

228
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,520
Suddenly I wanted to know how Fuca Rongyin

229
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,470
felt when she stood up here that day.

230
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,350
So I came here to experience it.

231
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,070
Are you really crazy?

232
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,550
Fuca Rongyin and I

233
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,990
entered the mansion in succession.

234
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,470
She was the Primary Consort who was gentle and tender,

235
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,870
and I was the Secondary Consort who was prudent and cautious.

236
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,470
We had a lot in common,

237
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,190
but we were also so different.

238
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,110
We both

239
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,830
gave our true love to our husband.

240
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,990
But she jumped off from here,

241
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,350
while I became the Empress on high!

242
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,990
It was so long ago.

243
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,280
Why do you mention it again?

244
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,630
You're not Fuca Rongyin.

245
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,110
Yes, I am not Fuca Rongyin.

246
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,990
Because even if I stand here,

247
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,070
I never think of jumping off from here.

248
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,230
Do you know why?

249
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,350
Because I can’t accept it!

250
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,110
I thought I was in charge of the Imperial Harem.

251
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,870
I was the head of the country,

252
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,350
so I’d never be bullied by anybody,

253
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,430
and I’d never have to be cautious again! But I was wrong!

254
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,190
The then Consort Xian couldn't protect her mother and younger brother,

255
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,430
the current Empress still couldn't protect her father!

256
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,990
Because my power is too limited.

257
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,109
Too limited!

258
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,630
No. It’s not true!

259
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,510
It's because

260
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,610
you trust and admire His Majesty.

261
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,470
You want to be a good Empress.

262
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,870
Your Highness.

263
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,030
Please come down!

264
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,920
Your Highness the Empress.

265
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,510
My heart is straight toward my lord,

266
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,470
to the top of the clouds brushing away the blue sky.

267
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,790
It's time to return.

268
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,190
Empress.

269
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,510
If you need my help,

270
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,670
just let me know.

271
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,650
I want to do something for you.

272
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,880
Respectfully greeting Your Majesty.

273
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,190
How is the Empress?

274
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,230
Her highness was in deep sorrow upon losing her father

275
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,190
and accidentally offended Your Majesty.

276
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,990
She feels very sorry about that.

277
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,830
If she knows Your Majesty is here, she'll be so happy.

278
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,230
Allow me to inform her of your visit.

279
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,790
No need.

280
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,650
Take good care of the Empress.

281
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,640
Your Highness the Empress.

282
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,190
His Majesty didn't pursue your loss of composure.

283
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,920
Why are you still being so cold?

284
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,150
Don't worry.

285
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,190
His Majesty won't blame me.

286
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,750
Why?

287
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,950
Because he feels guilty.

288
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,070
Your Highness.

289
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,310
You think I really went mad?

290
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,970
Even if the entire world goes mad,

291
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,550
I will still be very lucid.

292
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,550
If I still acted like nothing happened

293
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,870
after losing my father.

294
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,270
Then do I still have a heart?

295
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,910
Your Highness, you mean..?

296
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,910
A disciplined person

297
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,150
can only win His Majesty’s heart

298
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,870
by occasional misconduct.

299
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,830
As long as His Majesty remembers my grievance

300
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,160
and my frustrated fury,

301
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,720
the entire Imperial Harem will remember too.

302
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,630
Empress,

303
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,120
His Majesty had Chamberlain Li send this.

304
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,510
Put it down.

305
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,170
Your Highness.

306
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,840
Emperor Chongzhen and Empress Zhou had a conflict once.

307
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,390
Empress Zhou went on a hunger strike and disobeyed.

308
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,590
So Emperor Chongzhen sent an old leather mattress to her.

309
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,470
The two thus reconciled.

310
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,830
Now His Majesty sent these old clothes to me

311
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,750
to tell me

312
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,830
that he remembers my grievance,

313
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,630
and he cares about me.

314
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,790
Then you sent me to go see Prince He?

315
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,550
Prince He

316
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,470
appears to be licentious and unruly. But in actuality, he is passionate and righteous.

317
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,110
If I want to subdue him,

318
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,630
I need to at least put some thought into it.

319
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,030
Your Highness.

320
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,550
Are you really not sad?

321
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,550
At this point, grief won’t do anything.

322
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,550
I’d rather think about how to take advantage of this incident

323
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,070
to benefit myself the most.

324
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,750
Alright. You may leave now.

325
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,520
Greetings to Mother Ling. May you have peace and longevity.

326
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,830
Rise.

327
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,630
In a blink of eye,

328
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,030
the Fifth Prince has grown up.

329
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,630
Yongqi.

330
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,430
When you were first born, you were golden yellow from head to toe.

331
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,490
Everyone thought you were a monster.

332
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,190
Thanks to your Mother Ling who protected you with her life,

333
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,190
or you might not even be alive today.

334
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,430
Thank you, Mother Ling, for saving me.

335
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,150
When I grow up,

336
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,810
I will surely be filial to you.

337
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,750
He’s such a young kid,

338
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,070
yet speaks like an adult.

339
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,790
Rise!

340
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,430
Rise, please!

341
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,390
Come here.

342
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,910
Mother Ling, does it hurt a lot?

343
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,270
Yes, it hurts a lot. But I can bear it.

344
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,510
When my Mother got hurt before,

345
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,550
she was clearly in so much pain that her eyes were red.

346
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,510
But she told me it didn't hurt.

347
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,310
Mother Ling, you are different than my Mother.

348
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,190
Yongqi.

349
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,790
Don't talk nonsense.

350
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,950
Fifth Prince.

351
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,720
If she clearly got hurt but she forced herself to endure,

352
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,810
it's because your mother was worried about you.

353
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,830
Your mother

354
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,890
regards you as the most precious treasure in the world.

355
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,890
In the future, you must be very filial to her.

356
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,630
I will be filial to Mother,

357
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,630
but can I be filial to you too?

358
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,110
My master will have her own child to be filial to her in the future.

359
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,510
We don't need to trouble you, Fifth Prince.

360
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,390
Mingyu, watch your mouth?

361
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,670
Last night, I kept hearing strange noises.

362
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,870
I was wondering

363
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,750
how come the yellow weasel is already here when it’s not New Year’s yet.

364
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,470
Mingyu.

365
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,270
Mingyu’s temper

366
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,030
hasn’t changed at all

367
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,350
over the years.

368
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,200
Who's laughing?

369
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,310
What’s going on?

370
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,550
Why are you so angry?

371
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,510
Just a traitor!

372
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,360
Why should we be nice to her?

373
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,110
Who is a traitor?

374
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,390
Yingluo is crazy, isn’t she?

375
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,870
Can’t believe she forgives Consort Yu!

376
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,270
But she also can’t confront her openly.

377
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,110
Don't forget.

378
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,470
It was Consort Ling who preserved the Fifth Prince's life.

379
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,430
She can't bear to watch such a little child

380
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,910
lose his mother.

381
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,600
Yingluo's changed.

382
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,070
Before, she was never hesitant to do anything.

383
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,800
Now, she's a different person,

384
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,630
talking happily with her enemy!

385
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,030
She's grown up.

386
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,670
Mingyu. You too though.

387
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,070
Me?

388
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,590
With this situation in the past,

389
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,830
you would've expelled Consort Yu and the Fifth Prince

390
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,230
out of your Palace by now.

391
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,670
But I am still stubborn and immature.

392
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,910
That's not stubborn and immature.

393
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,910
You are just not good at pretending.

394
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,910
Consort Ling has her reasons to do things.

395
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,390
I am guessing

396
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,830
she is getting close to Consort Yu,

397
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,160
because she wants to find a way to expose Noble Consort Chun.

398
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,750
The closer you get to your enemy, the easier to find.

399
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,670
Right?

400
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,830
Silly girl!

401
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,150
Now go back. Don’t let Consort Ling worry!

402
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,730
I am a month older than you!

403
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,150
How did you know?

404
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,230
I…

405
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,310
You looked into my age secretly.

406
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,010
I don't care about you.

407
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,390
Easy, Your Highness.

408
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,070
Even though the cast is removed,

409
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,150
you have to

410
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,150
move carefully.

411
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,510
I will prescribe another medicine for you.

412
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,230
Take it on time and take good care,

413
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,910
so that you can recover soon.

414
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,630
How is it? Feel better?

415
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,590
Thank you, doctor Ye!

416
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,040
I take my leave then.

417
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,510
Are we still mad at me?

418
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,390
No.

419
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,990
If you're not, then bring my tag

420
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,030
and go to the Imperial Household Department

421
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,430
and get something for me.

422
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,990
Here, to the left.

423
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,790
Yes, to the right.

424
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,110
Mingyu. Turn.

425
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,670
Keep turning!

426
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,750
That's not what Teacher Yin said.

427
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,870
It’s the other way!

428
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,270
This way! That’s right!

429
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,830
Slow down!

430
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,470
I give up! I can’t do it!

431
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,910
Mingyu.

432
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,910
Try again.

433
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,270
Yes.

434
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,520
His Majesty.

435
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,280
Greetings to Your Majesty.

436
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:34,910
Rise.

437
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,410
What are you doing now?

438
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:42,590
This Western item gets so dusty at the Imperial Household Department.

439
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,990
So I asked Teacher Yin

440
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,750
and he showed me

441
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,270
a dance.

442
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,350
I had the French technician stay in the Forbidden City

443
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,590
to work on calendars and firearms,

444
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,790
not to entertain you.

445
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,160
Do you know how to dance, Your Majesty?

446
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,150
I'll teach you.

447
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,760
I'm not interested.

448
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,150
I am not interested in horseback riding either,

449
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,070
but I learned it anyway for you.

450
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,710
To be fair,

451
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,800
Your Majesty has to learn how to dance too.

452
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,830
You are just messing around.

453
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,040
Step your left foot.

454
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,120
There you go.

455
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,590
One!

456
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,630
Two!

457
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,110
Left!

458
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,080
Keep your eyes straight ahead!

459
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,750
Your Majesty.

460
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,830
Dancing is fun, isn’t it?

461
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,230
That foreigner also put his arm around your waist?

462
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,190
Teacher Yin and the junior eunuch

463
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,830
showed it to me like this.

464
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,030
Your Master is really something.

465
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,600
His Majesty is unhappy these days.

466
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,750
But now he’s cheered up so quickly.

467
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,240
Something’s wrong!

468
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,390
What's wrong?

469
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,510
Wait.

470
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,350
I heard when the foreigners dance,

471
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,850
man should arm around woman’s waist.

472
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,350
Wei Yingluo, you're teasing me again.

473
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,030
Did I hurt you?

474
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,030
I was trying to cheer Your Majesty up.

475
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,770
By teaching me the woman's steps?

476
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,610
Then we'll switch.

477
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,710
Don't be mad anymore.

478
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,270
Step left foot.

479
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,670
Like this, right?

480
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,960
Your Majesty, so you know how to dance.

481
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,670
You knew how to dance.

482
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,990
You were tricking me!

483
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,430
Your Majesty is upset again?

484
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,390
Yingluo.

485
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,310
If one person must be killed,

486
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,310
what would you do?

487
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:18,910
Kill him.

488
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,070
What if he was falsely accused?

489
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,080
Release him.

490
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,160
What if he was falsely accused,

491
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,630
but he must be killed

492
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,670
for the big picture?

493
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,840
Either kill him or release him.

494
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,800
What does that mean?

495
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,230
Announce his death sentence in public,

496
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,510
but find someone

497
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,510
who is on death row with similar appearance,

498
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,430
and do a secret switch!

499
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,150
That’ll work, right?

500
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,670
You think the Ministry of Justice is the vegetable market?

501
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,270
You have to ascertain someone's identity before you behead him.

502
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,590
Your Majesty is indeed talking about Lord Naerbu.

503
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,270
But you did want to kill him.

504
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,230
Nonsense. I’ve never thought of that.

505
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,510
Even if you granted the Empress your grace,

506
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,230
exiling her father instead of beheading,

507
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,350
but would he be safe one the way?

508
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,720
There's no one the Emperor cannot spare in the world.

509
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,390
Your Majesty didn't want him to live after all.

510
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,270
Will Your Majesty kill me

511
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,470
as I just told the truth?

512
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,870
Your Majesty!

513
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,530
So you're scared of death too?

514
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,430
Was I right?

515
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,550
You were right.

516
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,630
Naerbu didn't take the disaster relief.

517
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,810
But he did make two mistakes. One, he kept information from me,

518
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,390
two, he is incompetent.

519
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,670
Many places in Eastern Zhejiang

520
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,070
face similar situations.

521
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,600
But they didn't have any revolt

522
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,960
or deaths of disaster victims.

523
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,470
Sometimes, an incompetent officer

524
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,550
will do harm just the same as a corrupted officer.

525
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:44,930
I sentenced him

526
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,430
to exile

527
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,590
only on the Empress' account,

528
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,840
giving him an honorable death.

529
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,030
I had no idea Empress

530
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,110
Dowager would take an early action.

531
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,710
Yingluo,

532
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,429
do you think

533
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,429
that I am a cruel monarch?

534
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,190
I do.

535
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,030
So what?

536
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,770
Your Majesty always wants to be perfect,

537
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,610
but there’s no perfect person in this world.

538
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,469
The greedy officers will hate you if you kill them.

539
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,790
The useless officers will resent you if they are killed.

540
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,989
Just let them hate or resent.

541
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,070
Since it’s already done, then don’t regret.

542
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:47,350
You pushed yourself again, didn't you?

543
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,350
Last night you insisted on dancing.

544
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,969
When an officer is ill,

545
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:57,120
he still needs to attend court.

546
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,590
When a consort is ill,

547
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,030
she still needs to cheer up the Emperor.

548
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,680
This is called duty.

549
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,750
You're so full of bizarre logic.

550
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,370
I'll go find Doctor Ye.

551
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,710
Don't move.

552
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,880
Why is it hurting so much suddenly?

553
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,880
Because you overestimated yourself!

554
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,510
Give me your hand.

555
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,670
Brother!

556
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,750
How come you are here?

557
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,350
Your Highness Consort Ling.

558
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,590
You're a ranking consort now.

559
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,090
Don’t call me brother anymore! I’m not worthy of it.

560
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,630
No matter what, you're still my brother.

561
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,150
Alright, Consort Ling.

562
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,310
Take a seat.

563
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,390
Gently.

564
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,350
You deserve it!

565
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,850
Brother, be gentle, my bone was injured.

566
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,630
So comfortable.

567
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,790
I’m still angry.

568
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,330
I’ve been angry with you for the past six months.

569
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,470
The stuff you sent me has piled up,

570
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,720
but you never showed up.

571
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,650
I was afraid I'd make you angrier.

572
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,950
You promised me

573
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,830
that we'd shoulder trouble together and enjoy fortune together.

574
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,090
I’ve thought about it.

575
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,550
You're Consort Ling now.

576
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,070
I will stay at your Palace

577
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,630
and be your chamberlain.

578
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,190
Okay?

579
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,350
Sure!

580
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,950
Consort Ling,

581
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,350
don't call me Brother in the palace.

582
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,570
Others will hear it. Understand?

583
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,120
Just call me by name.

584
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,270
Knowing you is truly my misfortune.

585
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,430
Knowing you

586
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,070
is a luck for me!

587
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,830
Your Highness the Empress!

588
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,910
Empress, be merciful and save me!

589
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,630
I am dying,

590
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,110
Empress!

591
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,790
Your Highness the Empress, forgive us.

592
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,990
This servant is unruly and needs to be taught.

593
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,070
Hupo, how dare you to stop Her Highness!

594
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,470
Do you want to be whipped?

595
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,310
Empress,

596
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,430
I used to work at Palace of Eternal Spring.

597
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,960
Because I made one mistake,

598
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,750
I was sent to Slave House and suffered a lot.

599
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,390
Empress. May Your Highness be merciful

600
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,750
and save me!

601
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,270
Your Highness the Empress! Save me!

602
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,630
She is..?

603
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,210
Your Highness,

604
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:44,230
she's Hupo who used to work at Palace of Eternal Spring.

605
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,230
Hupo?

606
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,510
I remember now.

607
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,190
How did she become like this?

608
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,430
Empress,

609
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,790
she was supposed to be assigned to Palace of Everlasting Joy.

610
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,520
But she offended Consort Ling,

611
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,390
and she was sent to the Slave House to do hard labor.

612
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,870
But she can't endure any hardship.

613
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,030
Empress, don't worry,

614
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,490
I will teach her properly!

615
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,950
Empress.

616
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,190
May you be merciful and save me!

617
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,750
Shut up!

618
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,750
She's the late Empress' old servant,

619
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,310
so she should be treated well.

620
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,830
Yes.

621
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,560
Assign her some easier chores,

622
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,950
and don't whip her anymore.

623
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,630
Yes.

624
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,710
Let's go.

625
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,910
Empress.

626
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,750
Empress! Empress!

627
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,930
Your Highness!

628
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,430
Hupo.

629
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,590
Your Highness!

630
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,630
Stop daydreaming.

631
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,150
Your Highness!

632
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,030
You offended Consort Ling.

633
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,790
Even the Empress can’t save you!

634
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,030
Your Highness!

635
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:29,990
Shut up!

636
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,190
Your Highness.

637
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,670
Greetings to Mother Ling.

638
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,400
Yongqi heard you can get up now.

639
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,770
So I came to bid you wellness especially.

640
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,350
Mother Ling, I don't think Sister Mingyu likes me.

641
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,390
True.

642
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,630
Usually,

643
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,110
Mother Ling would say

644
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,890
it’s all a misunderstanding.

645
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,470
Why would I deceive you?

646
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,870
But everyone in the palace does that.

647
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,960
Mother Ling doesn't like that.

648
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,110
Sit here.

649
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,280
Thank you, Mother Ling.

650
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,870
Go ahead.

651
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,630
You clearly want to eat it.

652
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,990
It's by your hand, so why don't you take it?

653
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,630
Mother said

654
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,450
taking something without asking is not proper.

655
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:42,910
Enjoy!

656
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,270
I’ve agreed.

657
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,030
Is it good?

658
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,950
Yongqi.

659
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,190
Since you're coughing,

660
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,470
you shouldn't eat sweet things anymore. Got it?

661
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,830
The tea is cold.

662
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,350
I will go switch it.

663
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,270
This.

664
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,670
Give them to me.

665
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,590
Shush!

666
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,430
What are you laughing about?

667
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,110
I'm laughing that you're a fool!

668
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,590
Don’t you see that

669
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,670
she stole two chess pieces from you?

670
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,070
Yingluo! You're too much.

671
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,910
Last time you stole two chess pieces from His Majesty.

672
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,750
His Majesty was so mad that he ignored you for two days.

673
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,110
Now you're doing it again?

674
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,350
I like seeing him mad.

675
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,470
It makes me happy!

676
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,870
You're so weird.

677
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,230
I don’t know why,

678
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,750
but I like to tease serious people.

679
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:17,990
So silly!

680
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,250
Yingluo, Yingluo!

681
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,200
Chamberlain Li. What brings you here?

682
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,430
Consort Ling, His Majesty invites you to go to Palace of Eternal Peace.

683
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,830
Palace of Eternal Peace?

684
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,990
Why now?

685
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,800
Please come with me right away.

686
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,190
I will accompany you.

687
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,230
No!

688
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,670
I will accompany Your Highness.

689
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,350
Mingyu.

690
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,750
You stay here.

691
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,150
Don't be nervous.

692
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,710
Nothing will happen.

693
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,800
Your Majesty, Her Highness Consort Ling is here.

694
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,870
Greetings to Your Majesty.

695
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,840
Is the Fifth Prince ill?

696
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,790
What are you trying to do!

697
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:20,890
Consort Yu,

698
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,590
what was that for?

699
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:25,590
Your Majesty.

700
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,590
Yongqi is so young!

701
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,550
Can’t believe she poisoned him!

702
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,390
She is so evil!

703
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,430
Poisoned him?

704
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:36,840
What does that mean?

705
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,510
Consort Ling.

706
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:43,230
Did the Fifth Prince go to your Palace today?

707
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,430
Yes.

708
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,680
Consort Yu told him to come visit me

709
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:50,150
and bring lucid ganoderma and deer antler to me.

710
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,150
Did he eat a snack there?

711
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,960
He ate a piece of lotus cake.

712
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,000
There it is then.

713
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,670
Doctor Liu.

714
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,470
Consort Ling,

715
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:05,390
the Fifth Prince has been coughing lately.

716
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:07,950
I am treating his illness mainly with fritillary bulb.

717
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,750
But fritillary bulb has a peculiarity.

718
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,010
It cannot be taken together with aconite

719
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,670
such as wolf's bane, monkshood, devil's helmet.

720
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,520
They should all be avoided.

721
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,390
If they were taken together, what would happen?

722
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,990
To reply you, Your Highness,

723
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:23,510
if taken together,

724
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:27,070
it's very likely that due to the medicinal properties clashing, one would be poisoned,

725
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,790
causing paralysis, unstoppable pain,

726
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,430
even death.

727
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,290
When I took the Fifth Prince's pulse,

728
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:37,230
I found out that he had signs of being poisoned by wolf's bane.

729
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,710
Only Consort Ling knows

730
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,390
If her lotus cake contains wolf's bane!
