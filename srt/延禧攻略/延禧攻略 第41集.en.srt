[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 41]

3
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,170
Wei Ying Luo.

4
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,009
Wei Ying Luo.

5
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,750
Wei Ying Luo.

6
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,210
It's incompetent of Ne Qin.

7
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,320
Your Majesty, please calm down.

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,920
Since I...

9
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,520
ascended the throne,

10
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,680
Ne Qin has been my most favored official.

11
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,050
But during the battle of Jinchuan,

12
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,840
he underestimated the enemy
and fought blindly.

13
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,840
He kept incurring casualties
and suffering defeats.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,450
I suggested him...

15
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,450
to defeat the enemy by sowing dissension.

16
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
But he was stubborn and didn't obey.

17
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,520
After getting defeated,
he did nothing at all.

18
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,780
He just stayed in his tent and
never fought the enemy again!

19
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,130
He and Zhang Guang Si...

20
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,350
engaged in endless haggling
and shifted the responsibility,

21
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,720
causing our army to suffer heavy losses.

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,880
Tell me,

23
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,600
should I give him death penalty?

24
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,750
Your Majesty,

25
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,800
we were defeated in Jinchuan...

26
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,640
because Ne Qin didn't command
the army well indeed.

27
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,440
Yet, he's an important
military minister...

28
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,970
and is currently commanding
our army in a war.

29
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,780
Ne Qin is cowardly and incompetent.

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,329
If I don't severely punish him,

31
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,040
it will only make a useless man
like him more arrogant.

32
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,310
Issue my decree.
Dismiss Ne Qin from his post...

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,200
and immediately take him back
to the capital under escort.

34
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,090
As for...

35
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,290
his replacement...

36
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,310
Your Majesty,

37
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,760
Jinchuan locates in the west of Sichuan.

38
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,220
It's just a small area.

39
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,880
There is no need for all this.

40
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,970
Now that our army has
suffered successive defeats...

41
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,300
and a great loss of morale,

42
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,870
I suggest that we
retreat and recuperate...

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
so as to fight again next year.

44
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,000
Retreat?

45
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Retreat?

46
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,200
Every part of our territory...

47
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,830
is the result of the hard work
of our ancestors.

48
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,310
If I retreat now,

49
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,970
what would that make...

50
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,680
the soldiers who sacrificed
their lives in the war?

51
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,839
What about the...

52
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,890
inhabitants there?

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,660
How can I face my ancestors...

54
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,870
in the future?

55
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
Zhang Ting Yu,

56
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,380
I think you're getting muddled
as you get older!

57
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,150
Let me ask all of you,

58
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,760
who can replace Ne Qin?

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,260
All of you...

60
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,560
are my high-ranking officials...

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,840
who showcase civil and military skills...

62
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,360
and talk big all the time.

63
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,140
But at such a critical moment,

64
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,600
you all have kept quiet.

65
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,820
Who is brave enough to go to Jinchuan?

66
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,000
Your Majesty,

67
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,240
I'll go.

68
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,420
Lord Fu Heng,

69
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,520
Jinchuan has harsh weather conditions
and dangerous terrain.

70
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,430
And Slob Dpon is very vicious.

71
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,480
He's secretly connived with
adherents of the former dynasty.

72
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,800
Our army has suffered defeats,

73
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,740
with grave casualties and
a great loss of morale.

74
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,080
Even Zhang Guang Si who's familiar
with the Southwest's topographic...

75
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,010
has suffered successive defeats.

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,390
You mustn't act recklessly.

77
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,200
Fuheng,

78
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,970
can you do it?

79
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,300
I'm willing to go to Jinchuan now,

80
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,310
even if it costs me my life.

81
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,990
Young Mistress, no!

82
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,960
-No!
-Let go!

83
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,159
Help...

84
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,370
Don't try to stop me!

85
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,560
Young Master,
Young Mistress got agitated...

86
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,880
from hearing that
you're going to Jinchuan.

87
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,720
She said it's better for her to die now...

88
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,280
rather than seeing you seek your doom!

89
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,040
-Let go of me!
-Young Master, please stop Young Mistress!

90
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,240
Young Master...

91
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,070
-Let go!
-Say it.

92
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,490
What do you want?

93
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,080
Fu Heng,

94
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,590
are you even human?

95
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,740
I'm worried about you.

96
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,620
But you show no concern.

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,400
You're worried about me?

98
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,060
No.

99
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,760
You're afraid that if
I die on the battlefield,

100
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,320
you'll become a widow...

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,130
and the fame and wealth that you own...

102
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,890
will all be gone.

103
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,520
What are you saying?

104
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,690
What?

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,020
Am I wrong?

106
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,840
I'll cut off your hand...

107
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,100
-Young Mistress.
-so that you can't go to the battlefield!

108
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
Young Mistress!

109
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,310
Young Mistress.

110
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,330
Leave!

111
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,730
Fu Heng,

112
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,500
don't go too far.

113
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,740
I did all this for you.

114
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,130
Is it really for me...

115
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,240
or for yourself?

116
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,150
You know it very well.

117
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,140
Go ahead if you want to get yourself
killed on the battlefield!

118
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,320
You must let me go.

119
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,159
Er Qing, listen here.

120
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,950
I hope you will remember...

121
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,880
what I'm going to say.

122
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,480
I spared your life...

123
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,130
not because of
the imperial heir in your womb,

124
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,760
but because I felt guilty.

125
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,620
This sense of guilt...

126
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,850
once drove me to do
my utmost to treat you well.

127
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,080
But what you've done...

128
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,920
has made me lose all my patience.

129
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,830
From now on,

130
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,390
be obedient and stay in this room.

131
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
If you dare step out of it...

132
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,760
What will you do?

133
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
If you step out with your left foot,

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,530
I'll cut off your left foot.

135
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,409
If you step out with your right foot,

136
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,960
I'll cut off your right foot.

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,909
You're insane!

138
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,760
You dared not question His Majesty...

139
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,510
but you're insulting me here!

140
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,860
I was His Majesty's
study partner for ten years.

141
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,560
I know his character...

142
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,090
a hundred times better than you.

143
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,620
Even if you're extraordinarily beautiful,

144
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,620
as long as you're married to me...

145
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,440
and have become
a member of the Fuca family,

146
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,200
he would never touch
even a finger of yours.

147
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,130
As for how you got impregnated,

148
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,300
I'm able to guess it without thinking.

149
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,770
You'd better pray that I return safely.

150
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,120
If I'm unable to return...

151
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,410
What if you don't return?

152
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,370
The Buddhist nunnery
on the outskirts of capital...

153
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,850
will be your home
for the rest of your life.

154
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,270
You must come back.

155
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,560
Young Master,

156
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,540
are you really going to Jinchuan?

157
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,440
I heard that our army
has suffered huge casualties.

158
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,280
No one in the imperial court
dares go there.

159
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,750
It's so dangerous for you to go there.

160
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,040
Qing Lian.

161
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,020
I'm sorry, Young Master.
I'm being a blabbermouth.

162
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,520
But Old Mistress has fallen sick
from worrying about you.

163
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,920
She said if you insist on going there,
she won't see you again.

164
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,050
If I dare not risk my life...

165
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,190
and fight battles,

166
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,920
what's the point of
reading military texts...

167
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,450
and serving as an official?

168
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,240
I can only show my worth
on the battlefield.

169
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,840
Otherwise,

170
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,640
I'll feel shame...

171
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,930
even if I'm granted with a high salary.

172
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,640
If Old Mistress asks again, tell her...

173
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,410
that I'll do what I want.

174
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,280
May she forgive me.

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,480
It's very risky on the battlefield.

176
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,400
What if...

177
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,130
Young Master,

178
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,780
think about Old Mistress.

179
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,520
She already lost Her Majesty.

180
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,020
She can't lose you either.

181
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Young Master, it's getting dark.
Where are you going?

182
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:32,180
♫ As it falls lightly into my palm ♫

183
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:43,460
♫ As it freezes silently in the palm ♫

184
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,660
Why are you in a daze?

185
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,900
Are you finished with your work?

186
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,640
I just did.

187
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,040
Stop sweeping.

188
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,630
Let's go eat.

189
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:05,450
♫ As I painfully taste all the happiness ♫

190
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:15,850
♫ I make these obviously
unkind things out ♫

191
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:27,420
♫ To be words of exhortation ♫

192
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:38,560
♫ All the tears and
I still can't believe it ♫

193
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:49,170
♫ This is such a ill-fated life ♫

194
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,830
♫ I take my time listening to
the sound of falling snow ♫

195
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,670
♫ Closing my eyes and
hoping that it won't stop ♫

196
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,050
♫ You can't approach me ♫

197
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,070
♫ Not because I'm too ruthless ♫

198
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,980
♫ It's just that I want to
see the other world ♫

199
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,760
♫ I take my time listening to
the sound of falling snow ♫

200
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,410
♫ As if you're whispering
sweet nothings in my ear ♫

201
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:31,620
♫ I open my eyes to the ruthless snow
all over the sky ♫

202
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,390
♫ Who will compensate me for
the lost good prospects in this life? ♫

203
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,590
Greetings, Mother.

204
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,020
Get up.

205
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,360
Have a seat.

206
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,480
Mother, you asked me to come here.

207
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,470
Do you have something to say?

208
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,640
Go get the Guilingji prescription.

209
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,670
Yes.

210
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,320
This prescription is named Guiling...

211
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,320
which means longevity.

212
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,980
It consists of thirty-three kinds
of beneficial medicine.

213
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,300
It's the most effective
prescription for longevity.

214
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,060
The battle of Jinchuan hasn't ended.

215
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,350
You often work late to
deliberate with military ministers.

216
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,310
This would be the best prescription
to nourish your health.

217
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,370
Li Yu,

218
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,060
you must remind His Majesty
to take it every day.

219
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,830
Don't you slack off.

220
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,040
Yes.

221
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,520
I'll definitely etch...

222
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,450
your meticulous care...

223
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,820
and kindness in my mind.

224
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,270
It's from Imperial Noble Consort Xian.

225
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,670
She knows that...

226
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,950
you won't listen to her advice.

227
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,320
Hence, she asked me to tell you.

228
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,920
You would have to obey it.

229
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,170
Emperor,

230
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,250
she's a rare virtuous consort.

231
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,720
Since Her Majesty passed away,

232
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,130
she's been managing the harem.

233
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,610
She has received high recognition...

234
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,270
from all six palaces.

235
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,790
Don't you mistreat her.

236
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,250
I've promoted her to
the imperial noble consort.

237
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,960
Although she takes charge of the harem,

238
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,530
she's just a deputy empress.

239
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,530
Since you've made the first step,

240
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,240
why don't you give her more grace?

241
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,770
You want me to promote her...

242
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,110
to Empress?

243
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,390
I know.

244
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,470
Rong Yin was your first wife.

245
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,800
You feel very sad about her death.

246
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,000
But a long time has passed.

247
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,080
You should get over with it.

248
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,950
Also, the empress position
can't be vacant for too long.

249
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,200
You must appoint
an empress sooner or later.

250
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,060
Although Imperial Noble Consort Xian
has no child,

251
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,600
she's prestigious...

252
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,930
and virtuous.

253
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,160
If you're going to appoint an empress,

254
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,680
she's the best choice.

255
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,970
You're right, Mother.

256
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,090
I was negligent.

257
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,630
Emperor.

258
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,050
What happened in the past
is indeed regrettable.

259
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,240
But it's all in the past.

260
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,310
You should cherish those in front of you.

261
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,010
Since Lady Hoifa-Nara was conferred
by Father as my secondary concubine,

262
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,599
she has been virtuous, prudent,

263
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,319
and strictly obeying the code of ethics.

264
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,839
Empress Dowager instructs that...

265
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,079
she's now fit to be
a motherly model of the empire.

266
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,089
After an auspicious date is chosen,

267
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,329
she should be promoted to the empress.

268
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,160
Hence, I obey Empress Dowager's order...

269
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,640
and confer Imperial Noble Consort Xian
as the empress.

270
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,079
Your Majesty,

271
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
your hard work has finally paid off.

272
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,370
You silly girl.

273
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,850
This is a joyous event.
Why are you crying?

274
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,040
You're right, Your Majesty.

275
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,640
I should be happy.

276
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,230
I should be happy.

277
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,680
Your tears have messed up your makeup.

278
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,560
Go.

279
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,840
Go wash your face now.

280
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,360
Mother.

281
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,590
I'm no longer a cowardly
and incompetent daughter.

282
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,480
I've become the empress,

283
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,920
the head of the six palaces,

284
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,760
and the motherly model of the empire.

285
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,620
The whole Great Qing will know...

286
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,890
that your daughter is the empress.

287
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,240
You won't be ridiculed anymore.

288
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,470
You don't have to lead
a miserable life anymore.

289
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,070
No one would dare belittle you anymore.

290
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,710
I've earned you prestige.

291
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,080
I didn't disappoint you.

292
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,190
Mother,

293
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,170
I've become the empress.

294
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,090
Why aren't you around?

295
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,220
I want you to see...

296
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,740
this formal robe of mine...

297
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,070
and touch its luxurious fabric.

298
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,040
Mother,

299
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,260
I miss you so much.

300
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,020
I want you to hug me.

301
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,160
I miss you.

302
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,250
I miss you so much.

303
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,030
From now on,

304
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,970
I, Hoifa-Nara Shu Shen,

305
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,000
am the empress of Great Qing.

306
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,610
I...

307
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,490
will be under His Majesty
and above all others!

308
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,720
The birthday banquet for this year...

309
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,720
will be held in the Guangming Hall
of Yuanming Garden.

310
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,220
Everything must be prepared well...

311
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,910
before His Majesty arrives.

312
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
You will be responsible for cleaning...

313
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,380
Qinzheng Hall of His Majesty.

314
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,040
And you will handle…

315
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,480
Since His Majesty is coming to
the Yuanming Garden,

316
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,280
will his consorts come too?

317
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,880
Of course, that's the palace rule.

318
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,460
What are you two muttering about?

319
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,780
Yuan Chun Wang, Wei Ying Luo,

320
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,280
and the four others beside...

321
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,310
will take care of the weeds
around the back lake.

322
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,260
-The whole back lake?
-Yes.

323
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,100
The whole back lake.

324
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,960
For this year's birthday banquet,

325
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,320
a mercy release ceremony will be held
at the back lake of Yuanming Garden.

326
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,480
You all should be cautious.

327
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,930
If there's any oversight,

328
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,200
you'll be skinned alive!

329
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,940
Is cleaning the back lake a happy task?

330
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,940
Why are you happy?

331
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,090
If His Majesty comes,

332
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,000
surely Noble Consort Chun will come.

333
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,710
I can see Ming Yu then.

334
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,820
Ming Yu?

335
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Over the past two years,
we've kept in touch.

336
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,480
She said she's been doing well
in the Zhongcui Palace

337
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,980
But I haven't heard from her lately.

338
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,570
I'm quite worried.

339
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Empress Dowager,

340
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,930
on the eastern side is
the newly built Changchun Garden.

341
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,410
In the future, we'll expand it
to the southeastern side.

342
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,560
Look over there.

343
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,960
Those are the newly designed landscapes.

344
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,320
When the expansion is complete,

345
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
the three gardens
can be combined into one.

346
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,570
The scenery here is so beautiful.

347
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,400
Consort Yu,

348
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,350
this is your first time here, right?

349
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,010
I came here once with His Majesty.

350
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,880
But the garden has been undergoing
expansion over the past few years.

351
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,940
And I had to take care of Fifth Prince.

352
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,260
That's why I wasn't able to come anymore.

353
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,840
Look at that Consort Yu.

354
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Ever since she started following
Noble Consort Chun,

355
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,750
she's changed...

356
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,250
and become a flatterer.

357
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,160
Sister, stop it.

358
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,580
What's there to fear?

359
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm just telling...

360
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,610
the truth known by everyone in the palace.

361
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,300
Ming Yu.

362
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,960
I knew that you'd come here...

363
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,360
with Noble Consort Chun.

364
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,350
I've been waiting for you.

365
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,850
Ming Yu?

366
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,990
Ying Luo.

367
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,530
Greetings, Consort Chun and Consort Yu.

368
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,460
It's really you.

369
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,400
It's been a long time.

370
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,760
It is my great fortune
being remembered by Your Highness.

371
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,040
Get up.

372
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,830
Ming Yu,

373
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,170
you too served in the Changchun Palace.

374
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,640
Your relationship with Ying Luo
has always been good.

375
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,370
Since she came to see you today,

376
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,440
you should have a catch-up

377
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

378
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,130
No need.

379
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,400
Your Highness has just arrived here.

380
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,010
I have to unpack your things.

381
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,410
I have no time for such a nobody.

382
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,440
Ming Yu!

383
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,700
When we're serving the late empress,

384
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,210
you kept trying to be above everyone else.

385
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,920
Everyone in the Changchun Palace
had to yield to you.

386
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,000
Now that we're in the Yuanming Garden,

387
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,800
you still want to boss me around?

388
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,020
I've had enough.

389
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,160
Ying Luo.

390
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,800
Since she doesn't
want to mingle with you,

391
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,200
stop pestering her then.

392
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,810
Noble Consort Chun,

393
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,760
the peonies over there have blossomed.

394
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,090
Let's go check them out.

395
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,800
Mistress, I'll accompany you there.

396
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,160
Ming Yu.

397
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,280
Now that we're in the Yuanming Garden,

398
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,080
you still want to boss me around?

399
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,590
I've had enough.

400
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,800
You've been sitting here
for almost two hours.

401
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,930
I'm wondering what's on your mind.

402
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,340
Ming Yu was acting strangely.

403
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,680
What's so strange about her?

404
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,340
I find that perfectly normal.

405
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,920
You used to be
very arrogant and domineering...

406
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,270
while serving at the Changchun Palace.

407
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,520
She just acted to be nice to you.

408
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,160
In reality she hates you a lot.

409
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,690
You have yourself to blame.

410
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,000
Ming Yu and I have been
knowing each other for a long time.

411
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,660
Indeed she has a short temper.

412
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,260
But she's a straightforward person.

413
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,560
Straightforward?

414
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,810
That's why she humiliated you
in front of so many people.

415
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,440
Anyway,

416
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,360
I find her behaviour strange.

417
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,690
Even Consort Yu...

418
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,270
You mean...

419
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,390
she's not as cowardly as she was?

420
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,320
-Yes...
-Yes...

421
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,610
Sit down.

422
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,800
Let me reason with you.

423
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,090
Things are different now.

424
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,530
Consort Yu has now sided with
Noble Consort Chun.

425
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,920
It's as expected.

426
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,540
That's it. Stop thinking about it, okay?

427
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,810
Open your mouth.

428
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,640
You need to wake up early tomorrow.

429
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,390
Listen to me. Go to bed early.

430
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Does it look good?

431
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,350
What is this?

432
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,520
I noticed how plain hair adornment is,
so I bought it for you.

433
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,920
Say it. Does is look good?

434
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,060
Brother,

435
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,750
stop spending money on me.

436
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,150
Her Majesty gave me a lot of good items.

437
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,000
-I keep them all.
-Hush!

438
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,890
What?

439
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,120
From now on, don't ever simply
mention the late empress again.

440
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,000
Ying Luo,

441
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,300
it's no longer her reign.

442
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,120
You must always remember...

443
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,570
that the present empress is Hoifa-Nara.

444
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,150
Go to bed early.

445
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,890
Let go of me!

446
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,600
Can you tell me...

447
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,800
what happened now?

448
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,610
While serving at the Zhongcui Palace,

449
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,710
has Your Highness mistreated you?

450
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,650
I'm doing very well.

451
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,400
I'm doing very well. Get it?

452
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,840
I'm now Noble Consort Chun's
favored senior palace maid.

453
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,290
You're just a low-level servant
in the Yuanming Garden.

454
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,160
Let's not see each other again.

455
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
I've never seen you as a friend.

456
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,040
I don't want to see you again!

457
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Stop right there!

458
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,830
You're hurt?

459
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,590
Let me see.

460
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,400
I said, I'm fine.

461
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,160
Why don't you believe me?

462
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,440
If you're fine, why does your hand hurt?

463
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,790
I...

464
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,480
I...

465
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,870
Ming Yu,

466
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,020
Noble Consort Chun treats you badly.

467
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,000
And she threatens and
forbids you to get close to me.

468
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,880
Am I right?

469
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,560
I'll go see her.

470
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,980
Ying Luo!

471
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,060
Noble Consort Chun...

472
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,120
has changed.

473
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,780
-She...
-What happened over the past two years?

474
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,510
You've become so scared.

475
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,900
Ying Luo.

476
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,770
You must beware of Noble Consort Chun.

477
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,040
You must beware of her.

478
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,240
What do you mean?

479
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,620
It's too late.

480
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,200
They'll find out if I don't head back now.

481
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,310
I need to go now.

482
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,110
Ying Luo,

483
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,720
you must beware of her.

484
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,810
She won't let you off.

485
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,330
Ming Yu!

486
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,250
Miss Ying Luo,

487
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,960
why do you keep pursuing her like this?

488
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,330
What have you done to Ming Yu?

489
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,080
I don't understand what you're saying.

490
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,510
She was fine before.

491
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,260
And now she's become very scared.

492
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,180
Noble Consort Chun could be favouring
her publicly and secretly torturing her.

493
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,680
Stop talking nonsense!

494
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,480
In the past, Her Highness
had always obeyed the late empress.

495
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,080
Now that the late empress has passed away,

496
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,080
she secretly tortures
the palace maid of Changchun Palace.

497
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,490
It doesn't make sense.

498
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,640
Unless Her Highness is hiding something.

499
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,230
What can she be hiding?

500
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,920
If she's not hiding anything,

501
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,080
why are you being so nervous?

502
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,280
Shut up, Wei Ying Luo!

503
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,230
I warning you.

504
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,420
Stop being a busybody.

505
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,550
If not, you'll be killed.

506
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,160
Whether there's a secret or not,

507
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,520
it will be revealed sooner or later.

508
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,040
Providing that you're alive
to investigate it.

509
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,000
Help...

510
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,400
Stop the assassins!

511
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,010
Who are you? What are you doing?

512
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,200
It's them!

513
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,730
Catch him!

514
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,930
Catch him!

515
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,920
Don't move!

516
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,640
Who are you?

517
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,040
How dare you act wildly
in the Yuanming Garden!

518
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,140
Eunuch Zhang,

519
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,000
now that His Majesty is here,

520
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,080
they must have come here
to assassinate him!

521
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,230
Maybe they got lost and
mistakenly entered here!

522
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,920
No, we're here to steal things,
not to assassinate!

523
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,800
Nonsense!

524
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,120
If you're just stealing,
why did you bring a dagger?

525
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,830
You two rats!

526
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Drag them out!

527
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,250
You, come here.

528
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,570
Why were you yelling?

529
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,740
What if you startled His Majesty?

530
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,200
If you had attracted
the imperial guards here,

531
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,520
you would've been killed!

532
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,560
Supervisor Zhang,

533
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,400
Ying Luo did so for the sake
of His Majesty's safety.

534
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,800
That scoundrel was holding a dagger.

535
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,960
Leave.

536
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,920
All of you, leave!

537
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,280
Why didn't you tell the truth?

538
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,440
I did tell the truth.

539
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,130
Stop acting in front of me.

540
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,930
It's obviously that
they're here to kill you.

541
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,320
Yes.

542
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,490
They're here to kill me.

543
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,280
Why didn't you tell Supervisor Zhang?

544
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,870
Since the consorts tried to get rid of me,

545
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,680
they'd ask some undaunted men to do it.

546
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,480
It's no use interrogating them.

547
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,020
I don't have time for them.

548
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,560
Branding them as the assassins...

549
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,220
is torturous enough for them.

550
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,160
Tell me, who wants to kill you?

551
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,790
Your Majesty,

552
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,000
someone has been assigned to clean
the offering table of the late empress.

553
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,780
Look, they even placed
Her Majesty's favourite jasmine.

554
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,160
That's cotton flower.

555
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,590
Your Majesty,

556
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,190
When the jasmine hasn't blossomed,

557
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,960
I'd use paper flower and
cotton flower in replace of it.

558
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,720
I'd spray jasmine powder on them.

559
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
Hence, they're similar to jasmine.

560
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,960
I remember...

561
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,490
when Her Majesty was still around,

562
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,720
she loved eating this kind of cake.

563
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,560
But how come the colour looks weird?

564
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,960
Your Majesty, don't worry.
They serve the fresh ones every day.

565
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,880
And they serve it hot.

566
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,800
The servants dare not
serve insufficient offerings...

567
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,130
on the offering table of the late empress.

568
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,270
How come it's very hard?

569
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,780
Who made it?

570
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,270
Your Majesty,

571
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,770
I did.

572
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,330
Wei Ying Luo.

573
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,770
Is this glutinous rice cake or a rock?

574
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,280
How dare you serve such an item
on the offering table!

575
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,490
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

576
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,310
Your Majesty.

577
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,150
I dreamed of Her Majesty last night.

578
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,880
It's the first time Her Majesty visited me
in my dream over the past two years.

579
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,139
She said she misses glutinous rice cake.

580
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,719
But the cook of Yuanming Garden...

581
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,600
doesn't know the taste
Her Majesty preferred.

582
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,460
Thus, I decided to made it myself.

583
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,610
You made it yourself?

584
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,400
How can it be so bad?

585
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,909
Your Majesty,

586
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,040
it's Ming Yu who made snacks...

587
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,590
for Her Majesty.

588
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,679
I was only her assistant.

589
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,840
May Your Majesty forgive me.

590
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,409
What a flatterer.

591
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,199
Your Majesty,

592
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,800
I merely wanted to
fulfill Her Majesty's wish.

593
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,560
But I'm incompetent.

594
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,480
I've done Her Majesty wrong.

595
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,170
Mistress, what can I do for you?

596
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,630
Ming Yu,

597
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,120
where have you been last night?

598
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,670
I lost my handkerchief,
so I went back for it.

599
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,070
Really?

600
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,080
Yes.

601
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,200
Your Highness, please believe me.

602
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,620
I dare not lie to you!

603
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,010
It's indeed Wei Ying Luo.

604
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,480
She's quite ruthless.

605
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
With just a few words,

606
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,780
she's gotten two persons executed.

607
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,440
You're right, Your Highness.

608
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,020
That girl is a big trouble indeed.

609
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,360
No matter how crafty she is,

610
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,750
she can't predict things.

611
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,980
Don't we have a whistle-blower here?

612
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,000
Your Majesty, I didn't do it!

613
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,810
I would never dare do so!

614
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,420
You wouldn't dare do so?

615
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,780
Your Highness, please don't!

616
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,590
Your Highness, please spare me...

617
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:24,940
Noble Consort Chun, I'm here to
relay the verbal decree of His Majesty.

618
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,680
You do know what you should
and shouldn't say, don't you?

619
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,760
Yes.

620
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,640
Supervisor Li, come in.

621
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,840
Noble Consort Chun,
as decreed by His Majesty,

622
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,100
I need take Miss Ming Yu to
the Celestial Changchun Palace.

623
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,610
Ming Yu?

624
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,720
Yes.

625
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,480
His Majesty wants to
eat glutinous rice cake.

626
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,040
He heard that Ming Yu
is good at making it.

627
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,780
Hence, he asked her to make it.

628
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,170
Hurry.

629
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,030
Supervisor Li,

630
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,400
I'm used to having Ming Yu by my side.

631
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,310
Now that His Majesty
is taking her away from me,

632
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,280
I can't stand to part with her.

633
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,760
Your Highness, His Majesty
can have anyone he wants.

634
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,050
You have to part with her
even if you can't stand to.

635
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,840
Miss Ming Yu, hurry!

636
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,650
His Majesty is waiting for you!

637
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,250
I'm taking my leave.

638
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,000
Your Highness, what do we do?

639
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,910
They're just two lowly palace maids.

640
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,440
Even if they join hands,
they can't do anything about me.

641
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,680
Moreover, she's my maid.

642
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,840
She'll be back sooner or later.

643
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,450
Miss Ming Yu, here we are.

644
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,410
Just focus on making the snack.

645
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,990
Ming Yu, are you alright?

646
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
I tricked His Majesty
into thinking that...

647
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,720
a whole set of offerings
must be prepared for Her Majesty.

648
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,380
I've earned you another day.

649
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,410
That's too risky.

650
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,190
Where do you hurt?

651
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,400
I...

652
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,920
Don't touch me.

653
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,960
Ming Yu!

654
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,560
Let's go.

655
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,240
Let's go see His Majesty.

656
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,510
We can't.

657
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,070
We really can't.

658
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,270
Why?

659
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,890
We can't.

660
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,200
We can't.

661
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,000
I'll call for a physician then.

662
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,830
No, you can't, Ying Luo!

663
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,500
Ying Luo!

664
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,080
Miss Ying Luo, that's very risky.

665
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,830
If I didn't come...

666
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,960
and it's some other imperial physician,

667
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,280
what would you do?

668
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,560
The other hand.

669
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,970
Physician Ye, you're now the pillar of
Imperial Academy of Medicine.

670
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,440
You're highly favored by Empress Dowager.

671
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,800
You're with the imperial family
whenever they go on a trip.

672
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,800
We haven't seen each other for two years.
But you're as eloquent as ever.

673
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,860
Physician Ye,

674
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,870
how's Ming Yu?

675
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,260
Take this to make things bearable.

676
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,920
That was close.

677
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,720
If we were a bit late,

678
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,400
this needle would keep moving up.

679
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,660
If it reached the head,

680
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,490
even the deities
wouldn't be able to save her.

681
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,010
Who was so heartless enough...

682
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,840
to insert a silver needle into her body?

683
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,080
When you walk, sit, and sleep,

684
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,960
the silver needle will
move with your blood...

685
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,560
and you'll be in severe pain.

686
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,250
Physician Ye, thank you.

687
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,870
But what happened today...

688
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,840
Don't worry. I've been in the palace
for quite a long time.

689
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,040
I know what I should and shouldn't say.

690
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
But...

691
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,250
I was only able to find these
eight needles hiding beneath her skin.

692
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,160
It's possible that some
have gotten into her internal organs.

693
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,380
I'm afraid...

694
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,370
Doctor Ye,

695
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,150
I won't die.

696
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,430
Thank you.

697
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,570
Miss Ming Yu,

698
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,570
Follow the prescription
I gave you for one month.

699
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,640
You must take the medicine every day.

700
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,730
It'll help your recovery.

701
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,320
Physician Ye,

702
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,070
I'll walk you out.

703
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,640
Sure.

704
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,710
Can you tell me the truth now?
