[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,259
Drag her away and cane her thirty times.

4
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,240
I'm new to the palace and didn't know
about this spiritual cypress tree.

5
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,259
-But I did this for a reason.
-Shut her up.

6
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,730
Let her speak.

7
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,840
I didn't know that
this is the spiritual cypress tree.

8
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,759
But I dreamt about...

9
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,320
a tree last night.

10
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,680
It told me that
it has been here a long time...

11
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,200
and it is feeling itchy.

12
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
So, it asked me to come to the garden...

13
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,079
to give it a scratch.

14
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,070
Yes, I was just giving it
a scratch just now.

15
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,360
What nonsense is this?

16
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,760
How could a tree appear in your dream?

17
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,120
Since this is a spiritual cypress tree,
of course it could appear in my dream.

18
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,260
Your Majesty, I'm telling the truth.

19
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,010
I'm not lying.

20
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,730
Forget it. Let's go.

21
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,060
Consider yourself lucky today.

22
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,990
You brat!

23
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,560
Madam.

24
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,440
It hurts.

25
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,200
You also know what pain feels like?

26
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,280
You had quite the sharp tongue just now.
You even dared to contradict His Majesty.

27
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,079
Are you tired of living already?

28
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,310
Madam.

29
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,090
What kind of tree...

30
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,850
is this? Why is it so precious?

31
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,360
When His Majesty travelled incognito
back then, it was an extremely hot summer.

32
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,400
All the ministers
were sweating in buckets.

33
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,260
His Majesty was the only one
who didn't sweat at all.

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,530
Everyone thought that it was strange.

35
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,840
Whenever His Majesty thought about it,

36
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,630
he would roughly remember a giant tree...

37
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,010
that accompanied him all the way from
the Forbidden City to give him shade.

38
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,280
Everyone said that it was
this spiritual cypress tree.

39
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,640
It knew that His Majesty was about
to go travel, so, it went with him...

40
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,360
to protect His Majesty on his journey.

41
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,070
His Majesty said that to show everyone
that he's the son of heaven...

42
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,440
and is different from everyone.
This cypress tree is just a hoax.

43
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,360
-He must be dreaming.
-Watch your mouth.

44
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,200
This is just a tree...

45
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,660
and we can't even scold it or hit it.
In this Forbidden City,

46
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,620
even a tree has better life
than the people here.

47
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,880
You are right.

48
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,600
In this Forbidden City,
a tree which is favoured by His Majesty...

49
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,770
will live better than a woman
who has lost his favour.

50
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,300
Look at Noble Lady Yu.
If she can give birth to a son,

51
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,700
she'll be able to turn the table.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,180
But for Concubine Yi,
she even lost her life.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,640
Madam.

54
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,480
-Let's leave now.
-Why?

55
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,650
His Majesty was distracted by me just now.

56
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,360
If he realises it later,
I will be in big trouble.

57
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,240
-Let's leave.
-Do you think he can't find you?

58
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,760
He won't be able to find me.
All palace maids dress alike.

59
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,020
Furthermore, I didn't raise my head
just now. Let's go now.

60
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,490
Greetings, mother.

61
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,430
Come here. Let me take a look at you.

62
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,440
You don't look too good.
Have you been working too hard?

63
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,560
[Empress Dowager]

64
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,240
Thank you for your concerns.

65
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,200
There are too many trivial matters
recently. Nothing to worry about.

66
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,760
In the past, when you woke up
in the morning,

67
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,390
you would drink a bowl of
cold sweetened bird nest porridge.

68
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,370
In the evening, you would
drink wine together with your dinner.

69
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,760
But lately, you didn't
eat or drink anything at all.

70
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,840
Looks like you don't have much appetite.
If you are too exhausted,

71
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,000
you can let others handle
certain matters for you.

72
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,620
Or else, if you are
doing everything by yourself,

73
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,420
why do you need them for?

74
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,710
You are right. But those around me
are too useless.

75
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,730
I will keep them in check.

76
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,440
This is the Biluochun tea from Dongting
that Noble Lady Shu gave us.

77
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,060
You love to drink tea.

78
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,010
Take these back with you later.

79
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,660
[I dreamt about a tree last night. It told
me that it has been here a long time...]

80
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,360
[and it is feeling itchy. So,
it asked me to come to the garden...]

81
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,120
[Yes, I was just scratching it just now.]

82
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,880
Your Majesty.

83
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,440
Talking about the Biluochun tea,
there's still another story.

84
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,760
When my father went on a southern tour,

85
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,430
he heard about a tea
with unique fragrance.

86
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,280
The natives called it the
"Frightening Fragrance".

87
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,610
My father didn't like it.
So, he changed it to Biluochun.

88
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,600
It was supposed to be an annual tribute
but when my father became the emperor,

89
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,390
he felt that it was too troublesome.
So, he cancelled it.

90
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,960
If you like it,
I can reinstate the decree.

91
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,840
Don't change the subject.

92
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,270
You know what I'm talking about.

93
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,760
Don't you know Noble Lady Shu?

94
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,660
Your Majesty, she's the noble lady
who was just selected to enter the palace.

95
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,970
You even conferred a title on her.

96
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,150
In the past, you always
praises the empress.

97
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,680
She is your rightful wife and
she just gave birth to a son.

98
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,520
I couldn't say anything
if you wanted to dote on her.

99
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:38,760
But she is not in pink health now.

100
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,380
You haven't visited the harem for so long.

101
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,230
In the past, you said you were
tired of the old faces.

102
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,840
But there are many
new ladies in the palace now.

103
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,180
Why haven't you visited them?

104
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,080
You are right. I understand.

105
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,000
-What do you understand?
- It's so fragrant.

106
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
You are changing the subject again.

107
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,670
You are already an adult.

108
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,610
Stop making me worry.

109
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,360
Mother, I still have a lot of reports
to attend to at Yangxin Palace.

110
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,050
I have to leave now.

111
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,280
Your Majesty!

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,820
Why are you laughing?

113
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,480
His Majesty is so funny.

114
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,559
He said that he understands.

115
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,919
But I can tell that
he doesn't understand at all.

116
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,110
No matter what kind of women
who came into the palace,

117
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,710
they'll end up the same.

118
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,550
No matter how smart,
beautiful or precious they are,

119
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,430
they'll just end up losing their values...

120
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,320
and become someone common.

121
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,640
Your Majesty, what are you looking for?

122
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,820
Where is that palace maid just now?

123
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,410
Why are you looking for her?

124
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,150
I just realised this. Who is she?

125
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,900
Why would this spiritual cypress tree
appear in her dream?

126
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,040
I can only say that this girl
is too smart and quick-witted.

127
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,840
I was too distracted by
the issues of imperial court just now.

128
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,660
I didn't know what to ask.
That's why I let her go.

129
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,360
Yes, that girl was full of lies.

130
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,080
Furthermore, she sounded so convincing.

131
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,050
We have to catch her and kill her.

132
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,020
Your Majesty.

133
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,780
Your Majesty, if I did anything wrong,
just ask someone to beat me up.

134
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,240
Don't dirty your leg because of me.

135
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,190
Turn around.

136
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,520
You are really bold.

137
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,880
You reported everything about me
to the Empress Dowager.

138
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,760
I know my mistake now.

139
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,800
Your Majesty. Madam Liu
came this morning to check on you.

140
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,240
She said that Empress Dowager
is concerned about your health.

141
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,960
So, I could only tell her everything.

142
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,420
I know my mistake now.

143
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,080
In the future, do not trouble
Empress Dowager with my situation anymore.

144
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,860
I don't want her to worry about me.

145
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

146
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,980
Find that palace maid for me.

147
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,010
Your Majesty.

148
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,110
Why did you close the door
on Noble Lady Yu?

149
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,440
I know that you'll be
furious at me for doing so.

150
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,280
But I still did it for your sake.

151
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,190
Tell me. How is it for my sake?

152
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,500
I know that you are kind and
will surely help Noble Lady Yu.

153
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,520
But there are so many problems in
the palace. Can you handle them all?

154
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,200
Those two from Yonghe Palace
are not favoured by His Majesty.

155
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,800
Noble Lady Yu is finally pregnant.
But His Majesty still treats her as usual.

156
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,680
Why do you want to be involved
in this messy issue?

157
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,150
Why?

158
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,000
I am the mother of this nation, role model
of the six palaces, I have to handle this!

159
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,940
What about your own health then?

160
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,370
Are you not going to
take care of yourself?

161
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,000
Moreover, Noble Consort Gao
is currently at her peak.

162
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,450
-You can't control her at all.
-Ming Yu!

163
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,710
-Your Majesty. Calm down.
-Shut up!

164
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,640
Your Majesty, I am concerned about you.

165
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,560
You won't be able to
take care of every problem.

166
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,240
We can consider it if we can
topple Noble Consort Gao with it.

167
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,520
But we have no chance of winning.
We can't be involved in it.

168
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,210
-Your Majesty.
-What is it that she can't be involved in?

169
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

170
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,180
All of you, rise.

171
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,660
What were you all talking about just now?

172
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,980
My servants here
are getting more and more lax.

173
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,420
They didn't even announce your arrival.

174
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm the one who asked them
not to announce it.

175
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,780
I want to see what you are doing.

176
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,390
Noble Lady Yu is pregnant.

177
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,510
This is a joyous news in the palace.

178
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,270
I want to set up a porridge kitchen
by Shenwu Gate to pray for her child.

179
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,760
But they kept saying that
I'm too unwell to do it...

180
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,490
and I shouldn't overexert myself.

181
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,490
So, they are advising me against it.

182
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,180
Is that so?

183
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,720
Yes.

184
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,540
Other than that,
do you still have other things...

185
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,690
to tell me?

186
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,040
You are busy with
a myriad of state affairs every day.

187
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,840
Please take care of your health.

188
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,100
Yes.

189
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,290
-Your Majesty.
-I have many state affairs to attend to.

190
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,980
I will attend to them now.
Please rest well.

191
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,780
Farewell, Your Majesty.

192
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,270
Your Majesty.

193
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,720
Why didn't you tell him about it just now?

194
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,140
What's the use of
telling him about it now?

195
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,770
Concubine Yi has already passed away.

196
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,140
Even if we conduct a further investigation
on that loquat jelly now,

197
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,400
it'll not make any difference.

198
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,870
My greatest wish now...

199
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,210
is for Noble Lady Yu
to pull herself together...

200
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,870
and safely deliver her child.

201
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,820
Greetings, Noble Consort.

202
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:26,000
What is it? Did His Majesty
ask you to deliver me a gift?

203
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,010
Stop.

204
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,330
Please open it in person, Your Highness.

205
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,590
What is it?

206
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,980
Diamond Sutra?

207
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,270
Why did His Majesty give me this?

208
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,430
Your Highness,

209
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,490
His Majesty said that you are
too temperamental lately.

210
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,880
This sutra is specially given to you.

211
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,550
He said that after you copy it once,
you'll be able to calm down.

212
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,040
It'll be beneficial for your health.

213
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,020
There are 5000 words in this sutra.

214
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,660
Your Highness, we've already prepared
brush, ink, papers and ink stone for you.

215
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,120
Leave it here.
I will copy it when I'm free.

216
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,120
Your Highness, please forgive me.
His Majesty ordered me to wait here.

217
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,190
I have to personally
see you copy the sutra.

218
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,880
And then, I have to take it back for him.

219
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,200
What? His Majesty
asked you to monitor me?

220
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,860
Your Highness,
please don't say it that way.

221
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,490
This is His Majesty's
generosity towards you.

222
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,420
Don't do it, Your Highness.
This is an imperial gift.

223
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,360
You can't throw it.

224
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,180
Fine.

225
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,280
I will go and copy it now.

226
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,579
Open your eyes and watch me!

227
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,119
Yes, Your Highness.

228
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,800
Ji Xiang, look.

229
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,119
What is so good about him?

230
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,210
Idiot. Do you think that the guards in
Forbidden City are ordinary people?

231
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,430
This red wall of the Forbidden City
is a dividing line among the guards.

232
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,930
What do you mean? I don't understand.

233
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,120
You are really dumb.

234
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,180
The soldiers outside of this red wall...

235
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,780
are of ranking five and below.

236
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,450
But the guards inside this red wall...

237
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,320
are royalties from
ranking three and above.

238
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,440
Even royalties will work as guards?

239
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,880
Of course. Don't forget.

240
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,520
People who are always by His Majesty's
side will surely have a promising career.

241
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,720
Hence, when they compete to become a guard
inside the Forbidden City every year,

242
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,420
not only they have to be
from the noble class,

243
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,240
they have to be outstanding too.

244
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,680
Or else, they won't stand a chance.

245
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,730
I heard that the younger brother of
the empress, Lord Fu Heng, is a guard too.

246
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,300
Which one is he?

247
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,320
I don't know. I have never seen him too.

248
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,360
Madam said that we have to hurry up and
deliver these clothes to all the palaces.

249
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Don't waste any more time. Let's go.

250
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,740
Qing Xi, what are you looking at?

251
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,460
Guard this place for me.
I have an important matter to attend to.

252
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,660
You can't just leave like this! Jing Xi!

253
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,360
Ying Luo, what's wrong?

254
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,730
I think I dropped my handkerchief.
I'll go back and search for it.

255
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,220
You can go in first.

256
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,840
-Come back soon.
-Okay.

257
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,410
Come with me.

258
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,820
Madam Fang, a guard came to see
Ying Luo out of a sudden just now.

259
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,850
And he hastily dragged her away.

260
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,440
Ying Luo is new to the palace and
she doesn't know many people yet.

261
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,550
Will she be in trouble?

262
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,540
Good. She just entered the palace and
is already having an affair with a guard.

263
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,160
I'll skin her.

264
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
If you have something to say, say it.

265
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,720
Ying Luo, when Uncle Wei said that
you're in the palace,

266
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,270
I couldn't believe him.
But you are really here.

267
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,740
Me being in the palace
is none of your business.

268
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,060
I'm devastated about
Ying Ning's death too.

269
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,760
But this is the Forbidden City,
don't make any trouble.

270
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,180
Who are you? What rights do you have
to meddle with my affairs?

271
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,140
I have the rights to do that because
your sister and I were once lovers.

272
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,940
Why are laughing?

273
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,780
You and my sister were lovers once.

274
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,210
Why did you abandon her when
she needed you the most then?

275
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,320
She is from Imperial Household Department.
She will enter the palace eventually.

276
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,080
Do you want me to wait
until she's 25 years old?

277
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,310
No, it is not that you can't wait for her.

278
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,140
It's because we are all
from the lower class.

279
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,570
No matter how beautiful, intelligent
and virtuous my sister is,

280
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,240
a lofty young master like you will
never marry a woman from the lower class.

281
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,550
-Ying Luo.
-What is it?

282
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,110
I guessed it correctly, right?

283
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,900
Your surname is Qijia.
You are from a noble family in Manchuria.

284
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,780
Although my sister didn't
come from a noble family,

285
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,580
she was someone with a backbone.

286
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,450
Since you've broken up with her,
both of you are no longer related.

287
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,600
But I had always treated your sister well.

288
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,260
When my sister was in the palace,
have you ever showed her any care?

289
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,980
I am a guard.

290
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,170
I can't have any interactions
with a palace maid.

291
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,370
Very good.

292
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,120
Since we are strangers,

293
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,640
I won't blame you for turning
a blind eye against my sister's death.

294
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,920
Just pretend that you've never seen me
in the Forbidden City.

295
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,260
Ying Luo.

296
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,180
I'll be posted here once every 5 days.

297
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,840
If you run into any trouble,
you can come to me in the Guards Office.

298
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,790
I don't need your help!

299
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,160
I'm a palace maid from the inner court.
Aren't you afraid that you'll...

300
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,520
lose your job
if someone sees us like this?

301
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,880
Luckily, my sister broke up with you.

302
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,960
You're not even worthy enough
to be my brother-in-law.

303
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,680
You are just a good-for-nothing.

304
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,160
You shameless woman.
I've finally caught you red-handed!

305
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,640
How dare you have
a date inside the palace!

306
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,310
How can you be so bold?

307
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,480
Come out! You disobedient maid!

308
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,800
Open the door! Open the door now!

309
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,580
You scoundrel!

310
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,960
How dare you peek at me? You
shamelessly peeked at me! You scoundrel!

311
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,590
How dare you peeked at me!

312
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,050
-Scoundrel! How dare you peeked at me!
-Stop!

313
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,180
Stop it! Stop hitting her!

314
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,600
-She is Madam Fang!
-It's Madam Fang.

315
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,450
You wench!

316
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,670
How dare you hit her!

317
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,040
Madam Fang, how could it be you?

318
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,820
You useless brat! How dare you!

319
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,410
Madam, didn't you say that
you are here to...

320
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,480
Wei Ying Luo, where's your paramour?

321
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,190
Paramour?

322
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,340
I'm the only one here.

323
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,300
Answer me. Why did you
come to the storage room all alone?

324
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,590
I dropped my handkerchief.
So, I came here to look for it.

325
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,090
But I suddenly had the urge to pee.

326
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,960
There is no lavatory here and
I really couldn't hold it in anymore.

327
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,240
And then, I realised that
someone was stalking me.

328
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,050
How dare you spout so many lies.
I'll tear up your mouth.

329
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,550
-Madam.
-Madam. Did you hurt your waist?

330
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,210
Quickly go and lie down now!

331
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,890
Good.

332
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,080
I will slowly settle my score with you.

333
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,320
Be careful. Take it slow, Madam Fang.

334
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,820
Take it slow.

335
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,720
Ying Luo, are you okay?

336
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,170
You scared me to death.

337
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,530
Can't you see that I'm fine now?

338
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,160
But she was furious just now.
What if she decides to pursue this matter?

339
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,040
What will you do then?

340
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,320
Based on the beatings I gave her just now,

341
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,720
it'll take her more than
two weeks to recover.

342
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,780
She can pursue the matter when
she has fully recovered.

343
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,420
You did it on purpose?

344
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,020
You think too much.

345
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,480
[This is so pretty.]

346
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,810
Ying Luo.

347
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,060
What's wrong with you?

348
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,580
Did Madam Fang drop that tassel just now?

349
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,180
I will return it to her later.

350
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,240
Madam Fang.

351
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,800
Do you want to scald me to death?

352
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,720
Pour me a cup of water again!

353
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,790
Yes, Madam Fang.

354
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,570
Sister Bing Qing.

355
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,880
What are you here?

356
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,460
If Madam Fang sees you, she will be mad.

357
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,950
She is furious with you now. Be careful.
She might want to get even with you.

358
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,640
She dropped this tassel.

359
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,840
I'm here to return it to her.

360
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,840
You found it. She even asked
Yu Jie to go and look for it.

361
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,420
This tassel is exquisitely made.

362
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,090
The knots are very unique too.

363
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,440
I can't imitate it even after
I examine it for a long time.

364
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,720
Do you know who made this?

365
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,680
Man, the embroidery maid that
I told you not to mention last time.

366
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,450
Man?

367
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,560
Her name is Man?

368
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,760
I entered the palace late. I only
know that everyone calls her that. Why?

369
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,790
Where is she now?

370
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,200
I told you to not mention her.
It's forbidden by Madam Fang.

371
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,000
Sister, tell.
I won't tell anybody about it.

372
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,990
Later, I'll make you
a beautiful perfume pouch.

373
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,010
I know you like the "Golden Swallow
Chasing the Moon" design the most.

374
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,640
I think she committed a crime
and was driven out of the palace.

375
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,170
Madam Fang forbids anyone to mention it.
Those who mentioned it will be punished.

376
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,360
So, only Madam Fang knows about
the details of the incident.

377
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,820
-Yes.
-Bing Qing!

378
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,450
-She is calling for me. I have to go.
-Bing Qing, where did you go?

379
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,800
I told you to get me a cup of tea.
Where did you go?

380
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,740
Madam Fang, it's my fault.

381
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,830
I saw someone by the door
and chatted with her for a bit.

382
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,100
Who did you see?

383
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,560
Ying Luo.

384
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,640
She found your tassel and
was here to return it.

385
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,920
She's just checking if
I'm crippled or not.

386
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,800
What else did this wench say to you?

387
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,450
She asked about the creator
of this tassel.

388
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,840
She even asked about Man.

389
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,580
Man?

390
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,870
Madam, this is really not my fault.
I didn't say anything.

391
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,940
I'm sure that Ying Luo is just curious.

392
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,950
Wei Ying Luo.

393
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,830
Wei Ying Luo.

394
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,510
Why does this name sound so familiar?

395
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,050
Where did I hear it from?

396
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,260
Bring me Ling Long.

397
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,240
Take it! Show it to His Majesty!

398
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,320
Tell him that I personally copied it.

399
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,160
I didn't let anyone write it for me.

400
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,800
Tell him that my hand is about break!

401
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,850
Yes, Your Highness.
I will take my leave now.

402
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,480
Your Highness, since you've
finished copying the sutra,

403
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
stop being mad at His Majesty.

404
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,510
Being mad at His Majesty?

405
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,190
He is obviously the one
who is mad at me!

406
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,190
I heard that His Majesty went to
Changchun Palace this morning.

407
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,740
So, it's her.

408
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,250
I was still wondering
who was the one ratting me out.

409
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,310
Your Highness,
what should we do next then?

410
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,380
I forced that wench to kill herself.

411
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,990
But His Majesty
didn't reprimand me at all.

412
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,710
Yes.

413
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,780
His Majesty will not pay attention
to people who he doesn't care.

414
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,840
He's the son of heaven.
The ruler of Qing Dynasty.

415
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,810
How can he be constantly involved in
the affairs of the harem...

416
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,590
and uphold justice for
his imperial consorts?

417
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,110
Isn't that a big joke?

418
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,590
If the emperor has to take care of it
himself, what's the use of an empress?

419
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,460
So, he has no power over this matter.

420
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,350
If he does that, it's like announcing
to the whole Forbidden City that...

421
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,380
the empress is incompetent and is
unable to manage the imperial harem.

422
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,560
Then, this sutra...

423
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,560
There's another pregnant lady
in Yonghe Palace, right?

424
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,320
His Majesty is just reminding me...

425
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,310
to cultivate my moral character.

426
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,020
I was just giving it a scratch.

427
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,060
I was just giving it a scratch.

428
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,190
I was just giving it a scratch.

429
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,180
I was just giving it a scratch.

430
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,210
I was just giving it a scratch.

431
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,160
I was just giving it a scratch.

432
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,960
I was just giving it a scratch.

433
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,650
I was just giving it a scratch.

434
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,880
I was just giving it a scratch.

435
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,230
Madam Fang, I really saw
Wei Ying Luo with a guard that day.

436
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,430
I wasn't trying to fool you.

437
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,430
Enough. I believe you. Get up.

438
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,900
But, that Wei Ying Luo
is hiding something.

439
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,740
Keep an eye on her for me.

440
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,000
Madam Fang, I don't understand.

441
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:12,350
You don't need to understand.
You just need to remember it.

442
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,100
You just need to report back to me...

443
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,400
if you caught her on action.

444
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,740
If you don't agree,

445
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,200
I'll tell her that it was you
who told on her that day.

446
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,040
She even dared to hit me.

447
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,040
Let alone you.

448
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,020
Yes, Madam Fang.

449
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,360
Who's the person-in-charge here?

450
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,150
Greetings, Mistresses.

451
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,470
You know me?

452
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,060
I took your body measurements
when you just entered the palace.

453
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,500
You are a natural beauty and
your beauty is unforgettable.

454
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,110
I also remember First Attendant Qing.

455
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,680
Are you done with our new dresses already?

456
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,600
Yes. I was just about to have
someone deliver them to you.

457
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,160
No need to do that.
I'm here now, aren't I?

458
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,120
Noble Lady Shu, this way please.

459
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,810
You?

460
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,930
Greetings, Noble Lady Shu.

461
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,770
I remember you. Aren't you the one...

462
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,550
First Attendant Qing,
you have a good memory.

463
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,870
You left quite a deep impression on us.

464
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,990
I will never forget how Sister Uya...

465
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,420
was driven out of the palace back then.

466
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,560
Mistress Uya was
driven out of the palace?

467
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,570
How is that possible?

468
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,520
You don't know?

469
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm only a measly palace maid
in the Embroidery House.

470
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,860
How would I know about
the affairs of my mistresses?

471
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,390
So, it has really nothing to do with you?

472
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,760
How is it related to me?

473
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,110
Sister Nalan, looks like
she really doesn't know.

474
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,520
Hope that I'm just overthinking this...

475
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,320
instead of you overdoing it.

476
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,880
Noble Lady Shu, I really don't understand
what you're saying.

477
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,430
I'm not as stupid as Sister Uya.

478
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,120
You also should stop being
so presumptuous.

479
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,900
Be careful not to offend me.

480
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,800
I thought we are here for our new dresses.
Why are we still here?

481
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,600
This way please, Noble Lady Shu.

482
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,969
I was just giving it a scratch.

483
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,679
Chief Li, you've already met
most of the palace maids.

484
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,370
You still can't find that one
you're looking for?

485
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,800
That darn palace maid. If I find her,

486
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:28,080
I'm going to skin her!

487
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,020
This is it? Are all the palace maids here?

488
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,070
I've already summoned
all the palace maids here to meet you...

489
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,110
except the palace maids who serve the
imperial consorts. We can't summon them.

490
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,000
It's impossible that she is
serving an imperial consort.

491
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,120
I remember her voice very clearly.
I've never heard that voice before.

492
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,730
Then, the only palace maids left
are the ones from the Imperial Workshop.

493
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,159
For example, the Leather Workshop,
Embroidery House,

494
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,040
Filigree Workshop and Ruyi Workshop.

495
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,000
Call them out. We'll investigate
each and every one of them.

496
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,880
This is a decree from His Majesty.
We have to find her.

497
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,360
Lower down this part more.

498
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,630
-Look. Here.
-Am I doing it right?

499
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,910
Should I make a knot here?

500
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,620
And here.

501
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,760
Everyone, get out and form a line.
I'm going to check you one by one.

502
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,500
Chief Li. What's going on?

503
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,600
Madam Zhang, summon all of
your working maids to come out here.

504
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,840
I want to check them one by one.

505
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,570
Chief Li, we're rushing to finish
the spring dresses for our mistresses.

506
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:44,250
If we ask them to come out there,
it'll cause a delay in our work.

507
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,260
How about this? If you need anything,
you can just tell me about it.

508
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,660
Of course I can't do that.

509
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,630
I know that this place is under Eunuch Wu
from the Imperial Household Department.

510
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,670
You keep on addressing me
as Chief Li so intimately,

511
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,760
are you looking down on me?

512
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,640
What are you talking about?
I wouldn't dare do that.

513
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,260
Chief Li, who are you looking for?

514
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,780
A palace maid with a clever mouth
who is full of mischief!

515
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,500
If I catch her, I will surely skin her!

516
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,780
Alright. Wait a minute then.

517
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,980
Madam, we are in a rush.
We have no time for this.

518
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,920
We can't afford to offend Chief Li.

519
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,850
Chief Li, I still have to assist our
two mistresses to try on their dresses.

520
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,730
I will be leaving first then.

521
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,200
Move back.

522
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,960
Come. Queue up and tell me this.

523
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,390
I was just giving it a scratch.

524
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,800
I was just giving it a scratch.

525
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,720
I was just giving it a scratch.

526
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,580
I was just giving it a scratch.

527
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,320
I was just giving it a scratch.

528
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,990
I was just giving it a scratch.

529
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,020
Why are you laughing?

530
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,060
I'm talking to you!

531
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,140
You look like a dummy.

532
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,920
That maid is very clever.
You are not her for sure. Step back!

533
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,270
Those who are done, don't idle around.

534
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,670
Come with me to deliver
these dresses for our two mistresses.

535
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Chief Li!

536
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,160
Ji Xiang.

537
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,300
Such a huge commotion.
Who are you looking for?

538
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,620
Do you need our help?

539
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:55,240
Although it's an honour, I don't need to
trouble you for trivial matter like this.

540
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,730
"Honour" is too great a word for me.

541
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:03,200
I've invited you over many times
but you always refused me.

542
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,680
Noble Lady Shu, you must be joking.
You probably don't know...

543
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,090
His Majesty's temper yet
because you are new here.

544
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,710
If His Majesty finds out that
you invited me,

545
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,830
he may think that you're
inquiring information about him.

546
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,290
How can that be?
You are just overthinking it.

547
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,680
I'll be taking my leave then.

548
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,090
Ling Long!

549
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,590
Brat, where did you go?
I couldn't find you anywhere.

550
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,920
-Madam, I...
-You, come over here!

551
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,110
I'm talking about you!

552
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,620
Why were you not here just now?

553
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,670
You are very suspicious! Say this.

554
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,000
I was just giving it a scratch.

555
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,450
I was just giving it a scratch.

556
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,090
Go back. Let's continue.

557
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,680
Sister Nalan, are you really
going to track His Majesty?

558
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,850
Why are you such a coward?

559
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,570
It has been a month since we came in.
But I still haven't seen His Majesty.

560
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,360
Why did we work so hard to pass...

561
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,260
the Consort Selection then?

562
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,920
Did we come here just to bask in the sun?

563
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,520
You can't put it like that.

564
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,720
We'll get the chance eventually.

565
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,360
-But if we curry favours like this...
-If you want to be a solider,

566
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,870
aim to be a general.

567
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,120
Since we've come into the palace,
we have to fight to the top.

568
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,860
What's the point of...

569
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:54,220
hiding and cowering
at the corner like a coward?

570
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,190
Sister Nalan, lower your voice.

571
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,170
What are you afraid of?

572
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,560
I entered the palace to be
a favoured consort, to be above everyone.

573
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,430
Why should I cower in fear?

574
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:09,270
All of them look so noble and virtuous,
but they are just being pretentious.

575
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,480
Let's see if they can avoid
attending to His Majesty forever.

576
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,700
Sister Nalan, stop it.

577
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,440
All the other sisters in the palace
look quite prim and proper.

578
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,880
You are really naive.

579
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,020
I just said a few honest words and
you're already so frightened.

580
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,800
Let me tell you, no matter
it's inside or outside the palace,

581
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,570
all humans with two legs are all the same.

582
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,120
If you see anyone who likes to
flaunt or brag about themselves,

583
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,570
don't hesitate. Just spit on them.

584
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,660
They are too pretentious!

585
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,870
If you want to be a holy person
with a clean heart and mind,

586
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:50,780
just strangle yourself and go to heaven.

587
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,960
Sister Nalan, we still have to greet
Concubine Jia today. Let's go.

588
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,430
Wait.

589
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,200
Did you hear that?

590
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,360
Deliver my dresses back to my palace.

591
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,700
Yes, Your Highness.

592
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,540
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

593
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,460
Look! It's Imperial Guard Fuca!

594
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,820
-Imperial Guard Fuca!
-Jin...

595
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,850
-Imperial Guard Fuca!
-I like him so much!

596
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,240
It's Imperial Guard Fuca!
I saw Imperial Guard Fuca!

597
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,880
-I saw him!
-Imperial Guard Fuca?

598
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,840
Fuca Fu Heng, the brother of the empress.

599
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,360
He is well-versed in literature
and military affairs. A royalty!

600
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,100
Can we deliver the dresses now?

601
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,280
Ying Luo, wait. I need to pee.
Help me with this.

602
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,760
Thanks!

603
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,520
Jin Xiu!

604
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,700
Wei Ying Luo? What are you doing?

605
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,200
I should be the one asking that.
