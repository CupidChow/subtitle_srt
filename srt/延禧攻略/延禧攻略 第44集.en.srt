3
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,120
Have you sent someone to find her?
When will she return?

4
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,759
Yes, I have. I think she'll be back soon.

5
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,850
No one dares have His Majesty wait.

6
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,020
Your mistress is so unruly...

7
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,430
that she has His Majesty wait for her.

8
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,810
Well,

9
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,370
His Majesty didn't say he's coming.

10
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,170
She's improved a lot.

11
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,940
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

12
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Noble Lady Wei made the cold dessert bowl
and sent it to the Shoukang Palace.

13
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,320
She's chatting to Empress Dowager.

14
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,860
Until now?

15
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,390
Empress Dowager is in a good mood...

16
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,760
and talks about her private tour
to Jiangnan with the late emperor.

17
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,600
Noble Lady Wei is envious of her.

18
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,720
I'm afraid she won't return in no time.

19
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,390
So she's going to leave me here?

20
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
Your Majesty,

21
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,520
Noble Lady Wei is keeping
Empress Dowager company...

22
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,590
out of filial devotion.

23
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,150
Or...

24
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,440
you could go elsewhere.

25
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,079
You want to die?
How dare you speak like that!

26
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,400
Your Majesty,

27
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
it's not the mistress' fault.

28
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,160
Filial piety is the utmost priority.

29
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,610
She can't simply leave Empress Dowager.

30
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,030
All of you act just like your mistress!

31
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,880
I'll punish you later!

32
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,279
Sister Ming Yu,

33
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,640
why did Noble Lady Wei
refuse to see His Majesty...

34
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,040
after luring him into the palace?

35
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,920
You're a girl who knows nothing.

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,940
Leave now.

37
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,330
Yes.

38
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,820
What's wrong?

39
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,490
Nothing.

40
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:43,640
Noble Lady Wei, you must be tired
from chatting to Empress Dowager.

41
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,950
Go to bed early.

42
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,640
Ming...

43
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,650
Your Majesty?

44
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Didn't...

45
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,040
you leave just now?

46
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,790
No one has ever
fooled me like this before.

47
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,250
Wei Ying Luo,

48
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,480
you really get a nerve.

49
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,159
Sister Ming Yu,

50
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,720
I get it now.

51
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,330
Noble Lady Wei is so clever.

52
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,600
Stop talking nonsense...

53
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,200
or I'll tear off your mouth.

54
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
I'm wrong...

55
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,560
I'm really wrong.

56
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,440
Disturbing His Majesty
and Noble Lady Wei...

57
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,750
is a capital crime.

58
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,970
Shut your mouth now.

59
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

60
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,100
Noble Lady Wei,

61
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,040
are you aware of your offense?

62
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,310
I'm dull-witted.

63
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,920
I don't know what my offense is.

64
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,320
Yesterday, you had the servants...

65
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,720
hang a sunshade along the palace path?

66
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,350
-Yes.
-That's it.

67
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,040
They made so much noise...

68
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,750
and disturbed my nap.

69
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,159
They deserve to be executed.

70
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,510
But they're just servants.

71
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,880
So I should hold you accountable for it.

72
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,090
Your Highness,

73
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,159
I did so for His Majesty.

74
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,290
I said, you're wrong.

75
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,990
You're just a noble lady.

76
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,790
How dare you talk back to me.

77
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,680
Kneel now.

78
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,280
You...

79
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,840
You're right, Your Highness.

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,880
I disturbed your nap.

81
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
I deserve to die.

82
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,960
Since you're aware of your offense,

83
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,520
keep kneeling.

84
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,910
until...

85
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,160
the sun sets.

86
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,560
You want to vie with me
for His Majesty's favour?

87
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,490
You don't deserve to do so.

88
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,030
Noble Lady Wei,

89
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,840
how could you kneel?

90
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,720
Why is Noble Lady Wei kneeling?

91
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,680
I don't know.

92
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,240
Let's go.

93
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,429
Your Majesty,

94
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,039
I've never been mistreated like that...

95
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,040
since I entered the palace long ago!

96
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,920
Noble Lady Wei hasn't been
in the palace for long.

97
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,130
But she dared talk back to me!

98
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,960
It's because you favour her!

99
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,430
Alright.

100
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,290
Stop crying.

101
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,090
It's a mere trifle.

102
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,040
It's not decent for you to cry.

103
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,720
Get up now.

104
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,320
Your Majesty,

105
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,900
you don't blame me anymore?

106
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,540
I know...

107
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,690
it's not a big deal to Your Majesty.

108
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,150
But there are rules in this palace.

109
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,680
She spoke to me in an unruly manner.

110
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,960
I punished her because I'm her senior.

111
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,780
I know...

112
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,830
you favour Noble Lady Wei.

113
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,510
I lectured her for a little while...

114
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,050
before she turned around and walked away.

115
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,150
I've been wronged.

116
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,870
To whom do I complain?

117
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,070
I'm scared you'll listen to the rumours...

118
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,440
and think that I bullied her on purpose.

119
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,560
I wouldn't be able to clear my name
even if I had a hundred mouths!

120
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,240
Alright.

121
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,760
I didn't say I'd blame you.

122
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,280
You don't blame me anymore?

123
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,420
I don't blame you.

124
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,670
Stop crying.

125
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,280
Okay?

126
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,650
Your Majesty,

127
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,000
do you remember...

128
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,900
you used to treat me very well...

129
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
before Noble Lady Wei came?

130
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,560
But ever since Noble Lady Wei
came to the palace,

131
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
you've never visited me again.

132
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,880
Your Majesty, tell me.

133
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,000
Is there anything wrong with me?

134
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,910
Why do you get fed up with me?

135
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,280
I've been really busy lately.

136
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,400
So I didn't go to
the Chuxiu Palace and visit you.

137
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,130
When I'm done with everything,

138
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,690
I'll visit you for sure.

139
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
Your Majesty,

140
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,010
you're not lying to me?

141
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,640
I'm not lying.

142
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,160
I'm busy,

143
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,440
-You should get back now.
-I've just...

144
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,070
Then...

145
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,880
-Leave now.
-I'm leaving.

146
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,130
You must keep your word.

147
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Supervisor Li.

148
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,970
Li Yu.

149
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,120
I'm here.

150
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,340
Is Wei Ying Luo really that domineering?

151
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Well...

152
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,170
Your Majesty,

153
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,620
I've never seen it.

154
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,680
So I don't know whether it's true or not.

155
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,010
I think...

156
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,050
she needs to be taught a lesson.

157
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,520
She dared talk back to me
when she served in the Changchun Palace.

158
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,120
Now she's more out of control
because I favour her.

159
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,040
Your Majesty, you mean...

160
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,750
Get rid of her tag.

161
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,520
Yes.

162
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,580
Yes, over there.

163
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,190
Tie it tightly.

164
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,680
It must be that young Concubine Jia
who stirred up trouble.

165
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,070
She offended you.

166
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,000
But she complained to His Majesty
that you offended her.

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,810
How many times have I told you?

168
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,310
Tie the upper part, not the lower part.

169
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,350
Hey.

170
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,390
His Majesty removed your tag.

171
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,510
Why are you not anxious at all?

172
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,780
Yes...

173
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,930
Higher.

174
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,520
-Noble Lady Wei!
-Tie it tightly.

175
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,370
In addition to the swing,

176
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,140
set up a painting table too.

177
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,740
Noble Lady Wei didn't come at all?

178
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,920
No.

179
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,530
Zheng Zhu, push!

180
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,050
Harder!

181
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,700
Zheng Zhu, higher!

182
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,240
Harder!

183
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,030
Harder!

184
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,400
Your Majesty...

185
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,730
Supervisor Li?

186
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
Supervisor Li,

187
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,920
why is His Majesty here?

188
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,770
The young Concubine Jia
always defames Noble Lady Wei.

189
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,440
But she doesn't even
try to approach His Majesty.

190
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,120
His Majesty doesn't want to come here.
And she doesn't go to him either.

191
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,280
She's even playing on the swing.

192
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,480
Does she want to die?

193
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,890
Higher!

194
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,200
Didn't they see me?

195
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Well...

196
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,800
Well...

197
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,120
Your Majesty, Noble Lady Wei
is playing on the swing.

198
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,000
She probably didn't see you.

199
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,590
You even stayed to remind her.

200
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,200
She must have noticed me.

201
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,620
His Majesty came just now.

202
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,170
Okay.

203
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,630
Harder!

204
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,870
Noble Lady Wei!

205
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,420
You're in my way.

206
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Harder!

207
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,550
Don't go!

208
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,800
Zhen Zhu, harder.

209
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,150
Zhen Zhu, harder!

210
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,710
Your Majesty, calm down...

211
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,610
Your Majesty,

212
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,680
I'm here to check your pulse.

213
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,160
No need.

214
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
You may leave now.

215
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,420
No.

216
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
Your Majesty,

217
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,670
you have strong liver fire now.

218
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,480
It's better to have your pulse checked.

219
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,280
I said, no need!

220
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,040
Physician Ye, you should leave now.
His Majesty is angry.

221
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,650
No,

222
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,400
His Majesty must have the health check.

223
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,360
For example, Noble Lady Wei.

224
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,130
-She...
-Who are you talking about?

225
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,240
Noble Lady Wei.

226
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,310
She hurt her knees and
didn't seek treatment right away.

227
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,920
It caused her to develop multiple bruises.

228
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,780
It almost affected her mobility.

229
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,870
-Really?
-Yes.

230
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,000
What did you say?

231
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,370
Your Majesty.

232
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,300
Your Majesty.

233
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,440
I said you should have your pulse checked.

234
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,810
You can't delay it.

235
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,340
What did you say about
Noble Lady Wei's legs?

236
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,330
Noble Lady Wei...

237
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,000
Imperial Concubine Jia...

238
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,880
punished Noble Lady Wei
by having her kneel for four hours.

239
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,410
Her knees got injured from the kneeling.
She had to nurse them for a long time.

240
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,460
She got better...

241
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,970
two days ago.

242
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,920
Noble Lady Wei,

243
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,710
all these are bestowed by His Majesty.

244
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,270
Look.

245
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,000
This is Autumn Colours in the Qiao
and Hua Mountains...

246
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,120
by Zhao Meng Fu.

247
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,430
Noble Consort Chun once
asked His Majesty for it.

248
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,000
But His Majesty didn't give it to her.

249
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,040
And now he's decided to gift it to you.

250
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Really?

251
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,770
But I know nothing about painting.

252
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,160
It's such a waste for His Majesty...

253
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,560
to gift me this painting.

254
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,390
Moreover, it's such a precious painting.

255
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,790
I dare not accept it.

256
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,650
Noble Lady Wei,

257
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,270
His Majesty knows that
you've been painting lately.

258
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,380
His Majesty picked it especially for you.

259
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,440
Well,

260
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,160
I've brought it here for you.
I can't return with it.

261
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,150
Noble Lady Wei,

262
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,230
do you understand
His Majesty's intentions?

263
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,050
Understand what?

264
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,589
Noble Lady Wei,

265
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,520
His Majesty knows
he has falsely accused you.

266
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,869
He feels so upset.

267
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,800
But His Majesty can't swallow his pride.

268
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,000
So you should go to the Yangxin Hall.

269
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,670
Is that okay?

270
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
I see.

271
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,369
Noble Lady Wei,

272
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,590
I've served His Majesty for years.

273
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,710
But His Majesty...

274
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,000
has never cared about someone
as much as he does for you.

275
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,960
Well,

276
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,450
it's okay if you don't want to show up.

277
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,320
But you should at least allow
the Imperial Affairs Bureau...

278
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,880
to include your name tag
for the bed attendant selection.

279
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,410
That should be okay, right?

280
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,450
No.

281
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,280
Noble Lady Wei has caught a cold
while playing on the swing.

282
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,630
Her throat isn't feeling well.

283
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,210
We should wait until
she's fully recovered.

284
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,360
This...

285
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,120
Noble Lady Wei,

286
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,440
how can you get sick so often?

287
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,850
You've been sick
too frequently this month.

288
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,030
Take them away...

289
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,640
Your Majesty, please calm down...

290
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,960
If she's not willing to do it,

291
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,720
don't ever let her serve me again!

292
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,240
-Get out!
-Yes.

293
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,570
That's so funny!

294
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,200
In my opinion,

295
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,720
Noble Lady Wei is being ungrateful.

296
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,000
His Majesty kept tolerating her.

297
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,200
But she refused to give in to him.

298
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,790
Now that...

299
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,550
His Majesty has forbidden
her from serving him.

300
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,440
she can't act arrogant anymore.

301
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,560
In this Forbidden City,

302
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,330
there are all kinds of women.

303
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,370
But I've never seen one like her.

304
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,540
Not only is she being ungrateful,

305
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,930
but she also doesn't
want to live anymore.

306
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,090
Let's wait and see.

307
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,840
When she loses His Majesty's favour,

308
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,420
everyone will trample on her.

309
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,080
Let's see if she'll survive it.

310
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,870
What is Wei Ying Luo trying to do?

311
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,960
Could it be that...

312
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,630
she wants to anger His Majesty
and lose his favour?

313
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,720
All women...

314
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,070
think that they're special,

315
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,720
especially those at the early stage
of obtaining His Majesty's favour.

316
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,520
But as time goes by,

317
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,240
they'll realize that there's
no such thing as being special...

318
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,610
in the eyes of His Majesty.

319
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,830
In my opinion,

320
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,270
Wei Ying Luo wanted
to do something different...

321
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,000
to impress His Majesty.

322
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,560
But she went too far

323
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,590
and infuriated His Majesty,

324
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,360
And now she's become a joke.

325
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,530
Great.

326
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
She's lost His Majesty's favour...

327
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,400
without us doing anything.

328
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,390
Does she still go to the Shoukang Palace?

329
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,470
Yes.

330
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,740
Now that she's lost His Majesty's favour,

331
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,720
she's become more diligent
fawning over Empress Dowager.

332
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
I have no idea what she does.

333
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,040
There's always laughter
inside the Shoukang Palace.

334
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,010
Empress Dowager likes her a lot.

335
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,120
It shows that she's not stupid.

336
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,490
She knows that Empress Dowager
can save her life.

337
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,300
But it's such a shame...

338
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,200
that Empress Dowager hasn't dealt with
palace affairs for a long time.

339
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,090
I don't think she can protect her.

340
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,360
It's surprised that
His Majesty changed his mind.

341
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,010
Why didn't you reconcile with him?

342
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,520
Now that you've infuriated His Majesty,

343
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,160
you paid too dearly for your whistle.

344
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,390
Let him be angry then.

345
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,920
Ying Luo!

346
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,160
It's so late.

347
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,030
I'm going to sleep.

348
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,590
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

349
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,400
[Shoukang Palace]

350
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,720
When it comes to
the local scenery of Jiangnan,

351
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,960
Suzhou has the best one of course.

352
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,000
There aren't many old palaces
and leisure areas.

353
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,920
But there are a lot of canals
and small bridges.

354
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,640
Water chestnut and lotus
are sold in night markets.

355
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
Boats carrying beautiful fabrics.

356
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,070
What a pity.

357
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,400
When you traveled with the late emperor,

358
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,080
you didn't pass by Suzhou.

359
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,830
You'd be amazed that...

360
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,010
there's such a place
as gentle as water in this world.

361
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,470
They say Suzhou and Hangzhou
are like paradise.

362
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,630
Although I've never been there,

363
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,760
at the sight of you,

364
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,370
I know that women of
Suzhou and Hangzhou...

365
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,790
are gentle and adorable.

366
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,440
His Majesty is here!

367
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,320
Greetings, Mother.

368
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,160
You came just in time.

369
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,470
Noble Consort Chun and I are talking about
the scenery of Jiangnan.

370
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,730
Unfortunately,

371
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,880
I didn't manage to visit
Suzhou and Hangzhou.

372
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,130
I'll never get to see
the beautiful landscapes of Jiangnan.

373
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,160
But today I received
a beautiful painting of Jinan.

374
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,830
If you're interested, take a look at it.

375
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,800
Sure.

376
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,920
Bring the painting here.

377
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,610
This is Autumn Colours in
the Qiao and Hua Mountains...

378
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,240
by Zhao Meng Fu.

379
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,590
Did Noble Lady Wei...

380
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,200
gift you this painting?

381
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,990
Yes.

382
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,820
Your Majesty, don't you love
paintings like this?

383
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,080
If Your Majesty likes it,

384
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,400
you can have it.

385
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,640
Of course I can't refuse...

386
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,110
your kindness.

387
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,830
Your Majesty...

388
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,000
What's wrong, Noble Consort Chun?

389
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,330
I should be the one asking you that.

390
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,940
You look very angry.

391
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,970
I'm fine.

392
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,080
It occurred to me that
I have state affairs to deal with.

393
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,400
I need to head back
to the Yangxin Hall now.

394
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,390
Your Majesty,

395
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,240
state affairs will never end.

396
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,650
You should take good care of yourself.

397
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,620
If not, I'll worry...

398
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,090
about you.

399
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,590
Okay.

400
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,700
That's weird.

401
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,080
Your Highness.

402
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,050
Wei Ying Luo had the painting.

403
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,530
His Majesty must have gifted it to her.

404
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,880
But...

405
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,730
she dared give the imperial gift...

406
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,580
to Empress Dowager.

407
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,110
That's so funny.

408
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,430
His Majesty bestowed it on her.

409
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,840
And now it's returned to him.

410
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,930
No wonder His Majesty was so mad.

411
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,560
I think...

412
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,640
it's game over for Wei Ying Luo.

413
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,390
She's very smart.

414
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,210
And she'll never dig her own grave.

415
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,990
-Your Majesty!
-Noble Lady Wei!

416
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,030
What?

417
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,720
Where are you going?
It's none of your business.

418
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,680
But His Majesty looks so mad.

419
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,030
Your mistress should reap what she sows.

420
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,920
She gave His Majesty's gift
to someone else!

421
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,360
But it's not some random person.

422
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,560
It's Empress Dowager!

423
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,280
If it were not Empress Dowager,

424
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,990
your mistress would've
been beheaded at once!

425
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,990
Your Majesty,

426
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,770
what are you doing?

427
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,550
Even if I'd falsely accused
and mistreated you,

428
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,550
you could've argued with me.

429
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,040
You endured it without telling me.

430
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,720
And you blamed me for treating you coldly.

431
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,640
Why?

432
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,520
I'm just a noble lady.

433
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,620
I obtained your favour all of sudden.

434
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,400
Of course other mistresses
were jealous of me.

435
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,190
If I always complain to you about it,

436
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,630
you'll believe me once or twice.

437
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,980
But as time goes by,

438
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,020
you'll get annoyed...

439
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,200
even if you believe me.

440
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,150
Thus, I chose to shut my mouth.

441
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,960
Why did you give that painting...

442
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,480
to Empress Dowager?

443
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,300
Empress Dowager liked it.

444
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,960
Of course I had to give it to her.

445
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,480
You're lying!

446
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,200
In your opinion,

447
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,680
why did I do so?

448
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,240
All concubines in the harem,

449
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,290
including Her Majesty,

450
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,160
obey me.

451
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,520
Only you.

452
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,840
You're bold and unscrupulous.

453
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,280
You're moody.

454
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,790
You want me to always think of you.

455
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,560
You want me to hold you
close to my heart all the time.

456
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,550
Wei Ying Luo,

457
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,240
you think I can't see through
your devious scheme?

458
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,800
Since you've seen through it,

459
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,910
why are you still mad?

460
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,900
You...

461
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,290
If you're angry,

462
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,360
I'll ask Empress Dowager...

463
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,240
to return the painting to me.

464
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,290
It's no big deal.

465
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,230
Anger is bad for your health.

466
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,160
Stop talking...

467
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,730
or I'll break your neck!

468
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,930
Did I hurt you?

469
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,210
I didn't actually strangle it.

470
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,830
You fooled me again.

471
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,230
Your Majesty!

472
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,350
Wei Ying Luo,

473
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,050
if you dare anger me again,

474
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,320
I won't spare you.

475
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,290
Get it?

476
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,760
This is who I am.

477
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,480
I'll never change.

478
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,450
Li Yu, issue a decree.

479
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,600
Appoint Minister of Works
Hadaha as the envoy,

480
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,220
and Wu Ling An of the Secretariat
as the deputy envoy...

481
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,170
to handle the conferment ceremony
of Noble Lady Wei as Concubine Ling.

482
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,310
Also,

483
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,320
Concubine Jia is to be grounded
and ponder on her mistake for a month,

484
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,080
And she'll copy the Virtues of a Woman
for one hundred times.

485
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,160
Yes.

486
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,410
The word Ling...

487
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,200
comes from the Major Court Hymns
in Classic of Poetry.

488
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,320
It means elegant temperament,
good character,

489
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,160
wonderful reputation and morality,
worthy of being admired.

490
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,050
One should be perfect enough...

491
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,010
to be worthy of such a title.

492
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,910
What's wrong with His Majesty?

493
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,980
He's very furious a few days ago.

494
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,910
And now he gave her this title.

495
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,080
Wei Ying Luo is really something.

496
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,080
It's been only three months
since she entered the palace.

497
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,480
But she's risen through the ranks.
It's really frightening.

498
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,820
In that case,

499
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,350
she can't stay here anymore.

500
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,720
Are you planning to
make a move, Your Highness?

501
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,690
Even if I'm going to make a move,

502
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,010
I'll never dirty my hands.

503
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,230
Your Highness,

504
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,880
what do you mean?

505
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,850
The young Concubine Jia hates...

506
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,640
Wei Ying Luo the most.

507
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,730
Your Majesty!

508
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,150
Your Majesty...

509
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,280
It's a great victory against Jinchuan!

510
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,800
General Fu Heng commanded the army...

511
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,460
and conquered
several fortresses of Jinchuan!

512
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,690
Really?

513
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,870
We won? Fu Heng won?

514
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,920
It's a great victory, Your Majesty!

515
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,160
The Tusi of Jinchuan Slob Dpon
submitted the surrender letter.

516
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Our army will set out to return at once.

517
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,170
Good!

518
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,930
I didn't make the wrong choice.

519
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,730
Fu Heng is indeed a rare military talent.

520
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,410
Issue a decree.

521
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,120
Tell Fu Heng to return to the capital
first and report on his duty.

522
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,440
Yes...

523
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,690
Third Young Master is back!

524
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,130
Third Young Master.

525
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,680
Third Young Master is back!

526
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,540
Mother, I'm back.

527
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,210
It's been three years since you left.

528
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,770
I've missed and thought of you every day.

529
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,730
What took you so long?

530
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,440
Mother, I'm here now.

531
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,370
It's good that you're back.

532
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,600
Mother and I...

533
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,400
have been worried about you.

534
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,800
You left her...

535
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,320
all alone here.

536
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,980
She had a difficult labour...

537
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,150
and almost died from it.

538
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,760
Luckily I asked the servants
to break that door open.

539
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,110
If not,

540
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,200
I wouldn't have found out
about my grandchild.

541
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,520
Isn't everything fine now?

542
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,190
Everything is fine now...

543
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,810
Go meet your son.

544
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,910
An.

545
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,280
An.

546
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,680
Come.

547
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,420
Come. Call him Father.

548
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,620
Do it.

549
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,330
Mother,

550
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,240
I need to go to the palace
and report on my duty.

551
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,700
I can't stay here for long.

552
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,470
I'll chat to you tonight.

553
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,410
Take Old Mistress back to her room.

554
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,570
Come.

555
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
Fu Heng,

556
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,250
Father named him...

557
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,120
Fu Kang An.

558
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,270
He's your son.

559
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,840
Why are you not happy to see him?

560
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Stop right there!

561
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,180
If you hadn't been heartless
to lock me inside the room,

562
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,290
I wouldn't have almost died.

563
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,720
Now that you're back,

564
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,800
aren't you going to apologise to me?

565
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,160
There were a doctor and a midwife
inside the room.

566
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,490
But what I needed was a caring husband.

567
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,980
Ever since you made that insane decision,

568
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,680
I'm no longer your husband.

569
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,160
The reason why you're able to stay here...

570
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,800
is because I want to save your face.

571
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,470
Since you've given birth to that child,

572
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,340
you should be a good mother.

573
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,120
Don't humiliate yourself.

574
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,160
Are you anxious to enter the palace...

575
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,200
and see your loved ones?

576
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,270
What are you saying?

577
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,470
You probably don't know yet.

578
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,090
She's become His Majesty's Concubine Ling.

579
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
Look at yourself.

580
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,690
You don't care if I embarrass you.

581
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,679
Fu Kang An's existence
doesn't break your heart.

582
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,790
But you face has changed
at the mention of her name.

583
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,449
It's been three years.

584
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:33,730
It's been three years and
you still hold her close to your heart!

585
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,280
But it's such a shame.

586
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,870
She's now His Majesty's woman.

587
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,190
You're lying to me.

588
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,480
Go find out yourself then.

589
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,800
Fu Heng.

590
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,400
Fu Heng, have you lost your mind?

591
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,960
His Majesty is waiting for you
at the Yangxin Hall!

592
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,840
-Why are you here?
-I want to ask her something.

593
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,770
Fu Heng!

594
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,230
Fu Heng!

595
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,120
Now that you've seen it,

596
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,760
you should give up on her.

597
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

598
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,520
Get up!

599
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,320
Fu Heng.

600
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,040
You didn't let me down.

601
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,940
You fought and won the Jinchuan war.

602
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,550
I shall reward you.

603
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,090
Tell me.

604
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,300
What do you want?

605
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,140
Your Majesty,

606
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,220
you'll give me anything I want?

607
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,680
Issue a decree.

608
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,410
Fuca Fu Heng...

609
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,600
is granted the title of
Duke Zhong Yong of the First Rank,

610
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,060
a hat with a gemstone knob,

611
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,280
and four dragon robes.

612
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

613
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,850
Okay.

614
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,070
You may leave now.

615
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,290
I'm taking my leave.

616
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,530
Why?

617
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,660
Young Master,

618
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,100
you haven't eaten or drank anything.

619
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:09,490
You won the battle
and received the rewards.

620
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,850
Why are you sad?

621
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,840
When the war was at its most dire point,

622
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,000
His Majesty issued
twelve decrees in succession,

623
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,720
commanding me to withdraw
the army from the front.

624
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,130
But I defied his decrees.

625
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,160
I fought until the end for the victory.

626
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,410
Because only if I won the war...

627
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,070
could I ask His Majesty
to grant me a wish.

628
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,640
But I'm one step late.

629
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,410
Just one step.

630
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,970
Young Master, what do you want?

631
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,680
I want a person.

632
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,940
I want to trade my battle merits
for a person.

633
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,120
Someone whom I lost.

634
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,080
And I want to reclaim her at all cost.

635
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,210
On the battlefield,

636
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,020
a sword almost pierced through my heart.

637
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,040
At that moment, I thought...

638
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,220
If I could come back alive,

639
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,510
I'd disregard her will and obtain her.

640
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,800
Even if she resented...

641
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,390
and hated me,

642
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,280
I wanted to keep her to my side forever.

643
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,480
Young Master,

644
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,770
this doesn't sound like you at all.

645
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,280
I thought that...

646
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,250
as a man, I must be
generous and forgiving.

647
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,900
As long as she's alive,

648
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,370
I wanted her to lead a happy life.

649
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,190
Now she's doing very well.

650
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,780
She's become Concubine Ling,

651
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,990
a woman favoured by His Majesty.

652
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,110
But I feel so upset.

653
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,430
Qing Lian,

654
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:41,050
do you know what
it feels like to be jealous?

655
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,750
It's like a poisonous snake...

656
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,120
gnawing at my heart all the time.

657
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,050
Young Master.

658
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,890
Anyone will become ugly...

659
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,190
from being jealous.

660
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,450
So when His Majesty
asked me what I wanted,

661
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,260
I couldn't say anything.

662
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,980
I do know that...

663
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,870
that I'll get her into trouble
by acting like this.

664
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,790
But I can't help myself.

665
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,190
I really can't help it.

666
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,840
Young Master,

667
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,880
this isn't your fault.

668
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,520
It's because of the force of circumstance.

669
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,010
You're being hard on yourself.

670
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,840
You're a human.

671
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
Of course you tend to get emotional.

672
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,870
You don't need to always control yourself.

673
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,200
My sister once told me...

674
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,890
that I'll regret it for sure.

675
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,330
Now I really regret it.

676
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,860
I really regret it.

677
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,410
What do I do?
