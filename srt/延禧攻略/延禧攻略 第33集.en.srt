[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,160
Wei Ying Luo, what did you
just call me earlier?

4
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,410
What porridge is this?

5
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,940
-It feels a bit...
-Don't change the subject.

6
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,020
Say it.

7
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,810
What did you call me?

8
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,780
You risked your life to cover up for me.

9
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,940
I called you "Brother"...

10
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,540
because I think it was only right.

11
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,030
From now on, I'm your sworn sister.

12
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,460
We will share our burden and joy together.

13
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,100
That's all?

14
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,560
Wei Ying Luo,

15
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,810
we bow to heaven and earth
when we become sworn siblings.

16
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,270
You mustn't brush me off.

17
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,560
Brother,

18
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,100
only married couple needs that ceremony.

19
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,579
For sworn brothers or sisters,
we burn incenses and bow.

20
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,990
It's fine.

21
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,250
Anyway, this is a very sacred thing.

22
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,800
I want your birth date and time of birth.

23
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,400
We still must get tablets
for the heavens and earth.

24
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,430
Okay?

25
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,650
We are servants of the Labour House.

26
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,780
Just make it simple.

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,180
No, we mustn't!

28
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,250
You're my only little sister in my life.

29
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,480
I can't make it simple.

30
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,720
Let's exchange birth time papers later.

31
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,700
Brother, that's not called
birth time paper.

32
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,360
It's called a "sworn brotherhood paper".

33
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,110
Fine, who cares?

34
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,410
Anyway, we are writing it.

35
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,260
Eat your meal, we'll write
those papers after that.

36
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,930
Wei Ying Luo.

37
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,390
What's that for?

38
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,970
Promise me you'll write it after eating.

39
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,640
Fine.

40
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,030
Whatever you call it is just fine.

41
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,250
Miss Ming Yu!

42
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,160
Miss Ming Yu!

43
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,670
Guard Fuca?

44
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,530
Guard Fuca, you need anything from me?

45
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,050
Miss Ming Yu, can you come out
and have a word with me?

46
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,530
Aren't you afraid that I'll pester you?

47
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,220
You're not that kind of person.

48
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,920
That's right. I can move on from anything.

49
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,320
Miss Ming Yu,

50
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,450
can you come out and talk with me?

51
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,850
Guard Fuca!

52
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,100
What did he tell you?

53
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,820
A secret!

54
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,510
I heard that after
Noble Consort Gao died,

55
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,140
her two sisters also died.

56
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,550
Lower your voice.

57
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,780
But now that Noble Consort Gao is gone,

58
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,140
Her Majesty will be dying soon.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,680
What are you talking about?
What nonsense is this!

60
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,000
Let me go!

61
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,480
Her Majesty is currently recovering.

62
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,040
Mind your attitude.

63
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,510
I was telling the truth.

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,550
People from Changchun Palace said
Her Majesty has been having fever.

65
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,480
Her condition has gone even worse.

66
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,910
Let me go.

67
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,270
You crazy!

68
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,860
You always...

69
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,000
fall sleep before midnight.

70
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,040
Why are you here?

71
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,890
Her Majesty...

72
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,760
Young Master,

73
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,490
you tricked me into coming here.

74
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,850
Her Majesty is completely fine.

75
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,940
-Am I right?
-You knew it's a trick just by seeing me.

76
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,950
You are not that stupid after all.

77
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,080
Do you know how hard
it is for me to come here?

78
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,960
How could you trick me?

79
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,930
You used to be a high-ranking
servant of Her Majesty.

80
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,320
Visiting your former master means
you are grateful for her guidance.

81
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,930
You can simply walk in here
from the front entrance.

82
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,810
Why do you sneak in through the window?

83
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,100
I...

84
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,480
Since I caught you sneaking in,

85
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,950
there is no need to hide.

86
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,510
Come in the way you should.

87
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,440
I'm not coming any more.

88
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,350
What do you want?

89
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,990
Whenever Ming Yu is on duty,

90
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,760
there won't be anyone
here at midnight hour.

91
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,360
You can come visit Her Majesty.

92
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,600
Remember, only at midnight.

93
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,810
Okay already. Climb out now.

94
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,560
Fu Heng!

95
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,650
It isn't easy for me to come here
and visit Her Majesty.

96
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,900
I should at least see her I leave.

97
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,210
Ying Luo.

98
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,330
Don't forget what I said.

99
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,470
I'll keep reminding you
should you ever forget.

100
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,010
[If you want to stay in
the Labour House, I'll wait for you.]

101
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,010
[I'll wait until you let go of your grudge
and freed yourself of burden.]

102
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,230
[No matter how long it will take,]

103
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,320
[even a lifetime,]

104
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,980
[I will wait for you.]

105
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,600
Guard Fuca.

106
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,030
Miss Ming Yu,

107
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,289
thank you.

108
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,860
You don't need to thank me.

109
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,299
But was she really involved
in Noble Consort's death?

110
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,870
Fine, I won't pry.

111
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,450
At least she has the conscience
to visit Her Majesty.

112
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,850
From now on, I will let her in
when I'm on duty.

113
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,380
You don't need to worry.

114
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,190
Imperial Noble Consort Gao,

115
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,000
provided merit, prestige,
and auspiciousness in life.

116
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,760
She assisted in managing
the imperial harem.

117
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,290
and was well-versed
in painting and history.

118
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,700
She was kind, benevolent, and been
part of the imperial harem at a young age.

119
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,200
She was a good assistance
in cleansing the harem,

120
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,000
and was sincerely filial.

121
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,800
She had a majestic prestige,

122
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,560
well-trained in being stately and poised.

123
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,160
She is regarded with esteem,

124
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,810
and regarded as an auspicious being.

125
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,130
She didn't let her title be in vain.

126
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,600
The imperial harem has lost a model.

127
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,080
Hence,

128
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,520
she will be referred
with her posthumous title,

129
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,520
"Imperial Noble Consort Huixian".

130
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,350
So be it.

131
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,870
Spread the words.

132
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,100
Yes.

133
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,480
Your Majesty, the Ministry of Rites
and the Imperial Household Department...

134
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,250
are in conflict over
details of the funeral.

135
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,580
They need Your Majesty to pass judgement.

136
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,300
The Empress is gravely ill,

137
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,870
she is unable to manage such affairs.

138
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,820
I'll leave it to you to decide.

139
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,670
In my opinion,

140
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,030
let's follow the funeral rites of
the late Imperial Noble Consort Dunsu.

141
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,440
Your Majesty has much works to finish,
I shall not bother you any longer.

142
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,900
I will take my leave now.

143
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,960
Consort Xian!

144
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,350
How is Consort Xian's condition?

145
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,450
Your Majesty, don't be anxious.

146
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,790
I still have some questions.

147
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,770
Zhen, does Her Highness
have other symptoms recently?

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,880
Her Highness has fever
and coughs at night,

149
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,170
she phlegm in the morning.

150
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,010
Whenever she coughs,
the pain at her chest is unbearable.

151
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,570
Zhen, don't make up things.

152
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,210
Your Highness, you're seriously ill.

153
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,320
You just hold it to yourself
and refuse to have it checked.

154
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,920
What if you really get sick,
what do we do then?

155
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,890
Your Majesty, don't listen to Zhen.

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,360
I indeed had a bad cough a few days ago.

157
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,140
I'm feeling better today.

158
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,800
Your Highness, you're so wrong.

159
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,450
Having chest pain when coughing...

160
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,890
indicates the pain comes
from your chest as well.

161
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,770
This could be serious.

162
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,920
Zhen.

163
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,860
Be honest with us.

164
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,530
How is Consort Xian lately?

165
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,330
Your Majesty, Her Highness's wound
has repeatedly festered and swelled.

166
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,320
I couldn't bear to look at it any more.

167
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,760
But just to handle the funeral
of Noble Consort Gao,

168
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,190
she put up with the pain,

169
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,750
just to finish her work
at the Chuxiu Palace.

170
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,330
I've tried to persuade
Her Highness many times,

171
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,040
but Her Highness wouldn't listen to me.

172
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,100
Zhen, that is enough.

173
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,640
Leave us.

174
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,330
Yes.

175
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,480
Consort Xian,

176
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,710
you are ill.

177
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,700
Why didn't you tell me?

178
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,150
It's Zhen's fault for exaggerating.

179
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,970
I'm really fine.

180
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,840
The wound is festering.

181
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,430
How is this fine?

182
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,080
No.

183
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,970
I want you to put your work aside.

184
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,630
As for the funeral,

185
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,130
I will leave it to a funeral officer.

186
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,640
Your Majesty….

187
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,090
Listen to me.

188
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,560
Leave the work and rest well.

189
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,570
I was entrusted by Empress Dowager...

190
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,430
to be in charge of the six palaces.

191
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,990
I can't abandon my work just because
of some minor wound.

192
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,600
Her Majesty is ill

193
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,370
Noble Consort Gao's death was so sudden.

194
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,970
There is unrest and rumours circling
around the Forbidden City.

195
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,490
Even if I'm ill,

196
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,930
I must get over it.

197
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,810
All I need is to make sure I make it
through Noble Consort Gao's funeral.

198
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,250
Your Majesty will have my word,

199
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,770
I will focus on recovery
after the work is done.

200
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,550
Why are you so stubborn?

201
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,700
What are you doing?

202
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,020
Please get up.

203
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,140
Please accept my request.

204
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,200
Let me finish my task,
so my mind can be at ease.

205
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,140
You have my word,

206
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,240
after the funeral of
the Noble Consort Gao,

207
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,090
I will set the work aside and return
to Chengqian Palace,

208
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,500
I'll stay there and heal.

209
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,370
Your Majesty,

210
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,030
Consort Xian is gentle and kind.

211
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,070
She also is a virtuous person.

212
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,300
Ever since she started handling
of the palace, everyone praises her.

213
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,920
We don't see this every day in the palace.

214
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,570
When Noble Consort Gao was still alive,

215
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,210
she would always purposely
make things difficult for her.

216
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,770
Sometimes, even I couldn't take it.

217
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,610
But she totally didn't mind at all.

218
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,580
Even when she was ailing, she never
stopped her works for Noble Consort Gao.

219
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,960
If the soul of Noble Consort Gao
could see this now,

220
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,330
she must feel so ashamed.

221
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,020
You are right.

222
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,770
I agree that...

223
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,820
even I would admire
and respect Consort Xian.

224
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,640
She has attended to you
since you were a prince.

225
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,220
Even though she has
no children of her own,

226
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,940
she's a very considerate person.

227
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,290
While taking care of the funeral,

228
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:48,020
she doesn't forget to visit me
and send her regards.

229
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,310
If the other imperial consorts
could be half as good as her,

230
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,450
I wouldn't need to worry any more.

231
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,320
Are you reminding me...

232
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,850
it's time to promote
Consort Xian's rank?

233
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,480
That's just one reason.

234
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,630
I want to remind you...

235
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,150
when the chance comes for us,
we must not forget to seize it.

236
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,250
Regret will mean nothing
once we missed the chance.

237
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,440
Learn to cherish the people
you have with you now.

238
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,420
Yes.

239
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,850
As mandated by the heavens,
His Majesty is giving this decree.

240
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,600
Consort Xian from the Hoifa-Nara Clan
is gentle and kind to all,

241
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,100
a merciful character.

242
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,160
Today, she will be promoted
to the rank of Noble Consort...

243
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,730
as to show my graces and care.

244
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,350
End of decree.

245
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,590
Much obliged, His Majesty.

246
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,060
Your Majesty,

247
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,130
Physician told me.

248
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,520
If you keeping lying in bed,

249
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,380
your ability walk and full recovery
will be affected.

250
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,310
Your Majesty,

251
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,060
I miss you.

252
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,770
I want to hear your voice.

253
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,410
I don't mind if you yell at me.

254
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,010
Please open your eyes.

255
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,040
Please?

256
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,160
Greetings to Your Majesty!

257
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,790
Don't follow me.

258
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,820
I want to talk to the Empress alone.

259
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,170
Your Majesty!

260
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,600
Your Majesty!

261
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,250
Chief Li, His Majesty will need
someone to attend to him inside.

262
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,440
If I'm inside, it's easier
to serve him water or tea.

263
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,089
Didn't you hear what His Majesty said?

264
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,210
He wants to speak to Her Majesty alone.

265
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,650
Do you want to disobey the decree?

266
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,030
My Empress.

267
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,410
I want to talk with someone.

268
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,260
But the Forbidden City may be huge,

269
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,520
there is none who would listen to me.

270
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,020
How good it would be...

271
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,710
if you're awake right now?

272
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,120
Much have happened in the palace lately.

273
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,880
Noble Consort Gao has died.

274
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,240
She was married to
me when she was 14 years old,

275
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,490
she has accompanied me
for twelve years.

276
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,670
I know...

277
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,550
she has always yearned for care and love.

278
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,020
But all I could give her...

279
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,240
is merely the title of
Imperial Noble Consort.

280
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,130
I feel very sad...

281
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,050
for her passing.

282
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,380
But if I were given another chance,

283
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,170
I will still make the same choice.

284
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,490
Guess who I am.

285
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,490
Wan's mother...

286
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,650
was my wet nurse.

287
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,970
She was there with me as I grew up.

288
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,870
I was closer to her...

289
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,770
than other people.

290
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,250
But because of a simple joke,

291
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,010
she was executed by my father.

292
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,170
At first,

293
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,640
I resented my father for it.

294
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,400
But when Noble Consort Nian died,

295
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,780
I saw with my own eyes...

296
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,890
that my father was crying...

297
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,270
in front of her coffin...

298
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,460
after driving everyone away.

299
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,720
Just a month after
Noble Consort Nian passing,

300
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,920
Nian Geng Yao was removed of
noble title and rank.

301
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,080
Only by then...

302
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,860
did I suddenly realize that...

303
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,060
Wan's death...

304
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,050
was a warning from my father.

305
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,690
As an Emperor,

306
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,530
I can favour my imperial consorts,

307
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,570
but I can never love them.

308
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,590
My feelings for Wan...

309
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,330
has doomed her.

310
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,340
My Empress.

311
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:49,730
My Empress?

312
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,230
Can you hear me?

313
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,920
My Empress?

314
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,700
My Empress.

315
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,650
Do you think I am...

316
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,650
too cruel and heartless as well?

317
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,500
I have failed you.

318
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,160
I have failed Noble Consort Gao.

319
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,530
Come out.

320
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,840
Is that annoying guy finally gone?

321
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,340
What do you think?

322
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,520
Put down the tea and leave.

323
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,690
He forced me.

324
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,020
Why are you hiding here?

325
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,730
Your Majesty,

326
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,700
I come to visit Her Majesty.

327
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,060
When heard the footsteps,

328
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,280
I panicked, so I hid behind the curtain.

329
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,300
Who allowed you to sneak into here?

330
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,370
Your Majesty,

331
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,910
I miss Her Majesty.

332
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,610
You really should be grateful
to the Empress.

333
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,100
But even so, you should have fear for her.

334
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,820
Because without her protection,

335
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,320
I can have you killed at anytime.

336
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,420
Her Majesty!

337
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,450
Your Majesty,
Her Majesty moved her hand just now!

338
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,840
Hand...

339
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,470
She moved her hand…

340
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,330
Her hand…

341
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,520
Your Highness,
it's time to apply your medicine.

342
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,380
But I already have it.

343
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,060
That is a medicine taken orally
more nourishment.

344
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,060
This one is amber cream.

345
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,540
It is made from amber powder,

346
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,840
cinnabar, and white otter's spine.

347
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,770
It will heal the wound faster
if you use it every day.

348
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,500
It can also helps remove scars.

349
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,560
Your Highness, that cream is priceless!

350
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,450
Why are you wasting it on mere plants?

351
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,580
It will be too late to heal the wound
once the scar formed.

352
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,560
I want to have that scar.

353
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,740
I want it deep just like the impression
I am leaving on His Majesty.

354
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,880
Let him forever remember...

355
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,160
that I got hurt because of him.

356
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,680
Guard Fuca.

357
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,020
How may I help, Your Highness?

358
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,680
Much unpleasant incidents have happened.

359
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,540
First, Her Majesty fell ill.

360
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,850
Next, Noble Consort Gao died.

361
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,000
The Changchun Palace
is one of the inner palaces.

362
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,770
If you come and go as you please,
there will surely be rumours.

363
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,780
Your Highness,

364
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,010
Her Majesty is my older sister.

365
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,360
His Majesty allowed me to visit her.

366
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,670
May I ask,

367
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,980
why are you giving me such advices?

368
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,770
I came across a rumour,

369
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,090
rumour has it you were
obsessed with Wei Ying Luo,

370
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,410
You turned down the lady
betrothed to you by His Majesty.

371
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,070
It's really absurd.

372
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,230
You come from a noble family
and you are a man with class,

373
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,440
why would you fall in love
with a handmaiden?

374
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,170
Those who spread such rumours...

375
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,430
is clearly harbouring evil intentions.

376
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,410
However, even if it's just a rumour,

377
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,600
it's only a matter of time...

378
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,660
before it reaches His Majesty.

379
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,080
It might affect your career.

380
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,230
It's not a rumour.

381
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,810
Thank you for your warning.

382
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,260
This is my personal life.

383
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,030
I cannot go into more details.

384
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,330
I'll take my leave.

385
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,090
The Forbidden City is a place
where troubles brews without reasons.

386
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,380
To survive here,

387
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,720
you must be cautious and
never let your guard down.

388
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,560
Guard Fuca,

389
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,810
you are the brother of Her Majesty,

390
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,560
and a close subject to His Majesty.

391
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,000
You are destined
to prosper in your career.

392
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,740
Don't get bewitched by a woman
and ruin your own future.

393
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,790
Your Highness, you're out of line.

394
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:18,970
Your Highness!

395
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,000
Your Highness!

396
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,850
What's wrong with you?

397
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,760
Your Highness,

398
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,680
you agreed not to write it again.

399
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,380
Why have you forgotten it?

400
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,050
If people see it, you'll get executed.

401
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,530
Executed?

402
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,920
Yes.

403
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,250
Not only your reputation
will be tarnished,

404
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,330
even Guard Fuca...

405
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,700
Don't say his name!

406
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,440
Chun He...

407
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,130
Chun He...

408
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,850
I remember everything, but he doesn't.

409
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,450
Over the years,

410
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,360
all the hard work I've done...

411
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,840
has been nothing but a joke.

412
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,110
I kept a close eyes on all the noble
families in the capital.

413
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,010
Even when my heart breaks,

414
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,170
I still recommended them
to Her Majesty,

415
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,570
I planned for his future.

416
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,690
All because I knew...

417
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,630
that one day,

418
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,340
he'll get married and have children.

419
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,450
Which is why,

420
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,520
I'm going to choose
the most beautiful...

421
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,450
and best lady to accompany him.

422
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,410
But what about him?

423
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,040
He actually fell in love with
a servant from the Labour House!

424
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,430
This is utterly ridiculous!

425
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,910
Your Highness,

426
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,870
that is their family matter.

427
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,300
Why must you torment yourself?

428
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,860
I've followed Her Majesty for many years.

429
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,720
Now, Fu Heng has committed a mistake.

430
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,010
How could I not share
the burden of Her Majesty?

431
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,250
Your Highness,

432
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,090
what are you doing?

433
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,820
Call the supervisor of the Labour House.

434
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,400
Your father doesn't focus
on managing the flood,

435
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,440
and instead wants to return
for the funeral.

436
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,020
This is so disappointing.

437
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,700
Your Majesty,

438
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,440
my father values the bond
among family members.

439
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,870
Noble Consort's death was too sudden.

440
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,630
And my two little sisters too.

441
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,160
That is too much
heartbreaks for my father.

442
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,120
Shut up!

443
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,180
The bond between father and daughter
come natural to all of us.

444
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,310
There's nothing wrong with
him returning for the funeral.

445
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,030
However,

446
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,460
there is flooding everywhere.

447
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,350
Thousands of refugees are now homeless.

448
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,850
Their homes is now under a body of water.

449
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,480
Their loved ones have died.

450
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,220
Who can save them then?

451
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,250
Both Commissioner of External Rivers,
Chen Ke Jun...

452
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,880
and Commissioner of Coast Defence,
Wang De Xuan,

453
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,830
have a deficit of 30,000 taels.

454
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,980
As the Viceroy of Southern Rivers,

455
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,050
Gao Bin didn't even notice it.

456
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,780
He acted as if it's just normal.

457
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,150
I put up with his mistakes.

458
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,720
I just want him to focus
on controlling the flooding.

459
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,520
But he only thinks about
returning to the capital.

460
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,200
He deserves to dies!

461
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,010
Your Majesty, please forgive him.

462
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,530
Your Majesty, my apologies.

463
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,680
Please calm down.

464
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,490
Get out!

465
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,380
I will take my leave.

466
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,690
Your Majesty, please calm down.

467
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,910
Spread my decree.

468
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,630
Gao Bin has obtained great imperial grace,

469
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,350
but he didn't know how to repay it.

470
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,110
He will be stripped off of his post...

471
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,050
but will stay to work
as to pay for his crime.

472
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,920
Your Majesty.

473
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,220
[Yangxin Hall]

474
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,710
What hour is it?

475
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,730
Your Majesty, it's already midnight.

476
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,260
Greeting to Your Majesty.

477
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,179
Your Majesty, I will never
allow Wei Ying Luo to enter.

478
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:18,489
Is she here?

479
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,520
Do you need me to ask again?

480
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,650
She…

481
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,239
She's in the backyard.

482
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,179
Your Majesty,

483
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,179
I'm guilty.

484
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,010
What are you holding?

485
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,010
The medicine prescribed by Physician Ye.

486
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,990
I want to do something for Her Majesty.

487
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,460
So I ask for this job.

488
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,820
Rise.

489
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,850
You are indeed devoted to the Empress.

490
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,350
Your Majesty,

491
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,670
Her Majesty is sincere to you as well.

492
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,650
Imperial consorts...

493
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,980
want either my attention...

494
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,420
or the title,

495
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,900
or a reward.

496
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,090
There is no difference in their nature.

497
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,340
Your Majesty,

498
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,270
Her Majesty is different.

499
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,790
I know.

500
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,400
She seeks sincerity.

501
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,090
But why doesn't she realize that...

502
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,970
as an Emperor,

503
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,240
I bear the lives of millions of people?

504
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,350
As the master of the world,

505
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,940
how could I be immersed in love?

506
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,080
Your Majesty,
you are saying the consorts...

507
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,640
are shallow and inconsiderate?

508
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,650
Have I said it wrong?

509
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,500
Now, there are floods everywhere.

510
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,410
refugees have nowhere to go.

511
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,190
I...

512
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,810
exhausted all the resources
to control the flooding.

513
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,890
But the officials
I put in charge of the duty...

514
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,550
make false reports
to fill in their own pockets.

515
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,610
Now the refugees outside of the capital...

516
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,870
are merely a portion of a greater number.

517
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,760
Worries has engulfed me.

518
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,770
I can barely fall asleep.

519
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,710
But what are these
imperial consorts doing?

520
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,660
Your Majesty.

521
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,010
Ever women are born,

522
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,080
they have been confined by
the norms of society.

523
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,660
Even after marriage,

524
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,590
a woman is only transferring
from one cage to another cage.

525
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,420
She is clearly a pampered yellow oriole.

526
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,760
How can it be like the eagle,

527
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,930
seeing the world with wide vision
and soaring over the four seas?

528
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,140
Don't forget.

529
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:34,120
That very same cage was
forged by the men of this world.

530
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,280
How dare you!

531
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,440
I have misspoken, my apologies.

532
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,240
I am stupid now.

533
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,910
I am wasting my time
talking to an ignorant servant.

534
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,250
Quietly listen to the raindrops
falling in the palace.

535
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,560
The house, shielded for a moment
from the rampant bustling.

536
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,080
Nothing is more entertaining than poetry,

537
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,760
there comes the fragrance
of the plum shoots.

538
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,410
You can recite my poetry?

539
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,400
Right after Her Majesty taught me
the Four Books and Five Classics,

540
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,970
she started to teach me
Your Majesty's poetry and proses.

541
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,950
I refused to learn this,

542
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,250
but Her Majesty insisted in doing that.

543
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,330
[Since His Majesty's ascension to throne,
he has always valued mercy.]

544
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,880
[He stopped opening new farmlands.]

545
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,440
[He stopped the practice
of donation for imperial court.]

546
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,920
[He put priority on agriculture.]

547
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,290
[He exonerated those wrongly jailed.]

548
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,120
[He helped people out of misery.]

549
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,060
[So, he is a good Emperor.]

550
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,840
She really said so?

551
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,090
Yes.

552
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,050
I want to be a wise ruler.

553
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,030
But reality tells me,

554
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,990
it's truly too difficult.

555
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,800
This empire is like a giant ship.

556
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,410
I want to take the helm.

557
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,130
But I am undermined at every corner.

558
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,560
I have gone astray.

559
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,040
Your Majesty,

560
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,700
there once was a folk rhyme in Wuzhong.

561
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,230
Qianlong's treasure for longevity.

562
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,000
Qianlong's money brings prosperity.

563
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,840
I know,

564
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,070
the people will remember...

565
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,540
all Your Majesty has done for them.

566
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,190
They will never forget it.

567
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:26,930
I know...

568
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:30,430
the nation is vast and troubles
brew in every place.

569
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,570
But as long as Your Majesty
resolve them one step at a time,

570
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,290
even if the results can be disappointing,

571
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:41,020
at least you didn't fail the will of
heaven and your own conscience.

572
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,610
Have a good conscience?

573
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,570
I will remember...

574
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,760
these words.

575
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,780
Actually, Her Majesty can recite...

576
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,800
all your poetry and prose to perfection.

577
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,080
But it wasn't because your poetry
skills are outstanding.

578
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,530
But because she wants to
understand your thoughts and worries.

579
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,770
She wants to know
when you'll feel joy and sadness.

580
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,030
If Your Majesty is willing
to tell all your troubles...

581
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,550
to Her Majesty,

582
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,970
you'll never be short on someone
who understands you.

583
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,440
So all you were saying was to
put up some good words for my Empress.

584
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,150
That made her caring for you worthwhile.

585
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,840
Wait.

586
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,520
Say that again.

587
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,550
If you are willing to tell
your thoughts to Her Majesty,

588
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,640
you'll never be short on someone
who understands you.

589
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,840
No. Not that one.

590
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,600
You said you refused to learn it.

591
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,370
And you said my poetry skills
aren't outstanding.

592
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,650
What did you mean?

593
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,000
Wei Ying Luo,

594
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,040
how dare you look down on me!

595
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,730
Her Majesty is waiting.

596
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,270
I must go to her now.

597
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,400
Heng Chen,

598
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,410
as Prime Minister of State Affairs,

599
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,770
do you know the yearly balance
of our treasury?

600
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,070
If Your Majesty wishes to know,

601
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,230
I will have the Ministry of Revenue
to report it.

602
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,570
Ortai, how about you?

603
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,140
Your Majesty, I will go now to...

604
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,160
Don't bother.

605
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,520
I know it.

606
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,340
In my first year after
I ascended the throne,

607
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,530
the Ministry of Revenue had
33,950,000 taels of silver.

608
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,310
In the second year,

609
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,210
it was thirty-four million,
34,380,000 taels of silver.

610
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,480
And by this year,

611
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,940
the number is
33,170,000 taels of silver.

612
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,920
Other than the treasury,
the various provincial treasuries,

613
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,250
it's safe to say we balance is sufficient.

614
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,500
So I will remit the taxes
and grains nationwide.

615
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,020
Your Majesty.

616
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,890
Each year, the taxes...

617
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,080
pay for salaries and various expenses
of officials and soldiers.

618
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,950
The remainder is less
than two million taels.

619
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,830
That isn't enough for disaster relief.

620
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,660
If you remit all the taxes and grains now,

621
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,090
it will take a toll on our financials.

622
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,170
The Ministry of Revenue
can't make the ends meet.

623
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,850
My grandfather had been on
the throne for sixty one year.

624
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,890
He exempted the people of taxes once.

625
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,550
My father always put
effort into reducing levy.

626
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,240
I...

627
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,690
wish to made the same decision
as inspired by their actions,

628
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,440
I will send out my decree at once.

629
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,530
The people will be exempted from
all tax payments and grain levies.

630
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,890
What's wrong with that?

631
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,810
Your Majesty,

632
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,320
Emperor Kangxi gave that order during
his 49th year of reign.

633
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,610
But Your Majesty has been
on the throne for only ten years.

634
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:56,460
Perhaps this decision
seems a little too impatient.
