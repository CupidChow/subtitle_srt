[Episode 61]

3
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,039
Look, how warm it is!

4
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,140
Stay still.

5
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,750
Since she's not willing to do it,

6
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,050
why continue transcribing
the sutra with blood?

7
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,110
That's the biggest disrespect to Buddha.

8
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Empress Dowager,

9
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,280
Concubine Ling stayed with you
at the Yuanming Garden for three years.

10
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,920
You should know...

11
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,780
what kind of person she is.

12
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,200
It's exactly because
I've spent three years with her...

13
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,360
that I know her too well.

14
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,760
This Wei Ying Luo...

15
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,090
is too clever.

16
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,550
She can use all viable methods...

17
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,160
to make you like her.

18
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,880
Like Rongyin and...

19
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,670
Emperor.

20
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,020
They all fell for her.

21
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,560
Perhaps...

22
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,160
this is a misunderstanding?

23
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,410
If she didn't complain,

24
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,900
how would Concubine Shun know about it?

25
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,480
Your Highness, are you here to deliver
the newly transcribed sutra volume?

26
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,350
Yes.

27
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,280
I'll pass it to Empress Dowager
on your behalf.

28
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,580
I'll come again tomorrow.

29
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,230
No need.

30
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,810
It's such a difficult work.

31
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,480
Empress Dowager is
concerned about your health...

32
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,200
so she's pardoned you from it.

33
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,970
Transcribing the sutra is a form of merit.

34
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,760
I'm willing to do it.

35
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,500
It's not a difficult work.

36
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,680
I'm just relaying Empress Dowager's order.

37
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,560
Another thing is that...

38
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,640
Empress Dowager...

39
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,760
will be meditating these days.

40
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,670
You need not to come and greet her,
Your Highness.

41
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,000
What happened?

42
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,960
Empress Dowager's manner
changed all of a sudden.

43
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,680
Don't worry about me.

44
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,340
You should think about
your own matter instead.

45
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,280
Your Highness.

46
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,470
Your Highness,

47
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,680
may I talk to Ming Yu...

48
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,390
for a while?

49
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,940
Ming Yu.

50
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,760
Don't complicate things.

51
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,140
Get things straight.

52
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,280
Ming Yu!

53
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,850
Have you lost your mind?

54
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,160
I'm still here in the palace.

55
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,060
It's inappropriate for you
to grab me like this!

56
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,720
I've asked for His Majesty's permission.

57
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,310
And he's agreed on our marriage.

58
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,030
What's wrong with talking to my fiancÃ©e?

59
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,850
Ming Yu, I want to know...

60
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,820
why you sent me back
all the betrothal gifts?

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,390
I've given it a thought.

62
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,159
And I don't think it's right.

63
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,320
What's not right?

64
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,730
You'll have to go to
the battlefield in future!

65
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,730
Who knows when you will return?

66
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,430
I don't want to be a widow.

67
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,610
I don't believe you.

68
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
If you didn't want to become a widow,

69
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,820
why would you agree to...

70
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,950
go out with me?

71
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,840
That's to help Ying Luo...

72
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,000
get information.

73
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,580
You stayed up all night...

74
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,200
to make headband and cook dishes for me...

75
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,890
because you just wanted to use me?

76
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,550
In order to use you,

77
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,450
I'd have to make some sacrifice first.

78
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,730
Your words are cruel...

79
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,700
but there are tears...

80
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,160
in your eyes.

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,090
Ming Yu, what happened?

82
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,110
That's enough.

83
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
Stop wasting your time on me.

84
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,270
-I've got to go.
-Ming Yu!

85
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,970
I don't believe...

86
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,550
a word you said!

87
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,810
Once we get married,

88
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,880
I'll find out the truth.

89
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,120
I've made an inventory of
the qin at Yuanming Garden.

90
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,920
There are 218 in total.

91
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,720
They're tuned and stored...

92
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,950
during the fourth year of
Emperor Yongzheng's reign.

93
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,480
So many years have passed,

94
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,990
due to the lack of proper management
as well as versed qin players.

95
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,840
it's quite a pity that...

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,920
they're abandoned
in the storeroom like that.

97
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,120
What a great
Plum Blossom Leaf-shaped qin!

98
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,920
I can't believe it's abandoned.

99
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,440
Yuan Chun Wang,

100
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,390
order those at the Yuanming Garden...

101
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,500
to send one qin here every five days.

102
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,920
I'll tune them myself
and catalogue them again.

103
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,170
I'll surely find you a good qin master.

104
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,860
You don't need to do it yourself.

105
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,930
This qin was once
used by Emperor Kangxi.

106
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,760
If one day His Majesty is
in the mood of playing it...

107
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,470
and finds that Emperor Kangxi's item
was abandoned,

108
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,520
he'll surely be furious.

109
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,090
Empress, because of Concubine Shun,

110
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,960
it's been quite a while since
His Majesty came to our palace.

111
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
But you still care about him so much.

112
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,630
Emperor Kangxi's memorial
is in four months.

113
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,799
If His Majesty finds out
just how thoughtful you are,

114
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,049
he'll be very touched.

115
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,150
This cover looks tacky.

116
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,610
I'll design a pattern...

117
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,350
and ask the Imperial Workshop
to make a new one.

118
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,720
Yes.

119
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,750
No, forget about the pattern.

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,040
Just embroider the name of the qin here.

121
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,600
Yes.

122
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,360
Twelfth Prince!

123
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,240
Your Majesty, please forgive me!

124
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,700
I've failed to keep an eye
on Twelfth Prince.

125
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Your Majesty.

126
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,900
Yong Ji, how can you be so naughty?

127
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,310
Go get an experienced qin master
and see if it can be repaired.

128
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,320
Yes.

129
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,310
Stop crying!

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,820
You're not like me at all.

131
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,670
Isn't it time...

132
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,880
for you to take the prince
for a walk in the Imperial Garden?

133
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,760
-Go now.
-Yes.

134
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,240
Your Majesty,
Twelfth Prince is still young.

135
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,640
Don't be angry with him.

136
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,000
He's the legitimate heir to the throne
and the world is watching him.

137
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,610
He's not an ordinary boy.

138
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,570
Mistress, don't worry.

139
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,580
I'll get a good qin master to fix it.

140
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,910
I won't let it affect your plan.

141
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,400
Here. Be careful.

142
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,950
Twelfth Prince,
you can't be naughty again.

143
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,430
If Her Majesty finds out,
she will punish you.

144
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,400
Twelfth Prince is a toddler
who tends to run around.

145
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,630
Isn't Her Majesty being too strict?

146
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,390
What do you know?

147
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,120
Discipline is a form of love.

148
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,610
Twelfth Prince is the legitimate heir...

149
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,270
so he's different.

150
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,280
Mind your mouth or you'll be punished!

151
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,520
Here, Twelfth Prince.

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,920
Slowly.

153
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,760
Let's catch dragonfly there, okay?

154
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,220
Your Majesty.

155
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,880
Prince He sent a gift for Twelfth Prince.

156
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,770
Prince He?

157
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,500
Your Majesty.

158
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,600
[The palace used to celebrate
the Lantern Festival...]

159
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,240
[by piling up colorful lanterns
into a sea turtle,]

160
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,440
[with autumn crickets
placed in the lanterns.]

161
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,000
[Once lit, a spate of
insect cries followed,]

162
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,460
[which was quite fun.]

163
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,340
[Once,]

164
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,360
[in order to grab the cricket inside,]

165
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,760
[I set the sea turtle on fire...]

166
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,440
[and almost burned down
the entire Forbidden City.]

being naughty and mischievous.]

168
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,960
[But when I was five,
I could recite sayings.]

169
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,560
[At seven, I could poetise.]

170
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,170
[Naughty children are smart.]

171
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,660
[When Twelfth Prince attends
the academy in future,]

172
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,800
[I'll have the teachers train him well.]

173
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,220
[Don't worry, Your Majesty.]

174
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,470
Prince, come here!

175
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,120
Look, this is very fun.

176
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,090
Come here.

177
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,240
Here, look.

178
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,430
Look, what is this?

179
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,890
What about this?

180
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,220
Father, they hit me.

181
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,040
-Who?
-The princes and their study partners.

182
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,780
Father, what are you laughing about?

183
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,180
His Majesty spoils you.

184
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,800
The princes yield to you.

185
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,640
Upon entering the palace,
you tore your teacher's book...

186
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,400
destroyed Fifth Prince's inkstone,

187
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,880
broke Sixth Prince's fan,

188
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,720
hid the whip of your companion,

189
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,960
and even rode your study partner
like a horse.

190
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Fu Kang An,

191
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,680
that's not studying.

192
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,650
You're learning to be like a crab.

193
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,890
-Why did you tell my father?
-Young Master, I really didn't.

194
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,040
Fu Kang An!

195
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,800
You are not allowed
to have dinner tonight.

196
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,720
And you don't get to
have snacks for one month.

197
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,800
If I can't have snacks, I'll kill myself!

198
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,130
The wall is right there!

199
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,120
Fine!

200
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,650
Your Highness.

201
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,870
My son is being disrespectful.
Please forgive him.

202
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,540
You are not...

203
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,830
like your father at all.

204
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,770
Fu Kang An, apologise to Concubine Shun.

205
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,110
Your Highness,

206
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,110
I am sorry.

207
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,230
You may get up.

208
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,340
This handkerchief...

209
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,930
What's wrong with this handkerchief?

210
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,830
Nothing.

211
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,710
We're taking our leave.

212
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,670
Fu Kang An, get over here.

213
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,100
What's wrong with this handkerchief?

214
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,630
Ming Yu.

215
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,860
Turn around.

216
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,400
This wedding dress is so beautiful!

217
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,300
Zhen Zhu,

218
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,580
we still need a veil.

219
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,040
Go ask Xiao Quan Zi
if it's delivered here.

220
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,240
Yes.

221
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,870
Ming Yu.

222
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,790
Ying Luo,

223
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,050
I don't want to leave you.

224
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,360
Get up.

225
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,300
The embroidery on your wedding dress...

226
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,760
was designed by myself.

227
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,920
And it's specially customised for you.

228
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,040
I was planning to embroider it.

229
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,520
But you do know that...

230
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,250
I lost my mother after I was born.

231
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,360
And I lost my sister afterwards.

232
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,560
If I were to ask a fortune teller,

233
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,370
he'd surely say that
I have an inauspicious life.

234
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,120
All brides...

235
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,610
should receive blessings...

236
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,740
from an auspicious wife whose parents
are alive and have a lot of children.

237
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,290
I dare not sully your wedding dress.

238
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,790
Ying Luo,

239
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,120
you never cared about these things.

240
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,240
It's okay if I don't believe them.

241
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,050
But I can't affect your happiness.

242
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,690
Ying Luo,

243
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,160
I don't want to leave you.

244
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,819
I really don't!

245
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,060
I'm begging you.

246
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,250
Don't marry me off, okay?

247
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,430
Ming Yu.

248
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,710
Look how beautiful
your red wedding dress is!

249
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,970
My sister once said that
if I ever got married,

250
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,140
she'd surely make me a wedding dress.

251
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,600
What a pity.

252
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,150
I wasn't destined to wear it.

253
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,090
But I hope you can wear yours.

254
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,690
If Her Majesty was still alive,

255
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,440
to see you get married,

256
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,660
she would be happy too.

257
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,120
Our wishes...

258
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,920
had been in vain.

259
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,910
So, Ming Yu,

260
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,440
you must be happy.

261
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,230
Please be happy.

262
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,630
Yi Zhu,

263
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,320
why are you here?

264
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,900
Miss Ming Yu,

265
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,120
my mistress asked me
to send you these embroideries...

266
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,610
and a set of gold tools.

267
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,950
She said those you're using are old.

268
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,010
She specially had a gold set made for you

269
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,490
to add to your dowry.

270
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,820
Please thank your mistress for me.

271
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,700
Yes.

272
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,710
Fu Heng?

273
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,760
You must have been busy
working at the Grand Council.

274
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,320
Why are you here?

275
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,630
A deed?

276
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,440
Your old house is in Qingyun County.

277
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,880
Now that you're getting married,

278
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,410
you should start
a family here in the capital.

279
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,240
Each inch of land here
is as expensive as gold.

280
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,590
Unless you're an aristocrat,

281
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,280
most officials have to rent it.

282
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,960
You're gifting me a mansion?

283
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,840
You're such a good brother!

284
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,040
Wait.

285
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,450
You've given me a wedding gift.

286
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,090
What is this for?

287
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,300
Just take it.

288
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,890
This mansion is very close
to the Forbidden City.

289
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,830
Ming Yu can come visit every day.

290
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,840
Are you...

291
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,450
-still have feelings for...
-Hailan Cha.

292
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,450
Stop talking nonsense.

293
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Do you want it or not?
If not, give it back.

294
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,170
How can you take it back?
It's mine now.

295
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,560
Just shut up then.

296
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,250
Did you hear that?

297
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,240
Young Master Fu Heng said
he'd get you out of the palace.

298
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,600
Are you happy?

299
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,870
Your Highness.

300
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,100
Lord Fu Heng, why are you here?

301
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,930
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

302
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,490
Your Highness,

303
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,320
I have something to ask you.

304
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,900
What is it?

305
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,360
Lord Fu Heng,

306
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,930
you haven't changed a bit.

307
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,160
What are you saying?

308
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,720
Upon seeing you for the first time,

309
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,840
I've heard that you're gentleman
from a noble family.

310
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,080
You're talented,

311
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,530
gentle, and refined.

312
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,000
But I think...

313
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,610
that's not the real you.

314
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,010
Concubine Shun,

315
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,320
I've only seen you a few times.

316
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,250
How can you say that you know me?

317
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,930
General Zhao Hui is ill-tempered.

318
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,900
For every battle,

319
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,420
he'd drink a lot of liquor
to vent his tension.

320
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,860
What about you?

321
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,120
You'd wake up at
the hour of Tiger sharp...

322
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,160
to practice martial arts for two hours...

323
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,480
and wait for daybreak.

324
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,120
After handling military affairs,

325
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,690
you'd read for two hours.

326
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,240
You'd then go to bed at the hour of Pig.

327
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,900
Just like that cuckoo clock
at the Yangxin Hall,

328
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,200
you follow your routine like a machine.

329
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,660
This is my lifestyle.

330
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,240
Everyone says that you're disciplined.

331
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,260
But people who are too self-disciplined...

332
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,950
are usually melancholic.

333
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,150
In this world,

334
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,480
how can there be anyone
who never gets angry?

335
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,920
But your face
is always peaceful and gentle.

336
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,260
You're clearly way more
melancholic than anyone.

337
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,780
Concubine Shun, stop assuming things.

338
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,200
This is my first time
seeing you getting angry.

339
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,840
It's so interesting!

340
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,880
You're totally different from...

341
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,640
that beautiful, generous, and
cheerful lady I thought you were.

342
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,400
Martial arts practitioners...

343
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,940
usually have dirt
in between their fingers.

344
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,980
But your hands are always clean.

345
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,830
You're a meritorious imperial relative...

346
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,000
and an important official
of Grand Council.

347
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,880
But you're so humble
and courteous to the wise.

348
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,840
No wonder His Majesty
values you greatly...

349
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,360
and the officials admire you a lot.

350
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,490
But aren't you tired living like this?

351
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,910
Stop forcing your ideas on me.

352
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,920
You're harshly restricting yourself.

353
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,200
You must be living a painful life.

354
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,190
Enough!

355
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,680
Lord Fu Heng!

356
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,800
I know my words...

357
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,710
must have offended you.

358
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,270
But that's how I felt...

359
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,800
when I first saw you.

360
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,310
If I angered you,

361
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,520
please forgive me.

362
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,420
I'll pretend...

363
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,610
I didn't hear what you said.

364
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,820
I'll never forget that...

365
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,800
it's you who saved my life
when I was in danger.

366
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,510
I'll always remember it.

367
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,040
I'll remember it forever.

368
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,240
I just hope that...

369
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,370
you live a carefree and happy life.

370
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,920
I didn't mean anything bad.

371
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,660
By the way,

372
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,880
what did you want to ask me?

373
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,370
Where did you get this handkerchief?

374
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,800
This handkerchief?

375
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,330
It's the design called
Hyacinth Beans and Dragonflies.

376
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,800
Concubine Ling has
a handkerchief like this.

377
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,790
The two dragonflies on it
rely on each other.

378
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,440
It looks very unique.

379
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,280
I asked for it,
but she wouldn't give it to me.

380
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,540
Thus, I made one...

381
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,070
after I came back.

382
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,610
Is there any special meaning
to this handkerchief?

383
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,320
It's the seventh work in Han Xi Meng's
Famous Song-Yuan Embroidery Collection.

384
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,650
Most women embroider plants and flowers.

385
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,010
This design is indeed very unique,
so I took notice of it.

386
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,250
Really?

387
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,510
Of course.

388
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,170
I have something else to attend to.

389
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,770
I'm taking my leave.

390
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,310
Lord!

391
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,850
These are all for Ming Yu?

392
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,070
Her family isn't rich.

393
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,630
I've got to back her up.

394
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,320
You're so generous.

395
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,150
Guard Solon will be shocked.

396
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,250
You're so kind to Ming Yu.

397
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,880
And she treats me well.

398
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,570
She's leaving the palace today.

399
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,320
How come she's still in her room?

400
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,690
What I like the most about
the wedding dress...

401
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,760
is that image of the flower
breaking off its stem.

402
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,590
It's interesting and pretty.

403
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,820
You've put a lot of effort
into Ming Yu's wedding.

404
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,620
On her wedding day,

405
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,590
our Ming Yu will be
the most beautiful bride.

406
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,810
Ming Yu.

407
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,520
Sister Ming Yu!

408
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,450
-Ming Yu!
-Sister Ming Yu!

409
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,510
Ming Yu!

410
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,010
Sister Ming Yu!

411
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,800
Ming Yu!

412
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,070
Sister Ming Yu!

413
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,830
-Ming Yu!
-Sister Ming Yu!

414
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,360
You're not focused.

415
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,720
I'm sorry for my oversight.
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

416
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,610
Forget it.

417
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,560
You can't wait to go pick up your bride.

418
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,090
But after Ming Yu leaves the palace,

419
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,060
she must first return to her home.

420
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,720
You can't take her
to Qingyun straightaway.

421
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,040
-What's the rush?
-We're not going back to Qingyun.

422
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,480
I've brought my mother here.

423
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,720
Our family is settling down
here in the capital.

424
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,900
With my salary,

425
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,560
I couldn't afford
a mansion in the capital.

426
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,660
But thanks to Lord Fu Heng,

427
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,860
I'm able to...

428
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,450
Fu Heng?

429
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,560
Yes.

430
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,880
He's quite considerate.

431
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,030
Your Majesty,

432
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,000
may I have a day off?

433
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,350
Look at yourself.

434
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,450
You're so anxious!

435
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,000
Your Majesty,

436
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,800
I have something to tell you!

437
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,310
Where's your manners?

438
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,860
Look at your face!

439
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,710
Why are you looking so serious?

440
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,770
Yanxi Palace sent someone
to look for Guard Solon.

441
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,690
He said...

442
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,430
What happened?

443
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,640
Miss Ming Yu...

444
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,150
is gone.

445
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,360
Your Highness!

446
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,900
Lord Hailan Cha, what are you doing?

447
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,600
-Your Highness, I need to see you!
-Lord Hailan Cha!

448
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
-What are you doing?
-Her Highness is not seeing anyone.

449
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,560
-Go away!
-You can't go in!

450
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,080
-Your Highness, come out!
-Lord Hailan Cha!

451
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,280
-Stop knocking!
-I need to ask you something!

452
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,810
-Stop knocking!
-Come out!

453
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,120
-Your Highness!
-Lord!

454
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,800
-Guard Solon.
-Come out!

455
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,940
Lord!

456
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,170
Your Highness.

457
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,800
You think...

458
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,320
you can disregard the palace rules...

459
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,480
just because you're
an imperial bodyguard...

460
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,320
and the trusted aide of His Majesty?

461
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,440
Please step aside.

462
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,340
Concubine Ling is in grave grief
and refuses to see anyone.

463
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,890
If you have anything to say,

464
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,190
just tell me.

465
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,430
I just want to ask her a question.

466
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,120
How did Ming Yu...

467
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,770
die?

468
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,190
When we entered her room,

469
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,620
she's already dead.

470
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,300
She didn't leave any last words.

471
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,530
Your Highness!

472
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,560
Ming Yu was your best friend!
Your most trusted confidante!

473
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,400
My lord!

474
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,960
Don't you have any explanation
for her death?

475
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,400
Move aside!

476
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,670
Concubine Ling!

477
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,560
-Concubine Ling!
-How dare you!

478
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,580
Concubine Ling!

479
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,790
Hailan Cha,

480
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,940
who gave you the right
to come disturb the Yanxi Palace?

481
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,940
Take him down!

482
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,800
Concubine Ling, come out!

483
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,270
Concubine Ling!

484
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,410
Tell me...

485
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,190
Concubine Ling!

486
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,180
Tell me!

487
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,120
Are you hurt?

488
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,840
Even if you lock yourself
in there forever,

489
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,870
she won't...

490
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,680
come back to life!

491
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,960
Your Majesty.

492
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,950
Let's go.

493
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,110
Your Majesty,

494
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,250
as for Ming Yu's death,

495
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,530
I have something to tell you.

496
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,810
Ming Yu.

497
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,550
Why?

498
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,060
Ye Tian Shi,

499
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,380
say it.

500
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,610
Your Majesty,

501
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,680
Ming Yu once came to see me.

502
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,690
I found that the silver needle had
entered her lung and it's incurable.

503
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,230
She asked me to not tell anyone,

504
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,590
But I never thought...

505
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,920
she'd kill herself.

506
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,430
You didn't say it...

507
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,720
just because she didn't let you?

508
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,050
That's a request from her as a patient.

509
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,750
Lord Hailan Cha,
I was left with no choice!

510
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,890
Stop.

511
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,560
It's my fault.

512
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,060
It's all my fault.

513
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,680
Why must I force her?

514
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,830
Why didn't I get it straight?

515
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,770
It's all my fault!

516
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,080
Your Majesty,

517
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,150
should we tell Her Highness...

518
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,930
There's no need to tell her.

519
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,760
Your Majesty,

520
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,110
I committed a grave mistake
by not reporting it.

521
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,960
If we keep it from Her Highness,

522
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,160
I'm afraid she'll...

523
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,890
There's no need to do so.

524
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,970
Yes.

525
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,870
She didn't understand it.

526
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,440
But now she does.

527
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,840
Your Highness, Mistress isn't around.

528
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,910
She locked herself up yesterday.

529
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,200
This morning,
when I entered to deliver her food,

530
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,340
I found that she's gone missing.

531
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,410
Everyone is looking for her.

532
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,040
Let me know...

533
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,350
as soon as she's found.

534
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,130
Lord Fu Heng!

535
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,630
Do you have a second?

536
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,400
Concubine Ling is missing.

537
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,130
Missing?

538
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,770
I'm sure you've heard of...

539
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,889
what happened yesterday.

540
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,239
I went to the Yanxi Palace today...

541
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,300
and was told that she's gone missing.

542
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,800
She's blaming herself for Ming Yu's death.

543
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,540
I'm afraid something bad
will happen to her.

544
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,810
Concubine Shun,

545
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,360
I'm an official working
outside the palace.

546
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,719
It's not proper for me
to intervene in palace affairs.

547
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,909
I'm sorry.

548
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,040
Mistress.

549
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,030
You know what to do, right?

550
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,679
Yes.

551
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,690
What are you doing here?

552
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,640
You're no longer a junior maid
of Changchun Palace.

553
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,970
You are Concubine Ling.

554
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,360
If others see you cleaning here,

555
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,190
what will they think of you?

556
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,320
It's none of your business.

557
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,630
Wei Ying Luo,

558
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,950
the late empress is gone.

559
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,840
So is Ming Yu.

560
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,720
You're the only one left.

561
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,080
But so what?

562
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,430
You are Wei Ying Luo.

563
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,240
Without them,

564
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,160
you can still stand on your own two feet.

565
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,780
What do you know?

566
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,840
I've seen Hailan Cha.

567
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,920
Ming Yu chose to kill herself...

568
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,850
because she didn't want to burden anyone.

569
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,650
It's not your fault.

570
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,400
You don't understand.

571
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,550
Then tell me.

572
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,690
It was me...

573
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,880
who couldn't wait to marry her off.

574
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,440
I wasn't considerate...

575
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,760
and attentive enough.

576
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,030
If I had been more patient,

577
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,410
and gotten to the bottom of it,

578
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
perhaps Ming Yu wouldn't have died.

579
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,120
Even if she didn't kill herself,

580
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,620
you couldn't have saved her life.

581
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,060
That needle had gotten into her lung.

582
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,340
Even God couldn't have saved her.

583
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,570
You've figured out the reason.

584
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,800
Why are you still blaming yourself?

585
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,460
Because I was selfish.

586
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,480
What do you mean?

587
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,680
The late empress...

588
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,680
once said to me...

589
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,600
that she wanted to marry me off.

590
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,400
She didn't have the chance,

591
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
so I wanted Ming Yu to get married...

592
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,190
wearing that bright red wedding dress.

593
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,500
I wanted her to fulfill my dream
because I'll never get to do so.

594
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,520
It's my fault.

595
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,390
I shouldn't have imposed my own will...

596
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,400
on Ming Yu.

597
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,160
Yes,

598
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,110
she was gravely ill.

599
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,430
But my stubbornness...

600
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,430
hastened her death.

601
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,030
Ying Luo.

602
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,080
It's not your fault.

603
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,090
If only...

604
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,670
I had understood her better,

605
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,630
treated her better...

606
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,810
and better.

607
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,040
If only I was granted a second...

608
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,000
to tell her...

609
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,200
that I'm sorry.

610
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,560
I'm so sorry!

611
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,400
I'm very sorry!

612
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,600
I'm sorry!

613
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,930
Lord Fu Heng.

614
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,130
I forgot myself.

615
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,080
I apologize.

616
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,040
-Ying Luo.
-It's inappropriate...

617
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,740
to address me like that.

618
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,650
Your Highness.

619
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,600
Please take care.

620
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,260
Who told you I'm here?

621
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,280
I ran into Concubine Shun.

622
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,900
She said you went missing.

623
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,270
I thought you'd be here.

624
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,580
What's wrong?

625
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,960
Nothing.

626
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,380
Your Majesty, Concubine Shun
would like to see you.

627
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,450
Let her in.

628
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,880
Yes.

629
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,450
Why are you here?

630
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,740
I learned how to embroider
from Concubine Ling.

631
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,330
And with some guidance from
the master at Embroidery House,

632
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,740
I finally finished this embroidery.

633
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:25,940
Your Majesty,

634
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,250
have a look.

635
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,680
Do you like it?

636
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,800
Hyacinth Beans and Dragonflies.

637
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,040
I didn't know what to embroider for you.

638
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,880
I saw that Concubine Ling owns
a handkerchief with this pattern.

639
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,810
And I found it very unique...

640
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,440
so I decided to make one.

641
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,390
Really?

642
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,360
Don't you tell Concubine Ling.

643
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,730
I asked for it for so many times...

644
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,820
but she wouldn't give it to me.

645
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,280
By the way,

646
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,210
I ran into Lord Fu Heng the other day.

647
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,930
Your Majesty,
you probably didn't know this.

648
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:14,430
I had an accident
on my way to the capital,

649
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,690
And Lord Fu Heng happened to pass by
and saved my life.

650
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,830
I didn't know if you'd like this present.

651
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:26,730
I thought Lord Fu Heng knows you well...

652
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,750
so I asked him.

653
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,440
But he scolded me instead,

654
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,070
saying it's not appropriate.

655
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,080
It's actually quite a coincidence.

656
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,270
Lord Fu Heng owns a perfume pouch...

657
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,400
with the same embroidery pattern on it.

658
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,610
He almost lost it while
he's trying to save me.

659
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,590
Enough!

660
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,160
Your Majesty,

661
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,830
what's wrong?

662
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,520
Chen Bi.

663
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,640
I have work to do. You should leave now.

664
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,640
Your Majesty,

665
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,360
did I say something wrong
and make you angry?

666
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,830
No.

667
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,320
I'm just upset with my work.

668
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,460
You may leave now.

669
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,320
I'll visit you when I'm free.

670
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:31,760
Yes, I'm taking my leave.
