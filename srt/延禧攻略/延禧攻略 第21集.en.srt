[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 21]

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,200
You are the one Her Majesty assigned
to take inventory of the treasures.

8
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,060
But you took away the task from me.

9
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,620
You were gone too.

10
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,090
How dare you shift the blame on me now?
Not a chance!

11
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,180
Let me tell you.

12
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,320
This is the Sarira that
Empress Dowager dearly wants.

13
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,080
Not just you and I,

14
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,850
even Her Majesty
will have to pay for this.

15
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,140
Who said that I am shifting the blame?

16
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,840
Zhen Zhu, who was the first to return
to Dongci Hall just now?

17
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,579
It was me. This is all my fault.

18
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,800
I thought that Qianqing Palace
had strict security and...

19
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
no one would steal
His Majesty's birthday gift.

20
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,200
So, I went out to watch
the fireworks with everyone.

21
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,940
Not long after that, I saw Sister Ming Yu.

22
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,579
She even gave me a good scolding.
So, I came back at once.

23
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,040
Did you find anything strange?

24
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,740
I think I saw a human shadow.

25
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,600
You saw the thief? Who was it?

26
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,440
I...

27
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,360
Hurry up and tell us.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,490
-I...
-Zhen Zhu.

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,990
Take your time and think carefully.
Who was it?

30
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,320
I think it was Noble Lady Shu.

31
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Alright. Let's go and meet her now.

32
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,810
Stop. What will you say when
you meet Noble Lady Shu?

33
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,260
Zhen Zhu is our witness. Noble Lady Shu
is the one who stole the Buddha's Lotus.

34
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,620
The Buddha's Lotus is a gift from
Noble Lady Shu.

35
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,350
Why would she steal it back
when no one is looking?

36
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,590
More importantly, in order
to watch the fireworks just now,

37
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,720
all the lanterns in the hallway
were snuffed out.

38
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,780
Who would believe
the testimony of a palace maid?

39
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,050
But the fireworks were burning brightly
at that time and I clearly saw her.

40
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,450
I believe you but
we don't have a proof yet.

41
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,770
It was a short opening. The one who
stole it wouldn't be able to sneak it out.

42
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,440
Furthermore, the Buddha's Lotus is very
precious. It won't be carelessly handled.

43
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,320
It's very possible that it's
still with her right now.

44
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,200
-We need to report it to His Majesty.
-What's the point of doing that?

45
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,730
Will His Majesty will order
for a body search?

46
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,100
This won't do and that won't do either.

47
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,480
We lost the Sarira that
Empress Dowager wants so badly.

48
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,190
His Majesty won't forgive us.

49
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,280
Even if Her Majesty begs for our mercy,
we will be punished severely.

50
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
The more I think about it,

51
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,159
the more I think it's your fault,
Zhen Zhu!

52
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,620
It's useless to blame her.

53
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,730
If they already had a plan,

54
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,720
they would've sent Zhen Zhu away even if
she was present at that time.

55
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,200
Our only chance right now...

56
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,050
is to recover the Buddha's Lotus
before the family banquet is over.

57
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,050
How is that possible?

58
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,800
Instead of waiting for our doom,
we should fight for our own fate.

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,480
Ming Yu,

60
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,680
I know that you hate me very much.
But this is a matter of life and death.

61
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,940
Are you willing to put away your prejudice
and work with me?

62
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,980
Alright. If you turn the tables,

63
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,250
I'll help you out this once.

64
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,700
My Lord.

65
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,160
Hailan Cha, gather everyone here
and lock down Qianqing Palace.

66
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,090
No one is allowed to enter
or leave the palace freely.

67
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,640
Your Majesty, I have
an urgent matter to report.

68
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,990
What is it?

69
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,320
What?

70
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,070
Your Majesty. What happened?

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,680
Your Majesty, in the past, we would have
an acrobatic show as the last performance.

72
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,110
How about we do
something different this year?

73
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,360
What is your suggestion?

74
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,950
Your Majesty, the Imperial Household
Department is afraid that...

75
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,920
all of you might find the old boring. So,
they have prepared something new.

76
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,280
This year, please allow Changchun Palace
to perform for all of you instead.

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,370
Let's begin.

78
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,720
This is just a commoner's petty trick.

79
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,000
How dare she perform it in the palace?

80
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,920
Watching this kind of trick
once in a while is quite interesting too.

81
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,350
I am aware that
this is just a petty trick.

82
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,880
So, I'm only using it as an opening show.

83
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,350
My true performance for today is,

84
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,710
telekinesis.

85
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,679
Telekinesis?

86
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,160
Look over there!

87
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,410
The Azure Buddha's Pagoda?

88
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,080
It's supposed to be kept at Dongci Hall
along with other gifts.

89
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,720
How is it here?

90
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,200
What telekinesis?

91
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,800
It was just a misdirection.

92
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,780
She hid it inside her robe.

93
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,980
And when we were focused
on the yellow cloth,

94
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,480
she moved it out in secret.

95
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,020
This is not right.

96
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,400
Where is the Sarira on that
Azure Buddha's Pagoda?

97
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,680
Yes, where is the Sarira on the pagoda?

98
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,720
The trick is good but how could you
lose the precious Sarira?

99
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,320
Don't worry, Your Highnesses.

100
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,120
I was afraid that my power wasn't enough.

101
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,660
So, I transported the Sarira
and the pagoda separately.

102
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,380
Where is the Sarira now?

103
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,600
It is now...

104
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,040
with Noble Lady Shu.

105
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,230
What nonsense is this?
Why would it be with me?

106
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,600
Yes. Originally, it's impossible.

107
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,960
But I put it on you on purpose.

108
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,980
Wei Ying Luo. You never came near me.

109
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,550
How did you put it on me?

110
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,680
If I had to go near you to put it on you,

111
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,560
I wouldn't call it telekinesis.

112
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,710
Noble Lady Shu, look carefully.

113
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,020
The Sarira is with you for sure.

114
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,140
How imprudent!

115
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,590
I just want to take back
the Buddha's Lotus.

116
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,660
How am I imprudent?

117
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,600
Since you already gave it out,
it belongs to His Majesty now.

118
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,260
Don't tell me that you regret it.

119
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,980
-You!
-Don't move!

120
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,070
The Buddha's Lotus.

121
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,580
Oh my goodness, this is so magical.

122
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,600
It was really with you, Sister.

123
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,920
I didn't see it clearly just now.
Can you perform it again?

124
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,330
No.

125
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,400
We can't use the same trick
twice in a day.

126
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,060
It's a rule of magic.

127
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,950
Although I had learned only some tricks
from an old artist under the bridge,

128
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,760
I still have to abide by
the rules of magic.

129
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,000
First Attendant Qing, please forgive me.

130
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,760
Wei Ying Luo. You are really amazing.

131
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,780
I here celebrate His Majesty's birthday.
I'm not here to ask for any rewards.

132
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,950
No need to reward me, Noble Lady Shu.

133
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,350
Your performance was very good.

134
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,830
Of course you should be rewarded.

135
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,150
If that's the case thank you,
Noble Lady Shu.

136
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,520
[Everlasting Life]

137
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,270
Long live, Your Majesty!

138
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,640
-Long live, Your Majesty!
-Long live, Your Majesty!

139
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,490
Good! Great performance!

140
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,670
Noble Lady Shu, have I ever offended you?

141
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,040
-No.
-Why did you do it then?

142
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,600
Your life is worthless.

143
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,670
Just like...

144
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,910
Just like a stray dog by the roadside.

145
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,480
If I want to kill it, I'll kill it.
Do I need a reason for that?

146
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,960
She's too much.

147
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,910
Changchun Palace is really
a peculiar place.

148
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,370
A fierce dog is barking here...

149
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,290
and here comes another one.

150
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,970
This is so unheard of.

151
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,050
Please excuse me. His Majesty
has flipped my tag for tonight.

152
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,820
I need to get myself ready.

153
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,070
Both of you can continue to
bark at each other now.

154
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,790
Why did you stop me?

155
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,840
I have to get even with her.

156
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,690
She already said it.

157
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,980
We are just the fierce dogs
of Changchun Palace.

158
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,590
She can just kill us without a reason.

159
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,340
Although we are slaves,
we are still humans.

160
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,420
Are you going to just let her
belittle you like this?

161
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,980
You want to seek revenge?

162
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,480
I want to kick her out of
the hall of Qianqing Palace!

163
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,620
You have to hit where it hurts.

164
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,880
If you want to seek revenge,
the best way...

165
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,700
is to snatch away what she wants the most.

166
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,750
What do you mean by that?

167
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,090
Noble Lady Shu is going to attend
to His Majesty tonight, right?

168
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,700
What are you talking about?
We are just petty palace maids.

169
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,540
Are you saying we can change
His Majesty's mind?

170
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,270
Want to collaborate with me again?

171
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,660
You managed to get back
the Buddha's Lotus, right?

172
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,460
You should be happy.

173
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,640
-Why are you sighing?
-She wants to know...

174
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,530
why you didn't give His Majesty
the Goddess Luo painting today.

175
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,700
I am the empress after all.

176
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,400
I can just admire it in private.

177
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,610
Giving him a goddess painting in public
is too frivolous and reckless.

178
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,560
But your Goddess Luo painting
is so vivid and artistic.

179
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,910
It's so mesmerising.

180
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,470
You put so much effort into it
but you didn't give it out.

181
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,099
-Isn't that a pity?
-Why is it a pity?

182
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,890
Keep it.

183
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,990
Your Majesty, if you dress up
as Goddess Luo,

184
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,900
-you'll be as beautiful as her too.
-What kind of nonsense is that?

185
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,960
Your Majesty, I made you
a Goddess Luo's dress.

186
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,920
Isn't it the perfect time
to put it on now?

187
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,050
You can bring this Goddess Luo to life.

188
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,380
What?

189
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,700
When I saw your painting last time,

190
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,130
I had decided to make the exact
Goddess Luo's dress for you.

191
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,520
-You can put it on now.
-You are getting out of hand.

192
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,980
Me dressing up as Goddess Luo?
How improper!

193
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,760
Er Qing!

194
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,710
Ming Yu. Let's dress Her Majesty up.

195
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,880
Let's see who is prettier.
Her Majesty or Goddess Luo.

196
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,660
-Alright. Your Majesty.
-Come on. Hurry up.

197
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,520
-This is ridiculous. I am the empress.
-Your Majesty.

198
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,060
There is no one here.

199
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,090
-Come on.
-Are the three of you mad?

200
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,080
-Your Majesty, put it on. Come on.
-Are you mad?

201
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,680
Your Majesty, I already picked up some
pretty accessories for you. Go now.

202
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,120
Your Majesty!

203
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,940
Sister.

204
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,520
Later...

205
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,160
Hurry up.

206
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,680
Don't you know the rules?

207
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,680
Do you know where you are?

208
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,370
Can you just wander around here
as you please?

209
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,630
Tell me. Where are you going?

210
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,720
Chief Li, I heard that
after the fireworks,

211
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,760
a star fell into Changchun Palace.

212
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,450
Now, everyone has gone there
to see that fairy.

213
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,520
Have you gone completely insane?

214
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,140
There is no fairy.

215
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,050
You are just completely insane and blind.

216
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,750
-So beautiful.
-That's right.

217
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,900
-So pretty.
-Her Majesty is so beautiful.

218
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,370
Your Majesty, you are so gorgeous
by dressing up like this.

219
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,040
You look like a beauty from a painting.

220
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,830
Your Majesty, you talked about the story
of Yang Yu Huan and Zhao Fei Yan that day.

221
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,220
Yang Yu Huan was an alluring beauty and...

222
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,310
Zhao Fei Yan was as light as a swallow.
But both were dance experts.

223
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,760
Finally, I get to see
such a beauty like that today.

224
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,140
But I can only learn about their
dance moves from the books.

225
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,390
If you want to see it,
beg Her Majesty then.

226
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,800
They that Noble Consort Gao
can sing and dance well...

227
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,530
because they've never seen
Her Majesty in the past.

228
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,950
-How was she in the past?
-Ming Yu.

229
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,800
I heard from the older madam that
before Her Majesty was married,

230
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,780
she was extremely talented
and she could dance beautifully.

231
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,940
Noble Consort Gao is no match for her.

232
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,490
But it's a pity that she doesn't dance
anymore after she is married.

233
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,710
Your Majesty, I really want to
see you dance today.

234
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,550
-Your Majesty, just one dance.
-Your Majesty, one dance.

235
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,220
-Ying Luo.
-Your Majesty.

236
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,110
All of us have never seen you
dance before. Dance for us.

237
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,600
-Just one dance, Your Majesty.
-One dance, Your Majesty.

238
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,460
-One dance.
-One dance.

239
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,580
Just one dance, Your Majesty.

240
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,440
Your Majesty, just one dance.

241
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,550
♫ Willow tree by the palace wall,
jade hair clasp ♫

242
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:17,000
♫ Slender female hands ♫

243
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:23,380
♫ A lonely wine for the autumn sorrows ♫

244
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,590
♫ It's hard to open up the past ♫

245
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:36,010
♫ Willow tree by the palace wall,
jade hair clasp ♫

246
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:42,230
♫ Slender female hands ♫

247
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:48,560
♫ A lonely wine for the autumn sorrows ♫

248
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,010
♫ It's hard to open up the past ♫

249
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:01,060
♫ I can wave it away
but the sorrow stays ♫

250
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:06,770
♫ My yearning bears so much such sorrow ♫

251
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:13,380
♫ When I wake up from the golden dream ♫

252
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,630
♫ We talk until we are old and gray ♫

253
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,640
Greetings, Your Majesty.

254
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,700
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

255
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,760
Don't worry, Your Majesty.
I've already sent the people outside away.

256
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,240
Nobody else will know that
you've danced today.

257
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,490
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I was too out of line today.

258
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,240
I've never seen you dressed like this.

259
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,190
You are so alluring that you
transcend all the beauties in this world.

260
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,130
You look different from usual.

261
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,000
Even you are making fun of me.

262
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,800
I'll change out of this dress right now.

263
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,900
No need to rush it.
I still want to look at you.

264
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,420
You are beautiful and so is your dance.

265
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,110
I've never expected this.

266
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,640
You look so refined today.

267
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,750
It's really a pleasant surprise.

268
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
Your Majesty, you must be
making fun of me.

269
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,090
I haven't danced for 14 years already.

270
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,310
When I danced just now,
I noticed how stiff I've become.

271
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,110
You can't even call it a dance.

272
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,620
Your Majesty, you're being humble.

273
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,610
She finally got the chance
to attend to His Majesty.

274
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,410
But we've popped her bubble.

275
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:53,230
I think that Noble Lady Shu
won't feel so arrogant now.

276
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,640
I haven't practised the character that
Her Majesty had asked me to write today.

277
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,770
I'm going to practise my writings now.

278
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,680
Everyone, get back to your work.

279
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,220
Look how smug you are.
You almost got into a huge trouble today.

280
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,280
Luckily, you had Ying Luo to help you.

281
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,960
After taking a little vengeance on
Noble Lady Shu, I'm in a great mood now.

282
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,440
I won't get mad no matter what you say.

283
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,840
Do you think she did it just to
take vengeance on Noble Lady Shu?

284
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,160
What else?

285
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,440
She's even more thoughtful
and way ahead than you think.

286
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,000
Think about it carefully.
That dress today...

287
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,600
is like a tailor-made dress
for Her Majesty.

288
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,480
It fits her perfectly.

289
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,960
It'll take at least half a month
to make such an elegant dress.

290
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,640
I'm sure that she must have
planned this a long time ago.

291
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,400
It has always been her plan to lure
His Majesty here to visit Her Majesty?

292
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,780
You silly girl.

293
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,740
She wants to make His Majesty stay,

294
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,070
so that Her Majesty
can bear a child again.

295
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,260
If it wasn't because Noble Lady Shu
was too arrogant today,

296
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,260
she wouldn't have taken out
that dress tonight.

297
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,110
She's really cunning.

298
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,020
Your Highness, I think
it's time for you to go back.

299
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,250
Get lost!

300
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,540
Zhen Zhu, you've spun around
so many times already.

301
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,600
Be careful not to get dizzy from it.

302
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,060
Fei Cui, look.

303
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,220
-It really does look very similar. Okay.
-Let me teach you.

304
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,170
-What are you doing?
-Ying Luo.

305
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,460
Everyone likes to cosplay lately.
We're just doing it for fun.

306
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,420
Go and finish up your tasks first.

307
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,220
If our mistress sees you slacking off,
I won't ask for leniency on your behalf.

308
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,220
Yes. We'll get back to our tasks now.

309
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,320
Zhen Zhu, do I look like Zhao Fei Yan?

310
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,080
You do. But, you lack a dancing dress.

311
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,950
Next time, ask Ying Luo
to make you one too.

312
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,070
Stop right there!

313
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,460
Yes, Your Highness.

314
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,710
What's that on your forehead?

315
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,030
Your Highness, this is the latest
cosplay trend in the palace.

316
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,410
We all just imitating
Princess Shuo Yang...

317
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,610
by putting safflower on our foreheads.

318
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,500
Your Highness!

319
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,540
-Get lost!
-Yes, Your Highness.

320
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,560
Your Highness, wait for me.

321
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,520
I heard that Her Majesty dressed up
as Goddess Luo.

322
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,650
That's why you waited in vain
for the whole night.

323
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,560
Put your hand down and
let me check on it.

324
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,760
♫ Sitting alone in the royal palace ♫

325
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,850
♫ For Years ♫

326
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,960
♫ With everyone fighting ♫

327
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,460
♫ To be in His Majesty's favour ♫

328
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,690
Your Highness, Noble Lady Shu is here.

329
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,780
♫ How lonely it is ♫

330
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,180
♫ To be cold-shouldered in the palace ♫

331
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,660
♫ Such a pity for Chang'e ♫

332
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:38,640
♫ To sleep in solitude ♫

333
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,710
Your Highness.

334
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:43,190
I failed my task. Please punish me.

335
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,640
You failed your task.
It means that you are useless.

336
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,420
Why would I want a useless person for?

337
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,960
Your Highness!

338
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,020
Your Highness,

339
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,010
I heard that Empress Dowager
is coming back from Changchun Garden.

340
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,240
So what?

341
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,990
Your Highness, give me another chance.
I guarantee that...

342
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,680
this time, not only will I be able
to get rid of that fierce dog,

343
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Her Majesty will also completely
lose the favour of Empress Dowager...

344
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,690
And she won't be able to
lift her head in front of you anymore.

345
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,760
♫ Don't be wishful ♫

346
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,440
♫ If you fail me ♫

347
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,800
♫ And do things not to my liking ♫

348
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,360
♫ I will ♫

349
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,410
♫ Report on you myself ♫

350
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:56,160
♫ You are just my slave ♫

351
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:03,480
♫ I'll kick you out from the palace ♫

352
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,880
♫ And crush you to pieces ♫

353
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,200
I will not disappoint you.

354
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,780
Ying Luo! Her Majesty has ordered us

355
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,320
to accompany Empress Dowager
in touring the garden.

356
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,920
-Empress Dowager is back?
-Stop dilly-dally.

357
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,680
Her Majesty is waiting.
Hurry up. Let's go.

358
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,490
-Be careful with your steps.
-Okay.

359
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,570
For the past few days,

360
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,590
I had been praying in Changchun Garden.

361
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,560
It must have been hard for you
to keep an eye on both places.

362
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,190
You've worked hard, Your Majesty.

363
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,320
Managing the harem and attending to you...

364
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,100
are both my duties.

365
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,660
I dare not ask for any merits.

366
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,920
Empress Dowager,
you don't know about this.

367
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,890
But Her Majesty conducts herself very well
and has a pure heart and spirit.

368
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,030
Everyone in the palace
sees her as their role model.

369
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,410
They even tried to imitate
her actions, speech and smile...

370
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,440
to try to win the favour of His Majesty.

371
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,640
Her Majesty has always been
fair and square.

372
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,700
She conducts herself virtuously.
If all the imperial consorts...

373
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,920
in the palace could be
just a third like her,

374
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,360
I would be contented with that.

375
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,870
You are being too kind, Empress Dowager.

376
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,370
Take a seat, everyone.

377
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,280
No need to be so humble.

378
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,560
I know you very well.

379
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,960
His majesty is very diligent in his work.

380
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,730
He likes to take things
into his own hands.

381
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,640
It can't be helped that he doesn't
take care of himself very well.

382
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:33,620
There are many miscellaneous affairs
and personnel within the palace.

383
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,000
And it's your duty to take care of
everything within the palace.

384
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,470
Now, His Majesty is able to
focus on the state affairs,

385
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,630
the palace is in harmony and
the people are united.

386
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,110
This is all because of you.

387
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,700
In my opinion, in this world,

388
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,680
you are the most suitable person
to be the empress.

389
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:10,140
Where is Noble Lady Nalan who gifted me
the Azure Buddha's Pagoda that day?

390
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,090
Noble Lady Shu, hurry up and
greet Empress Dowager.

391
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,360
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

392
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,900
To be able to find the Sarira...

393
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,810
means that you are fated with Buddha.
I never thought that...

394
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:32,330
you are such a beautiful lady.

395
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,530
You look way better than
your father, Yong Shou.

396
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,390
Empress Dowager,
I look like my mother more.

397
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,280
Empress Dowager,
Yanhui Pavilion is right in front.

398
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,810
The peonies in front of the pavilion have
already bloomed. They are so beautiful.

399
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,070
Good.

400
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,840
-Go and find out what happened.
-Zhi Lan, go now!

401
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,060
Yes, Your Highness!

402
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,179
Ming Yu.

403
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,900
Hurry up!

404
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,000
-Zhi Lan.
-Let go of me!

405
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,940
Zhi Lan, why are you in such a rush?

406
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,199
-Let go of me!
-Let me wipe your sweat for you.

407
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,560
-Move aside! Go away!
-Don't go.

408
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,620
Zhi Lan, you sprained your ankle.

409
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,750
-Let me take a look at it.
-Get lost!

410
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,050
We shouldn't have imitated Her Majesty.
We are in deep trouble now!

411
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,520
It's your fault. Why did you push her?

412
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,120
I was just kidding around.
Who knew that she would lose her footing?

413
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,199
We should stop talking.
Let's check on her now.

414
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,080
No, I don't have the courage to do so.
My knees are weak from fear.

415
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,960
Stop dilly-dally.
We can't just leave her there.

416
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,440
Let's go.

417
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,800
[Yanhui Pavilion]

418
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,960
Why are you so ungrateful?
I'm doing this for your own good.

419
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,240
Stop blocking my path!
Can't you understand human language?

420
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,180
Let go of me! Let go!

421
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,380
This is a serious matter.
No point in trying to stop me.

422
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,720
Noble Consort Gao ordered me to
investigate but you are in my way.

423
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,250
What is your motive?

424
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,000
Empress Dowager is here.

425
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,200
What happened?

426
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,840
Empress Dowager, this palace maid
fell down from a high place and died.

427
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,200
So, her face is badly injured.

428
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,760
In order not to give you a fright,
I covered her face with a handkerchief.

429
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,830
But I don't know how she fell down yet.

430
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,320
Are you palace maids from Yanhui Pavilion?

431
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,770
Talk.

432
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,080
The three of us are the cleaners
of Yanhui Pavilion.

433
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,180
We were fooling around earlier.

434
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,220
But she lost her footing
and fell down from the top floor.

435
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,750
I was so shocked that I wasn't able
to grab hold of her on time.

436
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,020
-That's how...
-This is a life.

437
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,780
You can't just brush it off by
saying that you were just fooling around.

438
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,550
Empress Dowager is right.

439
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,480
The three of you were on duty. You
should've worked on your tasks diligently.

440
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,540
Why were you fooling around here?
Tell us the truth now.

441
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:49,020
If you anger Empress Dowager,
you'll be punished severely.

442
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,260
Empress Dowager, please forgive us!

443
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,360
Recently, there's an on-going trend
in the palace to do cosplay.

444
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,400
Everyone is trying to imitate
the classic beauties as a way to have fun.

445
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,480
We were doing it just for fun.

446
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,640
And that has led to
this unforgivable accident.

447
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,800
Yes, Empress Dowager.
We didn't mean for this to happen.

448
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,030
-Please forgive us!
-What cosplay?

449
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,070
It's....

450
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,480
It's a trend that started from
Changchun Palace.

451
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,720
Her Majesty...

452
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,260
Empress Dowager,

453
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,270
my guess is, this palace maid was
trying to imitate Consort Yang just now.

454
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,720
Then, she accidentally fell down from
the top floor of Yanhui Pavilion and died.

455
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,050
As for why she was imitating Consort Yang,

456
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,640
maybe it's because Noble Consort Gao's
"Drunken Beauty" act was too fascinating.

457
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,600
That's why all the palace maids
want to imitate her.

458
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,520
"Drunken Beauty"?

459
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,180
What is this?

460
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,060
You were doing
an opera performance in the palace?

461
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,820
How dare you!
What nonsense are you spouting?

462
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,840
When did I ask anybody to imitate me?

463
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Of course you don't need to
ask them to, Your Highness.

464
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,240
You just need to set an example.

465
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,080
There is music coming out
from Chuxiu Palace every day.

466
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,500
And the opera performances
would go on one after the other.

467
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,800
Today, it's "The Palace of Eternal Life".

468
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,050
Tomorrow, it will be
"Farewell My Concubine".

469
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,310
Especially that "Drunken Beauty" of yours,
you performed it in perfection.

470
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,120
And your dance was so smooth and beautiful
that even His Majesty liked it a lot.

471
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,700
Even those opera singers
are no match for you.

472
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,510
The palace maids admire you for it...

473
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,390
and wants to imitate you...

474
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,300
to be in the favour of His Majesty.
It's only normal.

475
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,780
Ming Yu, am I right?

476
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,230
Yes...

477
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,960
Empress Dowager, I even saw someone
imitating Consort Yu yesterday.

478
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,200
Your Highness, please don't
blame me for speaking out of turn.

479
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:08,170
"Farewell My Concubine" tells the death
of an empire. It's really quite ominous.

480
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,600
It's better to stick to
"Drunken Beauty" instead.

481
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,200
That's why I told you to study more.
How is Consort Yang better?

482
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,930
Someone is dead because of her.

483
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,550
Moreover, Consort Yang died in Maweipo...

484
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,650
and the An Lushan Rebellion
befell upon the Great Tang.

485
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,280
It is such a pity.

486
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,590
They are all ominous.

487
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,100
Yes, I'm indeed uncultured.

488
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,120
When I listened to
the storytellers in the past,

489
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,240
I only listened until Han dynasty.
I haven't heard about Tang dynasty yet.

490
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,880
Your Highness, you can perform
"Mu Guiying Takes Command" next time.

491
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,980
Her looks and form are very impressive.

492
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,410
It's not good too.

493
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,330
Someone already lost her life
because of "Drunken Beauty".

494
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,530
It'll be worse if weapons are involved.

495
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,800
Shut up! Both of you, shut up!

496
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,600
This cosplay trend clearly looks like one
that started from Changchun Palace.

497
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,030
How could you accuse Noble Consort Gao?

498
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,640
Wei Ying Luo, your better
don't slander Noble Consort Gao.

499
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,570
Out the mouth comes evil.

500
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,270
Her Majesty doesn't know
how to perform the "Drunken Beauty".

501
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,410
And she has never acted as
Consort Yang in public.

502
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,120
What has this got to do with her?

503
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,360
But there are opera performances
in Chuxiu Palace every day.

504
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,570
Everyone can hear it.

505
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,920
Listening to operas is
just a way to spend our time.

506
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,250
Not only her, there are opera performances
in every palace.

507
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,530
And there are even more performances
during festivals.

508
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,240
How could you blame this matter
on Chuxiu Palace?

509
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,000
Enough! Stop talking!

510
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,900
Your Majesty,

511
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,100
when did the harem start to
have opera performances?

512
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,880
Empress Dowager, I...

513
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,060
If you allow it, Empress Dowager,

514
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,040
I can prove it to everyone.

515
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,100
What evidence do you have?

516
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,880
How did this happen?

517
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,100
I'm returning to the palace!

518
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,860
Your Majesty,
you've really bred a good dog!

519
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,900
I...

520
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,920
-Why are you still here?
-Yes, Your Highness.

521
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,440
Stop right there!

522
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,460
Your Majesty, this palace maid...

523
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,360
fell down from the top floor
without any reason.

524
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,070
This is too suspicious.

525
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,320
We should detain them
and interrogate them properly.

526
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,320
Guards, lock them up.

527
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,720
Your Majesty, I will take my leave now.
