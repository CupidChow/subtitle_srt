1
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,810
Why are you running around?

2
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,360
Your Highness, rest assured.

3
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,690
Everything is in place.

4
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,650
I won't ever see that low-down servant again, will I?

5
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,720
I promise

6
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,160
she won’t bother you again.

7
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,680
Why do you choose to deliver the powder on the day of the tea party?

8
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,120
The shell powder is washed with dye.

9
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,640
Only a little dye is used

10
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,680
so that no one can find out.

11
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,420
It takes several months of poison accumulation

12
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,480
to produce actual symptoms.

13
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,090
But Consort Yu has been suffering abdominal pain

14
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,560
and asked the imperial doctors for help

15
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,360
after using it for about one month.

16
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
She's making such grand movements.

17
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Don't you find it unnatural?

18
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,960
You mean…

19
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,079
Her Majesty has developed a close relationship with Palace of Eternal Peace.

20
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:49,540
And Wei Yingluo has been delivering pearl powder frequently.

21
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,320
They may have found it.

22
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,800
They are probably setting a trap

23
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,320
to catch us on spot.

24
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,540
But the fetus may have been affected by the mental trauma of Consort Yu

25
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,080
and it could be true.

26
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,730
Are you sure about this?

27
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
You may be oversensitive.

28
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,120
I…

29
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,920
I’m not sure.

30
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,240
But the best way

31
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,160
is check the medical records of Consort Yu at the Imperial Hospital.

32
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,820
We surely can see the problem.

33
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,480
If the medical records differ from what Fangcao said,

34
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,160
they are trying to trap us.

35
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,400
What is your plan

36
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,160
if you guessed it right?

37
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,160
I heard

38
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,160
Her Majesty trusts Wei Yingluo a lot.

39
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,840
She gave her the task

40
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,050
of taking care of the lychee trees.

41
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,040
Your Highness, don't you hate her very much?

42
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,680
I have an idea

43
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,400
to get rid of her.

44
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,280
It can also humiliate Her Majesty

45
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,920
and ruin her prestige.

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
What should we do?

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,160
What should we do?

48
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
What happened?

49
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,130
The lock got pried open.

50
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,440
The lychee trees

51
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,360
are killed by hot water.

52
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Yingluo,

53
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,960
what should we do?

54
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,690
Yingluo,

55
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,010
where are you going?

56
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

57
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
Forego the formalities.

58
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,400
Take a seat.

59
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,290
Your hands are cold,

60
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,720
Your Majesty?

61
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,980
Have you not fully recovered?

62
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,600
Or your servants

63
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,090
are tiring you too much?

64
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,600
Your Majesty,

65
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,900
it has nothing to do with them.

66
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,240
I've always had cold hands and feet.

67
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,600
An imperial doctor has made me a prescription.

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,120
Consort Chun has also gave me a medicinal bath to dip my hands and feet in.

69
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,360
They just don’t work.

70
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,960
The imperial doctors in the Palace

71
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,320
are highly-skilled,

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,360
but they are too conservative

73
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
and stick to old rules.

74
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,760
If they are too careful in medicine application,

75
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,290
how can they cure diseases?

76
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,960
A few days ago, Fuheng said

77
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,080
Jiangsu had a famous doctor named Doctor Nanyang.

78
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
He has divine-like medical skills.

79
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,340
No diseases are incurable to him.

80
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,159
I've sent someone for him.

81
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,960
They’ll take him to the capital as soon as possible.

82
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,159
By then, I'll let him nurse your health.

83
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,290
Thank you for your care, Your Majesty.

84
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,040
Yingluo,

85
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,680
let's report it to Her Majesty.

86
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,640
Can't you see His Majesty is there too?

87
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,400
His Majesty?

88
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,560
So what?

89
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,640
The tribute of Fujian got totally destroyed.

90
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,520
Were you him,

91
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,890
would you get angry?

92
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,600
Yes, absolutely.

93
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,220
He might have us beheaded.

94
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,760
Someone destroyed the lychee trees

95
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
to frame us.

96
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,560
What should we do now?

97
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,920
What to do? What to do?

98
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,920
Of course

99
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
we'll fight back.

100
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,040
Now,

101
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,960
listen carefully.

102
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,200
Choose the lychees that are still acceptable.

103
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,880
Send them to the Royal Restaurant,

104
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,210
and tell the Restaurant

105
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,560
Her Majesty is having a lychee party.

106
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
Ask them to immediately think of a way.

107
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,120
Consort Chun.

108
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,840
Afterwards, tell Her Majesty

109
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,560
the lychees from two trees are made into food.

110
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,440
The fruit of the remaining tree is left to be picked on spot.

111
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,300
Picked on spot?

112
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,320
No.

113
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,680
That’s why we will get found out.

114
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,960
Her Majesty said

115
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,360
she’d pick lychees for His Majesty with her own hands.

116
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,159
She can't casually take it back.

117
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,720
One of the trees must be brought to the party.

118
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,520
Of course,

119
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,600
we must have a plan.

120
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,880
What plan?

121
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
Consort Xian,

122
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,960
on my last birthday,

123
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,620
you gave me a pair of jade ruyi.

124
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,800
After checking them several times,

125
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,860
I couldn't notice anything unusual.

126
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,840
Erqing pointed it out

127
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,680
Heart Sutra

128
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,200
was carved on their handles.

129
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,440
Afterwards, an imperial doctor told me

130
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,600
your finger got injured

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,520
when you carved them.

132
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,880
I feel guilty about it.

133
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,080
I just exerted my measly effort

134
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,840
to celebrate your birthday.

135
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,880
I wish Your Majesty good health,

136
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,970
and a peaceful and smooth life.

137
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,200
Erqing.

138
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Your Majesty,

139
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,120
I've said

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,440
I will choose a favorite

141
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,290
among all my birthday gifts

142
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,400
and then reward the person who gave it.

143
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,720
However,

144
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,520
your gift

145
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,400
is the most unique one.

146
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,680
Yet I can’t reward you

147
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,620
because you own the whole nation.

148
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,240
So I want to give this reward to Consort Xian.

149
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
What do you think?

150
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,120
Your Majesty,

151
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,520
I don't deserve it.

152
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,120
The reward of Her Majesty

153
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,760
shows her appreciation of your sincerity.

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,260
You mustn't refuse it.

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,260
Thank you for your reward, Your Majesty.

156
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,480
I will accept it.

157
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,720
Rise, please.

158
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,880
Trying to win people's hearts, and fishing for fame.

159
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,840
Pretentious.

160
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,280
Get it back.

161
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,360
Yingluo,

162
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,000
will this work?

163
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,120
Of course not.

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,840
No?

165
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,880
Guard here.

166
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,480
You must not leave here.

167
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,290
Nor let anyone get near.

168
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,220
Go there when it's time to offer the lychees.

169
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,560
Are we clear?

170
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,960
But...

171
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,080
Consort,

172
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,780
Her Majesty is holding a lychee party today.

173
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,720
If you keep hiding here and refusing to see people,

174
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,360
Her Majesty may feel hurt.

175
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,920
Look at me.

176
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,400
I’d better not spoil the joy of everyone.

177
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,000
All the concubines have gone there,

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,120
except you.

179
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,680
If some vicious people learn of it,

180
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
they'll say you are being proud

181
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,360
because of your pregnancy.

182
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,440
I said I won't go.

183
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,700
Can't you understand?

184
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,840
Yingluo.

185
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,340
What are you doing?

186
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,860
I'm here to invite Consort Yu to attend the lychee banquet.

187
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,400
Even you are being hard on me?

188
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,500
You know that I'm afraid of seeing those people.

189
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,160
I don't want to go.

190
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,960
I don't want to see Consort Jia,

191
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,400
or Noble Consort Gao.

192
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,000
Leave us alone.

193
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,580
What are you doing?

194
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,780
Aren't you afraid?

195
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,720
Once you're dead, everything will be over.

196
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,280
No one will try to harm you again.

197
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,120
Yingluo...

198
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,200
Consort Yu,

199
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,340
Noble Consort Gao and Consort Jia

200
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,240
tried to harm you repeatedly.

201
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,340
You think you'll be safe if you hide here?

202
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,800
The more you're afraid of trouble,

203
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,400
the more they will bully you.

204
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,880
Think about the tragic death of Consort Yi.

205
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,210
Think about how you almost got strangled.

206
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,480
This palace is not a safe harbor.

207
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,160
It's just a tomb

208
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,840
that can be sealed anytime!

209
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,760
It has buried Consort Yi.

210
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,920
The next one

211
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,040
will be you.

212
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,240
You're right.

213
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,840
I'm afraid.

214
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,200
I'm so afraid.

215
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,280
Every time I think about those people,

216
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,160
and what they did,

217
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,880
I tremble with fear.

218
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
But Yingluo,

219
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,040
I had fought.

220
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,440
You saw what happened

221
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,400
to Sister Consort Yi.

222
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,280
Consort Yu,

223
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,520
when I was eight,

224
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,890
I got bitten by a bad dog.

225
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,480
It was so painful that I cried a whole night.

226
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,480
The next day, I took a rod

227
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,020
and chased after that bad dog.

228
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,880
I chased it across half of the capital city.

229
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,800
In face of bad dogs,

230
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,680
you must be braver

231
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,400
and fiercer,

232
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,460
so you can scare them away.

233
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,840
With the same reasoning,

234
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,440
evil people bully the weak but fear the strong.

235
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,770
The more you are afraid,

236
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,640
the more they will bully you.

237
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
For your child,

238
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,840
for poor Consort Yi,

239
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,000
pick up your weapons

240
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,360
and face your enemies.

241
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,200
Weapons.

242
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,680
Me?

243
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,240
What weapon do I have?

244
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,560
Your weakness,

245
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,880
your tears,

246
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,960
the Emperor’s offspring in your belly,

247
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,840
are all your weapons.

248
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,560
If you want to fight back,

249
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,160
today is your best chance.

250
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,960
Your Majesty,

251
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,180
this is "White Snow and Red Plum" specially made by the Royal Restaurant.

252
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,040
The Royal Restaurant really toiled for this.

253
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,360
They look elegant.

254
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,640
Your Majesty,

255
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,200
lychees can cause excessive internal heat.

256
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,130
So they soaked them in salted water

257
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,130
and paired them with wolfberry for neutralization.

258
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,720
Lychees used in food are nothing special.

259
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,000
After all, dried lychees are sent here every year.

260
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,140
If you add other ingredients to the lychees,

261
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,680
they won’t taste right.

262
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,160
People who know lychees

263
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,640
are only interested in the fresh ones.

264
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,640
Your Majesty,

265
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,720
didn't you say you’d pick the fruit today?

266
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,200
Why can’t I see anything happening?

267
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Where's Yingluo?

268
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,160
She...

269
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,240
Where

270
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,600
is Yingluo now?

271
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,320
Your Majesty, Yingluo…

272
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,840
Consort Yu is here!

273
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,360
Consort Yu.

274
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,160
I am late.

275
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,920
May Your Majesties forgive me.

276
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,880
Consort Yu,

277
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,440
you're here.

278
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,880
Rise, please.

279
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,560
Your Majesty, you’re holding a party.

280
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,480
I should come.

281
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,720
And you are so caring.

282
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,040
I have no reason to be idling around.

283
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,240
Consort Yu,

284
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,850
how are you feeling?

285
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,560
Thank you for your concerns, Your Majesty.

286
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,960
I feel much better.

287
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,050
That's good.

288
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,010
Take good care of yourself,

289
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,560
or else, Her Majesty

290
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,610
will be worried.

291
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,960
Yes.

292
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,200
Take a seat.

293
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,640
Your Majesty,

294
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,740
where's Miss Yingluo?

295
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,450
My mouth is watering

296
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,560
for the fresh lychees

297
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,280
that are beautiful and tasty.

298
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,640
Your Majesty,

299
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,280
where did she go?

300
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,200
Your Majesty.

301
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,360
I was making some preparations.

302
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Sorry to keep you waiting, masters.

303
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Your Majesty,

304
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,800
please pick the fruit.

305
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,000
Empress!

306
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,760
Snowball!

307
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,560
Your Majesty!

308
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,400
Help!

309
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't bite me!

310
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,340
Catch that dog!

311
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,160
Somebody!

312
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,440
Catch that dog!

313
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,520
Catch it!

314
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,010
Don't come here!

315
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,970
Don't be afraid!

316
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,130
Don't be afraid!

317
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,400
I’m afraid.

318
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,000
It's ok.

319
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,320
The dog has been caught.

320
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,160
It's ok.

321
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,640
Are you alright, Consort Yu?

322
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,780
Noble Consort Gao ,

323
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,860
you scared me in the Imperial Garden.

324
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,660
Today, you're doing it again!

325
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,800
Are you trying to kill me!

326
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,720
What's going on?

327
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,820
What is Consort Yu talking about?

328
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
Your Majesty,

329
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,560
a month ago in the Imperial Garden,

330
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,040
Snowball suddenly charged out

331
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,300
and scared Consort Yu.

332
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,160
No one got hurt that time,

333
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,040
and Her Majesty was magnanimous.

334
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,760
She didn't hold anyone responsible for it.

335
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,640
But Consort Yu

336
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,440
can’t sleep without nerve-calming soup at night.

337
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,320
Today, she was feeling a little better,

338
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,380
and this happened.

339
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,410
Consort Chun, what do you mean?

340
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,840
Are you saying

341
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,700
I ordered that animal to harm her?

342
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,320
Everyone saw it.

343
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,330
Noble Consort Gao, why bother denying it?

344
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,940
Consort Chun, you are so good at making unfounded remarks.

345
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,400
Did you see Snowball

346
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,000
rushing right to Consort Yu?

347
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,600
Your Majesty!

348
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,400
Your Majesty,

349
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,800
save me.

350
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,920
I can't endure it anymore.

351
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,800
Your Majesty,

352
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,320
if this continues,

353
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,040
I might die with my baby.

354
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,560
Your Majesty,

355
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,440
save me!

356
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Your Majesty!

357
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,820
Help Consort stand up.

358
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,680
Your Majesty,

359
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,960
please give me justice.

360
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,380
Take a rest on the side.

361
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,480
I will decide on this.

362
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,200
Consort Yu,

363
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,160
get up first.

364
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,730
Your health is more important.

365
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,260
Noble Consort Gao,

366
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,290
you repeatedly disturbed Consort Yu.

367
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,040
I let it pass.

368
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,650
But today on my lychee banquet,

369
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,880
you indulged the animal to act wildly.

370
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,760
You traumatized Consort Yu again.

371
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,800
What do you want?

372
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,860
Noble Consort Gao,

373
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
answer the question of Her Majesty!

374
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,800
Your Majesty,

375
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,120
I don’t know what happened.

376
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Snowball is very obedient and has never caused any trouble.

377
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,560
The event in the Imperial Garden was also a misunderstanding.

378
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,040
Today…

379
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,170
Misunderstanding?

380
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,960
My lychee tree is destroyed like that

381
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,120
and you call it a misunderstanding?

382
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,040
I repeatedly warned you

383
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,010
not to indulge your bad dog to bite people.

384
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,560
Today, the dog didn't bite.

385
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,120
It was interested in the tribute of Fujian,

386
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,260
the gift that His Majesty gave me.

387
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,560
Your Majesty,

388
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,920
if you delivered a tree to Palace of Gathered Elegance,

389
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,440
how could this happen today?

390
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,400
After all,

391
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,720
it was because Noble Consort Gao

392
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,240
harbored resentment

393
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,680
that she vented her anger on this innocent lychee tree.

394
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,210
I’m so sorry for Consort Yu.

395
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,970
She had to recall that fearful moment.

396
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,440
Then it means

397
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,400
You believed

398
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,280
I was biased towards Her Majesty

399
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,680
and harbored resentment,

400
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,080
so you were displaying your strength

401
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,840
with that dog?

402
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,960
Your Majesty,

403
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
Snowball is an animal.

404
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,640
It ruined the atmosphere today.

405
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,760
I'll skin it when I go back.

406
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,960
It is just a dog.

407
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,840
How could it know right and wrong?

408
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,200
You're passing the buck

409
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,280
to a dog?

410
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,560
The tiger and the rhinoceros got out of their cages,

411
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,200
and the tortoise shell and jade offerings got destroyed in their containers.

412
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,360
Who is to blame?

413
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,000
Your Majesty,

414
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,080
the tiger and the rhinoceros came out of their cages,

415
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,920
and the tortoise shell and jade offerings got destroyed in their containers.

416
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,050
The guardians should be responsible.

417
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,320
When we were carrying the tree today,

418
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,960
Snowball ran around underfoot.

419
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,480
But it was

420
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,880
a beloved pet of Noble Consort Empress,

421
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,640
so the servants didn’t dare drive it away,

422
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,200
hence this event.

423
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,880
It was my fault that I did not properly watch the tree.

424
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,920
I'm willing to accept punishment.

425
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,650
Wei Yingluo,

426
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,720
you indeed committed a mistake.

427
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,280
I'm punishing you…

428
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,540
By deducting your salary for half a year.

429
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,580
Thank you for your grace, master.

430
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,920
I'm going to be bold

431
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,320
and ask it for Consort Yu.

432
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,240
The person watching the lychee tree has been punished.

433
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,600
What about the one that destroyed it?

434
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,330
How dare you!

435
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,800
You think you have a say here?

436
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,240
Can't the person involved

437
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,960
defend herself?

438
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,440
Moreover, she's asking it for Consort Yu.

439
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,220
Doesn't the victim

440
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,800
have any right to question?

441
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
Your Majesty, thank you for your mercy.

442
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,960
Please forgive my boldness.

443
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,400
Consort Yu is carrying the Emperor’s offspring.

444
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
She’s honorable.

445
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,170
The lychee tree was yearly tribute of Fujian,

446
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,000
and was bestowed by His Majesty.

447
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,440
Your Majesty, you’re magnanimous, though,

448
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,720
Your honor is to be revered

449
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,520
and no provocation should be tolerated.

450
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,680
All these matters are connected with Snowball,

451
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,800
but Snowball is an animal.

452
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,320
It doesn't understand etiquette or rules.

453
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,450
If we're going to blame someone, it should be its master.

454
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,540
She didn't discipline or control it.

455
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,040
I boldly request Your Majesty to make a judgment.

456
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,160
Noble Consort Gao,

457
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,400
what

458
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
do you have to say?

459
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,280
Your Majesty,

460
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,040
it was all my fault.

461
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,200
Noble Consort Empress knew that Snowball was quite mischievous

462
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,560
and worried it might destroy the banquet of Her Majesty,

463
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,760
so she instructed me to keep watch of it.

464
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,680
I was careless.

465
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,640
My negligence

466
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,240
almost caused a huge accident.

467
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,240
It has nothing to do with Noble Consort, Your Majesty!

468
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,480
Noble Consort Gao is the master empress of Palace of Gathered Elegance.

469
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,680
Consort Jia, if you've committed a mistake,

470
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,640
can she exclude herself from the crime of not disciplining you?

471
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,440
Your Majesty, it's all my fault!

472
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,680
If you are to punish anyone, just punish me!

473
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,540
Your Majesty, please forgive me!

474
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,800
This lychee tree

475
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,880
is tribute of Fujian.

476
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,880
It had traveled a thousand li to arrive in the capital.

477
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,720
I gifted it to Her Majesty,

478
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,120
so that she could be happy.

479
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,880
But because of your negligence,

480
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,680
all my efforts are ruined.

481
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,840
You shouldn't be apologizing to me.

482
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,890
You should be apologizing to Her Majesty.

483
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,320
Your Majesty,

484
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,400
it was all my fault.

485
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,520
I'm incompetent and didn't discipline the dog well.

486
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,040
May Your Majesty have mercy.

487
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,320
Please forgive me.

488
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,240
May Your Majesty have mercy.

489
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,840
Please forgive me!

490
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,480
It’s nothing but a banquet to me.

491
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,560
But Consort Yu

492
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,650
suffered another huge trauma.

493
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,160
If anything bad happens to her,

494
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,360
and the Emperor’s offspring is harmed,

495
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,060
how are you going to pay for it?

496
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,330
However many times you kneel down,

497
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,080
you won't be able to make up for it.

498
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,040
Consort Jia,

499
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,640
Her Majesty means

500
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,280
you should be apologizing to Consort Yu.

501
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,880
Consort Jia,

502
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,840
what are you waiting for?

503
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,320
Are you unhappy with the judgment of His Majesty,

504
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,600
or

505
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,860
are you not sincerely repenting?

506
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,040
I...

507
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,160
I dare not.

508
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,360
Consort Yu,

509
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,600
it's because of my negligence

510
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,260
that a grave accident almost took place.

511
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,920
Please forgive me.

512
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
I

513
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,360
am not worthy of your bow.

514
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,120
Of course you are.

515
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,040
It's all my fault! My fault!

516
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,650
Sister, please forgive me!

517
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,370
Hope you're repenting sincerely.

518
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,840
Stop indulging that bad dog in harming others.

519
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,960
I won't.

520
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,940
It won’t happen again.

521
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,010
What about you, Noble Consort Gao?

522
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,840
Your Majesty,

523
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,380
Although it was Consort Jia’s fault to be negligent and not to discipline it,

524
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,280
I have my fault.

525
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,000
I will restrain Snowball.

526
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,160
I won't let that dog commit any mistakes again.

527
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,200
No need!

528
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,100
I don't want to see that dog again.

529
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,800
Consort Jia committed a grave mistake due to negligence.

530
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,720
She’ll be demoted by one grade

531
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,050
and confined to her room for three months.

532
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,360
Your Majesty.

533
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,320
As the master empress of Palace of Gathered Elegance,

534
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,880
you couldn't discipline your people or your dog.

535
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,280
You're so incompetent.

536
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,040
Your palace allowance will be omitted for one year.

537
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
Go back and reflect on your actions.

538
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,160
Your Majesty!

539
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,320
Your Majesty!

540
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,050
Until next time, Your Majesty.

541
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,380
Your Highness.

542
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,300
Your Highness.

543
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,820
Sister, why is the punishment so severe?

544
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,000
What do you know?

545
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,400
They destroyed the tribute from Fujian,

546
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,320
ruined the banquet of Her Majesty,

547
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,120
traumatized Consort Yu and almost harmed the Emperor’s offspring.

548
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,800
After committing so many crimes,

549
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,660
could anyone escape punishment?

550
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,200
No matter how smart Snowball is,

551
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,000
it's still a dog.

552
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,320
Shouldn’t its master be held responsible?

553
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,600
Wasn't the event in the Imperial Garden

554
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,240
settled already?

555
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,010
Retribution will come,

556
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,120
sooner or later.

557
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,600
Aren’t the debts all settled today?

558
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,920
Your Majesty,

559
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,920
that's what happened.

560
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,320
What?

561
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,040
Get it back.

562
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,760
Snowball.

563
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,240
Snowball.

564
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,520
Snowball.

565
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,080
Snowball.

566
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,640
What are you looking for?

567
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,880
Have you seen Snowball of Noble Consort?

568
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,960
It might have gone that way. There.

569
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,080
Snowball.

570
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,000
I decided on my own.

571
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,120
May Your Majesty forgive me.

572
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,480
Yingluo, oh, Yingluo.

573
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,720
How could you think of such an idea!

574
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,080
Noble Consort Gao

575
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,920
used Snowball to scare Consort Yu.

576
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,840
Her outstanding debt was paid today.

577
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,640
We were not aggrieving her.

578
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,680
It's nothing for me to admit my mistake and accept punishment.

579
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,000
Noble Consort Gao and Consort Jia did that

580
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,200
to embarrass Your Majesty.

581
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,960
How could I let them succeed?

582
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,120
I failed to watch the trees properly

583
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,000
and the lychees were destroyed.

584
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,320
That’s huge.

585
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,320
But Noble Consort Gao

586
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,680
instigated that bad dog to harm Consort Yu,

587
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,920
and destroyed tribute of Fujian

588
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,360
to spoil your banquet.

589
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,940
My crime was much minor than hers.

590
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,160
Consort Yu kept shouting

591
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,330
and demanding justice.

592
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,760
His Majesty was too busy to notice your mistake.

593
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,620
He focused his attention on Noble Consort Gao instead.

594
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,680
But Yingluo,

595
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,680
you told me

596
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,820
that you didn't read much.

597
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,840
How did you reply His Majesty's question?

598
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,920
The tiger and the rhinoceros got out of their cages,

599
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,600
and the tortoise shell and jade offerings got destroyed in their containers.

600
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,680
Who is to blame?

601
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,300
Your Majesty, you mean these sentences?

602
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,440
His Majesty said it too fast.

603
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,700
I didn’t understand immediately

604
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,320
that His Majesty was calling to account.

605
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,360
Your Majesty,

606
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,000
I only know three sentences

607
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
recorded in Analects of Confucius.

608
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,120
"Is it not pleasant to learn

609
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,000
with a constant perseverance and application?"

610
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,400
"When I walk along with two others,

611
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,460
I surely will learn from one of them."

612
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,720
And lastly,

613
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,520
“The tiger and the rhinoceros got out of their cages,

614
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,640
and the tortoise shell and jade offerings got destroyed in their containers.

615
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,720
Who is to blame?”

616
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,240
I heard those three sentences

617
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,800
when my neighbor, a scholar, recited them.

618
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,160
Then I guessed the meaning.

619
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,880
Yingluo,

620
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,060
you are quick-witted.

621
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,120
It's just that

622
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,160
you were not well educated when you were young.

623
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,290
I came from an ordinary family.

624
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,000
A full meal and warm clothes are already great fortune for us.

625
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,880
How could I have the luxurious hope of reading?

626
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,360
Your Majesty,

627
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,520
most women in this empire are like me.

628
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,440
From tomorrow,

629
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,480
I will teach you.

630
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,480
Your Majesty?

631
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,290
You're so intelligent.

632
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,300
I'll teach you to read books and know the proper etiquette.

633
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,280
We must not waste the talent and intelligence

634
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,880
endowed by the heaven.

635
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,880
Thank you, Your Majesty!

636
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,610
Imperial Consort Xian.

637
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,360
You told Her Majesty that I urgently needed money,

638
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,840
am I right?

639
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,520
Yes.

640
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,240
Why did you do that?

641
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,800
I mentioned it as some idle gossip.

642
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,560
I didn’t mean anything.

643
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,840
I didn’t expect she’d remember it

644
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,760
and grant you a gift today.

645
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,680
I know

646
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,240
you don’t want to be associated with me.

647
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,840
But today, let me tell you some sincere words.

648
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,760
Her Majesty has never meant to gang up.

649
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,160
She never wants anyone to repay her kindness, either.

650
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,720
She just helped you

651
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,880
because she heard that you were in trouble.

652
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,440
She was afraid her help might be a mental burden.

653
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,520
So she made an excuse for rewarding you.

654
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,080
She specially did it in front of His Majesty to make it more legitimate.

655
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,240
This money is now officially yours.

656
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,960
No one will comment about it.

657
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,280
Sister,

658
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,400
you can go save your brother with the money.

659
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,520
Empress,

660
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,409
you're assured now, right?

661
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,000
Why?

662
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,760
Are you still suspicious

663
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,290
of Her Majesty' intention?

664
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,560
I never suspected Her Majesty.

665
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,880
If she had wanted to oblige me,

666
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,840
she could have summoned me to Palace of Eternal Spring.

667
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,710
Today she rewarded me in a perfectly justifiable name,

668
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,170
because she didn't want me to feel burdened.

669
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,400
But Consort Chun…

670
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,320
What's wrong with Consort Chun?

671
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,280
Consort Chun is very sharp-minded.

672
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,190
She knew I wouldn't accept the money,

673
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,560
so she told Her Majesty.

674
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,670
This way,

675
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,560
I have to accept this favor of hers,

676
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,820
even if I don't want to.

677
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,710
Empress,

678
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,360
I don’t understand.

679
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,130
I only know that Young Master can be saved now.

680
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,880
Alright.

681
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,480
This being the case,

682
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,340
I can only repay the favor slowly.

683
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,400
Deliver the silver out of the Palace as soon as possible.

684
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,240
Yes.

685
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,680
Eunuch Li.

686
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Guard Suolun.

687
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,690
His Majesty ordered

688
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,120
this dog be killed.

689
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,600
We are all His Majesty's close attendants.

690
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
If we get blood on us

691
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,320
it may affect the fortune of His Majesty.

692
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,120
It's best for you guards to do it.

693
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,280
Eunuch Li!

694
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,880
Get blood on them!

695
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,420
You’re worried Noble Consort Gao might come after you.

696
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,600
Go patrol elsewhere.

697
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,160
Guard Suolun.

698
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,280
You are…?

699
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,360
The maid in Palace of Eternal Peace.

700
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,930
I am a palace maid of Palace of Eternal Spring.

701
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,880
Yeah.

702
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,280
Your name is Wei Yingluo.

703
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,320
That time

704
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,400
you were so ruthless with that eunuch!

705
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,600
I'll never forget it.

706
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,520
I had no choice.

707
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,080
I had to protect myself.

708
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,740
May you understand, Officer.

709
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,240
I am here today

710
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,280
to take Snowball.

711
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,120
It hurt Consort Yu,

712
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,130
ruined Her Majesty’s banquet,

713
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,320
and caused me to be punished.

714
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Take it to Palace of Eternal Spring?

715
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,880
What are you going to do with it?

716
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,410
First, I will vent my anger,

717
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
then I'll kill it.

718
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,880
You young lady

719
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,360
can do that?

720
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,010
That’s funny, Officer.

721
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,440
This dog

722
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,640
almost killed me.

723
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,620
Though I managed to keep my position,

724
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,930
I got harshly scolded by my master.

725
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,880
If I don't skin it!

726
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,200
Fine.

727
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,260
I'll give it to you.

728
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,160
Wait.

729
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,080
What is it?

730
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,970
If His Majesty asks about it later?

731
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,420
Don't worry, Officer.

732
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,040
You’ll have the evidence

733
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,640
to report on your mission.

734
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,200
Alright.

735
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,000
That's a deal.

736
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,360
How dare you!

737
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,840
You passed off your duty?

738
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,600
She asked for it.

739
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,130
I didn’t force it to her.

740
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,240
Don't pretend.

741
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,000
You were worried Noble Consort Gao

742
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,240
would understand what happened,

743
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,370
and ask about how her beloved dog died.

744
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,120
She can't do anything to His Majesty

745
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,720
but she can deal with a guard.

746
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,880
A woman's hatred is the most horrible thing.

747
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,400
It's best not to get it.

748
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,800
Then you just pushed it onto Wei Yingluo?

749
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,520
She's a palace maid of Palace of Eternal Spring.

750
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,880
Palace of Eternal Spring and Palace of Gathered Elegance have always been enemies.

751
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,280
More hatred isn't anything to be scared of.

752
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,560
I’m worried she couldn’t do it.

753
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,290
She's a girl, after all.

754
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,260
Maybe you have underestimated Wei Yingluo.

755
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,920
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

756
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,380
It's not right.

757
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,240
What's not right?

758
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,560
Do you remember how that lychee tree looked at the end?

759
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,460
I don't understand what you mean.

760
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,100
That lychee tree was destroyed by Snowball, wasn't it?

761
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,840
The lychees on the lower part could be destroyed.

762
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,440
But those on the higher part?

763
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,880
They…

764
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,840
Go to Palace of Eternal Spring right away

765
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,100
and bring me that maid.

766
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,880
I am going to punish her!

767
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,560
Yes.

768
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,120
Wait.

769
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Come back.

770
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,200
Your Majesty.

771
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
No need to go.

772
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,620
Your Majesty, you...?

773
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,800
That audacious girl!

774
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,660
She redirected the disaster.

775
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,400
What's the use of going there now?

776
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,000
The dust is settled already.

777
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,880
Your Majesty, that’s why

778
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,200
we can't spare that maid.

779
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,320
I will go and bring her here from Palace of Eternal Spring immediately!

780
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,360
For what? Bring!

781
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,160
I just finished punishing Consort Jia and Noble Consort Gao.

782
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,280
Then in less than four hours I retract my order?

783
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,410
Who do you think I am?

784
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,320
Your Majesty,

785
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,970
then you don't blame her

786
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,800
for framing Noble Consort Gao and Consort Jia?

787
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,600
Consort Yu was shivering.

788
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,900
I’m sure Palace of Gathered Elegance

789
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,200
have done something to the lychees and Consort Yu.

790
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
Now,

791
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,170
they are suffering for their own actions.

792
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,360
Your Majesty, you are going to let her go?

793
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,880
That maid made every effort

794
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,560
to protect Her Majesty.

795
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,760
I can't be too harsh

796
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,880
for Her Majesty’s sake.

797
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,200
But she used my hand

798
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,840
to take her revenge.

799
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,160
Despicable.

800
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,560
So despicable.

801
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,450
Chamberlain Li,

802
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,840
what's wrong?

803
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,360
Desheng,

804
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,960
what do you think of His Majesty

805
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,520
most of the time?

806
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,280
Diligent in governing and loving his people?

807
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,960
No, I don't mean that.

808
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,720
Then

809
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
determined and decisive.

810
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,200
Yes.

811
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,520
Who is His Majesty?

812
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,660
The Emperor of Great Qing.

813
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,080
The master of the nation.

814
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,040
He can kill anyone he dislikes

815
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,480
whatever happens!

816
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,760
Why did he just let it go?

817
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,120
That's courting trouble.

818
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,000
Chamberlain, maybe His Majesty has his concerns.

819
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,720
What concerns can he have?

820
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,880
How much did he favor Eshan?

821
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,680
And so many begged for his mercy.

822
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,320
In the end, he killed Eshan

823
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,040
without a blink.

824
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,180
Hey, why are you smirking?

825
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,770
No, not the same.

826
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,080
That depends on if that's a man or a woman.

827
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,720
Woman.

828
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,160
Then it depends on if she's pretty

829
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,560
or ugly.

830
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,800
She looks despicable.

831
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,200
When I think about her...

832
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,000
Be careful. Be careful.

833
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,880
What…what do you mean?

834
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,720
If I think about it again,

835
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,880
she's good-looking.

836
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,280
You mean..?

837
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,330
Impossible! Absolutely impossible!

838
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,480
Chamber Li,

839
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,960
the world is so vast.

840
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,050
How could anything be impossible?

841
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,440
You…

842
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,560
You think I don’t know what His Majesty is thinking?

843
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,080
If I say it's impossible, it's impossible.

844
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,760
Then it's impossible. Impossible.

845
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,890
I shouldn’t have guessed what His Majesty was thinking.

846
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,280
Impossible.

847
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,600
You killed it?

848
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,370
It ruined my master’s banquet.

849
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,080
I beat it up to vent my anger.

850
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,130
Then I killed it.

851
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,240
Where's the meat?

852
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,610
I meant to send it to the Royal Restaurant.

853
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,400
But I heard

854
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,120
before our ancestors crossed Shanhaiguan,

855
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,080
people of all banners lived on hunting

856
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,400
and befriended hunting dogs.

857
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,840
So since the days of Taizu,

858
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,680
it has been forbidden to eat dog meat.

859
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,480
Though Snowball was killed by order of His Majesty,

860
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,600
we couldn’t eat it.

861
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
I was so angry

862
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,410
that I decided to bury it right then and there.

863
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,160
Later,

864
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,400
I remembered I need to preserve evidence for you.

865
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,930
So I delivered the fur here.

866
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,400
Alright.

867
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,560
Then you can keep it.

868
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,440
If Eunuch Li asks about it, I will answer to him.

869
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,840
Thank you, Officer.
