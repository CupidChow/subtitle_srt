[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 66]

3
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,300
Li Yu, did you smell anything just now?

4
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:55,820
Wellâ€¦

5
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,920
Didn't you smell something
raw on the Empress?

6
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,300
That medicine...

7
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,380
Should I check the medicine?

8
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,419
The Empress wants eternal youth.

9
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,340
Ying Luo was right.

10
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,380
It's human nature.

11
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,120
-No need to investigate.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

12
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,020
Your Highness,

13
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,740
His Majesty rarely comes here.

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,860
Why must you mention the unhappy things?

15
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,750
The Fifteenth Prince
is Noble Consort Ling's son.

16
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,850
Why do you care about him?

17
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,930
As for the two princesses,
they have the Empress Dowager's support.

18
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,660
They'll find a husband.

19
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,620
Why do you have to worry about them?

20
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,420
I'm the Empress, the legitimate
mother of the concubines' children.

21
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,660
I have to mind certain things
even if I don't want to.

22
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,900
Otherwise, if anything happens,

23
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,410
I'll be the first person
His Majesty blames.

24
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,660
Zhen'er.

25
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,330
I'll take the placenta
at night in the future.

26
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,990
Don't let anyone find out.
-Yes, Your Highness.

27
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,900
Your Majesty, stop moving.

28
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,690
You are disturbing my sleep.

29
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,180
Are you supposed to serve me
or the other way around?

30
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,900
You have been asking this for ten years.

31
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,900
Aren't you tired of it?

32
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,820
Do you know what the Empress said today?

33
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,740
I didn't do anything.

34
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,260
Forget the fact
that you're still wild and reckless.

35
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,630
You're influencing your children now.

36
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,620
It makes all the other
princes and princesses...

37
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:16,140
hope to have a silly mother like you
to turn the palace upside down!

38
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,920
Why aren't you asking
me for forgiveness?

39
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,740
Did the Empress complain that
I spoil the children too much,

40
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,800
and they don't have manners?

41
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,780
Since you know that,

42
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,050
then why are you still doing it?

43
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,500
Zhao Hua and Zhao Yu are your daughters.

44
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,300
They will either marry
a prince or commoner.

45
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,850
They will eventually be married off.

46
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,430
This is a responsibility
a royal princess can't shirk.

47
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,010
I just want them to enjoy
a happy childhood.

48
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,660
Am I wrong?

49
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,260
Fine.

50
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,460
I won't worry about my daughters,

51
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,770
but what about Yong Yan?

52
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,720
Throughout the dynasty's history,

53
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,780
every prince studies from day to night
in scholarship and warriorship.

54
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,500
Yong Yan is my son.

55
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,080
How can you just bring him out and about
till he neglects his studies?

56
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,380
He's your son and my son.

57
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
I have the right
to educate him however I like.

58
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,620
You are being unreasonable!

59
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,100
Stop!

60
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,100
Come back here.

61
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,780
Give me back!

62
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,659
Give it back!

63
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,300
Come back!

64
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,760
Your Majesty, put me down!

65
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,940
Put me down!

66
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,940
Your Majesty...

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,370
It hurts, doesn't it?

68
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,780
You deserved that, you willful girl!

69
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,680
You just sprained your back, right?

70
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,840
You are not young anymore!

71
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,420
Still acting like a child!

72
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,100
Serves you right for being reckless!

73
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,580
You're the child here.

74
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,530
Running off in the middle of the night?

75
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,430
If it were someone else,
they'd be beheaded by now.

76
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,710
I'm not afraid!

77
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,430
If Your Majesty beheads me,

78
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,060
you'd miss me!

79
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,020
By the time I get beheaded,

80
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,570
what should I do?

81
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,860
It's fine.

82
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,020
Your Majesty can hang
my head in front of the bed.

83
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,180
When you are bored,

84
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,500
I can still talk to you.

85
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,340
I don't want your head.

86
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,540
It's horrifying.

87
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,620
Get up.

88
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,950
Come here.

89
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,340
Give me a massage.

90
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,020
Why are you so quiet now?

91
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,020
When Yong Yan was little,
he was weak and frail.

92
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,220
The whole house smelled like medicine.

93
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,540
It really broke my heart.

94
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:54,220
That's why I don't care whether
he becomes a good prince.

95
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,060
I only want him to be healthy.

96
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,340
I don't care about anything else.

97
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,300
Out of all your sons,

98
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,250
Yong Yan is not the smartest.

99
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,540
But I only want him to be the happiest
and healthiest child.

100
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,620
That is good enough.

101
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,440
Yong Yan is a prince.

102
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,170
I know.

103
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,660
You come from an ordinary family,

104
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,820
you don't understand
the problems we have here.

105
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,980
A rich family can afford
to have a spoiled child.

106
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,740
But if we have a spoiled prince,

107
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,700
it'll be recorded in history.

108
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,900
Yong Yan is a good child.

109
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,850
Don't let his talents go waste.

110
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,700
Anyway,

111
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,700
everyone hopes to see their
sons accomplish something.

112
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,500
Don't you want that?

113
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,980
Your Majesty,

114
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,000
haven't you been setting your
sights on the Fifth Prince?

115
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,430
Keep quiet if you know nothing.

116
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,020
Everyone can see that.

117
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,650
Why don't you admit it?

118
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,060
Among all the princes,

119
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,660
Yong Qi is the most outstanding one.

120
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,410
Everyone is impressed by him.

121
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,060
That's why you should
just let go of Yong Yan...

122
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,340
and let him grow up happily.

123
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,580
You don't have any ambition.

124
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,140
In other words,

125
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,100
you are short-sighted!

126
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,780
No matter who the future Crown Prince is,

127
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,460
I have no worries.

128
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,420
As long as Your Majesty is healthy
and lives a long life,

129
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,780
you can protect Yong Yan and me.

130
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,970
I love that line.

131
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,620
What's wrong?

132
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,300
I just hurt my back when I fell.

133
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,660
Starting tomorrow,

134
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,400
you are not allowed to disturb
Yong Yan when he's studying.

135
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,890
Do you hear me?

136
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,220
Here?

137
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
This New Year's drawing looks nice.

138
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,970
I like it.

139
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,700
What is this?

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,460
Sugared hazelnuts?

141
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,300
We have sugared hazelnuts!

142
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,090
Consort Ling,
these are for my Ninth Sister.

143
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,500
Look at you.

144
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,300
Look at you.

145
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,220
Playing favorites now.

146
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,370
Not only do I have nothing,
your younger sisters

147
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,340
get way lesser than what
the Fifteenth Prince gets.

148
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,170
The Empress Dowager dotes on
the Seventh and Ninth Princess.

149
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,940
They have the best food and clothes.

150
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,630
As for the Fifteenth Prince...

151
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,380
He has Consort Qing and me
to take care of him.

152
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,980
It's good that Consort Qing
cares of him deeply.

153
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,860
As for youâ€¦

154
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,300
I can't count on you.

155
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,540
What's wrong with me?

156
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,180
What's wrong with you?

157
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,760
Other than bringing the
Fifteenth Prince to run amok...

158
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,590
and earning him a reproach from Father,

159
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,020
what else have you done?

160
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,340
Ever since His Majesty
scolded me last time,

161
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,720
I have never had him skip classes again.

162
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,440
You've been hiding much from us,

163
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,750
but I understand that you took him
out and about for two years...

164
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,560
because his health was poor.

165
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,130
There's nothing wrong with this.

166
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,120
But he's a healthy child now.

167
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,300
He can't continue playing like this.

168
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,120
As a prince, if he's
ignorant and incompetent,

169
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,040
how will he get on
with life in the future?

170
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,140
He will blame you when he grows up.

171
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,850
In the future, I will tutor him myself.

172
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,620
Duly noted.

173
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,010
Isn't there a firearms
demonstration today?

174
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,860
You should go now.

175
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,220
Well...

176
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,380
Well,

177
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,580
leave all the gifts here.

178
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,940
I will personally deliver them.

179
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,820
Really?

180
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,410
Yes.

181
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,340
Go now.

182
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,340
Look how petty he is.

183
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,140
I'm going to take these gifts for myself.

184
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,180
No need.

185
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,710
The gifts for the princesses
and the prince...

186
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,230
have been delivered this morning.

187
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,960
These are all for you.

188
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,900
The Fifth Prince was teasing you just now.

189
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,740
Fourth Prince.

190
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,770
Father sent Fifth Brother
and me to Suzhou for some errands.

191
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,290
We brought back some local
specialties on our way back.

192
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,770
These are for Mother.

193
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,870
Fourth Prince, bad timing.

194
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,800
Her Highness
hasn't been feeling well since noon.

195
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,070
She's resting now.

196
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,240
-Have you summoned the physician?
-It's just the usual relapse.

197
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,970
She will be fine after resting.

198
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,970
When I'm back from the practice field,

199
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,340
I'll visit her.

200
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,800
Twelfth Prince,

201
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,710
studying and training are important,

202
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,990
but you should visit
Her Highness more often...

203
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,030
as she has been unhappy.

204
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,780
With you keeping her company,
she will cheer up.

205
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,290
Madam Zhen, don't worry.

206
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,660
I will keep it in mind.

207
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,460
Fourth Prince!

208
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,300
Fourth Prince, wait for me.

209
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,420
Fourth Prince!

210
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,660
Fourth Prince, wait for me!

211
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,590
Jin Zhong.

212
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,810
Yes, Your Highness.

213
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,540
Do something for me.

214
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,500
Father values Yong Qi very much.

215
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,500
If he messes up,

216
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,100
I can finally make an impression.

217
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,140
By then,

218
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,530
Mother will be proud of me.

219
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,380
Are you happy now?

220
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,640
I can count on you!

221
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,780
If this goes on,

222
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,920
the Fourth Prince will hate
the Twelfth Prince even more.

223
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,460
So what?

224
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,540
To the Empress,

225
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,690
the more the Fourth Prince
tries to gain her attention,

226
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,260
the better it is for herself.

227
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,500
I really don't understand
what you are trying to do!

228
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,830
You will understand.

229
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,660
You will understand
my painstaking efforts very soon.

230
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,350
[Weapons Storage Office]

231
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,080
Your Majesty.

232
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,830
The Fifth Prince's
marksmanship is improving.

233
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,780
Yong Ji,

234
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,060
how's your marksmanship?

235
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,660
Father, I'm not
as good as Fifth Brother,

236
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,530
but I have confidence
that in less than six months,

237
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,180
I can hit the bull's eye too.

238
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,700
Ambition is crucial.

239
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,310
If you hit the bull's eye,

240
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,620
I will give you the Weijie gun.

241
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,740
Thank you, Father.
I will practice diligently.

242
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,610
Father.

243
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,210
Your marksmanship is impressive.

244
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,720
It was just a stroke of good luck.

245
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,900
Why do you say that?

246
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,470
This is a flint-lock rifle,
not a matchlock musket.

247
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,840
If it were a musket,

248
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,360
I wouldn't hit the target
even if the target is right in front.

249
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,300
Yong Qi.

250
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,400
When Emperor Kangxi conquered Guldan,

251
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,500
his army used muskets
and won a glorious war.

252
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,930
The matchlock muskets used
by the army barracks now...

253
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,579
are more sophisticated
than those in the past.

254
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,270
But our muskets are much less effective
compared to the flint-lock rifles...

255
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,099
all the way from England.

256
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,420
Both are firearms.

257
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,970
What's the difference?

258
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,849
The muskets have to be ignited manually.

259
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:17,940
When it rains,

260
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,880
the fuse will be wet and can't be lighted.

261
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,940
When it's windy,

262
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,690
the gunpowder will be blown away.

263
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,780
How will we fight the war then?

264
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,260
Fu Heng,

265
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,700
you even discussed this with him?

266
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,330
It's good that the Fifth Prince
is interested in military matters.

267
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,160
I just presented him with facts.

268
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,090
I didn't expect him
to draw inferences from this.

269
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,680
Father,

270
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,630
please allow me to say something.

271
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,390
Our flint-lock pistols and rifles
are all kept in the palace.

272
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,980
It's a great pity.

273
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,220
If we can promote
the use of flint-lock guns,

274
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,770
we will be invincible on the battlefield.

275
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,180
The flint-lock guns
used by the royal family...

276
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,740
are tributes from the West.

277
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,520
Mass production
is nearly impossible.

278
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,870
Furthermore, the body of the
flint-lock rifle is long and ornate.

279
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,720
Will that be suitable for military use?

280
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,560
Father.

281
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,980
Nearly impossible means still possible.

282
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:26,380
We can omit the ornery
and hire a Western firearms engineer...

283
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,730
to remodel the design.

284
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,400
By the way, Father,

285
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,530
I just borrowed a matchlock musket
from the musket barracks.

286
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,700
We'll see the difference after a test.

287
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,940
Very well.

288
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,410
Do demonstrate.

289
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,900
Come on!

290
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,860
Yong Qi!

291
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,620
Physician Zhang,
how's the Fifth Prince's injury?

292
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,150
Your Highness,

293
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,940
I just stopped his bleeding.

294
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,860
But his wound is very serious.

295
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,380
He's still unconscious.

296
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,800
What will happen to him in the future?

297
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,780
Wellâ€¦

298
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,210
Answer me!

299
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,690
Be honest!

300
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,140
Your Majesty,

301
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,340
when the musket went off by accident,

302
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,640
its bullet injured
the prince's right leg meridian.

303
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,770
Even if his right leg recovers,

304
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,020
it'll be hard to recover fully.

305
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,730
You're saying that
it will have long term effects?

306
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,490
Can he still walk normally?

307
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,920
Your Majesty,

308
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,540
I will try my best to
treat the Fifth Prince.

309
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,760
But I can only propose and see
if heaven will dispose too.

310
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,780
As for the rest, I dare not guarantee.

311
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,660
You may rise.

312
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,300
Thank you, Your Highness.

313
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,800
Physician Zhang,
is there really no other method?

314
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,660
Your Highness.

315
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,810
In the musket barracks,

316
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,560
there are many injuries from
accidental discharges every year.

317
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,020
Some even lost their lives.

318
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,780
The Fifth Prince is already lucky enough
to still be alive.

319
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,300
Moreover,

320
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,490
the weather's getting warmer every day.

321
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,060
The wound may get infected.

322
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,100
We need to treat him meticulously.

323
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,740
As for the rest, I really can't guarantee.

324
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,020
He's such a good child.

325
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,930
It's really such a pity.

326
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,550
Your Highness,

327
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,680
everyone has gone
to visit the Fifth Prince.

328
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,190
You have always been close to him.

329
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,940
Shouldn't you go visit him now?
What are you doing here?

330
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,000
Will visiting him help his recovery?

331
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,300
Everyone is crowding his room,
asking about him.

332
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,100
It's simply a useless act
that annoys the patient.

333
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,300
We might as well do something useful.

334
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,660
What are you planning to do?

335
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,780
Your Highness.

336
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,380
Lord Fu Heng.

337
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,420
Your Highness.

338
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,870
This musket was borrowed by
the Fifth Prince's aide...

339
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,330
from the musket barracks.

340
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,460
This is the musket.

341
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,220
It weighs eight jin.

342
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,800
You won't be able to use it.

343
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,740
Here.

344
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,220
Let me show you.

345
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,700
Now, if you want to shoot,

346
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,520
you need to light the fuse first.

347
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,000
The soldiers on the battlefield
will light both sides of the fuse...

348
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,500
to ensure that this gun
will fire properly.

349
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,020
Wait.

350
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,860
I've used a musket before.

351
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,100
It's fine.

352
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,500
But when Yong Qi lit the fuse,

353
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,980
it exploded right away.

354
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,100
Right?

355
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,500
As far as I'm concerned,

356
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,610
the embers blown by the wind
ignited his ammunition belt...

357
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,420
and caused the accident.

358
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,570
Do you really think it was an accident?

359
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,110
Ying Luo.

360
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,330
Noble Consort Ling.

361
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,500
The royal family usually uses
flint-lock guns kept in the palace.

362
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,130
These guns are mostly tributes
from the West.

363
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,660
They are more accurate and safer
than the muskets,

364
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,690
but they are not given to the soldiers.

365
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,170
What the soldiers use
are still old-fashioned muskets,

366
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,700
also known as matchlock muskets.

367
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,100
This kind of gun
is extremely prone to accidents...

368
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,170
during transportation and usage.

369
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,020
The accidents happened this year alone
have already reached 46 cases.

370
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,820
More than half of
the injured soldiers died.

371
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,940
Compared to them,

372
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,410
the Fifth Prince was extremely lucky.

373
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,680
How did the accidents occur?

374
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,420
Eighty percent were from careless usage.

375
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,580
I always call Yong Qi pedantic...

376
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,420
because he's very cautious
with whatever he does.

377
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,020
Do you know how long he trained
for today's trial?

378
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,700
He started training six months ago.

379
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,180
It wasn't an impulsive decision.

380
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,580
Are you sure he trained for six months?

381
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,580
That's right.

382
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,960
The new gun was received three days ago.

383
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,180
What happened to the gun...

384
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,100
he's been using all along?

385
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,780
When the Fifth Prince is awake,

386
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,700
let me know immediately.

387
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,740
Yes, Your Highness.

388
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

389
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,100
The Fifth Prince is close with you,

390
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,500
but you are the last one
to come visit him after the accident.

391
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,900
What was so important...

392
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,910
that you couldn't even come
to check on him?

393
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,020
Visiting is important,

394
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,200
but capturing the perpetrator
is more important.

395
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,410
It was an accident.

396
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,130
Your Highness, what makes you so sure?

397
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,380
Noble Consort Ling.

398
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,420
I understand that you are upset about
the Fifth Prince's injury.

399
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,280
But many musket accidents
happen every year.

400
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,510
Now, you claim to capture the perpetrator.

401
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,580
What is your intention?

402
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,320
Your Highness, you are worrying too much.

403
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,220
It was just a remark.

404
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,720
What intention would I have?

405
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,660
I'll go check the Fifth Prince now.

406
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,500
I'll take my leave.

407
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,260
Goodbye, Your Highness.

408
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,620
Stand guard outside.

409
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,010
Yes, Your Highness.

410
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,060
Greetings, Your Highness.

411
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,540
The Fifth Prince isn't awake yet.

412
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,620
Physician Zhang.

413
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,120
Please prepare some hot water
and a handkerchief.

414
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,740
Urge the servants
to bring the medicine over.

415
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,400
And ask them to prepare
a few sets of new nightwear.

416
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,530
Yes, Your Highness.

417
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,370
You are awake.

418
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,690
I really can't hide anything from you.

419
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,860
Why did you pretend to sleep just now?

420
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,860
Let's not talk about that.

421
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,020
My wives came here and cried,

422
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,290
then His Majesty's harem
came and cried too.

423
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,870
If I were awake then,

424
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,340
they'd cry even harder.

425
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,980
Their tears could've flooded my bed.

426
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,140
Consort Ling,

427
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,700
I know you won't cry.

428
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,050
I hope you don't disappoint me.

429
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,250
Yong Qi.

430
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,660
I'm sorry.

431
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,480
Consort Ling, it was just an accident.

432
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,430
It's definitely not an accident.

433
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,500
-Someone wants to...
-Consort Ling.

434
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,980
I've said this.

435
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,860
It was an accident.

436
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,980
That's all.

437
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,800
But do you know that...

438
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,560
in the future,

439
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,640
your legâ€¦

440
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,940
I already know even they don't tell me.

441
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,650
My leg is crippled now, I'm afraid.

442
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,820
Don't you want to seek justice?

443
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,090
What they wanted
to take away wasn't my leg.

444
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,930
It was Father's attentive care and love
toward me.

445
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,770
The Crown Prince
will never be a disabled man.

446
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,300
No matter how much Father dotes on me,

447
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,220
he will never bet on the royal decorum.

448
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,320
The perpetrators would rather risk it
and commit such a heinous crime.

449
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,010
Who are they doing this for?

450
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,340
If we investigate this,

451
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,690
I fear all my brothers will be affected.

452
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,940
My mother asked me...

453
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,860
to be a morally upright person.

454
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,120
But when I was lying in bed
and couldn't move,

455
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,500
my mind was full of malice.

456
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,910
I hate the person behind this
and this accident!

457
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,810
I envy my healthy brothers.

458
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,780
From now on,

459
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,890
I won't be able to stand normally
next to them again.

460
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,300
I will never be Father's pride again!

461
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,940
But I can't pursue this matter.

462
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,220
I can't investigate this.

463
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,010
Pursuing further will only...

464
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,700
cause my father and
the dynasty disgrace!

465
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,060
He has already lost a son.

466
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,300
He can't lose another.

467
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,340
Your Majesty, eat slowly.

468
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,180
Your Highness, you are here.

469
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,400
His Majesty has been reviewing memorials
non-stop until now.

470
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,050
Please talk to him.

471
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,940
Your Majesty, have some water.

472
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,290
Your Majesty,

473
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,940
take care of your health.

474
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,120
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

475
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,100
I'm fine.

476
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,130
I know that you are very sad about
Fifth Prince's injury.

477
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,660
It was an accident,
no one wanted it to happen.

478
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,130
Now that it has happened,
Your Majesty should try to get over it,

479
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,160
lest the Fifth Prince sees your sadness
and feel more miserable.

480
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,140
I understand...

481
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,940
what you said.

482
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,540
But it's hard to accept.

483
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,660
That's right.

484
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,780
Yong Qi is a well-behaved child.

485
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,680
Good at literature and martial arts,
intelligent and outstanding.

486
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,180
It's such a pity that
God punished him this way!

487
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,940
That's right.

488
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,580
It's a pity.

489
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,610
What a pity!

490
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,620
Your Majesty, what is it?

491
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,060
Your Majesty,

492
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,340
why are you looking at me like that?

493
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,500
It's nothing.

494
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,780
I'm tired.

495
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,780
Let me serve you tonight.

496
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,770
I still have many unread memorials.

497
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,100
You can go back now.

498
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,440
Your Majesty.

499
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,010
Just go back.

500
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,860
I take my leave.

501
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,340
Supervisor Li.

502
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,460
Yes, Your Highness?

503
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,820
When His Majesty takes his dinner,

504
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,340
prepare a bowl of duck broth.

505
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,020
I'll keep that in mind.

506
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,860
Don't let him stay up too late.

507
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,330
Take better care of him.

508
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,690
Yes, Your Highness.

509
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,500
Fourth Prince,

510
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,020
what's going on with you?

511
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,620
What exactly

512
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,090
happened to Yong Qi?

513
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,550
It was an accident.

514
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,410
Many soldiers die
every year because of this.

515
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,180
I think the Fifth Prince
was really unlucky!

516
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,690
If this was an accident,

517
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,930
why did Father detain all the Princes
in the palace?

518
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,010
Wellâ€¦

519
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,100
Father definitely suspects something!

520
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,179
Fourth Prince,

521
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,600
will people find out what we did before?

522
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,690
It's not the time to talk nonsense!

523
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:22,020
Fourth Prince, why are you so furious?

524
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,260
Fourth Prince.

525
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,920
Madam Zhen?

526
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,570
Did Mother tell you to come?

527
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,929
Something so unfortunate happened today.

528
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,880
You probably didn't finish your meals.

529
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,239
The Empress is worried about you
and instructed me...

530
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,120
to deliver this meal to you
to fill up your stomach.

531
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,389
Mother indeed dotes on me the most.

532
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,500
Of course.

533
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,719
What are you doing here? Leave.

534
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,000
-Yes, madam.
-Don't annoy His Highness!

535
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,580
Did Mother ask you
to relay any other messages?

536
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,530
Did she say when I can
return to the mansion?

537
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,140
Your Highness.

538
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,400
His Majesty's ordered all the princes
to remain in the Forbidden City.

539
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,600
Please keep calm.

540
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,300
Please tell my mother...

541
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,270
that I want to check on Fifth Brother.

542
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,780
Fourth Prince, why don't you eat up first?

543
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,110
Let's talk again tomorrow.

544
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,200
Mother still remembers that I love
fermented glutinous rice balls!

545
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,760
Of course, the Empress thinks of you.

546
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,630
Do you still remember that my throat
was narrow when I was little...

547
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,840
and I couldn't swallow the rice balls?

548
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:43,170
Mother then asked you to cook
smaller rice balls for me.

549
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,010
After so many years,
I still love your cooking the most.

550
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,020
Wait!

551
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,770
What's wrong?

552
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,740
What's wrong?

553
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,690
Well, I think that
glutinous rice balls are too filling.

554
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,780
Why don't you taste other dishes first?

555
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,250
This duck is not bad.

556
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,660
Try this first.

557
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,300
Madam Zhen.

558
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,400
What on earth is going on?

559
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,660
Your Highness.

560
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,320
I can't do this!

561
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,860
I can't!

562
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,050
What are you talking about?

563
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,930
Those rice balls has lethal poison in it.

564
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,020
You mustn't eat it!

565
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,540
Say again?

566
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,010
Eliminate the Fifth Prince first,

567
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,700
then you...

568
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,200
so no one will compete
with the Twelfth Prince.

569
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,060
Mother wants to kill me!

570
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,060
She...

571
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,330
She wants me dead!

572
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,700
Your Majesty,

573
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,340
the Empress ordered us
to prepare duck broth for you.

574
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,620
Li Yu.

575
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,500
Conduct a secret search for physicians
who can cure the Fifth Prince.

576
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,020
You can even try approaching...

577
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,360
the Western doctors.

578
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

579
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,370
Your Majesty,
Lord Fu Heng seeks an audience.

580
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,200
-Speak!
-Your Highness!

581
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,450
Your Highness!

582
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,640
Your Highness!

583
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,260
Let's talk about it calmly.

584
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,920
Don't you have a cold?

585
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,080
Go back and rest,
none of your business here!

586
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,280
Your Highness!

587
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,390
Tell me!

588
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,120
What have you done?

589
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,300
Your Highness.

590
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,120
Without your permission,
I dare not do anything.

591
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,430
You have done many things
without my permission.

592
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,760
How can I trust you again?

593
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,980
Tell me!

594
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,100
What have you done...

595
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,350
to the Fifth Prince?

596
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,710
Your Highness.

597
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,340
I'm just a dog by your side.

598
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,500
Without your orders,

599
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,980
a dog wouldn't attack people.

600
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,420
Your Highness,

601
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,250
I believe that Yuan Chun Wang
wouldn't do such a thing.

602
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,510
He isn't that bold!

603
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,980
Other than you, who else
would dare touch the Fifth Prince?

604
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,050
What do you know?

605
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,260
I dare not say it.

606
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,010
At this point,

607
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,390
what else can't you say?

608
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,420
Say it now!

609
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,540
Your Highness.

610
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,780
I think you already know who he is.

611
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,170
Who is he?

612
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,050
The Fourth Prince.

613
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,220
-Zhen'er!
-Summon the physician, now!

614
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,380
What did you say?

615
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,070
I've checked the latest records
of the Weapons Storage Office.

616
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,410
Ten days ago,

617
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,020
Jin Zhong, the Fourth Prince's eunuch,
went to the Weapons Storage Office.

618
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,620
He claimed to be looking for a bow
and stayed there for an hour.

619
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,140
Afterwards,

620
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,440
the Fifth Prince's musket was damaged.

621
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,980
The Fifth Prince

622
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,610
had no choice but to borrow
a new gun from the musket camp.

623
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,500
Your Majesty,

624
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,100
this is a serious matter.

625
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,820
I dare not act on my own.

626
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,770
Please decide.

627
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,940
Is everyone in the
Weapons Storage Office dead?

628
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,370
Why didn't they report such a huge matter?

629
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,860
The imperial armory handles
the weapons for imperial and military use.

630
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,600
They have always been very strict.

631
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,900
But for the past month,

632
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,530
they've been busy cleaning
and auditing the armory goods.

633
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,960
In addition...

634
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,740
In addition,

635
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,420
this matter concerns the Fourth Prince.

636
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,180
No one dares to say or do anything.

637
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,530
Am I right?

638
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,450
Bastard!

639
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,260
The Fourth Prince's eunuch
felt that this is a grave matter.

640
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,990
He was afraid of future retribution,
so he divulged the secret to me.

641
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,950
He said that he was ordered
by the Fourth Prince...

642
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,800
to enter the Weapons Storage Office.

643
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,130
Now, they want to confound the enemies
and attack back.

644
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,170
-Your Highness, you can't enter!
-Scram!

645
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,940
I have an urgent matter

646
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,570
to report to my father!

647
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,860
Father!

648
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,460
I have an urgent matter!

649
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,830
-Please stop!
-Please see me!

650
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,070
You're a noble prince,
but we're mere commoners.

651
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,200
-I beg you!
-Father!

652
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,780
-Get lost!
-How dare you?

653
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,970
How have I taught you?

654
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,070
After committing such a treacherous act,

655
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,070
you still dare to create a scene here?

656
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,140
I wonder who's the one...

657
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,540
who committed a treacherous act!

658
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,380
What are you saying?

659
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,140
Your Highness, what do you mean?

660
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,550
Your Highness, don't you see?

661
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,970
The Fourth Prince is desperately trying
to clear his name...

662
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,520
till he's blaming you!

663
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,370
Arrest him.

664
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,540
Father!

665
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,820
Father, save me!

666
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,980
Father!

667
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,580
Father!

668
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,380
Father, save me!

669
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,740
Father!

670
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,160
Mother wants to kill me!

671
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,000
Your Majesty, Yong Cheng is crazy!

672
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,450
He's making a scene here
and slandering me.

673
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,740
Why would I kill him?

674
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,510
Father,

675
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:10,310
I was staying at the Princes' Residence
when Madam Zhen brought me food.

676
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,410
She brought me a poisonous dish!

677
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,380
Mother harmed the Fifth Prince
and is now harming me!

678
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,130
Father, save me!

679
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,180
Your Highness,

680
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,970
if the food is poisoned,

681
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,180
why are you safe and sound here?

682
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,000
Zhen'er felt guilty and told me the truth.

683
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,530
Your Highness.

684
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,620
What are you talking about?

685
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,820
That's impossible.

686
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,310
Zhen'er is already
bedridden from sickness.

687
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,930
The whole Chengqian Palace knows about it.

688
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,090
The Empress even called
a physician to check on her.

689
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:48,730
How can she poison you?

690
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,210
The poisonous food is still there.

691
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,670
Fearing that the evidence
would be destroyed,

692
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,130
I had someone stand guard.

693
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,380
If you doesn't believe me,
you can investigate it.

694
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,440
Otherwise,

695
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,520
ask Zhen'er to come here!

696
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,780
Li Yu.

697
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

698
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,140
Yong Cheng.

699
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,210
Answer me first.

700
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,700
Has Jin Zhong gone to the
Weapons Storage Office?

701
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,340
I'm asking you!

702
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,740
Yes.

703
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,990
I did send him to the Weapons
Storage Office, but that was to...

704
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:36,130
You sent your servant to destroy
the Fifth Prince's musket, didn't you?

705
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,460
Father,

706
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,180
I did send my servant
to destroy his weapon,

707
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,550
but that was purely out of jealousy,

708
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,720
so that he'd embarrass
himself in front of you.

709
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,550
But I never wanted to kill him!

710
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,050
Father,

711
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,380
I destroyed his old weapon,

712
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,980
but my Fifth Brother
was injured by his new musket.

713
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,080
I've never touched it!

714
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,740
It was Mother.

715
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,280
It was her who wanted to kill him.

716
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,530
-It must be her!
-Nonsense!

717
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:14,880
Your Majesty,
I never thought that my own son...

718
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,870
would try to frame me
in order to clear his own name!

719
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,780
I am greatly saddened.
