[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 47]

3
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,880
Why are you still here?

4
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,259
Your Highness.

5
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,060
His Majesty granted me
80 strokes of flogging.

6
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,670
I escaped death, but I have nowhere to go.

7
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,360
I betrayed you,

8
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,139
offended Noble Consort Chun...

9
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,900
and turned against young Concubine Jia.

10
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,140
I...

11
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,620
have no way out no matter where I go.

12
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,180
Hence,

13
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,950
even if you're living
in the Cold Palace,

14
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,040
I'll serve you until the end.

15
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,410
As a servant,

16
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,829
you dare to speak so bluntly.

17
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,390
You're indeed bold.

18
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,870
Your Highness,

19
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,060
I do not deserve your praise.

20
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,140
Even if all the servants
in the palace died,

21
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,400
Her Highness would not accept...

22
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,880
an ingrate like you.

23
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,550
-Pack up your belongings and get lost!
-Your Highness.

24
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,170
I have indeed done something wrong.

25
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,250
But in this Forbidden City,

26
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,160
it's common to flatter superiors
and trample those of lower status.

27
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,420
Betrayal and exclusion often occur too.

28
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,790
After these incidents,

29
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,180
you know my vulnerable points.

30
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,450
I will never dare
to betray you ever again.

31
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,090
If Your Highness accepts me,

32
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,580
I will be as loyal as a dog...

33
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,340
and guard your door...

34
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,950
even at the cost of my life.

35
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,590
Your Highness.

36
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,140
What a pity.

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,370
Now my gates...

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,450
do not need...

39
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,670
-guards anymore.
-Your Highness.

40
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,180
His Majesty is just
misled for the time being.

41
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,350
Once he realises that,

42
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,980
you'll still have the opportunity
to rise from the ashes again.

43
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,890
Please don't give up!

44
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,480
Scoundrels.

45
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,730
How dare they serve you food like this!

46
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,930
-I'll go talk to them.
-Stop.

47
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,079
Ying Luo!

48
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,020
According to palace rules,

49
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,740
every concubine is entitled
to their allowances.

50
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,600
But did they follow accordingly?

51
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,760
Not only we received
less food and clothing,

52
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,090
we were ignored as well.

53
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,020
Such obvious bullying...

54
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,910
is clearly trampling over you!

55
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,600
Just like what Xiao Quan Zi said,

56
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,630
in the Forbidden City,

57
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,090
it's common to flatter superiors and
trample those of lower status.

58
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,350
Betrayal and exclusion often occur too.

59
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,500
Even he understands that.
You certainly know it better.

60
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,089
It's so unfair!

61
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,700
His Majesty clearly knew
you were framed by young Concubine Jia,

62
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,900
but why is he still treating you coldly?

63
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,070
Because of my past with Fu Heng.

64
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,820
He was on the battlefield,

65
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,110
but now he's back.

66
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,750
Every time when His Majesty sees him,

67
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,870
he'll be reminded of that.

68
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,409
It's like a fishbone
getting stuck in his throat,

69
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,010
tormenting him at all times.

70
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,450
But you're innocent!

71
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,600
His Majesty shoulders the whole nation,

72
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,130
working hard night and day.

73
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,700
He doesn't care who lies in his bed.

74
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,110
As long as she's beautiful, gentle...

75
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,120
and can ease the pressure of his work,

76
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,200
that is enough.

77
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,140
So,

78
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,410
the concubines in
the imperial harem are either...

79
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,560
elegant,

80
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,780
pretty or noble.

81
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,320
Besides spicing up his life,

82
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,640
to His Majesty,

83
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,590
they will all become blurred faces...

84
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,680
as time goes by.

85
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Since His Majesty is upset to see me,

86
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,060
he doesn't want to see me again.

87
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,860
If this continues,

88
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,220
not to mention paying off old scores,

89
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,150
we cannot even protect ourselves.

90
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,970
Ying Luo,

91
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,940
what shall we do?

92
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,420
Your Highness, Noble Consort Chun is here.

93
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,080
Greetings, Noble Consort Chun.

94
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,210
It's been a long time since we met.

95
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,180
You've lost weight.

96
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,460
Thank you for your concern, Noble Consort.

97
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,670
I am quite well.

98
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,330
That's good then.

99
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,310
On my way walking in here,

100
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,550
except a palace maid by the gate,

101
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,909
I didn't see anyone else.

102
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,560
How unproper.

103
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,420
Concubine Ling,

104
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,670
you ought to manage your servants better.

105
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,550
Thank you for your instruction,
Noble Consort.

106
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,990
Everyone has their own ambition.

107
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,680
Now that I am not favoured,

108
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,610
it's understandable...

109
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,310
that they want to turn to
a more promising mistress.

110
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,710
That's true.

111
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,440
Young Concubine Jia throws
tantrums all day in Chuxiu Palace,

112
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,120
upsetting people around her.

113
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,800
Compared to her,
you are truly more insightful.

114
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,030
At least you know you need to introspect,

115
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,580
instead of complaining about others.

116
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,200
Noble Consort,

117
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,480
why are you here today?

118
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,640
Look at this.

119
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,680
They say...

120
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,360
you were an embroidery maid.

121
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,760
Your needlework is delicate and wonderful.

122
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,370
I specially selected
a piece of your embroidery...

123
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,720
to present to Shoukang Palace.

124
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,050
Empress Dowager was very pleased with it.

125
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,740
She entrusted you to embroider...

126
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,980
a Bodhisattva portrait.

127
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,780
Noble Consort Chun,

128
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,130
my mistress injured
her hand some time ago,

129
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,130
so she can only do simple stitching.

130
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,130
A delicate Bodhisattva portraitâ€¦

131
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,520
What shall I do?

132
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,040
I already recommended you
to Empress Dowager.

133
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,210
Shall I go to Empress Dowager
now and tell her...

134
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,700
you can't do it?

135
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,310
Noble Consort,

136
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,870
when do you plan to present
the portrait to Empress Dowager?

137
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,170
Exactly...

138
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,140
one month later.

139
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,400
Don't worry.

140
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,420
I will do my utmost.

141
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,250
Concubine Ling,

142
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,190
Thank you very much!

143
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,510
Have a good rest.

144
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,930
Ying Luo, she's rubbing
your injury on purpose.

145
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,760
How can you say yes so quickly?

146
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,900
Noble Consort Chun made it clear...

147
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,620
that the embroidered portrait
is for Empress Dowager.

148
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,320
If I refuse,

149
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,020
it would be a great disrespect
to Empress Dowager.

150
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,630
She's waiting...

151
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,130
for me to screw up.

152
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,270
But your hands..

153
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,880
[Yanxi Palace]

154
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,410
Xiao Quan Zi.

155
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,650
Sister Ming Yu.

156
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,850
Where did you get the new coal?

157
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,590
I claimed it from
the Imperial Household Department.

158
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,700
You're lying.

159
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,260
When I went there in the morning,

160
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,350
they refused to give me coal
by giving all kinds of excuses.

161
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,610
I couldn't even get it,

162
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,780
not to mention you!

163
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,140
The coal even had cypress scent added.

164
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,710
Our mistress was focused on embroidery,

165
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,080
so she didn't notice it.

166
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,910
If you don't tell me,
I will tell our her now!

167
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,040
No...

168
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,040
Don't tell her.

169
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,130
Imperial Guard Solon gave it to me.

170
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,420
Why didn't you come inside to find me?

171
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,060
Yanxi Palace is forlorn...

172
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,880
Many keep a distance from it.

173
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,340
It's better not to let others see...

174
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,620
us together.

175
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,820
What a fool!

176
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,210
What if you freeze while waiting here?

177
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,240
I just want to thank you...

178
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,830
for the coal with cypress scent,

179
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,020
the fire pot given during a cold night...

180
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,020
and the loquat jelly sent
when my mistress got a cough.

181
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,780
Even Xiao Quan Zi
is attentive in every way.

182
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,760
We are really grateful...

183
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,830
for what you have done.

184
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,950
But I have to say that
we have enough coal now.

185
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,550
We really can't accept more.

186
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,900
As for those things you mentioned,

187
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,810
I said I would offer help.

188
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,410
I was just keeping my words.

189
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,880
Thank you, Hailan Cha.

190
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,360
I don't know how to repay you.

191
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,570
It's too cold. You should go back.

192
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,670
Go.

193
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,750
Come out now.

194
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,070
I did send the coal,

195
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,380
but I didn't add any cypress scent.

196
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,720
As for the fire pot, the loquat jelly...

197
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,060
and bribing Xiao Quan Zi,

198
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,260
these things have nothing to do with me.

199
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,360
Tell me.

200
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,900
You did so many things for her
without telling her,

201
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,630
why didn't you tell her though?

202
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,380
Fu Heng, is holding everything in...

203
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,790
the way to treat someone well?

204
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,620
We haven't sparred for a long time.

205
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,710
Let's go.

206
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,380
Look at...

207
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,610
this Bodhisattva portrait.

208
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,340
It looks merciful and benevolent.

209
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,500
Its face is round and tenderly white.

210
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,380
The folds are so three-dimensional.

211
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,880
This time the Embroidery House
did a really good job.

212
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,350
Empress Dowager flatters them.

213
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,920
This portrait is a gift to you.

214
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,300
How would they dare not to be diligent?

215
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,580
I think...

216
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,420
Noble Consort Chun
did a great job painting it.

217
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,420
That was why the embroiderers
managed to create this outstanding work.

218
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,220
In order to paint
the Bodhisattva portrait,

219
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,710
she analysed all the Bodhisattva portraits
in Forbidden City.

220
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,180
She painted it for over a month...

221
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,900
and used countless sheets of paper.

222
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,240
In the end, she finally picked one
that she was satisfied with.

223
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,170
Doing something for
Empress Dowager is my blessing.

224
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,280
Hang this portrait.

225
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,370
Yes.

226
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,060
Greetings,

227
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,460
mother.

228
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,520
Rise.

229
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,460
What are you looking at, mother?

230
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,260
May I see it too?

231
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,300
Look at this Bodhisattva portrait.

232
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,620
It is splendid and lifelike.

233
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,010
It's so rare to see
a good artwork like this.

234
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,160
The hair of this Bodhisattva is so vivid.

235
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,930
It doesn't look like thread.

236
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,850
Could it be...

237
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,860
real hair?

238
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,070
The embroiderer sewed in her own hair?

239
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,960
Manchurians and Han people are different.

240
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,360
For Manchurians,
cutting off hair is disrespectful,

241
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,100
while Han people sew in their own hair...

242
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,040
to show their sincere devotion.

243
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,470
There has been such practice long ago.

244
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,200
It's known as hair embroidery.

245
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,630
This spot is clearly a blood stain.

246
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,940
Your Majesty,
it might just be a coincidence.

247
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,100
The embroiderer was afraid that
her blood has stained the work,

248
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,740
so she embroidered it into a red spot.

249
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,060
This embroiderer is so meticulous.

250
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,370
I want to see her.

251
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,510
Empress Dowager,

252
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,520
this work wasn't done by just one person,

253
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,930
but a joint effort by all
the most outstanding embroiderers...

254
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,190
of the Embroidery House.

255
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,250
If Empress Dowager wants to meet them,

256
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,220
I'll personally summon them.

257
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,550
Empress Dowager meant that...

258
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,530
she greatly appreciates the skills
and diligence of the embroiderer.

259
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,110
Just send the decree to reward her.

260
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,340
Yes. There are so many
skilled embroiderers...

261
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,860
in the palace.

262
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,450
But few are as meticulous as her.

263
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,870
She should be handsomely rewarded.

264
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,940
Li Yu.

265
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,390
I am here. Your Majesty,
please give your instructions.

266
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,780
The embroiderers in
Embroidery House are very busy.

267
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,640
They tend to rush to finish a task.

268
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,339
Who would be so meticulous to...

269
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,349
use her own hair in the artwork?

270
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,010
Well...

271
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,480
I remember...

272
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,860
she used to be an embroiderer.

273
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,810
She?

274
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,560
Your Majesty, who are you referring to?

275
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,200
No one.

276
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,210
Your Majesty, be careful!

277
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,690
I disturbed Your Majesty!

278
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,790
I deserve to die!

279
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,820
Fu Heng,

280
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,940
it's been a long time
since I saw your swordsmanship.

281
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,870
Let's play a round. I want to see...

282
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,910
your improvement.

283
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,500
It's rare for His Majesty
to be in such a mood.

284
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,110
Don't get involved.

285
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,160
If you retreat without fighting,

286
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,300
you'll commit the crime
of deceiving the Emperor.

287
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,090
Your Majesty.

288
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,410
Your Majesty!

289
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,490
Why did you deliberately let me win?

290
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,980
Your Majesty,

291
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,440
what I learned on the battlefield...

292
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,840
are all skills for killing enemies.

293
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,440
I feared that I might hurt you.

294
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,370
I didn't let you win deliberately.

295
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,560
When Ne Qin was around,

296
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,110
he often met me alone.

297
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,130
But when you serve at the Grand Council,

298
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,730
you ask all the ministers
to see me at the same time.

299
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,050
Fu Heng,

300
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,080
aren't you too cautious?

301
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,550
Your Majesty,

302
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
I committed a mistake in the past,

303
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,490
which led to successive mistakes.

304
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,740
It is true for my private affairs...

305
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,340
and political affairs, too.

306
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,190
Being cautious and careful...

307
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,820
is to be responsible for state affairs.

308
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,810
You're talking about...

309
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,720
-Forget it.
-Why didn't you ask what mistake it was?

310
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,940
If you agreed
to my marriage request back then,

311
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,770
Concubine Ling...

312
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,700
would have been my wife.

313
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,790
Fu Heng!

314
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,340
Shut up!

315
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,950
Did I say anything wrong?

316
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,010
Fuca Fu Heng,

317
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,490
how dare you!

318
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,040
I indeed loved Wei Ying Luo.

319
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,520
Maybe for Your Majesty,

320
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,330
that was a blasphemy.

321
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,090
But she had never agreed to marry me.

322
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,960
That was...

323
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,900
my own wishful thinking.

324
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,160
What else do you want to say?

325
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,020
One shouldn't
keep reminiscing about the past.

326
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,080
Your Majesty has always been magnanimous.

327
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,450
Miss Borjigin...

328
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,740
was a widow before she entered the palace,

329
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,130
but got conferred as Noble Lady Duo
upon entering the palace.

330
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,340
Your Majesty didn't mind
about her being a widow.

331
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,940
When it comes to Wei Ying Luo,

332
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,840
why is Your Majesty so petty?

333
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,150
Fu Heng,

334
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,670
you think I won't kill you?

335
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,160
Because she is Wei Ying Luo.

336
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
You don't want to recall her past...

337
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,340
because you weren't involved in it...

338
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,740
and didn't get to know it.

339
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,290
The more you are angry now...

340
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,150
and the more you treat
Concubine Ling coldly,

341
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,070
the more it shows that you are jealous
and confused about what to do.

342
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,850
Fuca Fu Heng,

343
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,670
I stopped you becauseâ€¦

344
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,680
Was it because you assumed
Ying Luo was greedy for wealth and power?

345
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,150
But you know very well that...

346
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,840
if she's that kind of woman,

347
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,450
she would've taken advantage
of you to get promoted.

348
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,250
But you still kept asserting it.

349
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,710
Why?

350
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,770
You suspect that...

351
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,800
I deliberately separated the both of you?

352
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,740
Fu Heng,

353
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,240
how can you say such absurd words?

354
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,900
I dare not guess your intentions.

355
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,290
Maybe...

356
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,030
Your Majesty sometimes unconsciously
acts according to your emotions, too.

357
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,180
[Your Majesty,]

358
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,720
[do you really have no personal reason...]

359
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,650
[for breaking up their marriage?]

360
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,860
[Maybe you...]

361
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,110
[likes Wei Ying Luo.]

362
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,880
[You want her to be yours.]

363
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,950
Your Majesty,

364
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,160
since you've obtained her,
you should cherish her.

365
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,540
Or else,

366
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,520
you'll make me more regretful about...

367
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,730
my surrender back then.

368
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,350
I will take my leave.

369
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,450
Greetings, Your Majesty.

370
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,130
Prince He,

371
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,020
how was your work trip the south?

372
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,730
Thank you for Your Majesty's blessings.

373
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,260
Everything went smoothly.

374
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,590
I heard from His Majesty...

375
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,660
that you did
a great job in investigating...

376
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,190
the corruption cases in Jiangnan.

377
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,170
His Majesty felt so gratified.

378
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,760
He kept praising you.

379
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,130
Receiving praises from His Majesty...

380
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,810
means that my hard work was not in vain.

381
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,630
Are you here to pay your respect
to Consort Dowager Yu?

382
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,420
As soon as I returned to the capital,

383
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,820
after greeting Empress Dowager,

384
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,880
I came to pay my respects to my mother.

385
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,770
Bai Ling who served Consort Dowager Yu...

386
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,080
has gone crazy because of that matter.

387
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,980
I've ordered
an imperial physician to treat her,

388
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,450
but to no avail.

389
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,180
If she is sent to Anle Hall,

390
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,070
she'll die soon.

391
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,800
If you are compassionate,

392
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,960
please take her out of the palace.

393
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,020
Though Bai Ling has gone crazy,

394
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,460
she affirmed that...

395
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,660
it was Wei Ying Luo who killed my mother.

396
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,650
I've always wanted...

397
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,060
to clarify it with her.

398
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,330
Prince He,

399
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,630
Wei Ying Luo now is Concubine Ling.

400
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,130
Without any evidence,
you must be cautious with your words,

401
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,060
to not invite trouble to yourself.

402
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,290
Thank you for Your Majesty's concerns.

403
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:21,250
I will surely remember your care.

404
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,070
For the sake of Consort Dowager Yu,

405
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,090
you should take good care of yourself.

406
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,220
Don't be impulsive and cause trouble.

407
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,020
Your Majesty.

408
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,610
Prince, what do you want to say?

409
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,520
For so many years,

410
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,670
you haven't changed.

411
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,260
You are still gentle, kind, righteous...

412
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,060
and virtuous as before.

413
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,260
I really envy my brother...

414
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,840
having you as his wife.

415
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:01,960
Prince He,

416
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,900
cherish the people around you.

417
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,000
Cherish everything around you right now.

418
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,480
Don't forget that Consort Dowager Yu...

419
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,600
wanted you...

420
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,080
to be safe and happy.

421
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,660
I also...

422
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,420
have the same wish for you.

423
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,480
Finish embroidering
the Bodhisattva portrait isn't enough.

424
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,280
Now, you must embroider
the Buddhist scripture.

425
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,880
Obviously they are trying
to give you a hard time!

426
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,390
Your hands got injured
when you were in the Labour House.

427
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,710
Now, you have to embroider day and night.

428
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,410
The scars on your hands
have all opened up.

429
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,290
Once you scratch the silk fabric,

430
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,570
you have to redo everything again.

431
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,600
Today, without Madam Zhang's help,

432
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,420
we wouldn't be able
to find new silk fabrics.

433
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,320
If you have the time to complain,

434
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,490
why not think about...

435
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,150
how to not scratch the fabric.

436
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,300
Wei Ying Luo,

437
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,900
I'm going to make you
pay back with your life.

438
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,300
Ming Yu!

439
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,820
Prince He,

440
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,430
It is shameless...

441
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,130
for you to treat a woman like this.

442
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,180
My Lord, you cannot be like this.

443
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,540
Consort Ling has...

444
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,600
lost His Majesty's favour.

445
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,470
She's now a wild dog
getting trampled over by everyone.

446
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,120
What's there to fear about?

447
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,470
Don't forget...

448
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,270
a wild dog can bite people!

449
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,410
You think..

450
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,520
I'm still as foppish as before?

451
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,350
Fu Heng?

452
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,730
Are you crazy?

453
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,840
You dare treat me like this?

454
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,590
Considering that we grew up together,

455
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,390
I'm already courteous with you.

456
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,560
You have done so many good things

457
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,660
and finally changed the way
His Majesty sees you.

458
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,670
So,

459
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,520
you want to return to before?

460
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,750
Let go!

461
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,240
Fine.

462
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,530
Let me see...

463
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,860
how long you can protect her!

464
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,830
Ying Luo,

465
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,540
did you get hurt?

466
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,510
Ming Yu,

467
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,920
-let's go back.
-Wait!

468
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,720
Hong Zhou is bearing grudges against you.

469
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,890
You must be careful.

470
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,800
Also,

471
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,590
I met with His Majesty.

472
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,230
I hope that...

473
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,950
everything goes as you wish.

474
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,730
Let's go.

475
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,930
Sister Ming Yu,

476
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,760
This medicine was sent
by Imperial Guard Solon this morning.

477
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,950
He said that this is the best hand cream.

478
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,320
It's made of
cardamon and white sandalwood.

479
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,120
It will make your hands
smooth and clean as before.

480
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,010
Great. That's exactly what I need.

481
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,870
Even someone as foolish as me can tell it,

482
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,630
not to mention you.

483
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,770
Adding flowers on brocade is easy,

484
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,050
but sending charcoal
in snowy weather is difficult.

485
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,740
I wish to have someone...

486
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,810
as considerate and tender as him,

487
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,980
always thinking of me.

488
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,900
Isn't Imperial Guard Solon such a person?

489
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,020
He is like a block of wood.

490
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,710
He always thinks of going
to the battlefield to win an honour.

491
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,110
He doesn't comprehend sentiments of love.

492
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,580
Rather than throwing
a flirtatious glance at him,

493
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,580
it's better to do that to a blind man!

494
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,490
Put it away now.

495
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,760
You won't use it now?

496
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,800
Yes,

497
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,520
I won't use it.

498
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,710
Put the charcoal basin...

499
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,980
away too.

500
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,500
[You don't want to recall her past...]

501
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,220
[because you weren't involved in it
and didn't get to know it.]

502
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,560
[The more you are angry now,
the more you treat Concubine Ling coldly,]

503
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,600
[the more it shows that you are jealous
and confused about what to do.]

504
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,970
[Your Majesty,]

505
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,600
[since you've obtained her,]

506
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,170
[you should cherish her.]

507
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,650
Why is there no one here?

508
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,190
These servants are too undisciplined.

509
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,880
Your Majesty.

510
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,440
Your Majesty, since you can't
bear to part with Concubine Ling,

511
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,610
why don't you go see her?

512
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,679
Shut up.

513
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,870
I deserve to die. I am talking too much!

514
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,449
I...

515
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,969
wasn't concerned about her.

516
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,550
I don't want anyone
in the imperial harem...

517
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,020
to be treated harshly.

518
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:32,370
Those Imperial Household Department's
servants are atrocious.

519
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,360
No matter how out of favour
Concubine Ling is,

520
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,870
how could they treat her badly?

521
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,840
Calm down, Your Majesty.
I'll make sure they get punished severely.

522
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,870
No need!

523
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,570
Since she didn't come to me for help,

524
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,370
I'll pretend that I never saw it!

525
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,030
Your Majesty.

526
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,630
This is too hot.

527
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,760
Send it to her.

528
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,370
Remember, I didn't send this to her.

529
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,480
I understand.

530
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,150
Because Imperial Household Department
made a mistake,

531
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,000
they sent a new charcoal basin there.

532
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,040
Well...

533
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,520
Send her this glazed lantern too.

534
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,760
I don't like blind people.

535
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,430
-Yes.
-Hurry up and follow me!

536
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,290
The lantern and the quilt.

537
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,050
What are you doing?

538
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,130
Miss Ming Yu.

539
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,150
It is already winter now.

540
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,860
Yanxi Palace hasn't been outfitted yet.

541
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,930
They lack many things.

542
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,150
Here.

543
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,610
Hurry up.

544
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,640
Greetings, Concubine Ling.

545
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Concubine Ling has been suffering.

546
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,550
As soon as I found out it,

547
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,410
I brought them here immediately.

548
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,330
Your Highness, please be lenient.

549
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,480
When I return,

550
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,400
I will punish them harshly!

551
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,860
It has been winter for more than a month.

552
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,390
No other palace lacks
charcoal basins nor lanterns.

553
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,950
Do you believe your own words,

554
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,100
Supervisor Wu?

555
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,700
It was all my fault.

556
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,910
I was negligent.

557
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,040
Your Highness, you are magnanimous.

558
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,540
Please forgive me.

559
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,800
From now on, if you have any need,

560
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,400
just order me and
I'll make sure it's done.

561
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,700
If it happens again,

562
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,510
I'll just pluck my own head off...

563
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,140
and let you use it as a stool!

564
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,300
That's enough, Supervisor Wu.

565
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,790
Concubine Ling doesn't like noise.

566
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,210
You may leave with your men now.

567
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,680
I'll take my leave now.

568
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,060
To please Empress Dowager,

569
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,590
Concubine Ling managed to embroider
Buddhist scriptures in half a month.

570
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,460
Empress Dowager still thinks...

571
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,800
it's the work of embroiderers.

572
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,600
Her hard work will just go in vain.

573
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,330
People like her are dreadful...

574
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,260
no matter how low she falls,

575
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,810
she'll always find a way up.

576
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,360
On that day,

577
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,860
when His Majesty discovered
the hair of Bodhisattva...

578
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,530
was real hair,

579
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,670
I was startled.

580
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,950
If she wasn't prominent
in certain aspects,

581
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,880
the late Empress wouldn't have
favoured her so much.

582
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,170
But she fell out of favour...

583
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,030
after a short period of time.

584
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,780
His Majesty saw it, but he didn't care.

585
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,230
Yu Hu.

586
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,980
Concubine Ling's
embroidery skills are great.

587
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,120
We should make use of unwanted stuff.

588
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,420
Go.

589
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,630
Send my embroidery screen to her too.

590
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,300
-Supervisor Li.
-De Sheng,

591
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,110
Concubine Ling hasn't come here to
express gratitude?

592
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,500
You are joking.

593
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,650
Those items were sent by
the Imperial Household Department.

594
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,850
Concubine Ling doesn't know.

595
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,440
You! Do you think
Concubine Ling is like you?

596
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,340
His Majesty is angry again.

597
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,600
He loses his temper three times a day
and no one can stand it anymore!

598
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,480
Hurry, beg Concubine Ling...

599
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,390
-Hurry up!
-Yes.

600
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,730
Miss Ming Yu, I'm here
to invite Concubine Ling...

601
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,460
Her Highness isn't in the hall.

602
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,200
But it's so late.

603
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,830
Where else would she be...

604
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,160
if not in Yanxi Palace?

605
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,940
Take a guess.

606
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:23,960
Supervisor Li,

607
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,540
I went to Yanxi Palace,
but I didn't see her.

608
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,720
Inside.

609
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,660
Inside?

610
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,620
How dare Zhang Ting Yu...

611
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,730
requested to have his plaque
placed in the Imperial Ancestral Temple?

612
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,190
Nonsense!

613
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,820
Order Zhang Ting Yu to present himself
before me right away.

614
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,840
Yes.

615
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,130
Wait.

616
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,900
Zhang Ting Yu is getting
more muddled with age.

617
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,050
After being instigated by Shi Yi Zhi,

618
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,500
he even forgotten his surname.

619
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,320
He is just a pedantic old man.

620
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,190
Forget it.

621
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,150
Forget it.

622
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,070
Ming Fu embezzled 30,000 taels...

623
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,760
through Guangdong grain courier route.

624
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,170
Guangdong's Governor Yue Jun
covered up for him.

625
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,300
Liu Tong Xun travelled far to Guangdong
to investigate the case.

626
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,760
He was so tired that
he even coughed up blood.

627
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,640
Ministers and commanders residing
in Tibet were killed in succession.

628
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,040
There are signs of heavy drought
in the east part of Zhejiang.

629
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,140
Instead of thinking of
what he can do for the nation,

630
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,970
Zhang Ting Yu,
as the Grand Secretary,

631
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,580
only thinks about...

632
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,460
having his plaque in
Imperial Ancestral Temple after his death.

633
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,560
How despicable!

634
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,060
How despicable!

635
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,760
Tell Zhang Ting Yu to get lost.

636
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,590
Get lost as far as possible!

637
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,850
Water.

638
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
Water.

639
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,920
You're a messenger, not a piece of wood.

640
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,450
I ask you to pour some water.

641
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,210
Yes.

642
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,520
Wei Ying Luo!

643
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,360
Who allowed you in?

644
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,390
Li Yu!

645
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:55,680
Li Yu!

646
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,990
Your Majesty, I missed you.

647
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,140
It's been a long time since we met.

648
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,670
Your Majesty didn't miss me at all?

649
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,930
How dare Li Yu...

650
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,010
allowed you in recklessly?

651
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,590
Besides,

652
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,200
what are you wearing?

653
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,750
You're getting more and more unseemly!

654
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,560
You really don't miss me?

655
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,440
Then I will leave.

656
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,690
I'm really leaving.

657
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,470
If I were to blame you,

658
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,780
you would've been
sentenced to death several times.

659
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,380
Stop putting on an act!

660
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,730
That is because you were jealous.

661
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,450
Why are you blaming me?

662
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,470
Nonsense.

663
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,770
You and Fu Heng were clearly...

664
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,140
Why are you so petty?

665
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,930
You've been mad for so long,
why are you still brooding?

666
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,820
Yes,

667
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,860
the late Empress did intend...

668
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,430
to let me marry Lord Fu Heng.

669
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,220
You..

670
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,910
But Your Majesty,
didn't you reject that long ago?

671
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:41,360
That's because I was afraid
you'd ruin Fu Heng.

672
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,220
There wasn't any personal motive at all.

673
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,360
Since you said no, then it didn't happen.

674
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,160
His Majesty never...

675
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,720
tried to ruin my engagement on purpose.

676
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,550
Your Majesty also never got jealous...

677
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,810
and treated me coldly on purpose.

678
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:05,350
Your Majesty is righteous, broad-minded.

679
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,780
without any personal motive.

680
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,820
Hypocritical.

681
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,660
You are clearly
mocking me with every word.

682
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,550
If my words sting Your Majesty,

683
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,410
it means what I said is true!

684
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,320
Your Majesty,

685
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,960
the past is in the past.

686
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,900
We're in the present.

687
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,680
Since I became Your Majesty's woman,

688
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,650
I will never betray you.
