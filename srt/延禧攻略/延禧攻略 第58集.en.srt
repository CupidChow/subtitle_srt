1
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,130
Empress Dowager.

2
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,729
What do you want to say?

3
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,850
Empress Dowager, when did you recover?

4
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,890
You should ask me

5
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,570
if I was

6
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,170
really sick.

7
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,770
Consort Ling, if Empress Dowager were not ill,

8
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:28,170
would the Empress put her guard down?

9
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,970
How would Empress Dowager win His Majesty's compassion?

10
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,090
And How would she also defeat the enemy by surprise?

11
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,530
How did you cheat the Imperial Doctor?

12
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,250
The Empress thinks she's smart.

13
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,210
She bribed Director Zhang.

14
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,890
But she didn't expect that Aunt Liu

15
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,890
is also an expert in medicine.

16
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,770
Empress Dowager, I’m flattered.

17
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,930
The needle trick

18
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,010
can fool them for a short time

19
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,450
but not forever.

20
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,530
Hence, Empress Dowager must leave the Forbidden City.

21
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,780
Empress Dowager uncovered the truth,

22
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,780
and suddenly left the Forbidden City.

23
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,450
His Majesty must feel extremely guilty right now!

24
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,260
Empress Dowager

25
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,730
is indeed brilliant!

26
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,210
Consort Ling,

27
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,770
you made up a story just based on a few words that Aunt Liu told

28
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,930
and had His Majesty know about it.

29
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,170
Regarding this,

30
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,530
you really read my mind.

31
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,130
But your story was incomplete.

32
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,650
So, I needed to complete it for you.

33
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,930
Consort Ling,

34
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,490
do you know why Empress Dowager

35
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,690
wants to take you with her?

36
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,290
You

37
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,170
are very smart,

38
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,370
but your methods are still too soft.

39
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,250
You urged

40
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,810
Noble Lady Qing

41
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,010
to tell the story.

42
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,170
It helped her, as well as helped yourself.

43
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,490
You were certain that His Majesty would guess that you were behind this

44
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,490
and wanted to use this opportunity to rise again.

45
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,250
But,

46
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,410
you were overconfident.

47
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,490
You have badly offended His Majesty.

48
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,050
If you got too close to him every day,

49
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,730
it’d only annoy him more.

50
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,090
So now

51
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,290
you need to make him think of you and miss you,

52
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,850
yet he can’t reach you.

53
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,170
Consort Ling,

54
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,580
you should thank Empress Dowager.

55
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,730
She's helping you.

56
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,050
Thank you, Empress Dowager!

57
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,610
You are the most

58
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,370
likable person in the Forbidden City.

59
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,930
I also wanted to find a companion in the Summer Palace.

60
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,370
Empress Dowager,

61
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,690
may I dare to ask

62
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,890
one more thing?

63
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,810
Are you going to ask

64
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,970
how Madam Qian really died?

65
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,890
What do you think?

66
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,550
His Majesty really chased after?

67
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,730
Yes.

68
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,250
That Empress Dowager is indeed a sly old fox.

69
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,050
Do you think His Majesty will pursue this matter?

70
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,410
That letter was kept by Madam Wenshu.

71
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,020
Elderly Concubine Yu hid it

72
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,570
and Prince He found it.

73
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,410
It had nothing to do with me

74
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,890
the whole time.

75
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,210
It's a pity that

76
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,810
the one from Palace of Everlasting Joy went with Empress Dowager.

77
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,670
Your Highness,

78
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,810
if you don’t remove the root of a grass,

79
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,210
It’ll become a big problem sooner or later.

80
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,370
Why do I feel that

81
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,690
you hate Consort Ling more than I do?

82
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,690
Your Highness, to reply you,

83
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,450
she's just a palace maid

84
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,290
who once betrayed me.

85
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,370
Naturally, she's not worthy of my thoughts.

86
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,690
When His Majesty learned that Empress Dowager went to the Summer Palace to recuperate from her illness,

87
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,850
he immediately dispatched a large number of attendants to follow her.

88
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,909
He's obviously very concerned about Empress Dowager.

89
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,980
If we take action during this period, won't we be getting ourselves into trouble?

90
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,410
Not to mention, my power is steadier than ever.

91
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,610
Consort Ling follows Empress Dowager

92
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,890
to gain her favor,

93
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,450
but at the same time, she is losing the opportunity to gain grace from the Emperor.

94
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,930
When she's back,

95
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,290
the ownership of the Forbidden City will have changed.

96
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,730
Your Majesty,

97
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,930
it's a letter from Empress Dowager.

98
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,860
Read it to me.

99
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,050
Yes.

100
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,090
Your Majesty,

101
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,610
all is well at the Summer Palace,

102
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,210
Don't worry about me.

103
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,050
The day before I obtained a book,

104
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,050
"Discretionary Treatise on Diet and a Brief History."

105
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,310
Who dedicated this book to Empress Dowager?

106
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,410
Your Majesty,

107
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,130
this book was written by a eunuch in Late Ming.

108
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,730
Some of it has been censored out.

109
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,010
What Empress Dowager obtained

110
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,090
should be the revised version.

111
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,770
I think it's not serious.

112
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,690
Continue.

113
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,130
The Chapter Eating is a Discipline

114
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,610
mentions that

115
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,370
The freshest herring should be eaten in the seventh lunar month.

116
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,410
Empress Dowager ordered Imperial Household Department to make offerings

117
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,370
and held an osmanthus festival.

118
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,770
It was a marvelous event,

119
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,810
watching the palace maids set out river lanterns.

120
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,730
She tried to copy the tone of Empress Dowager in the first sentence.

121
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,860
But didn’t make it consistent for the rest of the letter.

122
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:10,650
Continue.

123
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:11,930
That’s all.

124
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,210
That’s it?

125
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,250
Yes.

126
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,810
No need to deliver the letter in the future.

127
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,140
I get upset when I see it!

128
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,650
Your Majesty,

129
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,450
the Discretionary Treatise says

130
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,650
cutting grapes during the Mid-Autumn Festival

131
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,690
and placing them in water and sealing it

132
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,370
can keep them fresh until the first month of the next year.

133
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,570
But in less than ten days,

134
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,610
they all rotted.

135
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,650
A book of misinformation is worse than no book.

136
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,220
Empress Dowager saved a moon cake on purpose,

137
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,210
and ordered it to be delivered to Forbidden City

138
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,670
for Your Majesty to enjoy,

139
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,390
so that we can share the happiness together.

140
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,450
Where's the letter?

141
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,210
Your Majesty,

142
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,370
you said that…

143
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,690
Let me read it to you.

144
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,150
I will read it on my own.

145
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,050
Hurry. Over here.

146
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,210
Empress Dowager,

147
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,370
it tastes good.

148
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,930
Yes. Hurry up.

149
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,850
Leave it here.

150
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,530
Hurry up. Be quick.

151
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,370
Over here.

152
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,290
Put it here.

153
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,050
Mingyu,

154
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,690
I told you many times.

155
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,370
When preparing the eggplants,

156
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,810
you should place the coins layer by layer.

157
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,690
You are all thumbs,

158
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,050
really beyond help.

159
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,370
Aunt Liu,

160
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,450
I have been making snacks for many years.

161
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,250
Everyone praises my handiwork.

162
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,450
our Majesty, every year during the Double Ninth festival,

163
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,130
people in the Forbidden City would ascend a height.

164
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,370
This year, although Empress Dowager hasn't not recovered yet,

165
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,450
She's leading the palace maids and eunuchs

166
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,890
to cook vegetables.

167
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,150
It's rather interesting.

168
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,090
It's a pity that Mingyu keeps trying and failing at it.

169
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,990
She often stamps her feet.

170
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,370
The embroidery maids are busy with making the winter clothes.

171
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,850
As long as they rush it day and night,

172
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,250
it won't cause any delay.

173
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,410
Don't worry.

174
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,170
Remember to frequently tidy up

175
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,010
the fabrics in the stockroom.

176
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,940
I've already ordered them to do it.

177
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,410
But there's one thing I must ask your permission about.

178
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,210
Today, Her Highness Consort Shu sent people to the Storage Office

179
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,940
and insisted on looking for an old white fox skin.

180
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,930
I showed them over a hundred pieces,

181
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,060
she didn’t like any.

182
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,410
Isn't that deliberately nit-picking?

183
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,650
I'm afraid that…

184
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,850
Empress Dowager has gone to the Summer Palace for such a long time

185
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,930
and has been waiting for some joyous news.

186
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,810
But the Tenth Prince died at birth.

187
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,290
Although His Majesty promoted Imperial Concubine Shu,

188
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,930
it's still normal for her to be unhappy.

189
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,170
Just try to avoid her from now on.

190
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,210
Yes.

191
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,090
The most important thing now is that

192
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,330
the Empress is about to give birth.

193
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,650
Your Department must prepare well for that.

194
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,690
Yes. I understand.

195
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,690
Don't worry.

196
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,180
Who allowed you in here?

197
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,050
I...

198
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,580
was sent by Chief Steward Liu to attend to you.

199
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,010
At first glance,

200
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,410
you indeed look a bit like her.

201
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,210
Get up! Get up!

202
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,330
Hit me!

203
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,610
Chamberlain Yuan!

204
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,210
Hit me! Hit me back!

205
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:57,730
No!

206
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,690
Hit me!

207
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,170
I just hit you!

208
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,210
I want you to hit me back, don't you understand?

209
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,010
Why don't you fight back? Why?

210
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,690
I haven't lost her love!

211
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,210
I can’t even have her hatred now?

212
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,690
Chamberlain Yuan, have mercy!

213
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,650
Chamberlain Yuan, have mercy!

214
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,290
Right,

215
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,370
you're not her.

216
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,970
You're like a quail.

217
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,090
How could you compare to her?

218
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,050
Leave.

219
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,290
Tell Liu He that

220
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,570
if he tries to be a smarty pants again,

221
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,530
I'll kill him!

222
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,490
Get lost!

223
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,850
Understood!

224
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,850
His Majesty always replies these three words.

225
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,250
It’s too perfunctory.

226
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,410
Every month we send him a letter,

227
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,390
we've written thirty-five of them already.

228
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,770
His Majesty didn’t reply any

229
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,790
until the eighteenth letter.

230
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,570
This one will be the 36th letter.

231
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,530
Empress Dowager has said that

232
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,650
you should return to the Forbidden City,

233
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,410
but you keep refusing to do so.

234
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,090
Yingluo,

235
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,290
what are you thinking?

236
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,340
Yingluo, you're not sending this letter?

237
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,450
No.

238
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,220
I'm not sending one this month.

239
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,570
Desheng,

240
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,570
what's that?

241
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,050
This?

242
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,530
The monthly letter from the Summer Palace.

243
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,890
Chamberlain Li.

244
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,090
What is Empress Dowager thinking?

245
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,930
She has lived in the Summer Palace for such a long time.

246
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,130
His Majesty has gone there so many times this year,

247
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,730
but Empress Dowager refused to see him

248
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,650
whenever he arrived at the Hall of Eternal Spring.

249
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,650
Fine, if she doesn't want to see him.

250
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,850
But how come the monthly letters never stopped?

251
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,610
It won’t be easy for Empress Dowager

252
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,210
to get over her anger.

253
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,810
As for the letters,

254
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,010
they’ve being written by Consort Ling,

255
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,610
so that His Majesty can be informed of Empress Dowager’s condition.

256
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,530
This way,

257
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,370
even if His Majesty is mad at Consort Ling,

258
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,830
he still has to accept this goodwill of hers.

259
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,130
Learn something!

260
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,730
Slow down, Chamberlain Li.

261
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,890
After three years,

262
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,490
it's finally done.

263
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:58,690
Li Yu.

264
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,470
Send this painting to Jiaxing right away

265
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,250
and bestow it to the descendants of the Qians.

266
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,530
Yes, I will immediately handle it.

267
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:07,810
Your Majesty,

268
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,940
this is a letter from Empress Dowager.

269
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,849
Your Majesty

270
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,690
Li Yu,

271
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,650
go ask what's going on.

272
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,090
Yes, I will go right away.

273
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,780
Greetings, Your Highness.

274
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,210
Your Highness.

275
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,050
Empress Dowager has had people send

276
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,110
the materials needed for the bathing ceremony of the Thirteenth Prince.

277
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,050
When Yongji was born, Empress Dowager didn't return to the palace.

278
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,250
And now on Yongjing's third day bathing ceremony, Empress Dowager is still not attending.

279
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,130
Looks like she has decided

280
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,690
to stay for a long time in the Summer Palace.

281
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,890
It's good that Empress Dowager doesn't return.

282
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,890
Once she's back, she'll give Your Highness a hard time.

283
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,290
She’s been out of the Forbidden City for three years,

284
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,330
and you have successively given birth to two princes.

285
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,990
Your Highness finally gets to live a happy life.

286
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:26,850
Zhen'er,

287
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,210
watch your mouth.

288
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,810
Yes.

289
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,370
While Empress Dowager is staying in the Summer Palace,

290
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,210
Imperial Household Department should be more meticulous in their work.

291
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,740
In case people would say you are slacking off.

292
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,610
Yes!

293
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,890
Your Majesty,

294
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,690
I've got the news.

295
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,610
Empress Dowager suddenly

296
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,290
caught a cold and she was bedridden for three days.

297
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,930
Luckily, the Imperial Doctor treated her in time

298
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,970
and took good care of her.

299
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,500
She's now fully recovered.

300
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,250
Empress Dowager was the only one who got sick?

301
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,010
No.

302
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,970
Her Highness Consort Ling also got sick because of attending to her.

303
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,290
Your Majesty, don't get anxious.

304
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,810
I heard that,

305
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,930
the condition of Her Highness Consort Ling has already greatly improved.

306
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,970
Yesterday, she was already able to leave her bed.

307
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,570
As for the letter, it was written by her palace maid on her behalf.

308
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,770
Your Majesty,

309
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,350
don't get anxious.

310
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:44,930
Your Majesty,

311
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,330
our army on the front line attained a great victory.

312
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,890
The leader of the Huolan Tribe led only three hundred men

313
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,650
to flee away from Mt. Balan in a flurry

314
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,050
and eventually got captured by our army.

315
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,250
The army will be returning in a few days.

316
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,330
Great!

317
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,690
Immediately give the instructions

318
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,370
to prepare for the victorious return of our army.

319
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,430
I will personally welcome them back.

320
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,330
Yingluo,

321
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,770
I've been asking you to return to the Forbidden City since a year ago,

322
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,970
but you keep refusing to.

323
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,370
Why?

324
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,620
I want to accompany you longer, Empress Dowager.

325
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,050
Well,

326
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,930
don’t think I can’t see through you.

327
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,450
I think you've been

328
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,890
enjoying yourself too much.

329
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,570
Just like a bird who flew out of a cage,

330
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,030
you don't want to return to the cage anymore.

331
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,530
Empress Dowager,

332
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,530
what are you saying?

333
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,290
See,

334
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,550
it's just the fifth month,

335
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,170
yet you've started setting up preparations

336
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,770
for the Dragon Boat Competition.

337
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,730
Do you really want to return to the Forbidden City?

338
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,930
I like it here.

339
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,610
I like admiring flowers during the spring,

340
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,090
picking water lilies during the summer,

341
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,450
appreciating the maple leaves during the autumn,

342
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,690
and enjoying the view of snow during the winter.

343
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,050
I like it more accompanying Empress Dowager to offer incense to Buddha

344
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,250
and going on occasional tours outside.

345
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,700
Empress Dowager, if His Majesty never remembers me,

346
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,370
I'll just stay here forever

347
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,290
and keep you company.

348
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,050
Yingluo,

349
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,850
life is like

350
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,980
moving against the current. One will fall behind without moving forward.

351
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,970
Now, you have me protecting you.

352
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,490
But what if one day you are left alone?

353
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,250
What would you do?

354
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,330
Empress Dowager…

355
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,650
You're the Imperial consort of His Majesty.

356
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,780
You have to return to the Forbidden City sooner or later.

357
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,530
Delaying it from day to day,

358
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,050
aren't you afraid that His Majesty will forget you?

359
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,290
By then,

360
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,930
you won't have any chance to make a comeback even if you want to.

361
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,610
Think about it,

362
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,730
how long has it been since His Majesty wrote you a letter back?

363
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,610
Mingyu,

364
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,530
you say it.

365
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,130
Three months ago,

366
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,010
Consort Ling asked someone to write a letter with only the word "well" on

367
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,770
and deliver it His Majesty.

368
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,100
We haven't received any reply letter ever since.

369
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,490
Yingluo,

370
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,250
your life here has been too comfortable.

371
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,110
You have totally forgotten the potential dangers.

372
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,530
Think again,

373
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:35,130
why His Majesty isn't writing you back.

374
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:50,690
Mother!

375
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,090
Mother!

376
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,330
Fuheng?

377
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,050
Fuheng!

378
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:03,850
Mother!

379
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,050
My son,

380
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,730
You are finally back!

381
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,650
I'm back.

382
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,170
Finally!

383
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,810
Mother, have a seat.

384
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,290
Son.

385
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,570
I'm so unfilial.

386
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,130
I didn't even come back when my father passed away.

387
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,530
Please forgive me, mother!

388
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,660
You were fighting on the battlefield.

389
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,090
The messages were cut off.

390
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,290
How could I blame you?

391
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,690
Besides,

392
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,170
you consecutively won the battles.

393
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,850
His Majesty

394
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,810
has given orders to construct an ancestral memorial temple

395
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,130
for the ancestors of the Fuca Clan,

396
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,700
and even conferred posthumous title to your father.

397
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,650
He will surely be proud of you

398
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,050
in heaven!

399
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,090
Mother.

400
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,770
I should have returned earlier with General Zhaohui's army,

401
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,910
but there were many matters to attend to.

402
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,970
Thus, I could only return today.

403
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,810
I would like to go to the mourning hall to light incense for my Father.

404
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,370
Alright.

405
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,570
Alright.

406
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,610
I will go with you.

407
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,250
After we have paid our respect and lit the incense,

408
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,250
I will to open the front gate

409
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,890
and hold a grand celebration.

410
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,250
I want everyone in the capital to see

411
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,850
that we not only have the benevolent Empress Xiaoxian,

412
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,370
we also have

413
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,450
a real gyrfalcon in our Fuca Family.

414
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,170
Mother,

415
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,450
where are An'er and Fuqian?

416
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,690
I asked Fuqian to take An'er

417
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,010
to get the Lady of the Hitara clan

418
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,860
a memorial tablet for reincarnation.

419
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,950
What are you doing?

420
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,820
The walnuts are delicious.

421
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,230
Do you want any?

422
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,370
You don’t want to live anymore?

423
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,930
How dare you to use a personally-written letter of His Majesty as a waste bin for nut shells?

424
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,010
Don't blame him.

425
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,010
I did it.

426
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,770
Empress Dowager asked you to do self-reflection.

427
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,770
Have you done it?

428
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,250
I’ve kept myself indoors for three days.

429
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,090
Doesn’t it count as self-reflection?

430
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,370
Is this how you do it?

431
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,090
Empress Dowager left a problem for me.

432
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,810
I'm trying to solve it now.

433
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,810
Keep quiet.

434
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,620
I think you're not giving it any serious thought.

435
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,130
The messengers from the Forbidden City are here.

436
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,730
It’s up to you what to do next!

437
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,210
Your Highness Consort Ling.

438
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,130
I was ordered by His Majesty

439
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,130
to deliver a gift to Empress Dowager for the Dragon Boat Festival.

440
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,330
Officer of the Guard,

441
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,010
Empress Dowager is paying respect to Buddha now.

442
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,890
I'm afraid she can't meet you in person.

443
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,530
I will leave the gift here and return.

444
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,050
I wouldn't dare to disturb Empress Dowager.

445
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,780
But there's still someone else

446
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,070
who would like to meet you, Consort Ling.

447
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:03,890
Mingyu,

448
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,170
what are you doing?

449
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,350
None of your business.

450
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,530
You are being rude! Come with me.

451
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,930
You can stand here alone then.

452
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,660
I'm leaving.

453
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,530
I wanted to hear what they are saying.

454
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,530
Why are you so angry?

455
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,330
Whenever I have free time,

456
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,050
I come here to see you in every way I can.

457
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:23,770
But

458
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,370
when I’m finally here,

459
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,730
you only care about others.

460
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,260
Why don’t you care about me?

461
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,410
Hailancha!

462
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:33,890
Look at her.

463
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,930
She's really a foolish girl.

464
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,050
I wonder what she's worried about.

465
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,910
She even hid there to sneak a peek.

466
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,850
What do you think

467
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,370
she is worried about?

468
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,530
Fuheng.

469
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,050
Erqing is dead.

470
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,410
I know.

471
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,910
If this is the reason you are here,

472
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,050
let me tell you,

473
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,450
she deserved it.

474
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,330
I won't feel guilty about this.

475
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,530
Neither will I apologize to you.

476
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,130
Yingluo,

477
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,010
I'm not here for this.

478
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,050
Go back. Return to the Forbidden City immediately.

479
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:20,690
Why?

480
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,170
Because of someone.

481
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:22,970
Someone?

482
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,770
Yes,

483
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,410
because of a woman.

484
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,890
Who, perhaps with her appearance,

485
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,690
will make everything that you meticulously planned

486
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,650
to obtain turn to nothing.

487
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,210
For your own benefit,

488
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,530
Go back.

489
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,050
Depart immediately.

490
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,730
Fuheng.

491
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,650
What are you talking about?

492
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,580
I don't understand.

493
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:46,850
Yingluo,

494
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,210
do you still remember

495
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,810
the horizontal inscribed plaques that His Majesty granted to the imperial harem?

496
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,450
He even ordered the painters to make twelve copies

497
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,610
of the famous stories of ancestral virtuous Imperial consorts

498
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,140
as Instructional Drawings on Virtues of Imperial Concubines?

499
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,610
I remember,

500
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,530
but how is that related to the matter you're talking about?

501
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,970
Beauty, loyalty,

502
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,030
humility, righteous, and brave.

503
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,490
All these beautiful words can be used

504
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,010
to describe her.

505
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,490
I'm not exaggerating at all.

506
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,270
With a woman like that by His Majesty's side,

507
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,650
Wei Yingluo,

508
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,250
what can you do in the future?

509
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,590
I don't believe there's such a perfect woman in this world.

510
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,870
Reality has proven you are wrong.

511
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,850
Fuheng.

512
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,490
Are you helping His Majesty to persuade me to return to the palace?

513
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,370
Wei Yingluo,

514
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,490
you are an ambitious woman.

515
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,530
Even if you entered the palace with a motive,

516
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,930
since you have entered the palace,

517
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,930
you must obtain His Majesty's favor

518
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,330
and become his favorite.

519
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,050
In fact,

520
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,850
you have definitely won His Majesty's heart

521
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,530
and had him miss you day and night.

522
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,250
But from now on,

523
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,090
you are not that most unique woman anymore.

524
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,350
In this past three months,

525
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,510
His Majesty has never remembered you even for a moment.

526
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,570
Maybe staying here in the Summer Palace

527
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,010
makes you feel comfortable

528
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,570
and numbs your sharp senses.

529
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,810
Or maybe you are too overconfident

530
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,850
to remember the saying that

531
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,570
"There's no limit if you look up."

532
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,170
Then who is this

533
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,370
better woman

534
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,850
with unlimited power?

535
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,730
The daughter of the Governor of Hu-Guang.

536
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,530
His Majesty

537
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,350
personally changed her name into

538
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,210
Chenbi.

539
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,570
All the mist completely disappeared.

540
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,370
The bright moonlight shines on a thousand of land.

541
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,210
The fluctuating light flashes some golden hues.

542
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,930
The silent moon's shadow is like a jade that has sunk into the water.

543
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,010
The songs of the fishermen are being sung by us.

544
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,050
This kind of happiness is unending.

545
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,700
This must be how one would imagine the scenery in the essay "On Yueyang Tower."

546
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,570
Let's go.

547
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,330
To where?

548
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,730
To say farewell to Empress Dowager.

549
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,290
We are going back?

550
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,250
Yes.

551
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,870
Setting off immediately!

552
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,890
Your servants make respectful greeting to Your Highness Consort Ling!

553
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,290
Rise.

554
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,850
Xiaoquan,

555
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,210
well done!

556
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,330
I told you to return first and make the arrangements,

557
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,810
and you were able to do so in such a short time.

558
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,570
I dare not take all the credit.

559
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,290
When I returned to the Palace,

560
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,290
everything had already been taken care of.

561
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,550
Then, these servants…

562
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,500
All were sent by the Imperial Household Department.

563
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,490
Yingluo,

564
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,330
His Majesty cares about you after all.

565
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,490
Everything had already been prepared

566
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,170
even before your return.

567
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,050
What do you think?

568
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,490
Is Your Highness Consort Ling satisfied with

569
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,290
the preparation of your Palace?

570
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,790
Yuan Chunwang is here to greet Your Highness Consort Ling.

571
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,930
Chamberlain Yuan.

572
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,330
Long time no see.

573
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,330
Consort Ling,

574
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,570
Her Highness the Empress is still waiting for you.

575
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,850
Please go to her palace now.

576
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,370
I knew that you were returning to the palace,

577
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,010
so I immediately sent people to clean up your place.

578
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,290
Hope you’ll like it.

579
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,010
If you need anything else,

580
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,610
you can notify Chamberlain Yuan any time.

581
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,730
Why are you looking at me that way?

582
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,370
Your Highness the Empress. As one who’s in charge of the imperial harem,

583
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:45,890
you gave birth to the Twelfth Prince in the seventeenth year in reign of Qianlong.

584
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,570
This year, you gave birth to the Thirteenth Prince.

585
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,370
The entire harem is under Your Highness' control.

586
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,250
What kind of woman

587
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,510
has already made you so uneasy

588
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,050
after entering the Forbidden City

589
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,130
When you see Consort Shun,

590
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,650
you will be concerned

591
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,530
just like I am.

592
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:09,530
No,

593
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,330
you should be terrified that

594
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,810
there's such a beauty in this world.

595
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:22,690
How is she compared to the late Noble Consort Gao?

596
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,420
Beauty is more than just a face.

597
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:27,290
His Majesty has seen so many beauties.

598
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,290
How could he get enchanted with just a beautiful face?

599
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,530
Your Highness,

600
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,130
even if Noble Lady Chang is an exceptional beauty

601
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,460
and enjoying the favor of His Majesty,

602
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,969
she is of no threat to your position.

603
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,810
I don't understand

604
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,449
why you’d

605
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,730
humble yourself

606
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,409
to show me kindness?

607
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,290
Consort Ling,

608
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,340
Noble Lady Chang has now been promoted to Imperial Concubine Shun.

609
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,290
She has an illustrious background.

610
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,930
Her ancestor was one of the people who established this empire.

611
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,010
Her great aunt was Empress Xiaozhaoren.

612
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,750
His Majesty personally named her

613
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,170
"Chenbi"

614
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,970
and is favoring her a lot.

615
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,690
Far more than the amount he favored you before.

616
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,530
Hence, we must work together to resist her.

617
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,390
I've already experienced

618
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,870
Your Highness' kindness.

619
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,330
I think I’ll

620
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,590
pass your offer this time.

621
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:47,770
When she entered the palace, she was like a flawless white jade.

622
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,610
I heard that when she was little,

623
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:58,410
she grew up with ordinary people in a natural environment,

624
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,890
She only got found not long ago

625
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,530
and became the most-favored woman in the Forbidden City.

626
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,170
Wei Yingluo, are you not worried?

627
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,450
If you didn't have any fear,

628
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,980
you wouldn't have immediately returned to the Forbidden City.

629
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,170
There're no friends or foes in the Forbidden City.

630
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,970
There’re only common interests.

631
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,330
Only working together

632
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,750
can we stand a chance against Imperial Concubine Shun.

633
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,410
Or else,

634
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,570
before long,

635
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,290
you will leave the Forbidden City dejected

636
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:34,140
and get back to Empress Dowager to live the rest of your life.

637
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,090
Think about it clearly.

638
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,250
I'm sure that

639
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,490
you'll give me a satisfactory answer.

640
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,230
Your Highness,

641
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,650
will Consort Ling agree to work with you?

642
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,030
Words are but wind, but seeing is believing.

643
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,370
As long as she sees that Chenbi,

644
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,370
she will certainly come to beg me.

645
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,410
Okay.

646
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,420
Let's go back for an afternoon nap.

647
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,210
What are you laughing about?

648
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,090
Have you seen her?

649
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,210
Consort Ling, you are a smart person.

650
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,410
I knew that once you saw her,

651
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,530
you surely would come back.

652
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,170
That woman is really amazing.

653
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,850
Anyone who has interacted with her would get attached to her.

654
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,530
From the Emperor

655
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,130
to the eunuchs and palace maids.

656
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,690
Maybe

657
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,130
that is her charm.

658
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,130
Consort Ling,

659
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,650
before we start working together,

660
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,410
I have to warn you

661
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,770
to stay away from her and don't get bewitched by her.

662
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,370
I won't.

663
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,410
Hope so.

664
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,590
Your Highness,

665
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,310
what are you going to do first?

666
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:27,130
I will certainly help you to win His Majesty’s favor back.

667
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,970
You want to use me

668
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,450
to lure His Majesty’s attention away from Imperial Concubine Shun?

669
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,290
Wei Yingluo,

670
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,330
can you do it?

671
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,850
As you wish.

672
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,450
Good!

673
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,700
Hope our collaboration will be a success!

674
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,250
Yingluo,

675
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,470
are you really going to work together with the Empress?

676
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:52,930
Why not?

677
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,930
I don't understand.

678
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,290
You'd already refused it initially.

679
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,290
But after seeing Imperial Concubine Shun,

680
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,290
you immediately changed your mind.

681
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,170
Is she that special?

682
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,330
Look at this face!

683
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,970
What's wrong?

684
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,170
This face

685
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,850
is not adorable at all.

686
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,370
As if with just a blink of the eye,

687
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,190
bad ideas would come out of it.

688
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,100
How could you say such things about yourself?

689
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,140
I'm speaking the truth.

690
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,570
My sister once said

691
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,610
that I have a face that looks quick-witted.

692
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,410
It's a good thing,

693
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,460
but also a bad thing.

694
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,850
Good thing is that

695
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,860
no one will dare push me around.

696
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:40,890
Bad thing is that

697
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,570
everyone thinks that I'm too scheming.

698
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:49,530
What's different about the face of Imperial Concubine Shun?

699
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,570
Her face

700
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:54,810
is what I want the most.

701
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,130
Pure white and flawless.

702
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,290
Gentle and amiable.

703
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,530
It makes people want to dote on her.

704
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,770
This is the reason why you're working with the Empress?

705
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,050
Not only her looks,

706
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,540
but also her behaviors.

707
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,250
Mingyu.

708
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,610
Let me ask you.

709
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,770
What kind of woman is the scariest

710
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,030
in the Imperial harem?

711
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,250
Like the Empress?

712
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:22,930
Like you?

713
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,250
I’m out.

714
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,450
A woman who’s so naive that she won’t be affected by the outside world is the scariest!

715
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,910
Because she can easily obtain a man's heart.

716
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,830
Especially a complicated man like the Emperor.

717
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,210
If only I had a face

718
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,410
just like hers!

719
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,770
Right.

720
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,770
It would be way much easier to seduce His Majesty with a face like that.

721
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:52,810
Wrong!

722
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,370
Having a face like that,

723
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,460
it would be more convenient

724
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,930
to do evil things.

725
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,530
Look at you.

726
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,170
Why bother?

727
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,170
Isn’t this what you want

728
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,340
that His Majesty neglects you?

729
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,170
Yingluo,

730
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,130
are you really

731
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:20,090
falling in love with the Emperor?

732
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,460
Absolutely not!

733
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,330
They why did you rush back

734
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,310
and why do you get so angry now?

735
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,330
This concerns my dignity as a woman.

736
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,300
And I’m quite competitive.

737
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:38,140
But His Majesty is only fond of women like Imperial Concubine Shun.

738
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,650
Why don't you imitate her?

739
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,850
Wei Yingluo is Wei Yingluo!

740
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,890
Why should I imitate others?

741
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,610
And you can just sit here alone and be grouchy.

742
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:54,970
Your Majesty,

743
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,910
I've already arranged a guidance Granny

744
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,300
and will send her to Hall of Fairview soon.

745
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:01,790
No need to force it.

746
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,250
I like the way Imperial Concubine Shun is.

747
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,490
It's her great fortune

748
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,290
that Your Majesty loves her so much,

749
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,350
but she still needs to learn the rules

750
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,330
in case she meets Empress Dowager or attend ceremonies.

751
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:19,460
Or else, she may feel uncomfortable in those occasions.

752
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,510
Empress, that’s very thoughtful of you.

753
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,970
Then send Imperial Concubine Shun to Palace of Everlasting Joy.

754
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,250
Ask Consort Ling to teach her well.

755
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,250
That’ll do it.

756
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:31,610
Yes.

757
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:40,530
That is a Dragon Boat Festival gift that Consort Ling gave to Yongjing.

758
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,410
Others all gave gold and silver ingots,

759
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:43,610
bracelets, or lockets,

760
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,610
while Consort Ling gave something more appropriate.

761
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:53,370
Zhen'er,

762
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,730
ask Director Zhang

763
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,180
to examine the health of Consort Ling.

764
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,810
She had been in the Summer Palace serving Empress Dowager.

765
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,090
And she didn’t take good care of herself.

766
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,730
She’s having a hard time falling asleep and not eating enough.

767
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,490
She needs special care now.

768
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:07,690
Yes.

769
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:30,930
Your Highness,

770
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,050
can Consort Ling succeed?

771
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,570
It’s all up to her now.

772
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,010
She had been in the Summer Palace serving Empress Dowager.

773
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:52,530
And she didn’t take good care of herself.

774
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,990
She’s having a hard time falling asleep and not eating enough.

775
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:14,450
Respectfully greeting Your Majesty.
