[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,560
If Emperor hadn't suppressed it,

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,610
I wonder how it'd have blown up.

5
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,240
Empress Dowager.

6
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,100
Empress Dowager.

7
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,850
Please save Hong Zhou.

8
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,880
Please save Hong Zhou.

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,790
Get up now.

10
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,920
Hong Zhou has been ignorant
and stubborn since he was small.

11
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,680
But he's very close to his brother.

12
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,360
Whenever he has
delicious foods or fun games,

13
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,320
he shares them with him.

14
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,160
In his heart, his brother...

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,570
is more important than me.

16
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,230
Although Hong Zhou is indeed at fault,

17
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,750
may you and His Majesty...

18
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,630
spare him...

19
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,380
for old times' sake!

20
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,290
Hurry.

21
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,850
Help your mistress up first.

22
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,829
It's not that I don't want to help you.

23
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,600
We're under
the watchful eyes of the public.

24
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,410
And rumours are everywhere.

25
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,730
His Majesty is being pressured
by the imperial clan.

26
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,570
He's really in a tough spot.

27
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,010
Your Majesty,
you have always been decisive.

28
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,290
How come only Prince He...

29
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,920
Forgive me for being a babbler.

30
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,960
I know that you're kind, Your Majesty.

31
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,640
But what Prince He did
has incited public rage.

32
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,120
If you don't punish him severely,

33
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,380
I'm afraid it'll be hard to appease them.

34
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,760
It's all his fault for being arrogant.

35
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,120
He's offended so many people.

36
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,260
Even if I want to save him,

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,690
I have to think twice.

38
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,110
Your Majesty,

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,640
I have an idea.

40
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,360
What is it?

41
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,960
No one witnessed...

42
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,560
Prince He committing this absurd act.

43
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,170
If...

44
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,780
you get Wei Ying Luo...

45
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,970
killed secretly...

46
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,240
and defer this matter
for three to five years,

47
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,320
once the scandal is over,

48
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,160
no one will remember this case.

49
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,990
And Prince He will be fine then.

50
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,019
Are you asking me to execute Wei Ying Luo?

51
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,600
Your Majesty, this idea
is indeed a bit sinister.

52
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,460
But it'll work.

53
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,190
Get lost!

54
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,740
Yes.

55
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,640
Ying Luo!

56
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Consort Dowager Yu wants to see you.

57
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,620
Consort Dowager Yu, what are you doing?

58
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,170
Miss Ying Luo.

59
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,890
I've been to the manor of Prince He.

60
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,680
And I've found out what happened.

61
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,600
It's Hong Zhou's fault.

62
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,110
As his mother,

63
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,230
I apologise to you on his behalf.

64
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,820
He's responsible for what he did.

65
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,210
What does it have to do with you?

66
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,159
Hong Zhou is my son.

67
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,960
He made mistakes...

68
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,159
because I didn't discipline him strictly.

69
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,100
Now...

70
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,830
he's unconscious from shock...

71
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,930
and gravely ill.

72
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,640
The imperial physician said...

73
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,500
this illness will reduce
his lifespan by ten years.

74
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,960
I know.

75
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,140
Ten years of his life
can't pay for Man's life.

76
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,840
And it can't get rid of
your hatred towards him.

77
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,810
But I'm begging you.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,920
Whatever hatred or grudge you have,

79
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,240
just come at me.

80
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,880
I'm begging you. Please spare him.

81
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,540
As long as you can forgive him,

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,310
I'll promise you anything.

83
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,350
No way!

84
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,390
Her Majesty defended me
in front of His Majesty.

85
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,440
If I go back on my word,

86
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,900
what would that make Her Majesty?

87
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,610
Wei Ying Luo.

88
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,320
You're just a lowly palace maid.

89
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,960
Consort Dowager Yu
is kneeling and begging you.

90
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,220
Don't go too far.

91
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,170
All mistakes in the world can be forgiven.

92
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,200
But a human life can't be repaid.

93
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,530
If you want me to forgive Hong Zhou,

94
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,240
bring my sister back to life.

95
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,200
You...

96
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Enough.

97
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,030
Bai Ling.

98
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,530
Don't blame her.

99
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
I came...

100
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,890
to do my best...

101
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,380
and leave the rest to God.

102
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,830
It is no one else's fault...

103
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,560
that Hong Zhou has gotten into trouble.

104
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,940
Miss Ying Luo.

105
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,170
Thank you for your time.

106
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,100
Take care, Consort Dowager Yu.

107
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,800
Physician Ye.

108
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:33,980
Physician Ye.

109
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,570
Physician Ye.

110
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,960
[Imperial Apothecary]

111
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:49,970
Physician Ye.

112
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,980
I came to return your apothecary pestle.

113
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,140
Physician Ye!

114
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Stop!

115
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
It's me.

116
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,000
Darn it!

117
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,660
I told you not to act recklessly.

118
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,020
But you didn't listen.

119
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,400
Do you know that you almost got killed?

120
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,280
I...

121
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,340
You're worried that
Hong Zhou would kill me.

122
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,480
That's why you stopped me from
looking for the perpetrator.

123
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,880
Hong Zhou is severely ill and unconscious.

124
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,160
How can he kill you?

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,860
The one who's trying to kill me...

126
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,240
is not Hong Zhou?

127
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,120
I've told you that for times.

128
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,780
Hong Zhou is absurd.

129
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,440
But he never killed anyone.

130
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,760
Your sister's death...

131
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,970
was not his doing.

132
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,280
Could it be His Majesty
who tried to kill me...

133
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,970
because he wanted to protect his brother?

134
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,230
I've wondered about this possibility.

135
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,440
In order to preserve
Hong Zhou's reputation,

136
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,170
he might have gotten rid of Man.

137
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
For His Majesty,

138
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,840
it's not murder.

139
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,330
It's just like brushing away the dust.

140
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,640
If it's His Majesty's doing,

141
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,840
you'll never be able to seek vengeance.

142
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,480
I'd rather you didn't know anything...

143
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,880
so that you could be safe.

144
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,840
If Her Majesty hadn't come that day,

145
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,520
His Majesty would've
killed me to vent his anger!

146
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,410
No.

147
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,410
What happened today...

148
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,540
proves that His Majesty
has nothing to do with all this.

149
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,330
He's the emperor of Great Qing.

150
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,650
If he wanted to kill you,

151
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,640
he could just instruct someone...

152
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,040
to secretly execute you.

153
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,420
He wouldn't have to kill you this way.

154
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Since it's not His Majesty's doing,

155
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,580
it's another's.

156
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,730
Let's go save Physician Ye!

157
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,390
Your Majesty.

158
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,580
Consort Dowager Yu instructed her maid
to sent you these lotus pastries.

159
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,000
I heard that Consort Dowager Yu...

160
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,520
went to pick the lotuses at Jinshui River
early this morning.

161
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,880
She then sent them to the Imperial Kitchen
and had them made into this snack.

162
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,040
Empress Dowager said...

163
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,160
it's your favourite snack
when you're little.

164
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,290
That's why Consort Dowager Yu
instructed her maid to send you some.

165
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,640
I think...

166
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,000
she has an ulterior motive.

167
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,970
Hong Li.

168
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,640
You and Hong Zhou entered the palace
to keep Grandfather company.

169
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,600
Although he dotes on you,
you're far away from your family.

170
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,080
Secondary Consort misses you so much.

171
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,840
That's why she asked me to bring you...

172
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,500
your favourite lotus pastry.

173
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,280
My mother made me these?

174
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,500
-Yes.
-Third Brother, thank you.

175
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,170
Try it. It's still warm.

176
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,740
Let me have one!

177
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,960
Hong Zhou!

178
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,290
Third Brother was petty.

179
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,450
That's why Father didn't like him.

180
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,660
He's afraid that Father favouring me...

181
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,480
would affect his position
as the crown prince.

182
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,940
Thus, he thought of
making the first move...

183
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,670
to get rid of me.

184
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,880
If it hadn't been for
the naughty Hong Zhou,

185
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,990
I would've eaten that lotus pastry.

186
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,430
After that,

187
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,920
although Hong Zhou got saved,

188
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,640
his health deteriorated dramatically.

189
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,260
Consort Dowager Yu sent me these...

190
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,490
to remind me...

191
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,030
never to forget...

192
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,750
that I owe Hong Zhou my life.

193
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,480
[Ice]

194
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
What is this?

195
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,330
It's the ice sent by
the Imperial Household Department.

196
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,110
It does feel a bit cooler.

197
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,320
Summer came early this year.

198
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,960
Your Highness can't stand the heat.

199
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,520
I was worried that the department
would take their time.

200
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,210
This time they acted fast.

201
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,520
I'll open it and fan the ice.

202
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,330
The air will be cooler.

203
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,440
Oh yeah.

204
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,200
Have you sent the snack to Yangxin Hall...

205
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,280
as instructed?

206
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,000
Don't worry, Your Highness. It's sent.

207
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,580
It's so delicious!

208
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,030
Wei Ying Luo.

209
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,960
You're getting outrageous.

210
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,800
You're now meddling in my affairs.

211
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,890
Your Majesty.

212
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,120
Watermelon juice is indeed good.

213
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,030
But it's a cold drink.

214
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,370
You can't have another cup.

215
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,600
I order you...

216
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,100
to pour me another cup.

217
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,790
I'm just following...

218
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,690
Physician Ye's instructions.

219
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,240
For Your Majesty's sake,

220
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,330
I'm willing to get punished.

221
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,470
Wei Ying Luo!

222
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,120
-Your Majesty, please calm down.
-It's so lively here.

223
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,250
You're getting...

224
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

225
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,760
The weather is so hot.

226
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Oh yeah.

227
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,160
I remember...

228
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,220
you can't stand extreme heat.

229
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,080
I asked them to send you some ice.

230
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,380
Do you feel better?

231
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,800
Thank you for your care, Your Majesty.

232
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,450
But this year,

233
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,000
Ying Luo...

234
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,430
came up with a good idea.

235
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,450
It's very useful.

236
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,560
What is this?

237
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,840
What's special about it?

238
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,730
Your Majesty, this is an ice box.

239
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,150
Ying Luo.

240
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,150
Yes.

241
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,870
What's wrong?

242
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,400
What is this?

243
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,590
What do we do?

244
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,880
What's the lead paint for?

245
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,570
Your Majesty.

246
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,240
It can block off the external heat...

247
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,920
and preserve the low temperature
in the box.

248
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,030
That way,

249
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,810
you can eat cold fruit and drink...

250
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,160
anytime you want.

251
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,850
Li Yu.

252
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,670
Ask the Imperial Household Department
to make two of this...

253
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,330
and send them to Yangxin Hall.

254
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,240
And send one to Empress Dowager.

255
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,330
Yes.

256
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,960
Oh yeah, Empress.

257
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,360
I have another thing to tell you.

258
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,710
What is it?

259
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,040
Two imperial physicians
has done the examination.

260
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,960
Prince He is severely ill and
needs to recuperate in peace.

261
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,490
I can only wait until
he's fully recovered...

262
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,790
before dealing with it.

263
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,260
Your Majesty. If you do so,

264
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,000
you'll have to endure
the pressure from the imperial clan...

265
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,280
and suppress the various criticisms
against Prince He.

266
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,720
You're so magnanimous towards Prince He.

267
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,390
I hope he can mend his ways...

268
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,770
and cherish your grace.

269
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,800
Prince He is my brother.

270
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,690
No matter what mistake he commits,

271
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,000
I am the only one...

272
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,980
to sentence him.

273
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,190
I won't allow anyone...

274
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,320
to do it on my behalf.

275
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,530
Ming Yu.

276
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,160
Is Her Majesty's cold bowl ready?

277
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,170
It'll be ready soon.

278
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,510
Why don't you...

279
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,300
put peach or melon...

280
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,470
into this bowl?

281
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,690
You know nothing.

282
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,870
His Majesty has cold grape bowl
every midsummer.

283
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,110
It's my first year in the palace.

284
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,000
Of course I didn't know that.

285
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,400
In that case, step aside.
Move out of my way.

286
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,360
How could I've known it has to be grape?

287
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,500
Supervisor Li.

288
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,750
Miss Ying Luo.

289
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,330
What's the rush?

290
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,810
Does Her Majesty need anything else?

291
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,200
No.

292
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,920
I asked
the Imperial Household Department...

293
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,550
to make two ice boxes.

294
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,840
One is being used in the Changchun Palace.

295
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,520
You don't need to make
another one for Yangxin Hall.

296
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,120
Just use the ready-made one.

297
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,360
I've even frozen the fruits.

298
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,400
Great...

299
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,940
Thank you...

300
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,020
-Get it over here.
-Miss Ying Luo, how thoughtful you are.

301
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,400
No wonder Her Majesty
dotes on you so much.

302
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,690
Slowly.

303
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,120
Carry it well!

304
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,070
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

305
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,990
Commode.

306
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,480
Commode.

307
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,990
Send in the commode.

308
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,480
Hurry up...

309
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,920
Send in the commode!

310
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,400

312
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,280
Commode...

313
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,780
Commode!

314
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,170
Commode...

315
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,970
De Sheng...

316
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
Supervisor Li, what's wrong
with His Majesty?

317
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,320
He's asked for the commode
five times just this afternoon.

318
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Call for the imperial physician now!

319
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,340
Yes!

320
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,800

Li Yu!

322
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,510
-Li Yu!
-Send in the commode...

323
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,980
Do I call for the commode
or imperial physician?

324
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,470
Send in the commode! No, both!

325
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,720
Yes...

326
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,710
You...

327
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,320
-I'm sorry.
-Move...

[Imperial Academy of Medicine]

329
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,400
Physician Ye,

330
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,120
how could you complain
to His Majesty about us?

331
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,490
I didn't say anything.

332
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,960
You're still denying it.

333
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,240
His Majesty reprimanded
all the imperial physicians harshly.

334
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,340
He said they're envious of talented people
and unable to do important tasks.

335
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,890
He ordered me to discipline them well.

336
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,800
Tell me.

337
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,310
If not you, who?

338
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,080
Physician Zhang,
don't you falsely accuse me.

339
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,080
There're so many people in this palace.

340
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,150
Someone might have spoken it out...

341
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,170
and His Majesty found out about it.

342
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,280
I swear.

343
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,400
I didn't tell His Majesty anything.

344
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,380
Then...

345
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,930
Forget it.

346
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,480
Starting from tomorrow,

347
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,120
you can have regular duty shift
like other imperial physicians do.

348
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,110
Really?

349
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,310
Yes.

350
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,730
I'm not kidding.

351
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,440
Thank you, Physician Zhang!

352
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,160
Come with me now! His Majesty...

353
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,190
Calm down. What's wrong?

354
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,400
His Majesty is having a stomach ache.

355
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,040
Cut the crap. Come with me now!

356
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,310
Okay...

357
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,520
Why is His Majesty...

358
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,330
having a stomach ache?

359
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,470
Physician Ye.

360
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,130
Miss Ying Luo.

361
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,770
You're full of ideas.

362
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
I didn't say anything.
Yet, His Majesty got it.

363
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,880
And it's been settled.

364
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,890
Hush!

365
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,350
I came for an important matter.

366
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,370
Say it.

367
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,810
Thanks to your prescription,

368
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,050
Her Majesty is getting healthier.

369
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,800
But it's summer.
Her Majesty yearns for coolness.

370
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,080
Thus, she eats frozen fruit all the time.

371
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,280
No way.

372
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,870
I told you...

373
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,970
not to let Her Majesty
eat too much frozen fruit,

374
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,500
especially frozen grapes.

375
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,520
Everyone in this palace
loves to drink tea.

376
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,080
Grapes help reduce constipation
and keep bowel movements regular.

377
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,640
If one drinks a lot of tea
after eating grapes,

378
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,380
he'll have diarrhea.

379
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,000
Don't worry, Physician Ye.

380
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,280
I always follow your order...

381
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,550
and stop Her Majesty.

382
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,080
But Her Majesty keeps saying
that it's too hot.

383
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Is there any way to reduce body heat?

384
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,440
How about...

385
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,120
I give you some dried tangerine peels?

386
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,920
Make tea with it for Her Majesty.

387
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,720
Beside reducing body heat,
it can regulate her energy and stomach.

388
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,920
It's the best remedy.

389
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,600
Thank you, Physician Ye.

390
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,680
You're welcome.

391
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,080
What's wrong?

392
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,480
Tea is served at Yangxin Hall
every single day.

393
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,680
Maybe His Majesty
is having that condition.

394
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,740
It won't do. Next time,
I must remind Eunuch Li about it.

395
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Wait, what are you laughing about?

396
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,400
Did I say anything wrong?

397
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,810
Nothing.

398
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,910
Physician Ye.

399
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,240
Her Majesty is waiting for me.

400
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,420
Get me the dried tangerine peels now.

401
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,570
Okay... Wait for me.
I'll get some for you.

402
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,800
Aren't you going to Changchun Garden?

403
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,200
It's said that it's easy to fall sick,
but hard to recover from it.

404
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,620
This illness almost killed Hong Zhou.

405
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,620
I'm really worried about him.

406
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,720
I'll stay and spend more time with him.

407
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,180
I hope Hong Zhou...

408
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,200
will remember your motherly love.

409
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,670
Empress Dowager,

410
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,240
Hong Zhou regrets...

411
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,550
what he did.

412
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,320
If he could get out of his bed,

413
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,460
he would've entered the palace
and asked to be punished.

414
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,480
His Majesty...

415
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,900
has been defending Hong Zhou...

416
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,570
because they're brothers.

417
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,640
His relationship with the imperial clan
has become quite strained.

418
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,570
Since this scandal isn't over yet,

419
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,410
just let Hong Zhou
recuperate at home in peace.

420
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,920
He mustn't come to the palace for now.

421
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,560
Empress Dowager, Hong Zhou...

422
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,720
His Majesty is filial.

423
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,250
He instructed
the Imperial Household Department...

424
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,580
to make and send me an ice box.

425
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,590
It's quite convenient.

426
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,670
If you're interested,
let's go have a look at it.

427
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,560
Empress Dowager, I...

428
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,440
Consort Dowager Yu.

429
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,920
His Majesty has been
merciful to Hong Zhou.

430
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,120
Empress Dowager. Please don't be angry.

431
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,560
Take care of your health.

432
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,790
From now on,
I'll keep an eye on Hong Zhou.

433
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,040
I won't let him commit any more mistakes.

434
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,270
Enough.

435
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,240
I'm tired. You should leave now.

436
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,610
I...

437
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,050
It's all that wretch's fault.

438
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,330
She caused Hong Zhou to get sick.

439
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,000
Now even Empress Dowager despises us.

440
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,560
Consort Dowager Yu.

441
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,480
Wei Ying Luo is very good at flattering.

442
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,160
Her Majesty adores her.

443
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,840
She even defended her
in front of His Majesty.

444
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,160
I heard that she modified...

445
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,760
that ice box so as to
earn Her Majesty's favour.

446
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,880
It's become a trend in the Forbidden City.

447
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,480
Every palace has instructed
the Imperial Household Department...

448
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,920
to make them one.

449
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,880
She's very smart and quick-witted indeed.

450
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,540
Bai Ling.

451
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,480
Let's go to the Changchun Palace.

452
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Your Highness, do you mean...

453
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,900
Secondment.

454
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
What did you say?

455
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,000
Ying Luo has been summoned by
the Shoukang Palace?

456
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,920
Yes.

457
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,080
You do know that Consort Dowager Yu...

458
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,880
blames Ying Luo for
what happened to Prince He.

459
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,080
Why did you let her go?

460
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,480
Consort Dowager Yu
instructed beforehand...

461
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,290
Ying Luo to guide the palace maids...

462
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,780
on how to use the ice box.

463
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,510
It's a reasonable request.

464
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,630
How could I reject her?

465
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,020
Your Majesty.

466
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,580
If you go, Ying Luo
won't be able to come back.

467
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,190
Why do you say so?

468
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,030
Consort Dowager Yu keeps
Empress Dowager company...

469
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,600
and stays in the Shoukang Palace.

470
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,260
And she's Prince He's mother.

471
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,660
She's very well-respected in the palace.

472
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,900
If you go,

473
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,710
she'll lose face.

474
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,720
At first, she just wanted to
vent her anger.

475
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,650
She didn't want others
to find out about...

476
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,890
what Prince He did.

477
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,810
If you keep pressuring her,

478
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,370
things will get out of hand.

479
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,720
By then,

480
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,940
surely Empress Dowager
will vent her anger on Ying Luo.

481
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,360
Your Majesty.

482
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Ying Luo is smart and quick-witted.

483
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,320
Surely she knows what to do.

484
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,410
She'll come back safely.

485
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,960
I hope so.

486
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,050
There's a small hole beneath the box.

487
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,880
The melted ice water flows out of it.

488
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,980
Place a small basin beside it.

489
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,730
And the ice water can
lower the room temperature.

490
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,960
You've indeed put a lot of effort...

491
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,140
into gaining your mistress' favour.

492
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,450
Consort Dowager Yu.

493
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,640
I've done explaining the use of ice box.

494
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,900
I'll take my leave now.

495
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,840
Consort Dowager Yu, what are you doing?

496
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,560
I want to ask you something.

497
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,790
What is...

498
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,080
that hand for?

499
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,520
Everyone knows that
you're a devout Buddhist.

500
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,520
You don't even go to
the Imperial Garden during summer...

501
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,720
because you're afraid to step on an ant.

502
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,560
But no one knows that...

503
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,260
behind your benevolent face...

504
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,480
is a cruel and evil heart!

505
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,720
Not only did you kill my sister,

506
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,530
you also want to kill me
to vent your anger!

507
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,680
And now,

508
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,800
I sent your gift...

509
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,150
back to you!

510
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,160
Nonsense.

511
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,000
How dare you slander Consort Dowager Yu!

512
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,670
Whether it's nonsense,

513
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,670
only Consort Dowager Yu knows.

514
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,940
She's muddled.

515
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,500
Wake her up!

516
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,570
What are you doing?

517
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,730
Consort Dowager Yu!

518
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,200
Let go of me!

519
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,770
You're right.

520
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,550
I killed your sister.

521
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,560
She wanted to seduce Hong Zhou.

522
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,660
She's a wretch!

523
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,710
She deserved to die.

524
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,050
Hong Zhou is a pervert!

525
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,160
But you blamed it on my sister
and even killed her!

526
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,560
You're twisting the truth!

527
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,640
Many women are gold diggers!

528
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,360
Should princes be blamed
for being who they are?

529
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,720
It's all because of wretches like you
who climb into a man's bed!

530
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,850
That's why Hong Zhou are in deep water!

531
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,810
I'm telling you!

532
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,220
I asked you to come here...

533
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,680
just to tell you one thing.

534
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,690
Listen up!

535
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,570
You're currently
Her Majesty's favourite maid.

536
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,520
You're also a loyal servant who
attended to His Majesty when he's sick.

537
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,160
I won't kill you.

538
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,160
But don't you forget that...

539
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,550
Wei Qing Tai...

540
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,720
is currently a supervisor in
the Imperial Household Department.

541
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,360
A word from me...

542
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,970
and he'll be killed!

543
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,480
From now on,

544
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,530
you'd better behave yourself.

545
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,640
Don't mess with me again.

546
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,410
If you dare do so,

547
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,840
not only will you get beheaded,

548
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,100
the entire Wei family...

549
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,890
will die with you!

550
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,240
Get lost!

551
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,160
No matter how strong her bones are,

552
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,990
I'll tear them off...

553
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,810
one by one.

554
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,500
Be careful...

555
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,200
They're the top-grade
materials for awning.

556
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,410
Don't spoil them.

557
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,470
Hurry.

558
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,290
Where are the window screens?

559
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,070
Supervisor Wu.

560
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
I've been to the Embroidery House.

561
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,360
But the embroidery maids are too busy.

562
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,800
They can't finish them.

563
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,400
Burn the midnight oil then.

564
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,330
Go hurry them into finishing them.

565
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,690
Miss Ying Luo.

566
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,640
Supervisor Wu.

567
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,280
What happened to your face?

568
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,900
Excuse me, Supervisor Wu.

569
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,610
I need to get back
to the Changchun Palace.

570
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Supervisor Wu.

571
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,560
Judging from her look,
she must have been wronged.

572
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,310
Isn't Consort Dowager Yu...

573
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,480
the most benevolent mistress?

574
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,650
She knows how to make things
difficult for servants?

575
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,280
We work in the palace.

576
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,200
Even if you know something,

577
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,060
you cannot...

578
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,960
say it out loud.

579
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,220
-Got it.
-Get back to work.

580
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,200
-We almost did it.
-Indeed.

581
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,010
Try again.

582
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,990
Take it easy.

583
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,540
-Try again.
-You do it.

584
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,250
Ying Luo, you're back.

585
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,800
Ying Luo.

586
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,700
Come here.

587
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,850
Here.

588
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,850
What are you playing?

589
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,120
Have you forgotten?

590
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,920
Today is the Double Seventh Festival.

591
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,400
We're playing this game
called Beseeching Skills.

592
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,270
That's right.

593
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,680
Place a needle on the water.

594
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,270
If the sunlight can pass through its eye,

595
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,330
the Weaver Girl will bless you
with embroidery skills.

596
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,840
Let me try.

597
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,090
This is annoying.

598
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,280
See.

599
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,990
Even the Weaver Girl is laughing at
your poor needlework skills.

600
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,550
You're a little mallet.

601
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,810
No, you're a mallet.

602
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,470
I was careless.

603
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,060
I won't tease you anymore.

604
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,810
Ying Luo.

605
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,720
You're the most skilled
among us. Give it a try.

606
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,840
-That's right, Ying Luo.
-Try it...

607
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,130
I killed your sister.

608
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,040
She wanted to seduce Hong Zhou.

609
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,240
She's a wretch!

610
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,610
She deserved to die.

611
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,480
She used to work at the Embroidery House.

612
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,380
I think she's worse than me.

613
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,440
That's right!

614
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,940
Let me try again.

615
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,840
It's okay. Try again.

616
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,640
Ying Luo, take it easy.

617
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,450
You'll make it.

618
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,410
Wei Qing Tai is currently a supervisor
in the Imperial Household Department.

619
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,090
A word from me...

620
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,830
and he'll be killed.

621
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,230
Your hand...

622
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,430
keeps shaking.

623
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,670
I'm fine.

624
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,290
Let me try one more time.

625
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,230
Ying Luo.

626
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,790
It's just a game.

627
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,510
None of us made it.

628
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,120
She wants to be the best at everything.

629
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,760
-She's taking this game seriously.
-Ming Yu.

630
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,150
Let me try again.

631
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,409
Okay. Go play by yourself.

632
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,489
Let's go...

633
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,030
From now on,

634
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,850
you'd better behave yourself.

635
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,880
Don't mess with me again.

636
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,470
If you dare do so,

637
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,560
not only will you get beheaded,

638
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,800
the whole Wei family will die with you!

639
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,480
She's been acting that way since
coming back from the Shoukang Palace?

640
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Yes.

641
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,850
I don't know what's gotten into her.

642
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,680
It's just a game after all.

643
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,220
It's okay to fail.

644
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,920
But she keeps practicing.

645
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,920
It's been six or eight hours.

646
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,940
The sun is about to set.

647
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,600
Ying Luo is strong.
She doesn't show her weakness.

648
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,520
She's so anxious.

649
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,660
She must have encountered
some big problem.

650
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,020
[How come a murderer
can escape punishment...]

651
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,360
[while the victim gets treaded upon?]

652
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,720
[What a bully!]

653
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,440
Ying Luo.

654
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,040
Your Majesty.

655
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,480
If you give too much importance
to gaining and losing,

656
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,270
you won't win.

657
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,300
Sometimes...

658
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,910
it's true that man can conquer nature.

659
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,710
If you encounter a huge obstacle...

660
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,080
on your life journey...

661
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,310
and you cannot move on,

662
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,630
stop thinking about your goal.

663
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,680
Try to calm yourself down.

664
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,380
Focus...

665
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,480
and do your best.

666
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,680
Maybe...

667
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,990
you can see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

668
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,470
Ying Luo.

669
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,530
I know you're a very competitive person.

670
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,500
But I want you to remember that...

671
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,350
not everything will go your way.

672
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,740
You're a human.

673
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,790
You'll face failures.

674
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,700
Thus, you must learn...

675
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,630
to wait patiently.

676
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,120
How long do I have to wait?

677
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,800
Wait until you're strong enough.

678
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,550
Wait until the day...

679
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,020
when you're not
being restricted by anyone.

680
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,640
Wait for the right time,

681
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,040
right place,

682
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,000
and right person.

683
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,680
What are you doing?

684
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,660
A perfume pouch
gifted by the girl you like.

685
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,840
You don't want it?

686
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,870
It's not from her.

687
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,590
How did you know?

688
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,040
She's one of the best embroidery maids
in the Embroidery House.

689
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,070
How could she turn an orchid into a chive?

690
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,250
I find...

691
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,070
her handwork quite unique.

692
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,000
And it's fragrant.

693
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,990
You really don't want it?

694
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,620
I've never received a perfume pouch.

695
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,060
I'll accept this then.

696
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,650
Hailan Cha.

697
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,480
Remove it now.

698
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,610
Why?

699
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,030
If it's a gift from a girl,

700
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,200
I'll reject her.

701
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,440
But I can't give it to others.

702
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,650
That's belittling her.

703
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,140
I don't care.

704
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,890
I don't return the gifts I receive.

705
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,440
Hailan Cha!

706
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,810
[Will Guard Fuca like it?]

707
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,030
How come this perfume pouch is with you?

708
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,090
Someone gifted it to me.

709
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,640
Who would gift this perfume pouch
to an ugly person like you?

710
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,930
Dream on!

711
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,760
How could you say that?

712
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,120
I'm tall, handsome,
and highly skilled in martial arts.

713
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,080
It's normal for me to have an admirer.

714
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,150
Who admires you?

715
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,670
Give the pouch back to me!

716
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,560
You're so unreasonable!

717
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,120
It's given to me, so it's mine.

718
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,280
Why must I give it to you?

719
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,320
I made this pouch! Give it back to me!

720
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,640
-Give it back to me!
-Don't get physical!

721
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,510
Return it to me!

722
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,760
-Stop it, I'm not touching you!
-Give it to me now!

723
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,660
-Stop it!
-Return it…

724
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,800
What's wrong?

725
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,410
My hand...

726
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,640
I'm very tough.

727
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,180
Hitting me would
only feel like tickling me.

728
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,200
Look. You shouldn't
have worked yourself up.

729
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,070
You've hurt your wrist.

730
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,600
Why did you steal my pouch?

731
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,270
I didn't steal it.

732
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,640
Fuheng gave it to me
because he didn't want it

733
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,740
Thus, I put it on.

734
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,850
You came at me.
That's so unreasonable of you.

735
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,150
Hey.

736
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,800
Don't cry.

737
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,250
Don't cry.

738
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,720
What's wrong with you?

739
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,670
You're so fierce early on.

740
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,280
You've changed all of a sudden.

741
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,510
I didn't do anything.

742
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,770
Your bones are too fragile.

743
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,500
That's how you hurt yourself.

744
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,530
The perfume pouch!
You don't want it anymore?

745
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,930
Your bones are so fragile.
Remember to see a physician!

746
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,920
Wei Ying Luo.

747
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,750
I like Guard Fuca first.

748
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,680
How could you steal him?

749
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,800
If you like a piece of jewelry
in a jewelry store,

750
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,210
you don't reserve it...

751
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,080
and it's bought by someone else,

752
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,920
can you go to that person's place
and ask for it?

753
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,540
You're being unreasonable!

754
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,320
He's a human, not an object.

755
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,160
You do know that he's a human.

756
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,920
He can do what he likes.

757
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,720
If he likes me,

758
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,440
I can't do anything about it.

759
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,630
If you hadn't been shameless
enough to seduce him,

760
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,320
he wouldn't have liked you.
