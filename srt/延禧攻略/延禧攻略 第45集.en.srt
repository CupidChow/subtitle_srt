[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 45]

3
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,340
Your Majesty!

4
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

5
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,320
Get up.

6
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,120
Why are you here, Your Majesty?

7
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,480
It seems a long time...

8
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,120
since my last visit.

9
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,200
Over the last month,

10
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,320
you've only called for
Concubine Ling to serve you.

11
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,450
I haven't seen you for a long time.

12
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,190
Don't you blame me?

13
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,840
If you visits me,
I'll welcome you with smiles.

14
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,880
If Your Majesty doesn't visit me,

15
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,079
I'll wait for you.

16
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,250
Noble Consort Chun,

17
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,700
do you know what I like about you?

18
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,210
What?

19
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,440
Whenever...

20
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,420
I see you,

21
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,500
you're always gentle, caring,
and considerate.

22
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,130
Her Majesty is virtuous.

23
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,040
Concubine Jia is adorable.

24
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,400
Imperial Concubine Shu is passionate.

25
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
Noble Lady Qing is innocent.

26
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,070
-In this Forbidden City,
-Your Majesty, please.

27
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,610
among all the beauties,

28
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,220
I feel most relaxed...

29
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,050
when I see you,

30
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,950
because you never ask anything from me.

31
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,820
I have nothing to ask for.

32
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,650
The only thing I want...

33
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,420
is to make you happy.

34
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,200
I heard the victory against Jinchuan...

35
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,520
has spared you a big concern.

36
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,329
Why are you frowning?

37
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,160
By the way, you should tell
Concubine Ling this good news.

38
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,930
She'd be happy to hear it.

39
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
Why would she be happy?

40
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,270
While she was in the Changchun Palace,

41
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Fu Heng always took good care of her.

42
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,300
He then went to war.

43
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,380
I'm sure Concubine Ling
has been worried about him.

44
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,610
Now that he's safely returned,

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,560
she will feel relieved.

46
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,400
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,880
Nothing.

48
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,760
It's late.

49
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,560
Go to bed early.

50
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,380
Take care, Your Majesty.

51
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,720
Let's go to the Yanxi Palace.

52
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,300
To the Yanxi Palace!

53
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,310
Lower the sedan!

54
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,380
Head back to the Yangxin Hall.

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,080
Sister Ming Yu.

56
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,800
Sister Ming Yu.

57
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,610
Sister Ming Yu.

58
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,200
-What's wrong?
-I saw His Majesty passing by our palace.

59
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,800
He left without getting off the sedan.

60
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,190
Why?

61
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,750
-Really?
-I saw it with my own eyes.

62
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,600
His Majesty left
without getting off his sedan.

63
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,820
-Is that true?
-I don't know.

64
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,950
I heard they all saw it.

65
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,700
-We'd better stop talking about it.
-It's true.

66
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,380
Have you heard?

67
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,690
Concubine Ling and
Lord Fu Heng seem to have...

68
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,130
Ying Luo, something is wrong.

69
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,940
Go and ask around.

70
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,050
Yes.

71
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,980
Is it true? Their relationship
may not be normal.

72
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,590
Stop talking nonsense.

73
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,600
Mistress, you're no longer grounded.

74
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,260
You should go out for a stroll.

75
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,300
What can I do out there?

76
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,240
Let that vixen laugh at me?

77
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,480
You're not the laughing-stock.

78
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,240
It's Concubine Ling herself.

79
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,420
What?

80
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,440
Mistress, we've been
staying in our palace.

81
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,000
Hence, we didn't keep ourselves updated.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,470
There's rumours flying around the palace.

83
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,290
Good!

84
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,310
I'll skin that vixen alive.

85
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,670
Your Highness,

86
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
His Majesty said that he won't see you.

87
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,350
You can't keep kneeling here, can you?

88
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,650
Does His Majesty...

89
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,159
despise me now?

90
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,140
I was wrong, Your Majesty!

91
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,840
[Yangxin Hall]

92
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,920
And I came to ask for your forgiveness!

93
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,130
Your Majesty!

94
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,310
Your Majesty,

95
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,490
if you don't forgive me,

96
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,740
I'll keep kneeling here...

97
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,480
Your Majesty!

98
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,080
Supervisor Li,

99
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,640
Your Highness has always been good to you.

100
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,800
Please beg for leniency
from His Majesty on her behalf!

101
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Well,

102
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,430
I'll give it a try.

103
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,450
Your Majesty,

104
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,340
Her Highness has been kneeling
out there for two hours.

105
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,380
She has a delicate build.

106
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,220
If she keeps kneeling,

107
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,740
I'm afraid her body
won't be able to take it.

108
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,300
Let her in.

109
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,900
Yes.

110
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,770
Your Majesty,

111
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,920
I know I was wrong.

112
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,390
I really do.

113
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,500
You really do?

114
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,360
Your Majesty, ever since
Concubine Ling entered the palace,

115
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,650
you've stopped favouring others.

116
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,750
Who am I?

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,790
I'm just a little woman who knows nothing.

118
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,410
You're the only one
who has a place in my heart.

119
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,890
But you always spent time with her.

120
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,670
I got so upset.

121
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,400
My anger got the best of me.
And I made a mistake.

122
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,410
I punished her by making her kneel.

123
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,300
I know I was wrong. I really do!

124
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,960
Your Majesty, I dare not
make things difficult for her again.

125
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,360
Does that mean...

126
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,730
you've figured it out?

127
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,820
Yes, I have.

128
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,050
Your Majesty,

129
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,750
you do know...

130
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,430
that everyone gets jealous.

131
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,000
If you can share with me...

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,600
a little part of your kindness
to Concubine Ling,

133
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,800
I'll be satisfied.

134
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,820
Do all women get jealous?

135
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,080
Of course.

136
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,500
As long as they hold Your Majesty
close to their hearts,

137
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,910
they'll get jealous.

138
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,360
Unless...

139
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,300
What if someone...

140
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,660
never cares if I visit her or not?

141
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,960
It can only mean that...

142
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,160
she doesn't hold you close to her heart.

143
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,200
Your Majesty,

144
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,510
you're not angry...

145
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,870
with me anymore?

146
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,930
Get up.

147
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,880
Thank you, Your Majesty!

148
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,810
I'll stay to chat to you then.

149
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,320
Your Majesty,

150
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,400
are you drawing a new courtyard?

151
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,030
I plan to...

152
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,840
bestow on Fu Heng a new house
in the Dongan Gate.

153
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,060
And I shall name this courtyard.

154
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,760
But I haven't figured out its name yet.

155
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,500
What about...

156
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,640
Yujing Garden?

157
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,420
Why?

158
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,880
Flowers in Shu have faded.

159
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,360
Gardenia is blooming.

160
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,860
Its colour is as beautiful as cajuput.

161
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,950
Its fragrance is like of
the goddess in the moon.

162
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,970
The phrase Yujing...

163
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,630
comes from this poem.

164
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,410
Yujing?

165
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,120
It praises gardenia?

166
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,110
Yes.

167
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,180
I heard that Lord Fu Heng...

168
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,660
ordered the servants to look for
rare gardenias everywhere.

169
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,200
I think he loves that flower very much.

170
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,430
Isn't Yujing Garden a very suitable name
for his courtyard?

171
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,390
Get out.

172
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,930
Your Majesty.

173
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,190
Did I say anything wrong?

174
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,340
You thought I didn't realize that...

175
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,620
you're indirectly...

176
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,800
defaming Concubine Ling?

177
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,770
Your Majesty!

178
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,830
I truly love you.

179
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,070
But you don't cherish me.

180
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,680
You hold the unfaithful one
close to your heart instead.

181
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,310
Even if you'll kill me today,
I must tell you the truth!

182
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,430
Concubine Ling,

183
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,510
she's done you wrong!

184
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,510
Get lost!

185
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,890
It's game over for that vixen.

186
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,400
But it's clear that His Majesty was angry.

187
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
You know nothing.

188
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,910
His Majesty was just venting his anger.

189
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,560
He is...

190
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,400
powerful and above everyone.

191
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,770
His favourite consort
is being coveted by his subordinate.

192
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,720
How can he swallow his pride?

193
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,330
But isn't it  too risky...

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,640
for you to do that?

195
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,350
So what if it's risky?

196
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,130
His Majesty used to...

197
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,370
dote on me the most.

198
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,210
I won't allow that vixen
to steal His Majesty.

199
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,180
If she's gone,

200
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,040
His Majesty will
return to my side for sure!

201
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,940
Just wait and see.

202
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,440
Greetings, Your Majesty.

203
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,560
Empress,

204
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,720
rumours have been going around lately.

205
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,670
Have you heard?

206
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,670
Rumours?

207
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,210
Are you talking about
Concubine Ling and Lord Fu Heng?

208
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,870
Even you've heard of it.

209
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,290
It seems that they've
been spreading those rumours.

210
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,060
You've been favouring Concubine Ling...

211
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,880
and other consorts got jealous.

212
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,050
It's inevitable that they've been
gossiping about her.

213
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,720
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

214
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,460
I'll look into it thoroughly...

215
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,660
to deliver justice for Concubine Ling.

216
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,960
So...

217
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,210
you believe she's innocent?

218
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,520
Lord Fu Heng was
on the campaign all the time.

219
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,040
And Concubine Ling has been
staying in the palace.

220
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,670
It's normal for them to have a chat
if they bump into each other.

221
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,240
Concubine Ling used to be
the late empress' trusted maid after all.

222
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,830
Their relationship...

223
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,680
is different from others.

224
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,190
Relationship?

225
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,540
You've misunderstood me, Your Majesty.

226
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,750
I meant...

227
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,450
it's all in the past.

228
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,530
Since the late empress passed away...

229
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,480
and Concubine Ling stayed
at the Yuanming Garden,

230
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,470
she's never seen Lord Fu Heng.

231
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,490
Concubine Ling is now your consort.

232
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,240
She's cautious and obedient.

233
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,240
She has no fault.

234
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,440
You're magnanimous, Your Majesty.

235
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,880
You've never cared about...

236
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,440
a trifle like this.

237
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,020
From now on,

238
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,520
whoever talks about it...

239
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,720
will be flogged to death.

240
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,300
-Your Majesty.
-That's all I wanted to say.

241
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,780
You'll take care of...

242
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,810
the rest.

243
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,680
Your Majesty, what do you think of it?

244
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,830
I've never seen His Majesty...

245
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,670
care about a woman so much.

246
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,860
What trick did Concubine Ling use?

247
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,760
Maybe His Majesty finds her unique.

248
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,210
He's never seen
a woman like her after all.

249
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,380
He may find her not attractive
anymore after some time.

250
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,860
It seems that Noble Consort Chun...

251
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,650
has met the biggest foe in her life.

252
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,640
I've looked into it.

253
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,920
The rumours about you and
Lord Fu Heng are going around.

254
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Some are saying you've been together
since your days at the Changchun Palace.

255
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,280
Some are saying Lord Fu Heng
offered you to His Majesty...

256
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,440
for the sake of promotion.

257
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,020
Some are saying
you're still in a relationship.

258
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,120
Every rumour is full of details.

259
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,870
They're all talking nonsense.

260
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,600
In that case,

261
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,160
it makes sense.

262
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,359
Do you mean His Majesty doesn't
come to Yanxi Palace anymore...

263
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,160
because he believes in the rumours?

264
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,020
What other reason could there be?

265
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,890
It's true that...

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,800
His Majesty hasn't summoned you lately.

267
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,960
Ying Luo, what should we do?

268
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,540
The wise does not buy into rumours.

269
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,839
I didn't expect that...

270
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,040
even His Majesty would believe in them.

271
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,440
Your Highness, we've been out for so long.

272
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,570
Let's head back now.

273
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,480
No,

274
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,080
I can't go.

275
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,010
If I leave now,

276
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,240
they'll say that I have
a guilty conscience.

277
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,230
But…

278
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,460
Ying Luo,

279
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,140
I want to talk to you.

280
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,350
Let's talk here then.

281
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,240
Why?

282
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,060
I didn't want to be
a palace maid anymore.

283
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,000
Why didn't you wait for me?

284
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,310
I could have...

285
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,620
You could've made me your concubine?

286
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,150
No.

287
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,560
I'd rather be His Majesty's consort...

288
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,470
than being your concubine.

289
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,530
At least it's a higher rank.

290
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,060
Ying Luo,

291
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,140
I won't believe...

292
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,590
what you're saying.

293
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,550
Fu Heng,

294
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,160
do you know about the rumours about us?

295
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,340
They're saying that
we're having an affair.

296
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,940
You're an esteemed official
with military merits.

297
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,070
Of course His Majesty
won't make life difficult for you.

298
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,000
But he's venting his anger on me.

299
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,280
Therefore,

300
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,710
please stay away from me.

301
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,810
Get it?

302
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,360
I just want to see you.

303
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,760
I just want to help you.

304
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,520
You can't help me.

305
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
You may get me into trouble instead.

306
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,610
Do you mean what you're saying?

307
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,510
Do you still remember that snowy day?

308
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,220
You and Er Qing stood together...

309
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,510
like a match made in heaven.

310
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,310
From then on,

311
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,250
I swore to myself that...

312
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,490
I would broke ties with you...

313
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,000
and become a stranger to you.

314
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,800
A stranger?

315
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,920
Yes.

316
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,070
Hence,

317
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,180
please stay as far away as you can.

318
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,680
What if I say...

319
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,380
I can't do it?

320
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

321
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,400
I can't stop caring about you.

322
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,400
For me, you're not
His Majesty's Concubine Ling.

323
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,330
You're the Wei Ying Luo of my heart.

324
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,250
You're the Wei Ling Luo who's stubborn...

325
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,030
and full of sense of justice.

326
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,990
Justice?

327
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,280
You're a noble-minded gentleman.

328
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,650
And I'm a petty person who seeks revenge.

329
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,530
We're never of the same kind.

330
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,980
I'm very touched...

331
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,300
by your compliment.

332
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,680
What did I say?

333
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,030
Playing chess somewhere else
is a change of mood.

334
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,380
It'll cheer you up soon.

335
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,100
Place the chess at that gazebo.

336
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,540
Your Highness,

337
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,220
the gazebo is occupied.

338
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,070
Isn't that Concubine Ling?

339
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,700
Who's beside her?

340
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,700
That's Lord Fu Heng.

341
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,570
Your Majesty,

342
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,040
Concubine Ling used to be a maid
at the Changchun Palace.

343
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,670
Surely she knows Lord Fu Heng well.

344
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,660
They're talking at a public place,

345
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,620
with a palace maid in attendance.

346
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,520
They're acting respectable.

347
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
Since they're acting respectable,

348
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,380
there's no need for you to explain it.

349
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,920
Your Majesty,

350
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,240
I am afraid you'll blame Concubine Ling,

351
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,560
since she's quite young after all.

352
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
She's ignorant of the palace rules.

353
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,770
An occasional misconduct is...

354
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,850
understandable.

355
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,410
Her Highness will be upset
seeing you like this.

356
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,900
Okay, Zhen Zhu,

357
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,720
-Stop crying.
-The entire palace is talking about it.

358
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,520
Surely Her Highness knows about it.

359
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,530
Stop crying.

360
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,760
What happened?

361
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,560
Mistress,

362
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,080
I accidentally tripped
and hurt myself today.

363
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,400
-Who did this?
-I tripped.

364
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,880
You did this to yourself?

365
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,330
You think we're fools?

366
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,220
Zhen Zhu,

367
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,650
tell me the truth.

368
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,280
Today, I went to the Imperial Kitchen
to fetch some snacks.

369
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,540
And I ran into Lan from the Chuxiu Palace.

370
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,460
They're the snacks made for you
by the Imperial Kitchen.

371
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,720
But Lan said that the Chuxiu Palace
needed them urgently.

372
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,560
And she took them away.

373
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,230
Everyone at the Imperial Kitchen
defended her.

374
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,900
Okay, stop crying.

375
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,920
I'll send you a bottle of ointment later.

376
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,380
We need to avoid scarring.

377
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,850
Where's the other bracelet?

378
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,330
Ying Luo, now isn't the time
to water the flowers.

379
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,660
Didn't you see Zhen Zhu getting bullied?

380
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,200
What should I do then?

381
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,720
Go to the Chuxiu Palace and
beat the young Concubine Jia up?

382
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,490
You need to stop the rumours.

383
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,580
Your Majesty favoured you...

384
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,020
for only a few days.

385
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,320
Yanxi Palace has now become a cold palace.

386
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,380
Even your servants are in deep water.

387
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,200
I can't stop thinking about you.

388
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,580
I can't stop caring about you.

389
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,890
For me, you're not
His Majesty's Concubine Ling.

390
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,050
You're the Wei Ying Luo of my heart.

391
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,450
You're the Wei Ling Luo who's stubborn...

392
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,350
and full of sense of justice.

393
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,500
Ying Luo!

394
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,940
Greetings, Concubine Ling.

395
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,640
De Sheng, what can we do for His Majesty?

396
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,750
What are you doing?

397
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,240
Concubine Ling,

398
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,640
His Majesty said...

399
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,240
that the smell of the chamber pots
at Yong Alley is too strong.

400
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,680
We need your gardenias to cover it.

401
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,080
How can you do that?

402
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,250
My mistress picked all these flowers.

403
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,280
And you're going to use them
to fumigate the Yong Alley?

404
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,570
Don't move them!

405
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,560
Don't move them!

406
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,480
Leave them be.

407
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,070
Concubine Ling,

408
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,000
His Majesty is mad at you.

409
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,800
When he calms down,

410
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,240
everything will be fine.

411
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,480
I'm just doing my job.

412
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,860
Please don't blame me.

413
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,910
Concubine Ling, I'm taking my leave.

414
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,280
That's going too far!

415
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,950
Hurry up...

416
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,700
Why are they taking them all away?

417
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,740
Has the mistress lost
His Majesty's favour?

418
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,070
When the mistress was favoured,

419
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,440
His Majesty had
the most precious variety sent here...

420
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,720
upon knowing that
she loved gardenia the most.

421
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,000
And now they've been taken away.

422
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,480
They'll be used to
fumigate the Yong Alley.

423
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,540
He's shaming the mistress.

424
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,970
Ying Luo,

425
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,900
why did His Majesty do that?

426
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,320
Go find out...

427
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,410
if His Majesty went to
the Imperial Garden today.

428
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,950
Oh no.

429
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,960
He must have seen
you met with Lord Fu Heng.

430
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,550
He did all this...

431
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,640
to warn me.

432
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,020
-How beautiful these flowers are.
-I know, right?

433
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,260
They're from the Yanxi Palace.

434
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,100
They smell quite nice.

435
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,940
Sister Ming Yu?

436
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,420
It's late. Why are you lingering around?

437
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,020
I'm on duty tonight.

438
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,480
But I've got a stomach ache
all of a sudden.

439
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
-I need to go relieve myself!
-Wait!

440
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,100
What's in your arms?

441
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,240
I can't hold it anymore.
Sister, I'm leaving!

442
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,410
You're the thief!

443
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,360
Concubine Ling,

444
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,850
I was wrong.

445
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,590
I stole them...

446
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,260
because I was confused.

447
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,710
I was wrong!

448
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,860
Your Highness, please spare my life!

449
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,150
You're not confused.

450
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,680
You knew I lost the favour...

451
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,840
so you tried to steal the valuables
from my palace...

452
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,070
and sell them off.

453
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,500
Your Highness,

454
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,370
You may beat or scold me.

455
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,010
But please don't send me to
the Bureau of Internal Affair!

456
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,400
If you do so, they'll kill me!

457
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,120
If I hadn't found out,

458
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,280
you wouldn't have admitted your crime!

459
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,310
Everyone is bullying us.

460
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,590
And you're acting like an ingrate.

461
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,110
Where would you sell...

462
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,420
the mistress' stuff?

463
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,000
Well...

464
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,170
Well...

465
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,630
If you don't tell me,

466
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,800
I'll send you to
the Bureau of Internal Affair.

467
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,700
Your Highness,

468
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,010
I'll tell you.

469
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,010
It's common for eunuchs to steal.

470
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,040
Even those serving at
the Qianqing Palace and Yangxin Hall...

471
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,520
often do so.

472
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,920
As long as the masters don't find out,

473
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,840
there're ways to get them
out of the palace.

474
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,680
With the help from
friends at Glass Street,

475
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,770
stolen items can be sold off very quickly.

476
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,610
-Really?
-I'm telling the truth!

477
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,120
If you spare my life,

478
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,470
from now on,

479
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,560
I'll do anything for you...

480
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,450
without complaining!

481
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,700
I can spare you.

482
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,540
But don't you ever forget...

483
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,170
what you just said.

484
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,360
Thank you, Your Highness...

485
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,930
Leave them here!

486
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,640
No one ever pays attention to these items.

487
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,650
He's stolen so many without our knowledge.

488
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,760
Ying Luo,

489
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,710
why did you let him off?

490
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,510
He said...

491
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,060
he'll do anything for me.

492
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,550
You believe the words of such a rogue?

493
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,240
Yes.

494
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,770
They found out about it?

495
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,800
You're such a good-for-nothing.

496
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,870
Miss Lan, please calm down...

497
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,010
It's all Ming Yu's fault.
She's too vigilant.

498
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
It's my fault as well.
I was being careless.

499
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,550
But don't worry.

500
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,970
I got away with it...

501
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,530
by saying that I stole them.

502
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,920
Concubine Ling will never
find out about it.

503
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,470
What's the point of it?

504
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,430
What my mistress wants is gone.

505
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,990
Miss Lan,

506
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,820
I'm capable.

507
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,910
I'll never let you down.

508
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,000
Give me what you promised me.

509
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,310
Thank you...

510
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,720
I'm leaving.

511
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,520
Miss Ming Yu, you're here to see me?

512
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,310
I came to say thank you...

513
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,190
for helping me.

514
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,040
I didn't help you with anything.

515
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,520
Can I call you Hailan Cha?

516
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,740
Of course you can.

517
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,600
Come and find me if you ever need my help.

518
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,420
What are they doing?

519
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,080
It's Noble Consort Chun's instruction.

520
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,560
She's preparing a special gift
for Empress Dowager.

521
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,630
Special gift?

522
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,050
It's supposed to be a secret.

523
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,520
But since you're not an outsider,

524
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,630
I'll tell you then.

525
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,840
Suzhou Street?

526
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,280
Here comes our opportunity.

527
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,990
Empress Dowager, be careful.

528
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,330
It's so bustling.

529
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,370
I can't see anything.

530
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,160
It's so bustling.

531
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,620
Noble Consort Chun,

532
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,680
what have you got for me?

533
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,340
Empress Dowager, listen.

534
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,220
Hurry. Take it off.

535
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,600
Take it off...

536
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,960
Look.

537
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,240
Noble Consort Chun, what is this?

538
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Empress Dowager,

539
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,760
you've always yearned for
Jiangnan's scenery.

540
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,680
There are no small bridges or rivers
in our Forbidden City.

541
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,570
Relying on my childhood memory,

542
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,840
I've instructed the eunuchs and maids
to dress as the commoners...

543
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,440
and open this palace market.

544
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,990
Even though there are
no swaying willows...

545
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,430
and flowing rivers,

546
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,910
we have flying wine flags...

547
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,610
and crowds of pedestrians.

548
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,800
I hope it can amuse you, Empress Dowager.

549
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,520
Noble Consort Chun,

550
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,510
you're thoughtful.

551
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,300
Noble Consort Chun,
that's very clever of you.

552
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,930
But this isn't real after all.

553
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,880
I've decided...

554
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,760
to build Empress Dowager a Suzhou Street
in front of the Wanshou Temple,

555
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,000
along the banks of Imperial River.

556
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,630
Once it's built,

557
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,720
Empress Dowager can enjoy
the beautiful scenery of Jiangnan.

558
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,770
Emperor,

559
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,670
that's too costly.

560
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,320
As long as you're happy,

561
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,050
I think it worth it.

562
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,960
Empress Dowager,
do you want to go down there?

563
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,800
Sure.

564
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,370
-It looks good.
-I know, right?

565
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,570
Amazing...

566
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,110
Awesome.

567
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,710
I like this fabric.

568
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,020
Empress Dowager,
Noble Consort Chun is smart indeed.

569
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,230
In my opinion,

570
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,240
since the palace market is open,

571
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,050
we shouldn't just look around.

572
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,590
We should put it to use instead.

573
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,720
How?

574
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,400
The war against Jinchuan
has just subsided.

575
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,960
Although we won,

576
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,210
it's incurred many casualties.

577
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,720
The pensions received by
families of the injured...

578
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,440
and deceased soldiers are very limited.

579
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,750
Widows and orphans lost their homes.

580
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,250
I suggest all consorts take the lead...

581
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,640
and donate some jewellery
and treasures for charity sale.

582
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,940
Since it's a charity sale,

583
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,760
we shouldn't just do it in the palace.

584
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,200
We can place these stalls
outside the palace gate.

585
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,800
The money received can be used
to compensate bereaved families.

586
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,710
Empress, you're very compassionate.

587
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,600
That's indeed a great idea.

588
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,880
In this case,

589
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,280
we can make this palace market...

590
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,070
prepared by Noble Consort Chun
more meaningful.

591
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,900
Since both Emperor and Empress said so,

592
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,679
we shouldn't build
a Suzhou Street for now.

593
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:21,409
Let's use the money...

594
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,909
to help those in urgent need.

595
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Empress Dowager.

596
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,929
When the imperial treasury
has enough money,

597
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:31,159
we'll then build a Suzhou Street.

598
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,659
Empress Dowager, I thank you...

599
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,860
on behalf of all Great Qing soldiers.

600
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,330
Your Majesty is indeed thoughtful.

601
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,460
I only thought about
making Empress Dowager happy.

602
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,719
I didn't think beyond that.

603
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,580
In that case,

604
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,400
I'll make a donation too.

605
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,140
You don't have to do this.

606
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,320
-A small donation will do.
-Come and buy the liquor!

607
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,160
A decree from Empress Dowager...

608
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,600
-and all the court officials...
-Come and buy the liquor!

609
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,430
will follow suit.

610
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,240
Come and buy the liquor!

611
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,370
Come and buy the liquor!

612
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,970
Thank you.

613
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,930
Why are you here?

614
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,230
Sir,

615
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,010
do you want some liquor?

616
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,130
Try it.

617
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,820
Sir.

618
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Sangluo liquor.

619
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,490
Xinfeng liquor.

620
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,000
Chrysanthemum liquor.

621
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,260
Zhuyeqing liquor. Red Daughter liquor.

622
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,140
Sir, which liquor would you like?

623
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,280
Concubine Ling?

624
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,040
Who do you dress up as?

625
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,960
I'm not Concubine Ling today.

626
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,210
I'm a liquor saleswoman today.

627
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,040
These are all rare good
liquors in Jiangnan.

628
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,780
You should try them.

629
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,000
You've dressed yourself
as a liquor saleswoman.

630
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,040
I can't contain my laughter
at the sight of you.

631
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,870
Only she could figure out
such an odd idea...

632
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,270
and execute it.

633
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,840
Empress Dowager.

634
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,110
If you don't buy it now,

635
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,160
I'll sell it to someone else.

636
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,350
Twenty wen for one pot of Sangluo liquor.

637
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,530
Forty wen for one pot of Xinfeng liquor.

638
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,660
Thirty wen for one pot of
chrysanthemum liquor.

639
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,320
Twenty wen for one pot of
Zhuyeqing liquor.

640
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,840
Twenty-five wen for
one pot of Red Daughter liquor.

641
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,610
Come and buy them!

642
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,720
What accent is this?

643
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,130
Your Highness,

644
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,500
you grew up in Suzhou.

645
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,480
That makes you the native speaker
of Suzhou dialect.

646
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,800
She's showing her slight skill
in front of an expert.

647
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
Try it.

648
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,170
Concubine Ling, you're really something.

649
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,900
I can't even remember...

650
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,100
my native dialect.

651
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,720
Come and buy the liquor!

652
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,470
Come and buy the liquor!

653
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,160
Concubine Ling is so clever.

654
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,400
Look at her clothes.

655
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,030
It looks pretty amusing.

656
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,860
Are you stupid?

657
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,890
Don't you see she's seducing His Majesty?

658
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,250
Look at His Majesty's eyes.

659
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,780
He's attracted by her.

660
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,670
It's because she's tactful.

661
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,160
Even if someone else
could think of such an idea,

662
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,040
they wouldn't be able to
swallow their pride and do it.

663
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,710
What liquor is this?

664
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,590
I think it's Dukang liquor.

665
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,880
Sangluo and Zhuyeqing liquor...

666
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,400
are from Shanxi.

667
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,670
They're not from Suzhou.

668
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,400
If you want to sell liquor,
you should check the market price first.

669
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,130
Who would dare buy your liquor?

670
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,550
Come and buy the liquor!

671
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,070
My liquor ladle!

672
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,220
It's mine!

673
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,360
Give it back to me!

674
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,200
This liquor is undrinkable.

675
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,780
Pay for the liquor.

676
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,290
Here's my payment.

677
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,910
Greetings, Your Majesty.

678
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,700
Hey!

679
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,630
Come here.

680
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,360
Don't you know the rules?

681
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,720
His Majesty is here.

682
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,380
Tell your mistress
to come out and greet him now.

683
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,330
My mistress said...

684
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,240
His Majesty will pass by and not come in.

685
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,420
So she won't come out.

686
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,180
She's acting like a smarty-pants again.

687
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,070
Is your mistress...

688
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,800
trying to scheme against
His Majesty again?

689
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,480
What are you talking about,
Supervisor Li?

690
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,440
My mistress only tells the truth.

691
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,650
You're pretending...

692
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,400
I'm telling you.

693
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,520
His Majesty is angry.

694
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,440
Although Concubine Ling
has lured His Majesty to visit her,

695
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,800
it may not be a good thing.

696
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

697
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,170
Your Majesty!

698
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,560
I treat you well with all my heart...

699
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,060
but you're fond of that vixen...

700
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,410
and always ignore me.

701
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,720
My anger got the best of me...

702
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,180
so I targeted her on purpose.

703
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,110
Your Majesty,

704
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,110
even if I have many flaws,

705
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,380
that's all because I love you.

706
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,010
Concubine Ling likes gardenia.

707
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,250
Lord Fu Heng too likes gardenia.

708
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,830
What a coincidence.

709
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,670
I think...

710
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,690
both of them are having an affair.

711
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,920
She doesn't deserve your favour.

712
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,600
Concubine Ling...

713
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,230
deserves to die.

714
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,800
Wei Ying Luo,

715
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,250
what are you doing?

716
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,510
Concubine Ling and Lord Fu Heng
have been knowing each other.

717
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,200
They bumped into each other...

718
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,810
and had a chat.

719
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,090
Even if they're in a relationship,

720
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,490
it's all in the past.

721
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,050
Now that she's entered the palace,

722
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,290
the past is not important anymore.

723
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,510
I believe...

724
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,400
she's not a shameless woman...

725
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,200
who would betray you.

726
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,640
You...

727
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,560
Your Majesty, don't worry.

728
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,930
As the head of the harem,

729
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,040
I'll find out who has been
spreading the rumours...

730
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,840
to deliver justice for Concubine Ling.

731
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,470
You haven't been
in the palace for very long...

732
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,160
but you know each one of them...

733
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,450
so well.

734
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,380
What you said is similar to
what they told me.

735
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,200
As if you actually heard them saying it.

736
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,030
I know women...

737
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,240
way better than you.

738
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,490
You knew what they'd say behind you.

739
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,340
Yet, you dared meeting
Fu Heng in the garden.

740
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,490
If I had turned around
and left right away,

741
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,340
they would've said...

742
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,380
Concubine Ling...

743
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,400
turned around and left right away
as soon as she saw Lord Fu Heng.

744
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,860
It's clear that she has
a guilty conscience.

745
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,300
Your Majesty,

746
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,680
rumours tend to confuse people.

747
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,600
If a lie is repeated often enough,
it'll be accepted as a truth.

748
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,880
I hope...

749
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,920
you can give me more trust...

750
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,950
while favouring me.

751
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,840
Or else,

752
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,040
even if I were made of bones of steel,

753
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,100
I would be reduced to tofu.

754
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,280
In this harem,

755
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,910
you're the most mischievous among all.

756
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,180
You always tease me.

757
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,810
Do you like me, Your Majesty?

758
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,870
I...

759
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,910
like a bad woman like you.
