[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,200
The people are
the foundation of our nation.

4
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,730
And food is the first necessity
of the people.

5
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
The wealth in the world

6
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,490
is definite.

7
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,240
The higher-ups shouldn't harbour it.
It should be distributed to the people.

8
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,360
No matter how many hard it is for
the court, we'll be able to pull through.

9
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,910
The floods recur again and again
and the people are suffering.

10
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,670
Exemption of taxes will give them
a shot at survival.

11
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,650
Say no more.

12
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,590
I have already made up my mind.

13
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,620
End of discussion.

14
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,470
It's just two in the morning and
His Majesty is already awake and working.

15
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,620
The candles in Yangxin Hall
have been burning the whole night.

16
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,970
How do you know?

17
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,840
Didn't you hear the sound
of the firecrackers just now?

18
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,440
They are used to notify the ministers that
His Majesty is calling for a meeting.

19
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,750
They say the servants of Labour House
get the worst of it.

20
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,140
But His Majesty sleeps later than us
and gets up earlier than us.

21
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,030
I even heard that His Majesty is
proficient in Manchu, Mandarin,

22
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,830
Mongolian and Tibetan
and even Persian language.

23
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,260
He's an extraordinary person.

24
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,920
Otherwise, why will so many people
worship him?

25
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,300
I don't believe it.

26
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,990
Do you want to die?

27
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,360
How dare you gossip about His Majesty!

28
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,190
You, you and you.

29
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,250
Follow me to the back of the hall.

30
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,470
Wei Ying Luo,
I will leave this to you then.

31
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,160
Finish the task before
His Majesty departs.

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,720
Got it.

33
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,440
Let's go.

34
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,270
Allow Gao Bin to return to the capital
for the funeral for just one day.

35
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,960
He must go back after one day.

36
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

37
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,030
The people will remember and see...

38
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,350
everything that you did for them.

39
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,500
I know that...

40
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,390
the nation is vast and...

41
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,709
there are many issues to attend to.

42
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,870
But you just need to
tend to them one by one,

43
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,080
even if the results
are not to your satisfaction,

44
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,250
you'll still have a clear conscience.

45
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,760
-Li Yu.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

46
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,990
Comes to think about it,

47
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,430
I have been too harsh on Wei Ying Luo.

48
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,630
Her Majesty is right.

49
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,600
She is not that bad after all.

50
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,510
Your Majesty, are you going to pardon her?

51
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,850
Issue my decree.

52
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,690
No.

53
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,340
I'll go to Changchun Palace
to tell her personally.

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,800
I want to see her tears of gratitude.

55
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,680
Stop right there.

56
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,770
It's so late already.

57
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,790
Where are you going so late at night?

58
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,560
I'm going to Changchun Palace.

59
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,730
Ying Luo.

60
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,450
You must have already
paid off all of Her Majesty's...

61
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,050
kindness towards you, right?

62
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,110
Her Majesty is seriously ill.

63
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,440
If she continues to be bedridden,

64
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,280
she will never be able to walk again.

65
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,620
She might even lose the ability to speak.

66
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,520
I need to do something for her...

67
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,730
so that I can have a peace of mind.

68
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,930
What about your yourself?

69
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,780
Ying Luo, you are not in
pink health yourself.

70
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,200
You work tirelessly during the day and
you still go to Changchun Palace at night.

71
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,760
Her Majesty is my mistress,

72
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,440
my respected teacher...

73
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,920
and she's like a sister to me.

74
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,480
She has protected me many times...

75
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,590
and even infuriated His Majesty
because of me. Without her,

76
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,350
I would have been dead.

77
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,390
If you are sick,

78
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,940
I will take care of you
in the same way too.

79
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,310
-Do you really mean it?
-Just like how you took care of me,

80
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,630
I will feed you porridge
spoonful by spoonful too.

81
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,090
I have to leave now.

82
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,880
Why are you doing here?

83
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,659
This is the storeroom. What else can I do?

84
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,640
I'm just here to take something.

85
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,200
I will leave now.

86
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,070
Young Master.

87
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,590
It's so late already.

88
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,490
Why are you here instead of
doing your night shift at Qianqing Palace?

89
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,360
His Majesty asked me to deliver
an edict to the Grand Council.

90
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,610
So, I sneaked here to check on you.

91
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,429
Greetings, Your Majesty.

92
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,410
Is Her Majesty doing well?

93
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,020
Her Majesty is doing well.

94
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,320
Please be rest assured, Your Majesty.

95
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,730
Let me check on her.

96
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

97
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,190
Ming Yu.

98
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,510
-Go and brew a pot of tea.
-Er Qing.

99
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,060
Why are you awake already?
I'm the one on duty today.

100
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,880
I couldn't sleep.

101
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,130
Then, I heard some sound.
So, I woke up.

102
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,600
Moreover, the junior maids
are more careless.

103
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,280
If it's you, I don't have to worry.

104
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,110
Go now. Don't be too slow with it.

105
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,470
I...

106
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,680
Your Majesty,

107
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,280
I plan to pardon Wei Ying Luo...

108
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,140
and let her return to serve you.

109
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,430
Okay?

110
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,000
I know that...

111
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,180
you will be very happy about it.

112
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,240
You hope that
she can live in freedom, right?

113
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,660
If you wake up,

114
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,450
I...

115
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,070
I won't ask her to follow
the rules anymore.

116
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,610
I just need one word from you.

117
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,670
And I'll grant you anything.

118
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,370
Your Majesty,

119
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,560
such good news.

120
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,110
I want to personally tell
Ying Luo about it.

121
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,670
She will be very happy.

122
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,520
She's here tonight too?

123
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,240
She's at the backyard.

124
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,060
It's already so late.

125
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,010
Why is Imperial Guard Fuca here?

126
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,210
Your Majesty.

127
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,670
Your Majesty, I...

128
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,080
I...

129
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,720
Why did you do that?

130
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,190
-What did I do?
-Er Qing,

131
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,020
you've always been gentle and considerate.

132
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,920
But recently, you seem to have changed.
You keep targeting Ying Luo.

133
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,590
I don't know what you're talking about.

134
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,470
-I didn't target her.
-How dare you say that.

135
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,920
Didn't you deliberately lead
His Majesty to see them being together?

136
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,320
It was just a coincidence.

137
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,810
You can fool others, but not me.

138
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,170
Fu Heng likes Ying Luo.

139
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,320
You are clearly envious of her.

140
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,810
I do envy her. So what?

141
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,320
Er Qing.

142
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,060
You have a secret crush on
Fu Heng for so many years.

143
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,020
Now, he's about to be taken away.

144
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,920
Won't you hold any grudges towards her?

145
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,160
He's not the only man in this world.

146
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,920
I won't hold a grudge against a friend
because of a man.

147
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,080
Friend?

148
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,730
When did Wei Ying Luo become your friend?

149
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,320
We've served Her Majesty
for so many years.

150
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,390
We've always been very loyal to her.

151
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,070
After she came here,

152
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,710
she suddenly became
Her Majesty's favourite.

153
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,960
Not only that,

154
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,720
In terms of looks and family background,
how am I inferior to her?

155
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,800
But because of her,

156
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,040
publicly rejected me.

157
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,510
He made the laughing-stock of the palace.

158
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,370
You might be able to accept...

159
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,450
all of these,

160
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,760
but I can't.

161
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,360
Even if you can't accept it,

162
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,450
-you shouldn't have framed Ying Luo!
-I framed her?

163
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,100
She's the one dating
an imperial guard at night.

164
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,040
She behaves licentiously.

165
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,200
You say that she behaves licentiously.

166
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,190
Why did you keep
fawning over Fu Heng then?

167
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,700
-You are worse than her.
-Ming Yu.

168
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,440
Ming Yu!

169
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,870
Ming Yu!

170
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,390
My good sister.

171
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,190
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,960
It was just a flare of jealousy.

173
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,040
Help me.

174
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,470
I admit my mistake. I'm sorry.

175
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,420
You should apologise to Ying Luo.

176
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,630
But if I tell her...

177
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,240
what happened tonight,
there will be chaos.

178
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,970
Ming Yu,

179
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,090
we've been together for so many years.

180
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,820
Is our friendship that shallow compares
to yours and hers?

181
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,760
Help me, okay?

182
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,820
Ming Yu, I beg you.

183
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,640
Help me.

184
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,700
Er Qing,

185
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
I'll help you just this once.

186
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,970
Just this once. Don't do it again.

187
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,720
Your Majesty, about this edict
to pardon Wei Ying Luo...

188
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,440
Get out!

189
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,210
Search the place!

190
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,510
Search this storeroom too.

191
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,970
Search carefully.
Don't miss even a corner.

192
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,270
-Madam Liu, what happened?
-Yes. What are they looking for?

193
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,660
Don't search my room.

194
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,680
There is nothing other than
an old and shabby bed.

195
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,290
Madam Liu, there's nothing there.

196
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,360
Madam Liu, there's nothing there.

197
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,630
-What is this?
-What is this?

198
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,090
Ying Luo, what is this?

199
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,870
When Yong Cheng just arrived
at Chengqian Palace,

200
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,740
he couldn't even talk properly.

201
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,170
But he is improving...

202
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,160
by leaps and bounds now.

203
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,040
Looks like...

204
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,550
my decision back then was right.

205
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,590
You...

206
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,750
are indeed an excellent mother.

207
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,550
This is not because of my effort.

208
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,510
Yong Cheng is intelligent
and he is a fast learner.

209
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,300
If you have time, you can test him.

210
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,400
He can recite Tang poems
very well right now.

211
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,720
Your Majesty.

212
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,440
Your Highness.

213
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,170
Really?

214
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,670
Your Majesty, there's an issue with a maid
in Labour House. I have to tend to it.

215
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,270
Please excuse me.

216
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,380
What can happen in Labour House?

217
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,000
They found out that a palace maid
used dark magic...

218
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,120
to curse Noble Consort Gao.

219
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,420
Who?

220
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,920
She used to be a high-ranking
palace maid who served Her Majesty,

221
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,070
Wei Ying Luo.

222
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,470
Bring everyone here.

223
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,390
I'm going to personally interrogate them.

224
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,560
Madam Liu, this is supposed to be
handled by Bureau of Internal Affair.

225
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,720
His Majesty is taking this seriously
because it's about Noble Consort Gao.

226
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,680
He wants to personally
handle the interrogation.

227
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,280
-Tell us the whole story.
-Yes, Your Highness.

228
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,280
I received a secret letter...

229
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,830
stating that someone in Labour House
cursed Noble Consort Gao to death...

230
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,079
and the evidence is hidden
within the Labour House.

231
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,920
At first, I didn't believe it,
but this is a grave matter.

232
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,390
So, I ordered someone to do
a thorough search of the place.

233
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,240
In the end, we found this wooden doll
inside the storeroom...

234
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,099
where Wei Ying Luo lives alone in.

235
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,310
And the birthday of Her Highness
is written on the doll.

236
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,680
There are even blood stains on its back
and a red rope around its neck.

237
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,490
It's very obvious that Wei Ying Luo
has cursed Her Highness to death.

238
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,390
That's why she died.

239
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,900
Wei Ying Luo, what do you
have to say about that?

240
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,460
Someone deliberately hid this
wooden doll in the storeroom to frame me.

241
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,390
You're just a petty palace maid of
the Labour House. Who would frame you?

242
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,120
Why would I curse Her Highness?

243
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,760
Because when you delivered
cow milk to Chuxiu Palace,

244
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,710
you were openly humiliated
by Her Highness.

245
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,310
Many people know about that.

246
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,740
That's why you hold a grudge towards her
and secretly cursed her to death.

247
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,140
You're really a meticulous person, Madam.

248
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,740
You have even prepared the reason for me.

249
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,880
Your Majesty, Noble Consort Xian,

250
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,160
everything I said is true.

251
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,940
I wouldn't dare lie to you.

252
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,120
Wei Ying Luo is the only one
who lives in that storeroom.

253
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,470
Who else would put that wooden doll
inside the storeroom except her?

254
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,540
Who else would...

255
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,360
hate Noble Consort Gao so much except her?

256
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,860
I didn't do it.

257
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,310
Wei Ying Luo,

258
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,270
after Noble Consort Gao died,

259
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,600
everyone in the palace has been grieving.

260
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,720
You are the only one who acts
and smile as if nothing has happened.

261
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,720
Now, you still want to pretend otherwise
and actively defend yourself?

262
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,460
We have a solid evidence here.

263
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
You still won't admit to your crime?

264
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,350
Brother Yuan,

265
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,040
what are you doing?

266
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,680
Brother Yuan,

267
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,440
Wei Ying Luo is about to die.

268
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,600
Are you still not going to consider me?

269
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,010
-What did you say?
-You're hurting me.

270
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,050
Say it again!
What do you mean by she is about to die?

271
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,470
Am I wrong? Wei Ying Luo is accused
for cursing Noble Consort Gao to death.

272
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,730
This time, there's a solid evidence
against her. She won't be able to deny it.

273
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,370
Do you think you'll be able
to save her now?

274
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,960
[Yangxin Hall]

275
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,790
Fuca Fu Heng!

276
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,360
-Fuca Fu Heng!
-Who are you?

277
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,360
How dare you call Fu Heng by his name?

278
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,000
You don't know me but
you surely know Wei Ying Luo, right?

279
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,530
Hailan Cha, move aside.

280
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,770
Lord Fuca, Wei Ying Luo is accused
for cursing Noble Consort Gao to death.

281
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,850
She's going to be interrogated
at Yangxin Hall soon.

282
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
-Who accused her?
-Madam Liu.

283
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,670
How could it be her?

284
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,640
She's a very greedy person.

285
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,930
If she accepted my money, she must
have accepted money from others too.

286
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,930
If you go now, not only you can't
save her, you'll be adding fuel to fire.

287
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,420
What do you mean?

288
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,620
You're a distinguished imperial guard.

289
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,760
If you beg for mercy on behalf of
a palace maid from Labour House,

290
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,510
who would believe that there's
no love affair between you two?

291
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,540
You...

292
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,950
Imperial Guard Fuca,

293
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,880
this matter should have been handled by
Bureau of Internal Affair.

294
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,080
But why is she summoned to Yangxin Hall?

295
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,250
I think you know the reason behind it
more clearly than me.

296
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,190
If you go now,
you will surely anger His Majesty.

297
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,040
And then, it'll be the end
for Wei Ying Luo!

298
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,820
Fu Heng!

299
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,760
Are you trying to save her or harm her?

300
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,960
I...

301
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,760
I am going to save her.

302
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,870
You clearly know that Fu Heng
can't go to Yangxin Hall.

303
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,980
Why did you deliberately
tell him about it?

304
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,400
What is your intention?

305
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,190
I was just dissecting the
pros and cons of this matter to him.

306
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,970
As for what choice to make,

307
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,810
it will all depend on Lord Fuca now.

308
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,020
Sister!

309
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,580
Imperial Guard Fuca,
Her Majesty is still unconscious.

310
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,620
Sister,

311
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,490
I know that you can hear me.

312
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,210
Ye Tian Shi said that
you are slowly recovering.

313
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,760
It's just that you don't want to accept
the reality and refuse to wake up.

314
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,570
Can you hear me, sister?

315
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,090
You will disturb Her Majesty
if you're like this.

316
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,390
Sister,

317
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,080
because of your illness,
our mother has been crying every day.

318
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,000
Now, she is blind in one eye.

319
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,100
Our father sighs all day
and has no mood to do his work.

320
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,950
And everyone in Changchun Palace...

321
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,670
is in depression.

322
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,290
Everyone is so lifeless.

323
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,090
You doted on Wei Ying Luo
so much before this.

324
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,130
She sought vengeance
and killed someone for you.

325
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,110
Now, she's in a desperate situation.
Can't you wake up and help her?

326
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,290
Imperial Guard Fuca.

327
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,600
Sister, you can hear everything.

328
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,690
Why are you still lying on this bed?

329
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,330
Why do you refuse to wake up?

330
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,400
You can't face the pain
of losing a child again?

331
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,020
Or you can't face the unending battles
in the harem?

332
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,520
How long can you keep avoiding it?

333
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,980
Unless you lie in bed forever.

334
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,960
Unless you stay in
this vegetative state forever.

335
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,210
Sister,

336
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,380
I beg you.

337
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,430
Help me.

338
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,440
Help Ying Luo.

339
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,290
Only you can save her.

340
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,190
Only you can help her.

341
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,830
There's only one way...

342
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,090
to save Wei Ying Luo.

343
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,490
Your Majesty,

344
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,170
this is a reef knot.

345
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,760
Reef knot?

346
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,650
You can easily untie a reef knot.

347
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,110
If you just pull it,

348
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,640
you can easily untie it.

349
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,930
So what?

350
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,250
Usually, no matter I'm doing
embroidering works or normal chores,

351
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,520
I will never use it because...

352
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,450
reef knot can become undone too easily.

353
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,790
Look.

354
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,220
I usually tie my knot like this.

355
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,950
If you don't believe me,

356
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,880
you can check all my embroidery works...

357
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,310
and all the rope knots that I've tied.

358
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,520
Even if the knotting method
is not the same,

359
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,920
you can't prove that
this item is not yours.

360
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,640
Madam Liu,

361
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,840
where did you find this wooden doll?

362
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,160
In your storeroom?

363
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,800
-Which part of the storeroom?
-Storeroom...

364
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,530
Inside a hole on the wall
behind the firewood.

365
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,860
You used it to keep
your vile things there.

366
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,240
Noble Consort Gao is dead
for more than two months.

367
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,470
If she were truly cursed to death by me,

368
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,080
why would I keep evidence
for you to find out?

369
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,510
Only you have the answer.
How would I know?

370
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,650
Okay.

371
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,310
Let's say I was really so foolish...

372
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,240
to leave an evidence behind.

373
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,880
This wooden doll was hidden inside
a hole on the wall of the storeroom.

374
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,200
The storeroom is humid and damp in summer.

375
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,080
Even the firewood is wet.

376
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,020
But this wooden doll is perfectly fine.

377
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
It's completely dry even though...

378
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,430
it has been soaking in water
for two months.

379
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,320
If a wood has been soaked in water before,
even after it is dry,

380
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,120
it will not be the same as before.

381
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,650
So,

382
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,160
this little wooden doll
is put in there just recently.

383
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,000
Madam Liu, what is exactly going on here?

384
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,680
I really don't know.

385
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,800
You are too foolish.

386
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,200
You can't even frame me properly.
What else can you do?

387
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,380
Your Highness,

388
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,090
someone must be behind this.

389
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,480
Please don't let go of that evil person.

390
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,600
Drag her to Bureau of Internal Affair
and grill her.

391
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,880
Yes, Your Highness.

392
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,360
Spare me, Your Majesty!
Spare me, Your Highness!

393
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,780
I know my mistake now!

394
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,580
I know my mistake now!

395
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,080
Spare me, Your Majesty!

396
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,790
Spare me, Your Majesty!

397
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,080
Looks like Wei Ying Luo is framed.

398
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,560
Even though you are not guilty for
cursing Noble Consort Gao to death,

399
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,310
as a palace maid,

400
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,110
what about your affair
with an imperial guard?

401
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,640
Your Majesty, this is a grave matter that
involves her honour and reputation.

402
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,570
-If there is no evidence...
-I saw it with my own eyes.

403
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,580
Guards.

404
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,130
Drag her to Bureau of Internal Affair too.

405
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,800
Your Majesty.

406
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,160
-Didn't you hear me?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

407
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,630
Stop right there.

408
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,150
You were so eloquent just now.

409
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,070
Why aren't you defending yourself?

410
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,440
Since you saw it with your own eyes,

411
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,820
I have nothing to say.

412
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,230
Well said!

413
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,430
Take her away!

414
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,450
Your Majesty.

415
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Imperial Guard Fuca
is still kneeling outside.

416
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,860
Let him kneel.

417
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,420
Your Majesty,

418
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,180
he said that he has
something urgent to report to you.

419
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,710
What matter can he have?

420
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,680
He's just here for that woman.

421
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,560
Tell him this.

422
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,750
Wei Ying Luo broke the palace rules.

423
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,120
I will not forgive her easily.

424
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,760
Fu Heng.

425
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,740
You've been kneeling here all day.

426
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,280
What exactly are you trying to achieve?

427
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,340
Your Majesty, I'm here to beg you
to grant me a marriage.

428
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,810
You want to marry Wei Ying Luo?

429
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,150
Let me tell you.

430
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,650
It's impossible.

431
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,210
I won't allow it.

432
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,900
This time,

433
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,000
I will cut off Wei Ying Luo's head...

434
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,460
to set her as an example.

435
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,820
You once granted me
a marriage before this.

436
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,550
I wouldn't dare marry another.

437
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,560
What did you say?

438
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,510
I'm going to accept your edict...

439
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,500
and marry the granddaughter
of the Minister of Justice,

440
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,320
Hitala Hala Er Qing.

441
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,440
I was framed. Let me go.

442
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,800
Wei Ying Luo, you can leave now.

443
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,710
Why are you standing there? Come out.

444
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,970
Why are you letting me go?

445
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,790
Are you not happy about it?
Do you want to stay here forever?

446
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,320
Come out now.
I don't have time to waste on you.

447
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,500
What about me? I was framed. Let me go.

448
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,750
Noble Consort Xian said that
she will interrogate you personally later.

449
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,850
Just sit tight in there.

450
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,020
What did you do?

451
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,020
I’m going to marry Er Qing.

452
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,880
Say that again.

453
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,960
I’m going to marry Er Qing.

454
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,790
-Ying Luo.
-Let go of me!

455
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,410
I am not here to apologise to you.

456
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
I'm here to return something to you.

457
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,930
You gave this to me.

458
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,730
Now,

459
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,280
I'm going to return it to you.

460
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,870
I will never take back...

461
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,800
the things that I have given out.

462
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,080
Since you don't want it anymore,

463
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,560
just throw it away.

464
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,390
Ying Luo.

465
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,080
Fu Heng.

466
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,610
You said it again and again,

467
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,920
and I listened to it again and again.

468
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,410
Although I said nothing,

469
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,360
I really believed in you.

470
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,240
So, when His Majesty asked me about it,

471
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,510
I didn't explain.

472
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,180
Because it's the truth.

473
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,560
Even if I would be punished severely,
I was willing to bear it.

474
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,000
I thought that...

475
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,890
you would bear it together with me.

476
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,310
But you gave up first.

477
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,930
You retreated first.

478
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,170
You broke your promise first.

479
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,510
Now, I don't need to ask you
the reason for doing so.

480
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,010
Even if you have millions of reasons,

481
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,160
this is the result.

482
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,770
It's already enough for an explanation.

483
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,970
From now on,

484
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,220
don't come looking for me ever again.

485
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,840
[I know that you always
have a lot on your mind.]

486
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,290
[But I hope that one day,]

487
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,460
[you can cast away your obsession...]

488
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,630
[and seek your own happiness.]

489
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,670
[Before that,]

490
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
[I will continue to protect you...]

491
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,760
[until you open your heart to me.]

492
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,330
Liar.

493
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,440
[I said that I love you
and I want to marry you.]

494
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,680
Those are all lies.

495
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,410
[If you want to stay at Labour House,
I will wait for you.]

496
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,440
[I'll wait until you can abandon
your grudges and let go of your burdens.]

497
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,760
Big liar.

498
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,760
[No matter how long it will take,]

499
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,590
[even if it'll take a whole lifetime,
I will wait for you.]

500
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,630
Liar!

501
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,860
Who is a liar?

502
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,780
Bureau of Internal Affair
is not a good place.

503
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,030
You were locked up for a day.

504
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,230
You probably didn't eat anything.

505
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,949
Here. Drink this bowl of porridge first.

506
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,270
Drink it if you want or don't!

507
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,780
Wei Ying Luo!

508
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,170
You are dumped by Fuca Fu Heng.

509
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,199
But you vent out your anger at me.
Is this the best you can do?

510
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,949
-What did you say?
-Am I wrong?

511
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,670
You rejected Fu Heng again and again...

512
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,610
and put on an air of nonchalance.

513
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,710
But in your heart,

514
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,070
you actually love him to death.

515
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,480
Right?

516
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,630
Yes.

517
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,580
I like Fu Heng.

518
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,270
He's gentle,

519
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,400
attentive,

520
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,630
educated...

521
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,440
and cultured.

522
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,200
And he's good to me in every way.

523
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,820
I like Fu Heng.

524
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,760
No.

525
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,400
-I love him.
-Enough!

526
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,510
Wei Ying Luo, you finally admitted it.

527
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,640
Actually, it's funny
when you think about it.

528
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,280
A lofty master like Fu Heng...

529
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:54,670
can get whatever he wished for
since he was little.

530
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,740
But when it comes to you,

531
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,710
you always push him away
from you again and again.

532
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,240
The more you reject him,
the more he loves you.

533
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,930
But what of it?

534
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,820
In the end,
you are not the one he marries.

535
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,670
Your so-called love...

536
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,130
is just a joke.

537
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,950
-Stop saying it!
-I must say it!

538
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,520
-I don't want to hear it!
-You have to!

539
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,110
-Brother!
-Wei Ying Luo!

540
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,000
I know that you're strong-willed.

541
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,430
You are always arrogant and unyielding.

542
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,800
This must be the first time
you suffered such a big blow from a man.

543
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,890
Let me ask you.

544
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,780
Do you feel very upset
and in pain right now?

545
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,930
Wei Ying Luo, this world is unfair.

546
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,760
No matter how much you love each other,

547
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,920
it'll never work out in the end!

548
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:48,400
With your family background, you can
never marry honourably into Fuca Mansion.

549
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,070
It'll forever be impossible!

550
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,570
Calm down!

551
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,400
Who is really the one that
broke the two of you apart?

552
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,860
It's Qianlong!

553
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,320
Who is the one that gave up?

554
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,960
It's Fuca Fu Heng!

555
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
And me?

556
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,280
I will never give up.

557
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,140
I am always by your side.

558
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,940
I always protected you...

559
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,830
and took care for you.

560
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,620
I'm always worried that
you'll be treated wrongly.

561
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,240
Is this how you treat me?

562
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,630
Ying Luo, I am your sworn brother.

563
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,960
I am your protector.

564
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,600
I will not harm you.

565
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,900
I'm the one who care the most
about you in this world.

566
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,480
Don't cry.

567
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,160
You are not allowed to cry.

568
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,630
Ying Luo,

569
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,480
remember my words.

570
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,680
We should never ever...

571
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,760
cry over the people who abandoned us.

572
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,930
Because crying is useless.

573
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,480
Others will laugh at you.

574
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,810
And it won't help you in any way.

575
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,940
Brother.

576
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,360
Ying Luo.

577
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,930
My heart is in so much pain.

578
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,040
I know.

579
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,160
I am so sad.

580
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,320
I know.

581
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,060
I'm really suffering.

582
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,650
This is just temporary.

583
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,890
Listen to me.

584
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,960
If you don't want to get hurt ever again,

585
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,470
we can only...

586
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,200
keep our true hearts to ourselves forever.

587
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,480
Foolish sister.

588
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,610
Do you know what's your biggest weakness?

589
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,090
You have an icy appearance.

590
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,810
But you don't have an icy heart.

591
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,030
Brother.

592
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,040
I'm sorry.

593
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,000
It was my fault just now.

594
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,680
I shouldn't have vented out
my anger on you.

595
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,920
It's alright.

596
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,320
You...

597
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,960
are always so emotional.

598
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,200
This is a weakness.

599
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,750
But it's alright.

600
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,520
Women cry to express their feelings.

601
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,480
From now on, you can cry
as much as you want on my shoulder.

602
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,980
I won't criticise you.

603
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,870
Brother.

604
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,840
I never asked you this all these whiles.

605
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,000
Why did you...

606
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,320
come to the Forbidden City?

607
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,810
-[Father, I can't walk anymore.]
-[Continue to walk!]

608
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,620
[Father, I really can't walk anymore.]

609
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,640
[Leave him be. Let's go now.
We can't even survive on our own.]

610
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,080
-[Leave him.]
-[Mother!]

611
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,260
My father abandoned me
five times on the journey.

612
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:20,680
-[Don't leave me behind!]
-My mother couldn't bear to do it.

613
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,040
She came back for me all five times.

614
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,780
We went through many hardships
and arrived at the capital.

615
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,800
After that, both of them
died from illness.

616
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,080
On her death bed,
my mother told me that...

617
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,760
I'm not their biological son.

618
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,970
My biological mother died a long time ago.

619
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,660
I was adopted just to...

620
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,370
continue their family lineage.

621
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,710
[Look for your biological father.]

622
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,200
[Look for him.]

623
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,380
Did you go and find
your biological father?

624
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,800
-I did.
-Did you find him?

625
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,390
Yes, I did.

626
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,460
My father...

627
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,850
lives in a huge mansion.

628
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,530
He has so many servants working under him.

629
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,000
And he is extremely wealthy.

630
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,930
At first, I was going to
acknowledge him as my father.

631
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But I was young at that time
and I didn't know anything.

632
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,760
I was tricked.

633
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,640
In the end,

634
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,540
I was sold into...

635
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,330
that big mansion as a slave.

636
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:44,070
[Father, I don't want to study.
I want to ride a horse.]

637
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,150
-[Father, look.]
-[Fu Hui, be careful.]

638
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,610
[Faster! Go faster!]

639
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,890
[Fu Hui!]

640
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,570
[Is this how you take care of
the eighth prince?]

641
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,530
[A bunch of trash! Drag them out!]

642
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,120
[Cane them thirty times.]

643
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,120
[Spare me, Your Majesty.]

644
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,410
[Spare me. Your Majesty!]

645
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,400
I hate everything.

646
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,290
I hate the first person
who discovered the Japamala.

647
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,640
He is my eighth uncle.

648
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,940
He lost in the fight for the throne.

649
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,480
So, he vented out his resentment on me.

650
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,120
He...

651
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,780
personally sent me
into the Forbidden City.

652
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:49,450
I hate my father.

653
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,690
His own son was clearly in front of him.

654
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,680
But he wouldn't acknowledge me.

655
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,730
He even...

656
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,160
turned me into Fu Hui's slave.

657
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,940
I hate my teacher.

658
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,120
He once showed me kindness.

659
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,900
But at the moment of life and death,
he pushed me out without any hesitation!
