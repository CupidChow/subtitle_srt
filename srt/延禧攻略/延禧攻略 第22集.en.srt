[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,680
Ying Luo, my heart almost
jumped out of my chest just now.

4
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,580
What happened?

5
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,230
For the past few days, cosplay has become
an on-going trend in the palace.

6
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,729
It has come to a point that
everyone is doing it.

7
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,360
Why did this accident happen
right on the day...

8
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,630
you accompanied Empress Dowager
to tour the garden?

9
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,600
Ming Yu blocked Zhi Lan. So,
I was able to arrive before her.

10
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,329
And this palace maid
has already fallen and died.

11
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,380
But her make-up was glamorous
and I heard the other two upstairs...

12
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,450
whispering about you.

13
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,960
So, I deducted that this incident must be
related to the cosplay trend.

14
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,960
More importantly,
Zhi Lan was so aggressive that...

15
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,070
I couldn't help but to suspect that
Noble Consort Gao is the one behind this.

16
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,540
So, you beat her to it and
dragged her down first?

17
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,200
What about that greasepaint on her face?

18
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,350
It's not greasepaint.

19
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,730
It's just berries and balsam juice.

20
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:00,020
Luckily, her face is covered
in blood after she fell.

21
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,860
Others won't look at her face closely.
As long as we insist that...

22
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,400
that she's playing as an opera,
we can then bluff our way out of this.

23
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,710
This cosplay trend...

24
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,830
has led to the death of
a palace maid today.

25
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,150
And the cosplay trend
started from Changchun Palace.

26
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,120
Empress Dowager will surely
blame Her Majesty for it.

27
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,950
Wait. I'm a bit confused.

28
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,160
How did Noble Consort Gao
know that a palace maid will fall down...

29
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,160
and purposely led Empress Dowager
to take a look at it?

30
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,840
Nobody in this world can tell the future.

31
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,400
Those three are cleaners of
Yanhui Pavilion to begin with.

32
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,920
They should be very familiar
with the pavilion.

33
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,860
Why would she fell down
without any reason?

34
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,640
Besides, after she fell down,
both of them were dilly-dallying upstairs.

35
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,590
They were like that too when they
came down. They didn't show any grief.

36
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,440
Is that normal?

37
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,720
So, they were not fooling around.

38
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,100
It was a premeditated murder.
They pushed her down.

39
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,660
Are you saying that Noble Consort Gao
killed someone to frame Her Majesty?

40
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,610
Not only Noble Consort Gao,

41
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,200
Noble Lady Shu is also involved.

42
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,350
Ying Luo, you finally did something right.

43
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,540
If they successfully framed Her Majesty,
Changchun Palace would be in big trouble.

44
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,320
Enough.

45
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,830
This is such a serious incident.

46
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,140
And you still think that we are lucky?

47
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,270
Was I too lenient with the both of you?

48
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,560
Your Majesty, slow down.

49
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,010
What's wrong with Her Majesty.

50
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,670
We managed to evade a huge problem.
Why is she mad instead?

51
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,780
Did I do something wrong?

52
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,610
Stop taking it down! What are you doing?

53
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,600
Stop taking it down!

54
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,190
Don't throw it out!

55
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,180
Your Highness!

56
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,800
They just came and took it down.
I couldn't stop them!

57
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,180
Hurry up.

58
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,210
-Don't take down my stage!
-Your Highness, be careful!

59
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,290
-I order you to stop! Stop!
-Your Highness, be careful!

60
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,070
How imprudent! Do you know where you are?
How dare you act atrociously here!

61
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,060
Please forgive us. We are just
following Empress Dowager's edict.

62
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,780
Empress Dowager's edict?

63
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,850
If I order you to stop, stop at once!
Stop! Do you hear me?!

64
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,760
-Take down that one too.
-Do you hear me?

65
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,110
-Stop!
-And these too, burn them all.

66
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,200
Your Highness.

67
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,430
Your Highness, those are your
favourite opera costumes and scripts.

68
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,159
I'm sorry. Empress Dowager said that...

69
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,000
the imperial consorts of Great Qing should
be prudent, elegant, kind and virtuous.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,240
It's really improper to always put on
so much make-up...

71
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,230
to seduce His Majesty.

72
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,910
In order to help you break this habit,

73
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,160
you are not allowed to keep any of
these opera costumes. Burn them.

74
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,660
Madam Liu, these opera dresses
are the Her Highness's favourite.

75
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,460
It'll be such a pity to burn them.

76
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,760
Can't we beg for mercy
from Empress Dowager?

77
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,600
Your Highness, don't blame me
for not warning you.

78
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,880
As a noble consort, you should obey
the etiquette of the royal family...

79
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,080
and become the role model of the palace.

80
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,530
If anyone else does as she pleases,
doesn't know to restrain herself...

81
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,909
and corrupts the morale
of the Forbidden Palace,

82
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:39,450
Empress Dowager will not spare her.

83
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,740
-Madam Liu!
-Continue to burn them.

84
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,300
Your Highness!

85
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,440
Your Highness, what are you doing?

86
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,659
Madam Liu.

87
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,120
This costume...

88
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,180
is my most beloved one.

89
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,760
I didn't like its embroidery done by
the Embroidery House before this.

90
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,150
So, I personally embroidered it
stitch by stitch.

91
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,820
I don't want those anymore.
I don't want any of those.

92
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,770
Can you let me keep just this one?

93
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,490
I promise that I won't sing...

94
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,900
or dance anymore.

95
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,430
From now on, I will lock them up and...

96
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,550
I won't take them out anymore.

97
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,440
Just let me keep them, okay?

98
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,080
Madam Liu.

99
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,200
I will forever be in your debt.

100
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,810
Your Highness, don't say it like that.
I can't bear to be in your debt,

101
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,170
You are a noble consort, but you imitated
those folk opera performers.

102
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,500
You corrupted the morale of the palace...

103
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,200
and someone is dead because of it.
Empress Dowager is so furious.

104
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,720
Do you think I can let you
keep these ominous things?

105
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,190
Not only I can't let you keep them,
if anyone else dares to cosplay again,

106
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,480
they'll be playing with fire...

107
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,790
just like this costume.

108
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,680
Her Majesty still refuses to eat.

109
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,340
What did we do wrong?

110
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,860
Noble Consort Gao was the one
who set up the trap.

111
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,270
Why are we blamed for turning
the tables on Her Highness?

112
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,300
Enough. Her Majesty is a lenient person.

113
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,000
But even she is mad.

114
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,920
Tell me then, why is she mad at us?

115
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,180
Not only she ignores us,
she won't even eat.

116
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,420
We need to know why she's mad
in order for us to fix it.

117
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,530
Look. You don't know as well.

118
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,180
You still have the nerve to come?!

119
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,880
Your rotten idea has caused Her Highness
to suffer in your stead.

120
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,430
Miss Zhi Lan, this is all my fault.

121
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,600
Can you allow me to see Her Highness?

122
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,410
Her Highness will never
see you again. Leave.

123
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,330

[Chuxiu Palace]

125
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,270
What is she doing?

126
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,480
She looks like she is praying to Buddha.

127
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,860
No. She is praying to Her Majesty.

128
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,930
Your Majesty is like a fairy in heaven.

129
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,280
You are beautiful, elegant and kind.

130
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,060
But the fairy is angry today.

131
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,980
So, I come here to pray...

132
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,800
in hope that this fairy will
guide a mortal like me.

133
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,380
Please tell us what we did wrong.

134
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,340
Such a lickspittle.

135
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,320
What lickspittle?

136
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,070
Even if we really did something wrong,

137
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,700
please be benevolent and forgive us all.

138
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,270
From now on, we will be careful with
our words and actions.

139
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,420
We won't repeat the same mistake again.

140
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,650
I'm not Chang'e,
why are you imitating Dian Dang?

141
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,280
You know the story of Chang'e from the
"Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio"?

142
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,320
Chang'e imitated the four great beauties
to entertain herself.

143
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,880
You followed her example.

144
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,510
Dian Dang is a troublemaker and she
burned the incense to ask for forgiveness.

145
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,440
And you followed her example too.
You are getting more and more cheeky.

146
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,860
Your Majesty!

147
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,280
Your Majesty, are you not mad anymore?

148
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,360
Ask them to come in too.

149
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,160
Your Majesty, you can be mad at us.

150
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,180
But you must not skip your meals.

151
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,810
If your health was affected because of it,
we would have committed a grave sin.

152
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,400
I'm not blaming you.

153
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,530
I'm blaming myself.

154
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,450
Aren't you always curious about...

155
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,940
why I became so traditional
and cautious...

156
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,440
after I was married?

157
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,930
A woman needs to take up
the duty of nurturing children,

158
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,660
attending to her parents-in-law
and taking care of the household.

159
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,520
If you indulge in singing, dancing
and enjoying the pleasures of life...

160
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,100
all day long,

161
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,920
it will be a disaster for
your husband and your family.

162
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,760
Take Zhao Fei Yan and Yang Yu Huan
from the past as examples.

163
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,000
Although they are alluring beauties,

164
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,310
they are criticised by
the later generations for being...

165
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,720
frivolous and having no virtue.

166
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,250
Will an empire last forever just because
there is no alluring beauty?

167
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,880
In my opinion, it is exactly because
there are true beauties that...

168
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,120
fake heroes are exposed.

169
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,290
In the past, whenever an empire
met its downfall,

170
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,490
they would either blame it on treacherous
subjects or seductive consorts.

171
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,480
Why don't they blame it on the bed that is
too soft, shoes that are too curvy...

172
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,100
-or a bad mood.
-You.

173
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,180
How could you speak
such nonsense so plausibly?

174
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,610
I'm the empress. I have to act modestly
and be cautious with my words and actions.

175
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,850
Only then can I set a good example
for all the six palaces.

176
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,200
But I forgot my place...

177
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,690
and started to reminisce the happiness
and freedom I had when I was still single.

178
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,400
I put on the Goddess Luo's dress
and broke the palace rules by dancing.

179
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,550
Now, I had set a bad example for them
and corrupted the morale of the palace.

180
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,090
And it has led to this disaster.

181
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,650
Your Majesty, this is obviously
Noble Consort Gao's fault.

182
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,580
No. This is my fault.

183
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,580
I'm the one who made the mistake first...

184
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,640
and gave her an opportunity
to use it against me.

185
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,960
Tell me, does the incident today
involve only one life?

186
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,450
Those two palace maids refuse
to admit to their crime...

187
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,490
and insist that it was
just an accident, right?

188
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,830
Yes.

189
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,910
In order to pacify Empress Dowager,
Bureau of Internal Affair...

190
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,800
had them caned 50 times and
sent them to the Labour House.

191
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,550
All of these had happened...

192
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,700
because I dressed up
as Goddess Luo, right?

193
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,180
Your Majesty.

194
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,130
Do you really think that Empress Dowager
is oblivious to the truth?

195
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,680
She just didn't want to expose me

196
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,470
to save me some dignity.

197
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,900
If this happens again,

198
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,710
I will be ashamed to hold
the position as the empress.

199
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,210
But you looked so beautiful
when you dressed yourself up.

200
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,890
-How can you...
-As a woman,

201
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,320
we are powerless to expand
the nation or defend our country.

202
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,190
I can only manage the six palaces well...

203
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,360
to free His Majesty from
any unnecessary worries.

204
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,530
That is the only thing
I can do for the nation...

205
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,840
and for the people.

206
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,460
Fulfilling my duty as the empress...

207
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,640
is more important than
winning the favour of His Majesty.

208
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,760
Ying Luo, thank you.

209
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,000
But I'm the empress of Great Qing.

210
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,830
Don't ever forget about that.

211
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,940
[Consort, the rules.]

212
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,280
Noble Consort Gao!

213
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,160
What's the use of kneeling?

214
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,880
I won't pity you even if
you kneel until you bleed.

215
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,110
Whenever I see you,
you'll remind me of my lost treasures.

216
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,780
Get lost. Stay as away from me
as far as possible.

217
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,510
Your Highness, I've disappointed you.

218
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,600
I should feel ashamed to face you.

219
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,960
But I've knelt here and reflected
on my actions the whole night.

220
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,240
After thinking about it, it's my fault
for belittling my enemies.

221
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,320
A fierce dog is indeed a fierce dog.

222
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,360
But Your Highness, it's really silly
to try to fight with a dog.

223
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,920
We just need a piece of meat
to take care of the dog.

224
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,750
I think you've become dumb
from kneeling too long.

225
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,010
You're starting to spout nonsense.

226
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,620
Your Highness!

227
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,050
Your Highness, everyone has a weakness.
As long as she desires something,

228
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,980
we'll be able to find her weakness.

229
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,520
Your Highness, when that time comes,

230
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,540
you'll be able to order her around
as you please.

231
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,250
Are you saying that...

232
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,430
you want to make that fierce dog
serve me instead?

233
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,560
Yes.

234
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,440
What are you doing?

235
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,190
Noble Consort Gao.

236
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,250
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

237
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,810
Madam Zhang, I heard that
Wei Ying Luo is your disciple.

238
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,500
Noble Lady Shu, you must be joking.

239
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,080
Wei Ying Luo was indeed in
the Embroidery House for some time.

240
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,610
I'm the madam who is directly
in charge of the Embroidery House.

241
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,000
Technically, we have
a teacher-disciple relationship.

242
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,470
But in reality, we don't have
any relationship at all.

243
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,940
Now, she is a palace maid
in Changchun Palace.

244
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,350
The more I don't matter to her anymore.

245
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,330
Madam Zhang, your statement
is really airtight.

246
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,890
But too bad.
Everything leaves behind a trace.

247
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,470
We wouldn't have found you if we
don't have any evidence to back us up.

248
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,960
Noble Lady Shu, what are you saying?

249
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,250
I'm confused.

250
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,400
Wei Ying Luo was born into
a servant's clan under the eight banners.

251
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,820
She has a father and a sister.

252
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,880
Her sister's original name
was Wei Ying Ning.

253
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,070
It was the same as Noble Consort Gao's
maiden's name. It was you...

254
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,070
who personally changed her name to Man.

255
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,840
Man was expelled from the Forbidden City
for breaking the palace rules.

256
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,800
After that, she hanged herself.
In less than three months' time,

257
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,330
Wei Ying Luo entered the palace and became
your favourite disciple once and again.

258
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,620
Tell me, isn't that such a coincidence?

259
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,510
-Noble Lady Shu...
-You need to know that...

260
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,510
if I have to ability to check
the family background of Wei Ying Luo,

261
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,860
I won't be ignorant about yours too.

262
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,200
Noble Lady Shu, my parents have
passed away a long time ago.

263
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,880
I'm the only one left in my family.

264
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,960
I've served the Forbidden City
my whole life.

265
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,210
There's no need for you to check on me.

266
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,240
Madam, maybe you are so forgetful
because you have gotten old.

267
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,160
Have you forgotten about
your biological brother?

268
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,450
You...

269
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,410
That older brother of yours...

270
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,460
is currently living at...

271
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,970
the main street outside of Yongding Gate.

272
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,250
Unfortunately, he died young...

273
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,170
and left behind his only child.

274
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,480
All your savings...

275
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,450
are used to support that child.

276
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,010
Noble Consort Gao.

277
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Noble Consort Gao, that child...

278
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,410
is only six years old.
He doesn't know anything.

279
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,880
Please let him go, Noble Consort Gao.

280
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,320
I beg you.

281
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,220
You are already an old palace maid
of the palace.

282
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,250
And you have always been
so attentive to your duties.

283
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,320
As long as you tell me
everything you know,

284
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,980
I won't treat you unfairly.

285
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,400
Sister Ying Luo, what instructions
do you have for me?

286
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
This is Her Majesty's casual dress.

287
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,100
The collar here needs to be adjusted.

288
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,140
Don't worry, sister. We will do it now and
deliver it to Changchun Palace by noon.

289
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,710
Where is Madam Zhang?

290
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,140
There are a few more instructions
from Her Majesty.

291
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,070
Madam Zhang hasn't come
to the Embroidery House yet.

292
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,700
She is always up at four and
starts to work at six.

293
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,470
Even when she was sick, she would force
herself to come to the Embroidery House.

294
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,670
How can she be absent?

295
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,120
Maybe she is seriously ill?

296
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,630
I'll go and check on her.

297
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,220
Sister Ying Luo.

298
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,640
Madam Zhang.

299
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,770
Ying Luo.

300
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,200
-What brings you here?
-Are you alright?

301
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,130
I thought that you were sick.
I was about to check on you.

302
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,990
I had a cold earlier but I'm fine now.

303
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,760
Really?

304
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,480
Silly girl. Why would I lie to you?

305
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,540
Look. I'm perfectly fine.

306
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,040
You've recovered from your cold.

307
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,070
But you still need to take care of
your rheumatism.

308
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,500
Don't think that you are fine
just because it's summer now.

309
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,230
When the winter comes,
the pain will start again.

310
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,440
The knee pads I made for you last time
are too thick to be used in summer.

311
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,170
I'll make you another pair
of thin ones tomorrow.

312
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,700
Alright. Ying Luo,
I have my work piled up.

313
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,780
I need to start working now.
You should go back first.

314
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,330
Ying Luo.

315
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,040
Take care of yourself at Changchun Palace.

316
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,990
Madam, you seem very strange today.

317
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,220
Did something happen?

318
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,990
Old people like to nag.
Hurry up and go back now.

319
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,880
Wei Ying Luo.

320
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,770
Do you want to know about
the reason of death of Man?

321
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,060
Come to Chuxiu Palace alone
during midnight tonight.

322
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,290
Remember. If words got out,

323
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,880
you'll never learn the truth.

324
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,490
[Chuxiu Gate]

325
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,240
Greetings, Noble Consort Gao,

326
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,280
Noble Lady Shu.

327
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,360
Wei Ying Luo.

328
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,600
I was just making bets with Noble Lady Shu
about whether you'll come or not.

329
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,830
May I ask boldly...

330
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,600
who won the bet? You...

331
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,580
or Noble Lady Shu?

332
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:37,360
I always hate people with a sharp tongue.

333
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,660
Especially you.

334
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,460
You ruined so many of my great plans.

335
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,000
But you came to Chuxiu Palace
all by yourself today.

336
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,100
I admire your courage too.

337
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,400
I am quite a coward.

338
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,160
So, I already left a letter before
coming to Chuxiu Palace.

339
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,500
If I am not back within two hours,

340
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,790
I can only ask Her Majesty
to come here and bring me back.

341
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,470
Stop babbling.

342
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,600
I summoned you here today...

343
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,410
to introduce someone to you.

344
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,000
Come on in.

345
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,100
-Who is he?
-I am...

346
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,530
the gardener and cleaner of
Imperial Garden, Xiao Zhang Zi.

347
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,700
Tell us what you saw at the night
of the tenth of January.

348
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,560
That night, His Majesty was entertaining
the royal clansmen at Qianqing Palace.

349
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,520
Other chiefs of the Imperial Garden
loafed on the job and went to play cards.

350
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,440
I was the only one on duty.

351
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,680
After that, I heard a movement near
the fake mountains. So, I took a peek.

352
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,320
What did you see?

353
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,710
I saw...

354
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,620
[Let go of me!]

355
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,920
[Release me!]

356
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,400
[Help! Let me go!]

357
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,270
[Let me go!]

358
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,950
Why didn't you save her?

359
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,430
I didn't dare to do it.

360
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,610
Who was that person?

361
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,530
-I don't dare to say it.
-Say it.

362
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,000
I will back you up.

363
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,180
That person was Fu Heng.

364
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,140
You heard that clearly, right?

365
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,250
The man who raped Man was Fu Heng.

366
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,820
Are you nuts? What's so funny about this?

367
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,480
What a great story.

368
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:11,110
Are you saying that we are
making up a story to deceive you?

369
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,150
My sister's incident.
My goal of coming into the palace.

370
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,920
Madam Zhang knows them best.

371
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,300
She is always diligent.
But she missed the whole morning session.

372
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,010
It's understandable if she was so sick
until she was bedridden.

373
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,320
Her footsteps were light and
there was no sign of illness.

374
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,940
But she was being evasive with her words
and was hesitant to speak.

375
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,300
Isn't that strange?

376
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,960
Wei Ying Luo, you are too sceptical.

377
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,400
You admitted it.

378
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,550
Noble Consort Gao summoned
Madam Zhang that day...

379
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,760
just to ask her some questions.

380
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:53,260
You found out about my secret from her.

381
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,370
So, you tried to frame
Fuca Fu Heng for it...

382
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,770
so that I can become
a pawn of Chuxiu Palace.

383
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,870
Wei Ying Luo.

384
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,790
Do you think that the jade pendant
is the only evidence?

385
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,660
What do you mean?

386
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,390
Take it out.

387
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,440
After that, I found this court band...

388
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,260
near the fake mountains.
He must have left in a hurry...

389
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,500
and forgot to take it with him.

390
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,610
You may leave now.

391
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,160
Yes, Your Highness.

392
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,280
Fuca Fu Heng.

393
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,680
If it's just a jade pendant,

394
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,900
you can say that it's a coincidence.

395
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,940
But even his court band is here.

396
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,360
This is a personal item of
the first-class imperial guard.

397
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,180
Could it be that
this is a coincidence too?

398
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,080
Fu Heng ruined Man's innocence.

399
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,640
And the upright and virtuous empress...

400
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,000
chased that pitiful palace maid
out of the palace...

401
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,720
in order to protect her
own brother's reputation.

402
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,610
Even so, she still didn't feel at ease.

403
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,760
If that palace maid let her tongue loose,
it would affect Fuca family's reputation.

404
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,320
So, in order to remove
the seeds of future trouble, she...

405
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,620
Enough!

406
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,180
Look at you. I haven't said anything yet.

407
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,480
And you're already trembling in anger.

408
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,460
I understand.

409
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,440
You put in so much effort
to enter the palace...

410
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,280
just to find the enemy
who murdered your sister.

411
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,110
But in the end,

412
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,040
you yourself became
your enemy's sharpest knife.

413
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,360
You devoted yourself to her cause
and fought her war for her.

414
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,480
That pair of pretentious
sister and brother...

415
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,820
is probably laughing at you
behind your back...

416
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,720
for being so foolish and
take a foe as your mistress.

417
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,840
Noble Consort Gao, what is your goal...

418
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,340
for telling me about this secret?

419
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,380
Her Majesty is very good at pretending.

420
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,190
She used her upright and virtuous face...

421
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,870
to deceive the entire world and
become the empress.

422
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,320
Now, the truth has been revealed.

423
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,460
I hope that you can
forsake darkness for light...

424
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,570
to work for me.

425
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,290
How?

426
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,000
Her Majesty fooled and deceived you.

427
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,380
Don't you want to see revenge from her?

428
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,160
You just need to put this into
Her Majesty's daily meal...

429
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,720
and you'll be able to kill her
without leaving a trace.

430
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,500
You want to me poison Her Majesty?

431
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,990
Why? Are you scared?

432
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,200
Or could it be that...

433
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,050
you don't really want to
avenge your sister, Man.

434
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,620
Of course I do.

435
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,020
So, Ying Luo. Her Majesty is
Fu Heng's biggest backer.

436
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,040
She killed the innocent Man in order
to protect her own brother.

437
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,040
Poor Man. First, she lost her virginity
and was chased out of the palace.

438
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,720
And in the end,
she was strangled to death.

439
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,560
All of these misfortunes...

440
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,590
are caused by Her Majesty and her brother.

441
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,120
How can you still be so compassionate
and soft-hearted towards them?

442
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,679
Take it.

443
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:20,989
Wei Ying Luo.
This is my last chance for you.

444
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:25,040
I hope that you won't disappoint me.

445
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,909
For Man and for yourself,

446
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,400
think it through.

447
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,060
[Ying Luo, I tell you one more time.]

448
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,150
[I, Fu Heng, will do no evil
and I never have.]

449
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,680
Imperial Guard Fuca.

450
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,500
Ying Luo.

451
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,300
You are here, Young Master.
Let me inform Her Majesty about it.

452
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,000
Hey. What's wrong?

453
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,960
Usually, you are the first to greet him.

454
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,110
He's not eager to see me.
Why should I embarrass myself?

455
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,680
Didn't you see who he was looking at?

456
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,980
-Zhen Zhu.
-Why are you here?

457
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,480
I came to check on the tea.

458
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,000
It's almost done.

459
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,000
Yesterday, Her Majesty
ate an extra sachima.

460
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,020
And she feels stuffed.

461
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,200
Let's serve her Pu'er tea today.

462
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,550
Pu'er? What kind of Pu'er?

463
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,070
Gourd Flowers Tea from Yunnan.

464
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,490
As for Imperial Guard Fuca,

465
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,620
he usually loves Tieguanyin from Anxi.

466
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,850
He's not used to the Biluochun
that you've prepared.

467
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,950
How do you know?

468
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,960
Not only I know that Imperial Guard Fuca
likes to drink Tieguanyin from Anxi,

469
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,090
I also know that Consort Chun
hates milk tea.

470
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,450
She likes jasmine tea from Suzhou.

471
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,950
Consort Xian used to like Enshi Dew Tea,
but she likes Biluochun now.

472
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,290
-What about His Majesty?
-His Majesty?

473
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,020
He won't let you know
his likes or dislikes.

474
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,610
But from my observation,

475
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,080
he seems to prefer Longjing tea.

476
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,800
Of course, it all depends on his mood.

477
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,070
If he's in a bad mood,

478
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,490
not only Longjing,
even a top-quality nectar wine...

479
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,710
will not save you from his wrath.

480
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:05,280
Hurry up and teach me
how you figured them out.

481
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,750
You just need to observe their teacups
after they visit the palace.

482
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,200
Go to the kitchen to
check on the snacks now.

483
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,860
I'll wait for you and
let's prepare the tea together.

484
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,140
Alright.

485
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,160
Greetings, Consort Chun.

486
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,000
Be at ease.

487
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,550
Are you here to see Her Majesty,
Consort Chun?

488
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:55,520
She is with Imperial Guard Fuca now.
Let me inform her about you.

489
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,920
Since Imperial Guard Fuca is in the
main hall, no need to inform her about me.

490
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,920
I'll leave first and visit her again
in the afternoon.

491
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,570
Yes, Your Highness.

492
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,130
Didn't I tell you...

493
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,240
not to frequent Changchun Palace
if there's nothing important?

494
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,900
You shouldn't take advantages of
His Majesty's favour like this.

495
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,510
Don't worry, sister. This time,
it is mother who asked me to visit you.

496
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,130
She prayed and go an amulet
from Huguo Temple.

497
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,840
She asked me to give it to you.

498
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,710
Ying Luo, bring me my fan.

499
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

500
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,420
Mother is too much.

501
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,990
From Longfu Temple to Guanghua Temple
to Huguo Temple.

502
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,070
Is she going to visit all temples...

503
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,240
and get an amulet from each of them?

504
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,260
I think she'll be willing
to do anything...

505
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,230
for you.

506
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,170
I think she's not doing it just for me.

507
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,830
I think she is praying for
your love life as well.

508
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,270
Love is set by God. I believe that...

509
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,340
He has already sent someone
to me a long time ago.

510
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,660
Consort Chun, what are you doing?

511
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,990
You should ask her this question instead.

512
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,920
What do you mean by that, Consort Chun?

513
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,200
In order to win His Majesty's favour,

514
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,480
Noble Consort Gao scent her body with
medicinal pills that are taken every day.

515
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,600
Not only her body will emit fragrance,

516
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,600
even the dresses she worn and
the room she stayed in...

517
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
will be infused with her fragrance.

518
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,080
She banned everyone in the palace from
copying her to win His Majesty's favour.

519
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,520
Wei Ying Luo,

520
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,340
why will you have this scent on you?

521
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,750
Consort Chun, perhaps...

522
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,780
she unknowingly got the scent on her.

523
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,630
Your Majesty, we meet
Noble Consort Gao every day.

524
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,930
But we've never gotten the scent on us.

525
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,330
There's only one possibility.

526
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,680
You went to Chuxiu Palace.

527
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,280
And you had stayed there for a long time.

528
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,410
Because the incense burner in Chuxiu
Palace gives out the same fragrance.

529
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,200
And the fragrance
will stay with you for days.

530
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,490
Changchun Palace and Chuxiu Palace
are in a discord now.

531
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,040
Wei Ying Luo,
why did you go to Chuxiu Palace?

532
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,630
Ying Luo, say something.

533
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,680
She has nothing to say.

534
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,790
I still wasn't sure when
I smelled the scent on her just now.

535
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,780
So, I had Yu Hu searched her room.

536
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,300
She found this.

537
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,020
What is this?

538
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,600
A medicinal pouch containing
a strong poison. It's empty.

539
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,740
I am sure that if you
drank the tea just now,

540
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,420
you would have been dead.

541
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,230
Ying Luo.

542
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,310
I don't trust the words of others.

543
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,760
Tell me yourself. Do you wish to kill me?
