1
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,440
I've heard that Consort Chun is very knowledgeable

2
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,180
and well-versed in medicine.

3
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,760
Today,

4
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,240
I've learned a lot.

5
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,680
Thank you, Noble Consort Empress.

6
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,190
I’m flattered.

7
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,480
Let's go.

8
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,720
Director Zhang,

9
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,160
can jujube and crystal sugar be added

10
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,960
to the prince's light porridge?

11
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,480
A moment, please.

12
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,440
I will try to find a way.

13
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,250
Thank you for your help.

14
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,040
Zhen'er, go with Director Zhang to get the prescription.

15
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,720
Yes.

16
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,600
It seems

17
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,120
you are in no mindset

18
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,400
of sharing with me the leisure of tea and painting.

19
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,040
Thank you for helping me get out of the fix.

20
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,640
I don't know how to thank you.

21
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,480
After Fourth Prince recovers,

22
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,720
I will go invite you.

23
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,280
I am content

24
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,880
knowing you feel this way.

25
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,200
However,

26
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,480
your kindness

27
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,960
was almost eaten by a wolf.

28
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,490
And you're not angry at all?

29
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,080
As long as Fourth Prince recovers,

30
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,240
I seek nothing more.

31
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,040
Lady,

32
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,840
here is your dinner.

33
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,250
I can smell it's rancid so far away.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,329
This is for human consumption?

35
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,680
Lady,

36
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
you've entered the Three North Yards.

37
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,040
If someone delivers food to you,

38
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,720
it’ll be a huge blessing here,

39
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,360
so just be content.

40
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,140
However frustrated I appear,

41
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,490
I am the birth mother of Fourth Prince.

42
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,880
But you treat me this way?

43
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,480
Bring your supervisor to me.

44
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:54,960
If it weren't

45
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,560
for Fourth Prince's account,

46
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,600
you'd have to go and fetch

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,930
the cold food yourself.

48
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,580
Suit yourself.

49
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,440
Come back.

50
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,600
Come back to me!

51
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,610
Did you come to enjoy my plight?

52
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Why do you have to torment yourself?

53
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,480
Torment myself?

54
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,080
What right do you have

55
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,010
to say that to me?

56
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,640
You robed me of my son.

57
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,660
From the start, it has been you who did wrong.

58
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,680
Having a birth mother like you,

59
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,280
Fourth Prince can easily be implicated.

60
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,440
His Majesty loved his child,

61
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,760
and transferred him to Palace of Receiving Celestial Favor.

62
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,200
If you sincerely want to do him good,

63
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,660
don't cause more trouble.

64
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,080
You think I wanted to?

65
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,440
What Empress?

66
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,560
What Consort Yu?

67
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,960
What huge grievance do I hold against them?

68
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,960
No!

69
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,240
I am just a scapegoat.

70
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,720
You willingly aligned with Noble Consort Gao.

71
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,980
You plotted the scheme

72
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,000
and you willingly acted as her vanguard.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,240
Who can you blame now?

74
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,300
Noble Consort?

75
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,460
When I first entered Prince Bao Mansion,

76
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,760
she was only a concubine.

77
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
She was even lower than I was.

78
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,250
But soon after that,

79
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,680
just because her father gained power in the court,

80
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,320
the late Emperor

81
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,720
promoted her as His Majesty’s second wife.

82
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,360
Later, after His Majesty's ascension,

83
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,570
overnight she became a Noble Consort.

84
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,160
Her whole family was promoted to the Xianghuang Banner,

85
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,820
overriding crowds of people.

86
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
But what about me?

87
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,640
No love, no favor.

88
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,800
No one to depend on.

89
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,180
It was so hard to give birth to Fourth Prince.

90
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,560
And I was only promoted by one grade.

91
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,100
Tell me, if I didn't attach myself to her,

92
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,720
how could I protect myself?

93
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,760
How could I protect my son?

94
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,659
Just because I acted as her vanguard,

95
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,880
my father and my brothers

96
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,320
all got promoted.

97
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,560
You had the heart to hurt Yongcheng.

98
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,960
You are too vicious to be a mother.

99
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,040
I have to survive first

100
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,720
so I can take care

101
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,760
of my son!

102
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,140
You don't understand!

103
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,290
His Majesty doesn't understand, either.

104
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,660
He only blames me for being paranoid,

105
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,280
being vicious.

106
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,360
But for Yongcheng,

107
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,000
my son,

108
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,000
I can be

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,760
Noble Consort Gao's dog.

110
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Whoever she tells me to bite,

111
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,080
I will bite them.

112
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,480
Even if my bones are shattered into pieces,

113
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,760
I won’t regret it.

114
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,360
Who

115
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,680
in this world

116
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,409
would love my son more than I do?

117
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,880
Who?

118
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,000
But you!

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,120
It's you!

120
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,840
You robbed me of my son,

121
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,680
and my hope.

122
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,600
I didn't come today

123
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,200
to hear you say these things.

124
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,000
I only want to know,

125
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,300
if it was Noble Consort Gao’s idea

126
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,400
that Prince Yi confided to His Majesty.

127
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,680
I am asking you a question.

128
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,010
Why don't you answer me?

129
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,170
This being the case,

130
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,640
there's nothing I can't say.

131
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Yes.

132
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,890
It was Noble Consort Gao who instructed Prince Yi

133
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
to report it to His Majesty.

134
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,240
So my family's demise

135
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,580
was closely linked to Noble Consort Gao?

136
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,440
Wrong.

137
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,720
All is wrong.

138
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,120
Hoifa-Nara clan's demise

139
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,480
was your fault, Consort Xian.

140
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,400
It was you who put on pretense of being lofty,

141
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,060
and rejected Noble Consort Gao's olive branch.

142
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,890
It was you acted strictly to the old rules,

143
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,490
and refused to beg for leniency for your father and brother.

144
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,960
It was you who was so heatless

145
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,000
and caused your mother to kill herself at Gate of Divine Might!

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,400
In this Forbidden City,

147
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,160
It’s all your fault.

148
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,480
a dog is more decent than you!

149
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,120
Did you do anything for anyone?

150
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,640
Our family has broken

151
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,320
because of you!

152
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,760
The most regretful thing I did in my life

153
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,400
is to give birth

154
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,600
to an incompetent daughter like you!

155
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,280
Even today.

156
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
If Consort Chun hadn’t rescued you,

157
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,160
could you have got away so easily?

158
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,320
The incompetent will be trampled over.

159
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,760
This is your reason for failure.

160
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,720
I saw the wet nurse

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,560
feed meat soup to the child that day.

162
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,960
I already had suspicion.

163
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,120
So

164
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,760
I invited Consort Chun for tea.

165
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
Consort Chun is versed in medicine.

166
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,840
Her debunking the incident

167
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,300
is better than my doing it.

168
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,880
Do you comprehend?

169
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,130
Did I do anything wrong?

170
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,240
What apology

171
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,200
do I owe you all?

172
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,200
Why do you all

173
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,400
have to force me?

174
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,640
I must be responsible

175
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,370
for Changshou’s death and my mother’s death.

176
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,560
But others can't escape either.

177
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,640
Those who bullied me. Those who owe me.

178
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,200
I will harvest it back,

179
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,720
one by one.

180
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,020
Your highness,

181
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,580
Your highness,

182
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,980
Your highness,

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,800
Where did you go, your highness?

184
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,120
I was looking for you everywhere

185
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,520
but found no trace of you.

186
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,600
Are you alright?

187
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,760
I'm fine.

188
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,640
I was just feeling stuffy,

189
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,170
so I strolled around alone.

190
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,000
Empress,

191
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,400
your clothing is all wet.

192
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,760
I will help you change.

193
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,720
Empress,

194
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,720
Empress,

195
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
what's wrong?

196
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,400
What time is it?

197
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,930
It's only midnight.

198
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,440
Please go on sleeping.

199
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,820
I will be on guard here.

200
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,600
No.

201
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,080
Did you hear the crying?

202
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,800
No.

203
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,040
I’ll go check Fourth Prince.

204
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,800
Empress!

205
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,480
Your shoes!

206
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,680
Your shoes, Empress!

207
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,680
What's wrong?

208
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,640
What's wrong?

209
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,680
It’s ok.

210
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,560
Come.

211
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,120
Where are

212
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,080
Fourth Prince's servants?

213
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,000
Where are they?

214
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,180
I will go find them.

215
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,000
No need.

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,240
I'll deal with that later.

217
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Get me a basin of water

218
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,970
and get him some clean clothes.

219
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,840
Empress,

220
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,000
put on your shoes first.

221
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,840
- You may catch a cold. - Go.

222
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,480
Go.

223
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,120
Yes.

224
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,720
Come.

225
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,080
Yongcheng,

226
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,280
from now on,

227
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,240
I am your mother.

228
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,800
Are you full?

229
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,280
Empress,

230
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,810
something happened at the Three North Yards.

231
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,440
Are you full, Yongcheng?

232
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,920
Go get the puzzle ring.

233
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,640
Mother will play it with you.

234
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,280
Consort Xian,

235
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
that woman in the Three North Yards

236
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,360
hung herself.

237
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,640
Poor thing.

238
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,040
Send some memorial gifts for me.

239
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,680
Empress,

240
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,960
she deserves it.

241
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,700
You don't need to care for her.

242
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,540
For the sake of Fourth Prince,

243
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,740
I must put in some consideration.

244
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,160
Shall we eat more?

245
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,440
More?

246
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Yes.

247
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,240
I told you to write "forgiveness".

248
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,740
But you wrote a hundred pages of "patience".

249
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,880
Why?

250
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,240
Forgiveness and patience,

251
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,330
aren't they the same thing?

252
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,200
Forgiveness means understanding.

253
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,860
Patience means hibernating.

254
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,240
Do you think I don't know

255
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,500
what you are thinking?

256
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,660
You don't even think you were at fault at all.

257
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,840
In your opinion,

258
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,680
all your waiting

259
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,200
is to save up energy.

260
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,320
When the right time comes,

261
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,520
you will give your enemy

262
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,600
the final blow.

263
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
Yingluo,

264
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,040
I’ve taught you so much.

265
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,800
Why can't you understand?

266
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,560
I am a hard stone.

267
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,400
I worried you.

268
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,520
You!

269
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,560
Your Majesty,

270
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,880
about Lady Jin of the three North Yards,

271
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,520
her funeral is finished.

272
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,440
Poor Fourth Prince.

273
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,600
He’s so young

274
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,300
and lost his birth mother.

275
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,200
If you are fond of Fourth Prince,

276
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,440
why not

277
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,570
bring him to Palace of Eternal Spring and raise him here?

278
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,290
I manage the imperial harem

279
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,119
and the affairs keep me busy.

280
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,440
Consort Xian is graceful,

281
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,210
well-natured and upright.

282
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,000
She is most suitable

283
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,530
for raising Fourth Prince.

284
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,680
Furthermore, she just lost her family.

285
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,880
Fourth Prince

286
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,200
is a consolation to her.

287
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,829
Your Majesty,

288
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,280
I may be too wordy,

289
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,200
but Palace of Eternal Spring is too quiet.

290
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,420
It's time to have a little prince.

291
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,480
Your Majesty,

292
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,120
you are the Empress of the central palace.

293
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,520
You need to give a legitimate son to His Majesty,

294
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,180
so the throne of the Great Qing can be carried on.

295
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,960
Erqing,

296
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,040
why would you say that?

297
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,880
I know

298
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,220
you are magnanimous and motherly to the nation.

299
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,080
You treat other concubines' children

300
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,040
as your own.

301
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
But Noble Consort Gao

302
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,720
is always watching with tiger eyes.

303
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,440
If Palace of Gathered Elegance

304
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,200
Stop it.

305
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,120
gives birth to a royal son first,

306
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,720
your position will be unstable.

307
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,300
I do not permit you to say any more!

308
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,160
Your Majesty.

309
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,080
Sister Erqing.

310
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,880
Your Majesty.

311
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,560
Why are you suddenly so anxious?

312
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
In this Palace,

313
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,600
a child affects the future of an imperial concubine.

314
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,400
Even if His Majesty adores and values Her Majesty,

315
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,860
having no child of her own,

316
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
her position

317
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,480
will just get more treacherous.

318
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,160
Every time

319
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,360
I bring this up to her,

320
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,640
she always gets upset

321
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,100
and I don't know what to do.

322
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Maybe Her Majesty

323
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,320
has her own concerns.

324
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,890
His Majesty cherishes her so much.

325
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,660
What concerns could she have?

326
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,240
Your Majesty,

327
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,440
what's wrong?

328
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,520
Yingluo. I...

329
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,380
Your Majesty, hold on.

330
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,960
I will ask for help right away.

331
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,600
Don't.

332
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,040
Don't alarm others.

333
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,080
Put another blanket on me. Hurry.

334
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,520
Yes.

335
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,280
Do you feel better?

336
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,800
What's going on?

337
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,660
Obviously you're ill,

338
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,000
but why do you conceal it?

339
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,930
Who said I am ill?

340
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,200
I'm not ill.

341
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,160
Your Majesty!

342
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,640
Go now.

343
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,040
Yes.

344
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,960
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

345
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,700
No need to be so formal.

346
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,640
I invited you here

347
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,440
to ask for a favor.

348
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,720
Mingyu, Erqing,

349
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,800
we don't need any attendants here.

350
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,730
You may leave us.

351
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,880
Yes.

352
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,240
What do you suppose

353
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,540
Her Majesty has to tell Consort Chun?

354
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,480
She even

355
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,440
sent us away.

356
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Let's not ask much

357
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,880
about Her Majesty’s business.

358
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
I don't believe you're not curious!

359
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,240
Your Majesty

360
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,370
has never concealed anything from us.

361
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
This time, it must be something big!

362
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,560
If she doesn’t let us stay there,

363
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,880
we'll guard the door here.

364
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,720
Got it?

365
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,320
Guard the door.

366
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,040
I’ll count on you.

367
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
Be assured, Your Majesty.

368
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,080
I will go get prepared,

369
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
and be back soon.

370
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,520
Erqing,

371
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,120
come in with me.

372
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,120
This way, Empress.

373
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
What's happening?

374
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,760
Really?

375
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,440
Those two women are so strange.

376
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,250
Consort Chun has been ill for years and doesn't serve in bed.

377
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,360
Her Majesty treats her like a real sister.

378
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,980
Those two are supposed to be love rivals.

379
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,440
How is there no grievance?

380
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,120
Indeed.

381
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,600
Consort Chun is serving Her Majesty

382
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
much more diligently than she serves His Majesty.

383
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
Though Her Majesty is magnanimous,

384
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
she's never as gentle

385
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,740
to anyone else as to Consort Chun.

386
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,040
Something weird must be going on between them.

387
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,040
What could be going on between two women?

388
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,160
They are not...

389
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,440
Right.

390
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,560
In this world,

391
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,160
what is impossible?

392
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,440
When I put it that way,

393
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,960
everything that's not right can be comprehended.

394
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,040
Empress,

395
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,640
you mean…

396
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,640
The opportunity has knocked my door.

397
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,800
If I don't use it,

398
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
I'll be disappointing them.

399
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,520
Zhilan,

400
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,040
spread a rumor for me.

401
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,120
Empress,

402
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,600
you mean it?

403
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,280
If you want a good reputation,

404
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,960
you'll need to commit yourself to good deeds forever.

405
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,890
If there's anything tint of filth,

406
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,360
that'll be a big crumble

407
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,720
right away.

408
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,680
Remember it.

409
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,040
However absurd things may sound,

410
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,680
as long as someone believes them,

411
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,760
they are true.

412
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,320
I think

413
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,280
something unusual must be going on between them.

414
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,800
Can't be. Impossible.

415
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,040
Why not?

416
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,800
Did you hear it?

417
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,280
What?

418
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,520
Master of Palace of Eternal Spring

419
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,560
and Consort Chun…

420
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,090
What are you looking at?

421
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,080
- You scared me. - So suspicious.

422
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,440
Look.

423
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,560
What's there to look at?

424
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,280
Yingluo,

425
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,740
don't you find it strange?

426
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,520
Strange, how?

427
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,480
I mean, Imperial Consort Chun

428
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,640
and Her Majesty.

429
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,600
Imperial Consort Chun

430
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,440
stays at Her Majesty' sleeping chamber

431
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,570
four hours each day.

432
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,480
Maybe Her Majesty and Imperial Consort Chun

433
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,720
are discussing something.

434
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,960
It's been seven or eight days.

435
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,000
What discussion

436
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,200
could take that long?

437
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,720
This is the business of the masters.

438
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,920
What's it to you?

439
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,680
I already spelled it out to you

440
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,480
but you still don't understand.

441
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,400
You are beating around the bush.

442
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,130
What exactly do you want to say?

443
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,040
I mean…

444
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,810
Where did you hear such a rumor?

445
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,080
If master finds out,

446
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,410
she will rip your mouth!

447
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,920
It's already known to the whole Palace.

448
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,200
Everyone says that.

449
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:05,760
Clearly

450
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,520
someone is trying to damage our master' reputation.

451
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,120
How could you be adding to it?

452
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,440
Alright.

453
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
I won't say it anymore.

454
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,720
I won’t, ok?

455
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Erqing?

456
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,210
You haven’t gone to bed?

457
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,360
These are Her Majesty's inner clothes?

458
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,840
She just had a nightmare

459
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,420
and broke into a sweat.

460
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,920
So she took it off.

461
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,960
It's late.

462
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,080
Why don't you wait until tomorrow?

463
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,640
I had been washing clothes, anyway.

464
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,920
You're on duty tomorrow morning.

465
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,000
Go to bed early.

466
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,000
Ok.

467
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,400
Then after you wash the clothes,

468
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,010
go to bed early, too.

469
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,840
Your Majesty.

470
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,560
Did you really find

471
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
the post "Sunny After Snow"?

472
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,200
Yes.

473
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,960
I heard you have obtained

474
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,770
Wang Xianzhi's "Mid-Autumn",

475
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,720
and Wang Xun's "Letter to Boyuan".

476
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,120
You only lack Wang Xizhi's

477
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,400
"Sunny After Snow".

478
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,960
So I asked my brother

479
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,200
to search everywhere in Suzhou.

480
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,400
Finally he found it.

481
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
Your Majesty,

482
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,400
would you like to see it?

483
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,640
His strokes are gentle

484
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,960
like flowing water.

485
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,040
Compared with "Mid-Autumn"

486
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,200
and "Letter to Boyuan",

487
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,560
it is obviously better.

488
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,200
This is Wang Xizhi.

489
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,290
But these four characters, "shan yin zhang hou",

490
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,810
seem different in style

491
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,360
with the main text.

492
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,080
You have sharp eyes.

493
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
This calligraphy post

494
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,560
was possessed by a collector

495
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,720
in Suzhou.

496
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Maybe

497
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
he added that line himself.

498
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,720
Pity!

499
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,480
It ruins the beauty of this post.

500
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,720
What a pity!

501
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,480
It can’t be the smell of musk or orchid.

502
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,680
Who's singing opera?

503
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Your Majesty,

504
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,220
they are rehearsing a new opera on stage.

505
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,080
It is close to Palace of Gathered Elegance.

506
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,080
It annoyed you.

507
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,440
I will go tell . . .

508
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,400
No need.

509
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:12,520
I try to sniff the plum blossoms,

510
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,880
Your Majesty.

511
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,440
Your Majesty.

512
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:33,680
How about we being sworn sisters this life,

513
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:42,520
and sworn brothers next life?

514
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,920
No.

515
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,880
I have already married Mr. Fan.

516
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,520
If you marry Mr. Fan too…

517
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,880
We will be sisters.

518
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,120
We won't have ranks.

519
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,720
Singing together,

520
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,200
never apart.

521
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,480
Closer than husband and wife.

522
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,720
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

523
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,080
What are you singing?

524
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,480
Your Majesty,

525
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,680
they are just singing

526
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,520
writer Li Yu's "Fragrant Companion".

527
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,800
It's about two beauties

528
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,520
that love each other

529
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,880
and marry the same man.

530
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,920
You may not be aware of it,

531
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,010
but the love stories between women

532
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,480
is entertainment to third-rate literati.

533
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,570
Why are they singing that opera in the Palace!

534
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,480
Your Majesty.

535
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,080
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

536
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,290
What's wrong with His Majesty?

537
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,200
He just heard the two singers

538
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,640
rehearsing "Fragrant Companion".

539
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,320
And I hear

540
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,560
the prototypes are Consort Chun and Her Majesty.

541
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,400
Gosh!

542
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,440
How could it be?

543
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,570
That's why His Majesty was that angry.

544
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,200
Your Majesty.

545
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,080
How dare you, audacious servant!

546
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,200
My fault.

547
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,560
My fault.

548
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,080
May Your Majesty forgive me!

549
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,140
What are you doing?

550
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,320
Your Majesty,

551
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,320
it's all my fault.

552
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,440
All my fault.

553
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,760
All my fault.

554
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,940
Your Majesty, please don’t be angry.

555
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,720
I'm asking you.

556
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,720
Why are you in such a panic?

557
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,520
Your Majesty,

558
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,180
Her Majesty instructed me

559
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,820
to get a new basin of water.

560
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,520
Your Majesty.

561
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,280
Your Majesty.

562
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,880
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

563
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,860
What are you doing?

564
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,440
Just painting.

565
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,080
Why did you have to shut the gate?

566
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
Rise and speak.

567
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,040
Your Majesty.

568
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,880
Actually,

569
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,800
we were secretly

570
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,680
preparing you

571
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,880
a birthday gift.

572
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,920
Birthday gift?

573
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,920
It's your birthday two months later.

574
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,120
I had thought to give you a surprise.

575
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,130
So I secretly invited Consort Chun to discuss it.

576
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,840
We thought and thought,

577
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,639
but didn't know what to give you.

578
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,840
At last, Consort Chun suggested

579
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,320
that I draw a scenery painting for you.

580
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,360
I’ve tried many pages.

581
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,760
They are not beautiful enough.

582
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,800
Yes.

583
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,610
I was too careless just now.

584
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,889
I splattered ink

585
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,480
all over Her Majesty.

586
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,760
I see.

587
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,800
Your Majesty, you're being too secretive.

588
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,960
Whatever you gift me,

589
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,400
I

590
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,910
will be happy with it.

591
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,160
Your Majesty,

592
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,840
your clothing is all wet?

593
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,680
Thanks to

594
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,210
your favorite palace maid.

595
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,200
Yingluo,

596
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,560
why were you so clumsy?

597
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,250
Beg forgiveness from His Majesty.

598
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,440
Yes.

599
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,560
It was my fault.

600
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,720
May Your Majesty forgive me.

601
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,120
Your Majesty,

602
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,040
she was too eager to help,

603
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,620
so she caused trouble.

604
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,810
If you have the leisure to be angry,

605
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,920
why not go and change?

606
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,120
Your Majesty.

607
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,720
Who allowed in?

608
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,600
Your Majesty,

609
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,960
Her Majesty told me

610
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,300
to make amends for my mistake.

611
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,360
No need.

612
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,850
Go out and kneel.

613
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,800
Yes.

614
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,680
Your Majesty,

615
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,440
why were you

616
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,320
so angry today?

617
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,320
Do you know

618
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,520
someone's spreading rumors in the Palace?

619
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,520
Rumors?

620
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,320
About what?

621
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,080
They say you and Consort Chun,

622
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,200
are too close

623
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,660
and that's unfitting.

624
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,480
Your Majesty,

625
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,200
did you believe

626
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,000
a rumor like that?

627
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,480
When I think about it,

628
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,410
it is indeed absurd.

629
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,840
I believed it too easily.

630
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,890
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

631
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,440
I will investigate

632
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,080
who spread it

633
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,260
and govern the rules of the Palace properly.

634
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
But Your Majesty,

635
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,010
you need to manage your close attendants too.

636
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,280
Your Majesty,

637
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,760
I think Yingluo

638
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,620
was just careless for the moment.

639
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,810
That girl is usually very prudent.

640
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,810
And very careful in her chores.

641
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,320
Don't you see something?

642
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,800
See what?

643
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,200
Earlier she ran into

644
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,640
my embrace on purpose.

645
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
It means what I said before was true.

646
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,250
That palace maid is trying to get promoted

647
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,480
relying on her little bit of beauty.

648
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,090
Trying to get promoted?

649
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,960
Your Majesty,

650
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,760
I know

651
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,000
this girl very well,

652
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,020
and I don’t think she’s like that.

653
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,730
I saw it with my own eyes.

654
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,600
Could that be wrong?

655
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,700
If I have not guessed it wrong,

656
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,360
she was trying to lure me.

657
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,440
Or she secretly loves me.

658
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,240
Or she is peacockish.

659
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
Whatever the reason,

660
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,400
she is clearly a cunning fox.

661
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,740
She’s here to seduce the emperor!

662
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,200
Look at her eyes.

663
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,760
Look at her smile.

664
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:14,800
She clearly...

665
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,730
Clearly you hold bias against her.

666
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,480
Because you misunderstand her,

667
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,080
every action and word of hers

668
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,040
are wrongly construed.

669
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,600
Forget it.

670
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,980
I will not argue this with you.

671
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,240
But one day,

672
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,160
you will come to know

673
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,220
what I said is true.

674
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,800
Wei Yingluo

675
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,370
wants to behold wealth.

676
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,850
She is calculating.

677
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,440
You must manage her well.

678
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,520
I got it.

679
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,530
Until next time, Your Majesty.

680
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,920
Shameless.

681
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,520
Shameless.

682
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,280
Yingluo,

683
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,800
you didn't know

684
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,730
what Consort Chun and I were doing.

685
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,770
Why did you rush back to warn us?

686
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,280
Rise and speak.

687
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,880
Yes.

688
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
I didn't know

689
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,240
what was happening

690
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,800
in the resting hall.

691
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,000
But since you shut doors

692
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,640
and acted low-key,

693
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,340
you didn't want others to know it.

694
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,560
So I

695
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,820
wagered my life to come back to alert you.

696
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,720
You knew nothing.

697
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,320
But you just guarded me?

698
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,880
Your Majesty,

699
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,410
you taught me to read and write and be upright.

700
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,560
You are a rare good person.

701
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,380
If you don't want to talk about it,

702
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,960
you have your reason.

703
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
My duty is

704
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,000
secure your secret,

705
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,530
instead of snooping it.

706
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,160
Show it to her.

707
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,840
This is…?

708
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
Since I gave birth to Second Prince,

709
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,090
the coldness in me has been spreading.

710
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,080
And since this winter,

711
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,530
it’s been getting more severe.

712
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,520
Every night, the pain pierces into my bones

713
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,280
and I am unable to fall asleep.

714
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,000
I’ll sweat all over.

715
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,360
I need to change

716
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,360
every hour.

717
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,560
So

718
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,880
Her Majesty invited me

719
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,740
to treat her by acupuncture here.

720
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,000
This matter isn't good for others to know,

721
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,120
but I didn't expect…

722
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,050
Didn’t expect people in the Palace

723
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,160
could be spreading such rumors

724
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,520
because of it.

725
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,920
It's absurd.

726
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,680
If His Majesty had burst in

727
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,050
and discovered our secret treatment,

728
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,330
the consequence

729
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,920
can't be imagined.

730
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,760
The women of the harem are valued by their heirs.

731
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,160
Think about it.

732
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,260
How could a woman weak to her bones

733
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,360
have children?

734
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,360
How can she manage the whole Palace?

735
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,720
So I don’t want

736
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,530
to trouble the Imperial Hospital.

737
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,290
I could only ask Consort Chun for help.

738
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,440
Yingluo,

739
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,920
from now on,

740
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,720
you and Erqing

741
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,320
will help me

742
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,040
guard Palace of Eternal Spring.

743
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,800
Yes.
