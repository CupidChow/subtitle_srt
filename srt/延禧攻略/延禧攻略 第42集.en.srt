[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 42]

3
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,890
Can you tell me the truth now?

4
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,509
Noble Consort Chun...

5
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,920
inserted those silver needles
into your body,

6
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,940
didn't she?

7
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,860
Ying Luo.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,660
For the past two years,
I've been serving at the Zhongcui Palace.

9
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,320
And Noble Consort Chun
had treated me very well,

10
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,560
especially in His Majesty's presence.

11
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,610
But three days ago,

12
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,280
I found out that the former supervisor
of Flame Department Wang Zhong...

13
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,230
is the lover of Yu Hu.

14
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,960
The oversight of
Flame Department eunuchs...

15
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,790
caused Jixiang jar to freeze.

16
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,650
And Seventh Prince died in the fire.

17
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,420
Wang Zhong get away with it...

18
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,270
because he wasn't on duty that night.

19
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,400
It's common for a eunuch
and a palace maid to become lovers.

20
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,120
Thus, I didn't think otherwise.

21
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,410
But Yu Hu felt guilty.

22
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,570
She reported it to
Noble Consort Chun at once.

23
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,270
From then on,

24
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,650
they've been treating me differently.

25
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,660
Let go of me...

26
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,640
They forced me to keep it a secret.

27
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,010
That's why I started to suspect...

28
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,320
that Noble Consort Chun...

29
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,740
is associated with Seventh Prince's death.

30
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,120
You found out about it.

31
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,920
But they didn't kill you immediately...

32
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,320
because there're many gossipmongers
in the Forbidden City.

33
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,130
If you die all of sudden,

34
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,160
surely His Majesty will suspect.

35
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,120
But they're afraid that
you'll reveal the secret.

36
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,290
Therefore,

37
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,940
they won't let you...

38
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,930
walk out of Yuanming Garden alive.

39
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,240
Ming Yu.

40
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,920
You're so silly.
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

41
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,290
I couldn't tell anyone.

42
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,720
Ying Luo.

43
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,760
I couldn't tell anyone.

44
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,269
Noble Consort Chun...

45
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,000
is now the most favored consort
in the Forbidden City.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
She is His Majesty's favourite.

47
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,720
I have no evidence
against Noble Consort Chun.

48
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,850
It's not a big deal if I lose my life.

49
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,180
I'm scared my family
will be dragged into it.

50
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,220
You're right.

51
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,540
If we don't have a shoo-in,

52
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,790
we can't act recklessly.

53
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,990
Ying Luo,

54
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,090
Her Majesty is gone.

55
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,210
If you commit a mistake,

56
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,230
no one will protect you.

57
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,800
Noble Consort Chun is high and mighty now.

58
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,060
We can't throw straws against the wind.

59
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,310
Yes.

60
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,830
No one will protect us.

61
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,640
In order to avenge Her Majesty's death,

62
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,780
we need to find ourselves backers first.

63
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,640
Fire!

64
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,850
I did not hurt Man.

65
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,490
If you don't believe me,

66
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,120
you can stab my heart...

67
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,870
with this dagger now.

68
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,590
Ying Luo,

69
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,060
I keep replaying...

70
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,760
everything you said to me...

71
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,990
every smile you gave me.

72
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,970
Even if you've been tricking me all along,

73
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,920
I won't believe it.

74
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,400
I'll wait for you to
give up your grudge...

75
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,710
and let go,

76
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,610
no matter how long it takes.

77
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,530
Even if it takes a lifetime,

78
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,610
I'll still wait for you.

79
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,590
Lower your arm.

80
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Focus on the bow.

81
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,810
Eyes over here.

82
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,120
Look straight ahead.

83
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,120
Try it.

84
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,590
Guard Solon.

85
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,680
Wait.

86
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,070
Lord Hai,

87
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,000
you have a lover
at Yuanming Garden as well?

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,890
How come!

89
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,320
If Miss Ming Yu finds out,

90
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,670
she will be sad!

91
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,240
I know, right?

92
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,980
Do you want to get flogged?

93
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,600
Keep on practicing.

94
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,930
Let's go on practicing.

95
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,720
Guard Solon.

96
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,580
Miss Ying Luo,

97
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,110
just call me Hailan Cha.

98
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,840
I came...

99
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,800
to ask for your help.

100
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,980
Sure.

101
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,280
I haven't said it.

102
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,000
Do you know what favor I'll ask of you?

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,520
Why did you say yes so quickly?

104
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,440
Before Fu Heng left, he asked me...

105
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,970
to help you with anything.

106
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,790
He's my best friend.

107
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,880
I trust whomever he trusts.

108
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,720
Go ahead. What can I do for you?

109
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,390
Brother!

110
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,390
Time to eat.

111
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,020
Okay!

112
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,320
Wow!

113
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,400
Wait, Ying Luo.

114
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,880
I'm usually the one
delivering food to you.

115
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,920
Why did you...

116
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,360
deliver food to me today?

117
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,600
Tell me.

118
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,310
Did you do something bad?

119
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,370
Brother.

120
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,010
I know you've been treating me well...

121
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,810
over these past two years.

122
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,310
What's wrong?

123
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,240
I succumbed to my conscience
and decided to be nice to you for once.

124
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,280
You don't like it?

125
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,340
-Ying Luo.
-Yes?

126
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,060
You've promised me that,

127
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,440
no matter how the outside world changes,

128
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,790
we'll always stay together
in the Yuanming Garden.

129
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,420
You've promised me that...

130
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,810
we'll never be apart.

131
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,220
You can't go back on your word.

132
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,600
The food's getting cold.

133
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Let's eat first.

134
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,850
Why are you staring at me like that?

135
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,390
Well,

136
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,030
the roof of my room is leaking.

137
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
I'm afraid there'll be a heavy rain.

138
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,180
Brother,

139
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,340
if you're free tomorrow,

140
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,390
repair it for me.

141
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,440
No problem.

142
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,030
I'll deal with it.

143
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,820
Look, Sister.
It's so beautiful over there.

144
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,390
Let's go.

145
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,480
Empress Dowager, you may release them.

146
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,670
Sure.

147
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,800
Let's go.

148
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,680
Namo Amitabha...

149
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,030
Namo Amitabha...

150
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
What's that?

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,840
Why is there a colourful bird
in the Yuanming Garden?

152
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,400
Sister, look.

153
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,520
The jaw of a swallow and
the beak of a chicken. It's colourful.

154
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,480
Could it be...

155
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,520
It's so strange.

156
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,080
Who raises these birds?

157
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,720
Empress Dowager is asking you all.

158
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,920
Who raises these birds?

159
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,620
Greetings, Empress Dowager,
Your Majesty, Empress,

160
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,240
and all the mistresses.

161
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,280
I took care of these birds...

162
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,840
before they're released.

163
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,630
Then tell me,

164
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,910
what's the name of this bird?

165
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,280
I've never seen it either.

166
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,150
I suppose...

167
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,530
it's a phoenix.

168
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,670
Utter nonsense.

169
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,240
Only common birds are raised
in the Yuanming Garden.

170
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,600
There's no phoenix here.

171
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,440
Empress Dowager, you've had
a mercy release ceremony...

172
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,830
on your birthday.

173
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,160
Such mercy has attracted...

174
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,730
the king of all birds.

175
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,070
God has shown this auspicious sign...

176
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,630
to compliment you on your merit.

177
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,800
The world is full of rarities.

178
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,120
Such an amusement is a first for me.

179
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,060
Emperor, do you think she's right?

180
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
Empress Dowager,

181
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,760
when the sky showed the auspicious sign
of five stars stringing together,

182
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,150
Emperor Kangxi didn't believe
such an illogical thing.

183
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,890
And he despised the fake auspicious signs.

184
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,930
However,

185
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,330
she did all this...

186
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,080
to make you happy.

187
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,410
You don't have to reward or punish her.

188
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,620
Empress Dowager,

189
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,220
His Majesty is right.

190
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,910
This palace maid...

191
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,120
must have coloured the bird beforehand...

192
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,360
and hid it inside the cage
to make you happy.

193
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,530
She's eager for a reward.

194
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,700
Wei Ying Luo, how dare you...

195
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,080
try to deceive His Majesty.

196
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,330
She just wanted to amuse Empress Dowager.

197
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,880
It's not as serious as you claimed.

198
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,360
Your Majesty,
you're merciful and forgiving.

199
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,800
However, this palace maid
was showing off...

200
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,560
and being flatterer before us all.

201
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,390
If everyone acts like her,

202
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,730
the palace will get out of hand.

203
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,220
Eunuchs,

204
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,240
take this palace maid away.

205
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Empress Dowager,

206
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,600
I have a way to prove it.

207
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,090
How do you prove that...

208
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,760
it's an auspicious sign from God?

209
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,960
It's your birthday.

210
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,080
And the phoenix shows itself.

211
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,120
Is it really an auspicious sign
from God...

212
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,060
or am I just trying to flatter you?

213
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,850
We'll know if we try it again.

214
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,280
What?

215
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:52,130
Are you going to use another fake sign
that you prepared beforehand?

216
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,000
Empress Dowager.

217
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,900
Don't let her trick you again.

218
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,290
All of us have been tricked
by a palace maid.

219
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,690
It's so ridiculous.

220
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,390
I think she should be taken away
and flogged for eighty times.

221
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,540
She'll eventually tell us the truth.

222
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,670
Empress Dowager.

223
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,580
This palace maid is trying to please you.

224
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,160
I'd like to plead for leniency.

225
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,780
Leniency?

226
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,760
In that case,

227
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,210
other servants will
mimic her flattery tricks.

228
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,720
None of them will ever
do their job diligently anymore.

229
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,420
Mistresses, you're overly worried.

230
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,700
There are many koi in the goldfish pond
of Yuanming Garden.

231
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,410
Why don't we verify God's will with them?

232
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,790
Let's see if I'm lying...

233
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,690
or it's indeed God's will.

234
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,670
Emperor.

235
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,110
Although it's my first time
hearing about auspicious signs,

236
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,350
I really want to know...

237
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,110
if God is touched by my kindness...

238
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,440
or...

239
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,190
this girl is lying.

240
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,619
Wei Ying Luo,

241
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,550
can you do it?

242
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,599
Since God is celebrating
Empress Dowager's birthday,

243
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,130
the auspicious sign
won't show for once only.

244
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,990
I'll verify God's will with my life.

245
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,500
Let's see if the auspicious sign
is real or not.

246
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,319
Empress Dowager,
since you want to verify it,

247
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,950
let's just take it as a game.

248
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,710
But we can't let her pick the koi.

249
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,570
How about I ask someone else to do it?

250
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,120
It'll be fair that way.

251
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,710
Sure.

252
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,540
Look, Empress Dowager.

253
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,520
It's obvious that she's lying.

254
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,250
The fishes have swam away...

255
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,990
and there's no auspicious sign at all.

256
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,920
How dare she...

257
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,810
make fun of Empress Dowager
in front of everyone.

258
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,190
She even did it twice.

259
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,080
How outrageous she is.

260
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,120
Your Majesty,

261
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,740
I think she should be punished severely.

262
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,220
We can't encourage flattery.

263
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,500
Wei Ying Luo,

264
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,200
all koi have swum away.

265
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,240
It's clear that your talk
about God's will is all a lie.

266
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,890
I can't defend you anymore.

267
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,210
Take her away now.

268
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,480
Look!

269
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,920
It's the word longevity.

270
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,270
You're right, Empress Dowager.

271
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,160
It's indeed the word longevity.

272
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,920
Such a rare auspicious sign
has appeared...

273
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,330
because God is touched by
Empress Dowager's mercy release.

274
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,930
May Empress Dowager be blessed with
a long and prosperous life!

275
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,040
An auspicious sign from God!
Congratulations, Empress Dowager...

276
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,550
Great...

277
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,840
Great...

278
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,860
It's an auspicious sign from God.

279
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,140
It means my years of devotion
to Buddha have paid off.

280
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,060
Everyone, get up now.

281
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,470
Get up now.

282
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,470
You're a good girl.

283
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,190
Tell me.

284
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,310
What do you want as a reward?

285
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,660
Empress Dowager.

286
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,230
I miss the Forbidden City very much.

287
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,980
I want to return there.

288
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,590
That simple?

289
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,470
Your merit has touched God.

290
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,480
I'd like...

291
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,480
to serve you, Empress Dowager.

292
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,420
No way.

293
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,440
This girl is clever and quick-witted.

294
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,560
I like her.

295
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,780
What's wrong with her serving me at
the Shoukang Palace?

296
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Empress Dowager,

297
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,200
she's glib-tongued and very tricky.

298
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,270
She's going to serve me, not you.

299
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,800
Her eloquence can amuse us all.

300
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,480
I feel bored.

301
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,130
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

302
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,920
Empress Dowager,

303
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,010
I don't want to disappoint you.

304
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,520
It's just that...

305
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,540
I intend to...

306
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,860
confer her the title of attendant.

307
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,680
[I won't let you get near
Empress Dowager.]

308
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,240
[Dream on.]

309
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,840
An attendant?

310
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,000
This Wei Ying Luo is a palace maid.

311
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,920
She's a former servant of
Imperial Household Department.

312
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,520
She should feel honoured
to be conferred the title of attendant.

313
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,320
She's smart and quick-witted.

314
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,400
She spent so much effort trying to
cheer me up on my birthday.

315
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,410
And she's pretty.

316
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,070
I don't think...

317
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,920
it's fair to make her an attendant.

318
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,920
She should be conferred
the title of noble lady.

319
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,340
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

320
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,310
Noble Lady Wei,

321
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,360
get up now.

322
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,320
Yes.

323
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,960
Come here.

324
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,350
Good girl.

325
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,720
You'll be blessed in future.

326
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,620
I'd like...

327
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,800
to request for another thing.

328
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,870
Wei Ying Luo,

329
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,680
don't go too far.

330
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,090
Empress Dowager,

331
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,560
am I asking for too much?

332
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,230
Tell me first.

333
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,430
Your Highness,

334
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,640
Ming Yu and I used to serve together
at the Changchun Palace.

335
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,280
We're very close and hard to be apart.

336
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,040
Your Highness, please be merciful...

337
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,310
and allow Ming Yu to keep me company.

338
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,190
Noble Lady Wei,

339
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
you've just been made an noble lady.

340
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,520
And now you're asking Her Highness
to give you her maid.

341
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,540
It seems in defiance of the rules.

342
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,880
I miss my old friend.

343
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,260
If Your Highness can't let her go,

344
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,390
I'll make another wish.

345
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,430
Enough.

346
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,370
It's just a palace maid.

347
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,010
Since she wants the maid,
just give her to her.

348
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,550
Yes.

349
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,880
I, your servant...

350
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,720
No.

351
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,160
I, your concubine,
thank you, Your Majesty.

352
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,210
Empress Dowager,

353
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,290
there's a fire show at the mountain.

354
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,970
Let's go see the show first.

355
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,430
Sure.

356
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,440
Join us.

357
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Yes.

358
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,270
Ying Luo,

359
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,940
are you doing this for my sake?

360
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,350
Ming Yu.

361
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,040
I was a palace maid.

362
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,650
And now I'm a noble lady.

363
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,120
I've climbed up the ladder.

364
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,500
You should be happy for me.

365
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,490
-But...
-Save yourself the worry.

366
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,600
Hurry and pack up.

367
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,200
Wei Ying Luo,

368
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,200
I want to talk to you.

369
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,390
Ying Luo,

370
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,910
I'll leave you two to it.

371
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Why?

372
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,040
What do you mean?

373
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,370
You promised me...

374
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,100
that you'd stay with me here forever.

375
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,460
Why did you become
Hong Li's noble lady instead?

376
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,470
Brother,

377
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,670
aren't you eager to get promoted?

378
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,080
From now on,

379
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,930
we don't have to suffer here anymore.

380
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,280
Let's go back to the Forbidden City
and be our own masters.

381
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Isn't that great?

382
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,920
Furthermore, I was only trying
to gain Empress Dowager's favor.

383
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,120
I never thought I'd become a noble lady.

384
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,360
It's unexpected.

385
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,920
You can fool anyone...

386
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,150
but not me.

387
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,040
Wei Ying Luo,

388
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,820
Hong Li is very suspicious of you.

389
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,000
He always thinks you're
harboring ulterior motives.

390
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,660
He wouldn't have let you
serve Empress Dowager.

391
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,300
But you earned Empress Dowager's favor.

392
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,010
For him,

393
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,960
the most proper way to deflect you
is to keep you by his side.

394
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,920
Ying Luo,

395
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,520
you had it all planned out, right?

396
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,440
You'd figured it out.

397
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,120
You're afraid that I'd stop you.

398
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,600
That's why you lured me away on purpose.

399
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,550
Am I right?

400
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,770
Yes.

401
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,320
I did so on purpose.

402
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,560
Because I don't want to stay here anymore!

403
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,160
And I don't want to be
a palace maid forever!

404
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,760
I won't let you go...

405
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,480
Brother.

406
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,680
Ying Luo, listen to me.

407
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,170
It's not that...

408
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,090
I don't want you to get married.

409
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,870
You can marry anyone.

410
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,640
Not only will I not object,

411
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,480
I'll help you with your wedding
and give you dowry.

412
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,890
Anyone except Hong Li.

413
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,600
You can't marry him!

414
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,630
-Why not?
-There's no reason!

415
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,120
You can't marry him!

416
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,010
Brother.

417
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,760
Me becoming a noble lady...

418
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,210
will only benefit you.

419
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,070
Tell me.

420
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,850
Why do you object to it?

421
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,900
Ying Luo,

422
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,320
I'm begging you.

423
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm begging you.

424
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,410
Can I defy the royal decree?

425
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
No problem!

426
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,080
There's fresh produce delivered into
and out of the Yuanming Garden every day.

427
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,450
If we plan ahead,

428
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,400
we'll escape from here for sure.

429
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,780
Ying Luo, I don't want anything else.

430
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,240
I ask for nothing.

431
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,160
I just want us to leave here safely.

432
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,360
Let's go together, okay?

433
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,240
Brother.

434
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,480
You've lost your mind.

435
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,150
Wei Ying Luo,

436
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
think about it.

437
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,560
If you go to Hong Li,

438
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,880
you'll break your promise to me.

439
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,290
And I never forgive...

440
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,890
a traitor.

441
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,160
Are we really parting ways?

442
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,850
Brother,

443
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,730
I'm sorry.

444
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,300
Fine.

445
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,080
Fine.

446
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,550
Wei Ying Luo, remember this day.

447
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,170
You broke the promise first.

448
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,240
From now on,

449
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,160
You go your way...

450
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,450
and I'll go mine.

451
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,360
It's over...

452
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,490
between us.

453
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,240
Brother.

454
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,250
Brother.

455
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,410
[Why do you see His Majesty...]

456
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,070
[as your enemy?]

457
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,250
Why?

458
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,240
You're born with everything.

459
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,870
I was born with nothing.

460
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,530
You own so many things.

461
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,050
And now you've seized
the only thing I have!

462
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,690
God, you're so unfair!

463
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,760
You're unfair!

464
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,190
Wei Ying Luo.

465
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,710
You betrayed me today.

466
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,280
Don't blame me...

467
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,870
for my retaliation in future.

468
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,800
From now on,

469
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,210
you go your way...

470
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,870
and I'll go mine.

471
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,220
Supervisor Li, why are you here?

472
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,590
Noble Lady Wei, His Majesty
summons you to serve him tonight.

473
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,240
Tonight?

474
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,340
Noble Lady Wei,

475
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,800
this is a great blessing.

476
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,880
You must be well-prepared for it.

477
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,950
Both of you will help
Noble Lady Wei dress up.

478
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,590
Ying Luo.

479
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,770
Can't you figure out a way
to avoid it tonight?

480
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,680
I'm His Majesty's new noble lady.
And he asked me to serve him tonight.

481
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,310
It's completely natural.

482
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,170
How can I avoid it?

483
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,720
Since His Majesty wants you
to serve him tonight,

484
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,440
he should arrange it
at the Jiuzhou Qingyan Palace.

485
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,320
That's where His Majesty resides
when he visits the Yuanming Garden.

486
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,600
Why would he choose
the Celestial Changchun Palace?

487
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,710
That's the late empress' residence.

488
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,820
I'm sure he's harboring
some ulterior motive.

489
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,090
Maybe...

490
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,120
he'll pick on you tonight.

491
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,820
Even if he's up to something,

492
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,960
I must go.

493
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,460
If not, I'd defy the royal decree.

494
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,400
Ying Luo,

495
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,910
it's all my fault.

496
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,390
If I had said nothing,

497
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,340
you'd be living peacefully
in the Yuanming Garden.

498
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,560
If trouble doesn't look for me,

499
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,000
I don't look for it.

500
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,520
If it looks for me,

501
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,600
I'm not afraid.

502
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,420
Life is all about
finding suitable solutions...

503
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,000
to the troubles that get in your way.

504
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,640
If you're always worried and scared,

505
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,840
it's no fun living.

506
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:49,110
[Celestial Changchun Palace]

507
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,920
His Majesty is busy with state affairs.

508
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,980
Noble Lady Wei, please wait a moment.

509
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,140
Sure.

510
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Your Majesty,

511
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,250
Noble Lady Wei has been waiting in
the cold wind for more than two hours.

512
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,610
Is it time...

513
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,530
to summon her in now?

514
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,710
Noble Lady Wei, what are you doing?

515
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,590
It's too rude.

516
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,000
Ming Yu,

517
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,850
I find this snack a bit hard.

518
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,120
Did you not add enough water?

519
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,650
I'll remember to add more water next time.

520
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,460
It's...

521
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,550
Ying Luo,

522
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,510
will it work?

523
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,910
Will His Majesty get furious?

524
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,670
Let's just wait and see...

525
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,230
if it works.

526
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,840
Ask her to come in.

527
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,000
Yes.

528
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,820
Greetings, Your Majesty.

529
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Wei Ying Luo,

530
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,980
How dare you.

531
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,100
Your Majesty, you summoned me
to serve you tonight.

532
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,230
I obeyed and came.

533
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,800
But waiting in the cold wind
makes one fall sick.

534
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,850
How can a sick person serve you?

535
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,370
I did so to protect myself...

536
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,040
as well as Your Majesty.

537
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,160
If not, others would think...

538
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,240
you're mean to your concubines.

539
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,410
It'd damage your reputation.

540
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,810
Do you know where this is?

541
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,490
The late empress' residence
in the Yuanming Garden.

542
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,310
Why did I summon you here?

543
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,990
Your Majesty is shaming me.

544
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,070
No.

545
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,860
I want the late empress to see...

546
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,680
how the one she favored before...

547
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,250
betrays her...

548
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,000
for wealth and status.

549
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,290
Since Your Majesty
has no intention to be served,

550
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,760
I shall take my leave.

551
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,800
Stop right there.

552
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,300
What else can I do for you, Your Majesty?

553
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,570
Isn't it your turn to serve me tonight?

554
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,360
Where are you going?

555
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:32,890
Get over here.

556
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,480
Are you waiting for me...

557
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,430
to undress you?

558
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,520
You...

559
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,250
Your Majesty,

560
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,520
for you,

561
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,530
the late empress is long gone.

562
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,320
But for me,

563
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,340
Her Majesty wasn't just my mistress.

564
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,690
She's my teacher...

565
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,250
and sister.

566
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,670
Hence,

567
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,570
I'll mourn for her
for twenty-seven months.

568
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,040
And I'm not done with it yet.

569
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,680
Even if it's your order,

570
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,560
I dare not serve you tonight.

571
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,750
Since you're mourning,

572
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,150
why are you here?

573
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,900
In your eye,

574
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,420
I'm merely a glutton
for wealth and status.

575
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,520
There's nothing to explain.

576
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,440
As days go by,

577
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,840
Your Majesty will find out
what kind of person I am.

578
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,920
But I do know that...

579
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,260
defying a royal decree...

580
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,770
is punishable by death.

581
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,960
Thus, I came to express
my intention to you.

582
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,420
If His Majesty insists on blaming me,

583
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,490
I'm willing to receive all punishments.

584
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,050
Take you leave.

585
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,330
Thank you, Your Majesty.

586
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,070
You're bold enough...

587
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,000
to treat His Majesty that way.

588
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,120
You risked your life
to refuse to serve him...

589
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,250
by wearing the mourning clothing.

590
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,910
You still miss Her Majesty, don't you?

591
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,640
You're so good to her.

592
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,140
You're such a fool.

593
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,750
Did I say anything wrong?

594
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,920
One respects another...

595
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,080
from the bottom of his heart.

596
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,520
He doesn't make a show of it.

597
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,660
That's meaningless to the deceased.

598
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,010
I'm now a noble lady.

599
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,870
If I insist on preserving my chastity,

600
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,760
that's being hypocritical.

601
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,560
But I had to do so today.

602
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,560
If I had really served him tonight,

603
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,200
he would've seen me...

604
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,030
as an ingrate woman...

605
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,560
who ignored the mistress' grace

606
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,210
and served him...

607
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,560
shamelessly at her residence.

608
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
Hence,

609
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,620
even if it meant infuriating His Majesty,

610
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,040
I wouldn't serve him tonight.

611
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,810
-Ying Luo.
-I'm now a noble lady.

612
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,330
But this is just the beginning.

613
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,320
But it took Noble Consort Chun years...

614
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,580
to gain her current position.

615
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,280
We'll wait and see then.

616
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,630
You're the one guarding the back lake.

617
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,390
If Wei Ying Luo wanted trick us,

618
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,240
you would know beforehand.

619
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,640
If you don't confess now,

620
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,560
leave the Forbidden City.

621
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,840
Your Majesty,

622
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,760
Ying Luo didn't mean to keep it from you.

623
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
She said...

624
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,760
you're very observant.

625
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,780
Surely you'll find out the truth.

626
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,060
She told me to report the truth to you.

627
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,750
Stop flattering me.

628
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Tell me.

629
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,720
The phoenix could be faked.

630
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,550
What about the word longevity?

631
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,120
Miss Ying Luo asked me to...

632
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,840
get her eighty nets
used for catching cicada...

633
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,760
and put in the buns
covered with fish baits.

634
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,060
I then dispatched several guards
who are good at swimming...

635
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,520
to dive to the bottom of the lake...

636
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,010
and stick the poles into the silt.

637
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,110
The koi would be lured to the food.

638
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,410
Eighty dots...

639
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,930
were linked into lines,

640
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,760
forming the word longevity.

641
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,390
She's so tricky.

642
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,630
Your Majesty,

643
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,120
Miss Ying Luo said...

644
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,000
you painstakingly prepared
for the birthday celebration...

645
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,690
to cheer Empress Dowager up.

646
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,520
Her goal was the same.

647
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,160
As long as Empress Dowager was happy,

648
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,190
it worth her effort.

649
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,610
Take your leave.

650
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,760
Yes.

651
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,560
Keep this in mind. From now on,

652
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,080
she's my Noble Lady Wei.

653
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,880
Don't ever address her as that again.
