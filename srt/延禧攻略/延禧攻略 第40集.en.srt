[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 40]

3
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
Your Majesty,

4
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,480
Her Majesty has lost her mind...

5
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,840
because of extreme grief.

6
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,639
Please do not get near her.

7
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,220
It's me,

8
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,870
Your Majesty.

9
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,160
Our Yong Cong is gone.

10
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,450
You must pull yourself together,

11
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,700
okay?

12
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,660
No!

13
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,800
Yong Cong!

14
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,400
Your Majesty!

15
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,520
Yong Cong!

16
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,950
Yong Cong!

17
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,070
Your Majesty!

18
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,520
Yong Cong...

19
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,250
Empress!

20
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,980
It's you.

21
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,770
You make me lose Yong Cong.

22
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,400
Give him back to me...

23
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,880
He is dead.

24
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,720
Empress.

25
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,760
Yong Cong is dead.

26
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,250
Pull yourself together.

27
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,270
Don't lose your demeanor.

28
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,560
Don't forget...

29
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,980
who you are.

30
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,460
Who am I?

31
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,320
Your Majesty,

32
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,300
tell me...

33
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,270
who I am.

34
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,210
You're my wife...

35
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,340
and the Empress of the Great Qing,
a motherly model of the nation.

36
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,680
Right.

37
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,800
I'm the Empress of the Great Qing.

38
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,300
Since the day I got conferred that title,

39
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,680
I attend to Empress Dowager,

40
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,140
respect Your Majesty and...

41
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,780
treat the concubines nicely.

42
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,940
I always do things in a cautious manner.

43
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,030
I was afraid to make any mistakes...

44
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,550
and be criticised by the people.

45
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,640
I'm virtuous and of good morals.

46
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,280
I'm afraid of getting spurned
by Your Majesty.

47
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,630
I don't bear grudges,

48
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,320
get jealous...

49
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,440
nor hate anyone.

50
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,940
On Your Majesty's behalf,

51
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,880
I protected your concubines...

52
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,530
and even treat their children

53
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,270
as my own.

54
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,850
But Your Majesty,

55
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,740
what did I get?

56
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,600
Yesterday is...

57
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,660
New Year's Eve,

58
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,390
the day of family reunions.

59
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,270
But I lost Yong Cong on such a day.

60
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,460
I risked my life to give birth to him.

61
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,100
He was the person
I love most in this world.

62
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,770
Why?

63
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,090
Why?

64
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,270
All my life,

65
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,710
I have never done...

66
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,770
anything evil.

67
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,760
Why did I end up in this state?

68
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,870
Why, Your Majesty?

69
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,040
Empress.

70
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,720
You're tired.

71
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,260
Your Majesty,

72
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,060
even you can't give me an answer?

73
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,240
You don't have an answer too.

74
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,390
Am I right?

75
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,390
Don't mind me anymore then.

76
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,680
Where are you going?

77
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,340
-Let me go!
-You need rest.

78
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,080
-Let me...
-You'll be fine after you wake up!

79
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,140
-Let me...
-Everything will be fine!

80
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,730
I'm going to look for my son!

81
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,400
-I'm going to look for my son!
-Calm down!

82
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,520
-Your Majesty!
-I don't want to be an Empress!

83
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,960
-Let go of me!
-Rong Yin...

84
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,500
I want to look for my son!

85
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,680
-Rong Yin!
-Let me go see Yong Cong.

86
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,480
Your Majesty, I beg you.

87
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,310
Let me go.

88
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,310
I don't want anything.

89
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,360
-Let me go.
-Rong Yin!

90
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,200
-Let go of me!
-Hand me a rope!

91
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,080
Let go of me.

92
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,990
I don't want anything!

93
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,430
Bring me a rope!

94
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,670
Let me go. I beg you.

95
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,660
Rong Yin,

96
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,190
you are my Empress,

97
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:35,390
my wife.

98
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,370
You don't have the right to be unruly.

99
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,850
It is impossible for you
to give up halfway.

100
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,290
Even if you get sick...

101
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,060
or go insane,

102
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,800
you must always remember...

103
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,610
your responsibilities.

104
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,470
Responsibilities?

105
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,860
In my life,

106
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,350
all that remain are responsibilities.

107
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,010
From now on,

108
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,470
you must stay by her side and...

109
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,920
take good care of her. Understand?

110
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
Yes.

111
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,430
Your Majesty,

112
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,720
funeral arrangements for
Seventh Prince have been made.

113
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,560
Your Majesty!

114
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,520
I will handle the funeral myself.

115
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,650
Your Majesty,

116
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,860
this is against the rules.

117
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,330
My words are rules.

118
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,970
Then should I order someone to inform...

119
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,720
Empress Dowager?

120
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,070
She also loved Yong Cong a lot.

121
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,780
I will inform her...

122
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,630
the news myself.

123
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,660
Yes.

124
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,410
Your Majesty! Urgent news!

125
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,720
Viceroy Zhang Guang Si of Chuanshan
sent an urgent military report.

126
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,040
It says the Greater Jinchuan's Tusi,
Slob Dpon...

127
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,300
is invading other kingdoms
like Kingdom of Chakla.

128
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,230
He intends to conquer the vassals.

129
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,690
Are you blind?

130
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,360
Seventh Prince just died.

131
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,470
How could His Majesty
be in the mood for that?

132
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,020
-Leave now.
-Yes.

133
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,140
Wait!

134
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,200
Summon Prince He...

135
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,830
to handle the funeral of Yong Cong.

136
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,520
Summon military ministers...

137
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,200
to Yangxin Hall for a meeting.

138
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Yes.

139
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,120
Yes.

140
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Young Mistress,

141
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,150
what's going on?

142
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,030
Why did Young Master
put you under house arrest?

143
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,620
Where did Fu Heng go?

144
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,640
An urgent military report
reached the palace today.

145
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,670
Young Master was summoned there.

146
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,080
At this time,

147
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,420
he probably is in Yangxin Hall.

148
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,570
Her Majesty just lost Seventh Prince.

149
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,920
His Majesty is his father...

150
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,970
and Fu Heng is his biological uncle.

151
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,420
Both of them are not by her side.

152
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,310
Men...

153
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,860
are so cruel.

154
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,150
Old Mistress fainted from crying...

155
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,510
after hearing the news today.

156
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm sister-in-law of Her Majesty.

157
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,150
I should visit her
on behalf of my mother-in-law.

158
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,830
But Young Master won't let you out.

159
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,620
If he doesn't let me out,

160
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,760
can't I go out anymore?

161
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,210
But...

162
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,820
I'm pregnant.

163
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,870
My body is very delicate.

164
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,380
While he's not around,

165
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,630
let's see who dares to stop me.

166
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,990
-Where is Fu Heng?
-Your Majesty,

167
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,770
Lord Fu hasn't arrived yet.

168
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,010
Greetings, Your Majesty.

169
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,160
Where did you go?

170
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,670
Your Majesty,

171
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,410
I went to Changchun Palace
to visit Her Majesty.

172
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,000
Just follow what we've discussed.

173
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,180
Order Ne Qin to be the commander
and provide reinforcement.

174
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,510
All of you can leave now.

175
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,860
I'm taking my leave.

176
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,140
Fu Heng, stay here.

177
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,360
I summoned you to discuss state affairs,

178
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,220
but you went to Changchun Palace.

179
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,370
How dare you do that?

180
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,790
Your Majesty,

181
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,500
Her Majesty is gravely ill.

182
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,120
Please be merciful...

183
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,910
and allow Her Majesty
to leave the palace to recuperate.

184
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,490
She should stay in the Forbidden Palace...

185
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,330
for recovery.

186
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,900
Your Majesty,

187
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,200
Her Majesty suffered extreme grief
after losing two sons successively.

188
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,610
She is now on the verge of collapse.

189
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,260
If she continues to stay here,

190
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,650
I fear that she might really go crazy.

191
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,620
Go crazy?

192
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,610
Go crazy?

193
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,650
Fu Heng,

194
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,390
you were promoted to a post in
the Grand Council from an Imperial Guard.

195
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,960
Your progression in the ranks was
so fast that much discontent was incurred.

196
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,520
Why did I promote you?

197
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,800
Because I recognise your ability,

198
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,560
and thus I regard you as
an important high official.

199
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,760
But today, you disappoint me so much.

200
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,690
Your Majesty,

201
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,450
I'm willing to give up all what I own...

202
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,240
in exchange for
my sister's safety and happiness.

203
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,650
Exchange?

204
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,500
What do you use?

205
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,080
Everything that you own was given by me.

206
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,900
I can take them back anytime.

207
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,290
Your Majesty can take them back.

208
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,450
I won't resist.

209
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,870
Fu Heng.

210
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,760
You don't care about power, status,

211
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,650
fame nor wealth.

212
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,030
You may find yourself
gracious and righteous.

213
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,720
But do you know...

214
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,200
people living near the border
are suffering extreme misery...

215
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,640
because of wars that Slob Dpon
started in Greater Jinchuan?

216
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,720
But...

217
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,600
your mind is occupied by your sister...

218
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,320
and your family.

219
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,980
Your Majesty,

220
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,430
I couldn't bear…

221
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,510
Couldn't bear?

222
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,440
A great man...

223
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,350
has the nation and its citizens
on his shoulders.

224
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,330
What can't you endure?

225
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,940
What can't you abandon?

226
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,540
Let me tell you.

227
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,800
Even if the person
who died today isn't Yong Cong...

228
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,020
but the Empress...

229
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,500
or...

230
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,480
even all the women of the palace,

231
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,880
I would attend morning meetings as usual.

232
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,250
Because I'm the Emperor,

233
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,600
the ruler of the Great Qing,

234
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,160
the ruler of a nation.

235
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,580
I gave you wealth, status and power.

236
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,090
You need to repay me
with loyalty and sacrifices.

237
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,600
When necessary,

238
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,790
you must go to the front,

239
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,200
fight for the people...

240
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,760
and sacrifice your life
for the Great Qing.

241
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,290
Responsibilities must...

242
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,780
be fulfilled.

243
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,200
That is applicable to me, you...

244
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,410
and everyone else.

245
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,849
Hence,

246
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,329
your sister can never leave the palace.

247
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,089
Even after her death,

248
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,349
she'll remain as the Empress
of the Great Qing.

249
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,090
Do you understand?

250
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,610
Yes,

251
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,940
I do.

252
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,730
Er Qing, why are you here?

253
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,280
I took my Mother's visiting request.

254
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,180
I went to greet Empress Dowager first...

255
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,090
and then came over to visit Her Majesty.

256
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,770
Her Majesty doesn't want
to see anyone right now.

257
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,350
I know.

258
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,370
But the longer she's alone,

259
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,980
the more anxious...

260
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,870
she will be.

261
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,190
Please let me in to talk with Her Majesty.

262
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,320
But...

263
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,760
I knew Her Majesty best in the past.

264
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,360
Now, I'm a daughter-in-law
of the Fuca family.

265
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,240
It's my duty to ease
the anxiety of Her Majesty.

266
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,260
Ming Yu, please let me in.

267
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,980
Even if I'm unable
to cheer Her Majesty up,

268
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,910
I can offer a little comfort to her.

269
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Okay.

270
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,720
Go in.

271
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,860
Zhen Zhu!

272
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,680
Zhen Zhu!

273
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,130
Ying Luo said that
she'll be back before sunset.

274
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,980
Go to the palace gate to check.

275
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,880
Yes.

276
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,670
Does Her Majesty feels better now?

277
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,390
After talking with her,

278
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,800
of course.

279
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,230
I fear that she might
think of committing suicide.

280
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,290
Don't worry.

281
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,760
Her Majesty is magnanimous.

282
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,410
She will surely cheer up.

283
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,740
It's getting late.

284
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,210
I must leave before
the palace gate is closed.

285
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,180
Please take good care of Her Majesty.

286
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,850
Hu Po!

287
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,480
Escort Young Mistress to the palace.

288
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,490
Yes.

289
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,700
Ming Yu.

290
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,990
Your Majesty.

291
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,720
I'm hungry.

292
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,820
I want to eat something.

293
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,480
I'll go instruct the kitchen to prepare.

294
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,120
I want to eat glutinous rice cake
made by you.

295
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,830
Your Majesty, if I make it now,
it will take a long time.

296
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,980
You haven't taken anything all day.

297
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,440
I'll ask them to cook some
barley congee first, okay?

298
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,570
It's fine.

299
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,180
Go now.

300
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,250
-I can wait.
-Okay. I'll go right away.

301
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,200
Have a good rest, Her Majesty.

302
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,590
Ming Yu.

303
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,110
Is Ying Luo back?

304
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,370
Not yet.

305
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,180
Okay.

306
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,030
Go now.

307
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,450
[I've made countless mistakes in my life.]

308
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,490
[I was born in the Fuca family...]

309
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,930
[and yearned for freedom.]

310
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,000
[But I married into
the imperial family...]

311
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,400
[and became the Empress
of the Great Qing.]

312
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,640
[That was my first mistake.]

313
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,040
[I became an example
of the imperial harem...]

314
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,770
[by obeying all rules and restrictions,]

315
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,350
[but I still yearn my past life...]

316
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,410
[and failed to be rational.]

317
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,620
[That was my second mistake.]

318
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
[I failed to stay true to myself...]

319
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,120
[and live for myself,]

320
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,270
[but I longed for love...]

321
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,440
[of His Majesty.]

322
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,220
[That was my third mistake.]

323
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,650
[I gave birth to Yong Lian and Yong Cong,]

324
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,450
[but I couldn't protect them...]

325
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,110
[and lost both of them.]

326
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,290
[I am not qualified to be a mother.]

327
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,080
[That was my fourth mistake.]

328
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,440
[The world is merciless.]

329
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,760
[demanding strict compliance
to ritual propriety.]

330
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,720
[Yet I delude myself to think
the Emperor is affectionate.]

331
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,380
[I was ignorant about evil souls.]

332
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,460
[The universal morality is cruel.]

333
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,800
[I suffered betrayals again and again.]

334
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,010
[One wrong decision...]

335
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,160
[led to another.]

336
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,820
[Your Majesty, you are right.]

337
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,970
[I am not a good Empress.]

338
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,790
[I'm sorry,]

339
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,000
[Ying Luo.]

340
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,620
[I promised to wait for your return.]

341
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,180
[Regrettably,]

342
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,060
[I can no longer wait.]

343
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,720
[Yet,]

344
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,060
[you should be happy for me.]

345
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,580
[From now on,]

346
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,140
[I will no longer be the Empress.]

347
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,970
[I'll only be Fuca Rong Yin.]

348
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,030
[I am...]

349
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,470
[only Fuca Rong Yin.]

350
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,240
This is the death knell.

351
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,840
What happened in the palace?

352
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,370
Her Majesty departed!

353
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,290
Her Majesty departed!

354
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,420
Her Majesty departed!

355
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,740
Her Majesty departed!

356
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,340
[Changchun Palace]

357
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,120
[Changchun Palace]

358
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,560
[Rule the imperial harem with virtue]

359
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,050
Why did you return so late?

360
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,430
Seventh Prince died unfortunately...

361
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,470
in a big fire in Changchun Palace.

362
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,740
Her Majesty jumped
from the top of turret...

363
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,260
in extreme grief.

364
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,350
Wei Ying Luo,

365
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,570
why are you late by a day?

366
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,580
Why are you late?

367
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,720
No.

368
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,780
No!

369
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,490
The face of Her Majesty
is stained with blood.

370
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,780
Don't look.

371
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

372
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,670
Make the Empress look presentable.

373
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,870
Dress her up.

374
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,080
I want her to leave
with grace and dignity.

375
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,120
Yes.

376
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,860
Your Majesty,

377
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,540
I will clean up the blood stains.

378
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,730
But Her Majesty
chose to give up jewellery.

379
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,640
Please allow her...

380
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,760
to not wear them.

381
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,030
As an Empress,

382
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,050
she can't leave unadorned.

383
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,420
Your Majesty,

384
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,450
if Her Majesty really cared about honour,

385
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,040
she wouldn't...

386
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,610
jump to her death.

387
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,920
Ying Luo,

388
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,930
are you crazy?

389
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,840
May Your Majesty be gracious...

390
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,960
and allow Her Majesty...

391
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,330
to leave without burden.

392
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,620
Ming Yu, dress up the Empress.

393
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,770
Your Majesty.

394
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,970
She will always be my Empress.

395
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,540
She couldn't be carefree...

396
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,240
nor lighthearted.

397
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,820
That is her fate.

398
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,620
Your Majesty said those words coldly.

399
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,960
Do you blame Her Majesty
for committing a serious offense...

400
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,030
by committing suicide?

401
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,030
As an Empress,

402
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,880
she shouldn't be so cowardly...

403
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,000
and incapable.

404
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
I...

405
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,970
will never forgive her.

406
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,030
Your Majesty,

407
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,430
with abnormally low body temperature...

408
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,650
and unbearable bone pain,

409
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,450
she risked her life
to give birth to Seventh Prince.

410
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,810
Many said she did so
to secure her Empress position.

411
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,880
That is not true.

412
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,700
Her Majesty knew very well...

413
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,850
that Your Majesty wanted
a legitimate son to succeed the throne.

414
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,000
To meet Your Majesty's need,

415
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,230
she was willing to sacrifice...

416
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,850
at the expense of her life.

417
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,950
But in the end,

418
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,330
she lost her son...

419
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,440
on New Year's Eve,

420
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,500
suffering extreme pain.

421
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,060
Your Majesty.

422
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,990
Had you ever heard
Her Majesty's cry of despair...

423
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,870
when you sit in Yangxin Hall daily?

424
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,070
She was waiting for you to rescue her.

425
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,790
Ying Luo,

426
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,640
stop talking.

427
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,090
Why not?

428
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,290
Her Majesty loved Your Majesty sincerely.

429
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,760
She treated everyone
in the imperial harem sincerely.

430
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,330
But her sincerity
earned her your oversight...

431
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,740
and the schemes of other concubines.

432
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,800
Many said Her Majesty was silly.

433
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,880
No.

434
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,410
She wasn't silly at all.

435
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,980
Her Majesty was innately clever.

436
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,600
She was the most
kind-hearted person on earth.

437
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,520
She just couldn't bear...

438
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,600
She couldn't bear
to hurt other concubines.

439
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,510
And she couldn't bear
to hurt Your Majesty's feelings.

440
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,020
But Your Majesty,

441
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,970
why can't you...

442
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,000
give her a little compassion...

443
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,090
and love?

444
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,860
Why are you so cold?

445
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,580
Is your heart made of ice?

446
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,199
Li Yu.

447
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,409
I am here.

448
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:47,929
Wei Ying Luo has been offensive...

449
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,800
and rebellious repeatedly.

450
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,320
Grant her suicide...

451
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,179
and have her buried with the Empress.

452
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,440
Your Majesty.

453
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,400
Your Majesty, please have mercy on her.

454
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,040
Ying Luo.

455
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,120
Beg His Majesty now.

456
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,960
Ying Luo.

457
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,810
-Guards.
- Your Majesty,

458
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,840
please have mercy on her.

459
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,080
I...

460
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,540
am willing to serve
Her Majesty all my life.

461
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,760
Thank you for Your Majesty's grace.

462
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,180
Her Majesty wouldn't want you to do so.

463
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,120
Beg His Majesty.

464
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,590
Ying Luo.

465
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,050
Ying Luo.

466
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,400
Ying Luo!

467
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,470
Your Majesty.

468
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,160
Her Majesty was very fond of Ying Luo.

469
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,360
You can't do that.

470
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:46,830
It's because she is
the Empress's favorite servant...

471
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,470
that I decide to send her
to accompany Her Majesty.

472
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,770
Continue to dress up the Empress.

473
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,580
Miss Ming Yu,

474
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,430
do it now.

475
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,650
Her Majesty would not agree with that.

476
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
She was so kind.

477
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,700
She wanted Ying Luo to be happy.

478
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,650
Your Majesty,

479
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,500
you don't understand Her Majesty.

480
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,620
Not at all.

481
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,460
Miss Ying Luo,

482
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,450
it is on the account of
your loyalty to Her Majesty...

483
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,920
that you get such preferential treatment.

484
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,320
For others,

485
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,390
it's just a rope.

486
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,120
But you can choose either one.

487
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,350
Wei Ying Luo.

488
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,560
Wei Ying Luo!

489
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,490
His Majesty has spared you.
You don't have to die.

490
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,810
Her Majesty left a will...

491
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,800
to save your life.

492
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,210
[Your Majesty,]

493
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,860
[we will part forever after I pass away.]

494
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,520
[My servant, Ying Luo,]

495
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,060
[is unbending...]

496
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,850
[and forthright,]

497
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,880
[unsuitable to stay
in the imperial palace.]

498
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,270
[May Your Majesty allow her to leave
the palace and regain freedom.]

499
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,480
[Best regards.]

500
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,760
[Fuca Rong Yin.]

501
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,960
She only mentioned
Wei Ying Luo in this letter,

502
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,020
leaving no words for me.

503
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,980
Empress,

504
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,850
you hold so many grudges...

505
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,630
against me.

506
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,450
Your Majesty,

507
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,840
by custom, we should report to
the imperial ministers and clans...

508
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,170
the death of Her Majesty.

509
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,600
But...

510
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,590
as it happened so suddenly,

511
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,850
I don't know how to tell them.

512
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,920
Due to deep sorrow...

513
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,760
at Seventh Prince's death,

514
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,810
Her Majesty developed a serious disease,

515
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,920
which was worsened
by labours during the eastern tour...

516
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,480
and led to...

517
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,840
her sudden departure.

518
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,040
I fear it is impossible for us
to conceal the fact...

519
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,180
from so many people
in the imperial palace.

520
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,200
If you fail to keep it secret,

521
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,190
you'll be sentenced to death.

522
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,830
Then, what about Wei Ying Luo?

523
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,840
Since it's the last wish of Her Majesty,

524
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,160
I won't kill her.

525
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,940
I don't want to see her again
in the Forbidden City.

526
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,690
Miss Ying Luo,

527
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,980
His Majesty ordered you...

528
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,840
to guard Her Majesty's portrait...

529
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,110
at the Yuanming Garden's
Celestial Changchun Palace.

530
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:27,280
You are not allowed to return
to the Forbidden City.

531
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:30,130
Didn't you claim that
you came here to work?

532
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,370
Brother.

533
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,030
What are you doing here?

534
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,880
I was transferred to Yuanming Garden.

535
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,880
You are in charge of the storeroom in
Imperial Household Department...

536
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,080
and appreciated by Noble Consort Xian.

537
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,250
Why do you want to be
transferred to Yuanming Garden?

538
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,540
Ying Luo, we have promised each other.

539
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,280
You and I,

540
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,240
no matter if it's His Majesty's
audience hall or a living hell,

541
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,840
we will be together forever.

542
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,290
You promised me. You did.

543
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,100
You can't go back on your words.

544
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,650
I didn't say that.

545
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,320
I don't remember your original words.

546
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,000
Anyway, the gist of it is that...

547
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,620
we share blessings...

548
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,100
and troubles together.

549
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,450
Have you gone mad?

550
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,550
You have worked so hard
to be promoted...

551
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,160
and finally got a chance.

552
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,040
But, you gave it up.

553
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,790
Therefore, Wei Ying Luo,

554
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,860
keep in mind what I've done for you.

555
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,630
Ying Luo, from now on,

556
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,850
you and I will stay in Yuanming Garden.

557
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,320
We'll never part.

558
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,450
I regard your silence as your agreement.

559
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,200
-I…
-Wei Ying Luo.

560
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,400
Wei Ying Luo.
