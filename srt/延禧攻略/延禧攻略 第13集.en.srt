1
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,270
Young Master?

2
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,910
What...

3
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,660
what are you doing?

4
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,050
Why did you fool Hailancha?

5
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
Are you scheming something?

6
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,160
Tell me,

7
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,880
what do you want to do?

8
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
It hurts!

9
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,480
Let go of me!

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,200
I don't understand what you're saying.

11
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,079
Wei Yingluo,

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
stop pretending.

13
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,120
That skin you gave him

14
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,000
has a black spot on its hind end.

15
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,680
But I remember

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,600
Snowball was white all over.

17
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,360
I'm sure

18
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,960
you played a trick.

19
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,160
Tell me.

20
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,440
Why did you do that?

21
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,880
Are you planning to frame Hailancha?

22
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,560
No!

23
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,720
I’m not!

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,250
I don't believe you.

25
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,250
Come with me to see His Majesty now.

26
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,440
Snowball.

27
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,000
Hush! Don't bark.

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,440
Why is it here?

29
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,440
Young Master,

30
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,080
a dog is an animal.

31
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,850
It’s not able to discern right from wrong.

32
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,440
If it has a good master,

33
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,560
it will guard the courtyard.

34
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,520
If it has a bad master,

35
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,079
it will get framed and used.

36
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,440
Snowball is innocent and I don't want it to die.

37
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,040
So I switched it

38
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,620
and secretly feed it here.

39
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,360
Now

40
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,640
can you let go of me?

41
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,720
Sorry.

42
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,640
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,720
Sorry.

44
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,960
Give it to me.

45
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,840
Why?

46
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,480
You know how small the Forbidden City is.

47
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,740
If it gets discovered,

48
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,640
you'll be sentenced

49
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,640
for deceiving the Emperor.

50
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,840
You want to be killed?

51
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,560
We can’t kill it for that.

52
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,970
Did I say I'm killing it?

53
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,140
I'll take it out of the Palace.

54
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,360
Really?

55
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,840
Young Master,

56
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,600
can you do me another favor?

57
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,480
What is it?

58
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,620
Find Snowball a master

59
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,240
that will care for it.

60
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,640
Ok, I promise.

61
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,380
Young Master, you're so nice.

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,920
Snowball,

63
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,440
you heard that?

64
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,320
Young Master Fuheng says he'll take you out of the Palace.

65
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,560
Are you happy?

66
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,080
Are you happy?

67
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,200
Your wrist...

68
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,720
Young Master,

69
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,320
you exerted

70
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,480
too much strength.

71
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,040
Look.

72
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,080
My wrist is all red.

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,640
Sorry.

74
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
I was too suspicious.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,840
I now believe you didn't mean it.

76
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,360
What?

77
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,960
Nothing.

78
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,120
Young Master,

79
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,120
if you blow it for me,

80
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
my wrist won't hurt anymore.

81
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,200
Sorry.

82
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,420
You're too close to me.

83
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,520
It's inappropriate!

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,530
I remember it very clearly.

85
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,240
After entering the Forbidden City,

86
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,400
I don’t own my knees anymore.

87
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,760
No matter if it's in the fake mountain or on the stone paths,

88
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,120
as long as I meet a master,

89
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,600
I kneel immediately.

90
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,600
Madam,

91
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,120
try them on.

92
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,680
Wear the covers

93
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,920
on your knees.

94
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,720
See if it's comfortable.

95
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,920
You’re really skillful with your hands.

96
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,960
I saw those eunuchs wearing them.

97
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,290
I just couldn't find good leather.

98
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,920
If I can find some better,

99
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,450
I’ll make you another pair.

100
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,240
What's wrong?

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,640
Yingluo,

102
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,680
Snowball was white all over.

103
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Why did you

104
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,760
choose a piece of fur with a flaw on it?

105
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,880
Because Guard Suolun and Fuheng are good friends.

106
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,440
I don't understand.

107
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,650
Guard Suolun was careless and negligent,

108
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,400
while Fuheng was very smart.

109
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,920
I was sure he’d soon notice that I had played a trick

110
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,050
and saved Snowball.

111
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,770
But why did you want him to find out?

112
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,290
Last time, I gave him a hog bladder.

113
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,260
Although I bluffed it out,

114
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,420
he must have doubted me after thinking about it.

115
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,040
Then how can I eliminate his doubt?

116
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,920
Only by making him feel

117
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,160
that I'm kind

118
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,540
and safe to be with.

119
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,880
Yingluo.

120
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,720
Madam,

121
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,050
I'm very evil to begin with.

122
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,120
I will be more evil

123
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
because I’ll revenge for my sister.

124
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
Don't advise me against it anymore.

125
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,680
I will never change.

126
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,770
Why would an evil person

127
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,720
repeatedly save Consort Yu?

128
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,170
Even to the point of antagonizing Noble Consort Gao.

129
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,920
Why would an evil person make Snowball a home,

130
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,280
and feed it on her own food?

131
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,460
To clear myself from my crime,

132
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,600
I used a dog.

133
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,400
More of less I feel guilty.

134
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
Yingluo,

135
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,920
in this Forbidden City,

136
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,720
if you want to be evil,

137
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,040
be thoroughly evil.

138
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,560
A tough mouth

139
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,520
and a kind heart

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,030
will lead to greater disaster.

141
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,600
What is this!

142
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:42,929
Empress,

143
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,280
this is West Lake Longjing Tea the Imperial Household Department delivered just now.

144
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,400
I've always loved Yunwu Tea,

145
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
and everybody in the Palace knows it.

146
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,800
I haven't fallen out of favor yet,

147
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,800
but the Tea House is already doing this!

148
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,720
What stupid thing did they send to brush me off?

149
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,120
Empress, please calm down.

150
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,960
This year, it rained continuously in Lushan

151
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,360
and the tea roots rotted.

152
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,800
The Tea House may want to deliver it,

153
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,160
but they don’t have any.

154
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,680
I don't believe it.

155
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,240
Go get me the Tea House Head.

156
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,600
It...

157
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Go!

158
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,920
Yes.

159
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,000
Greetings to you, noble consort

160
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,240
You dare come at this time?

161
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,520
You think you haven't caused me enough trouble?

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,680
Empress,

163
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,880
it was my fault.

164
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,720
I belittled that servant maid.

165
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,960
Please forgive me this time.

166
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,020
I will repay you with whatever I have.

167
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,200
Empress.

168
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,600
You’re not going?

169
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,680
Can't I order you around now?

170
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,820
It’s not like that.

171
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,280
When I got out of the gate,

172
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,760
I bumped into the messenger eunuch

173
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,240
of Prince Yi.

174
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,120
What did he say?

175
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,760
Tell Prince Yi

176
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
that he can handle it according to law.

177
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,040
Just send my words to him.

178
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,120
He will know what to do.

179
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,040
Yes.

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,840
I can forgive you.

181
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,480
But the flea of Palace of Eternal Spring that keeps jumping

182
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,120
is such an eyesore.

183
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,680
As long as you forgive me,

184
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,650
I will try to make up for my mistake.

185
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,400
Consort xian

186
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,240
what are you thinking?

187
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,860
I'm worried about Changshou.

188
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,680
He's sick in prison.

189
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,050
No one's taking care of him.

190
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,040
We've sent the money out.

191
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,960
Mistress will surely try to send him a doctor.

192
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,120
Rest assured.

193
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,610
Changshou is indeed a good-for-nothing.

194
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,560
He’s always asking for trouble.

195
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,680
But he's still my brother.

196
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,930
When we were growing up,

197
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,640
he always protected and respected me.

198
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,800
When he learned I’d marry into Prince Bao Mansion,

199
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,560
he cried his eyes out.

200
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
He kept requiring to go with me.

201
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,560
Then he got a good beating from father.

202
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,280
He hobbled to send my carriage off.

203
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,220
I refused to ask for leniency for him.

204
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,520
Maybe he will blame me.

205
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,040
Empress,

206
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,890
you've done everything you could.

207
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,600
Young Master will understand.

208
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,760
He won't blame you.

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,320
I only wish Changshou could get better soon.

210
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,520
He will. He surely will.

211
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,040
Are you wishing Changshou to get better

212
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,300
so he could continue damaging my empire?

213
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,160
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

214
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,840
Your Majesty, what brought you here?

215
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,520
I didn't even go out to greet you.

216
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,560
Please forgive me.

217
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,080
You haven't answered my question.

218
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,120
Your Majesty,

219
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,320
Changshou is young.

220
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,320
Because of a thoughtless moment, he committed a mistake.

221
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,920
But I know the laws,

222
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,960
so I won't beg for leniency.

223
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,480
I'm just worried of his suffering in prison.

224
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,760
This is human nature.

225
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,960
Your Majesty, why must you denounce it?

226
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,680
Your brother is young and thoughtless.

227
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,920
What about your good father?

228
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,180
Are you going to say

229
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,840
he's more thoughtless because he’s old?

230
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,800
Your Majesty, my father

231
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,720
has always been working with just.

232
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,050
He’s working very hard.

233
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,120
His only fault is that he didn’t discipline his son.

234
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,400
Why did you say that?

235
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,720
Today, Prince Yi submitted a memorial

236
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,240
saying that your father,

237
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,560
Na’erbu, offered him silver in person.

238
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,440
Impossible!

239
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,840
Why would he give Prince Yi silver?

240
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,130
Because I ordered Prince Yi to participate in the public trial.

241
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,000
Na’erbu requested Prince Yi

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,200
to be lenient in sentencing Changshou.

243
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,480
Your Majesty,

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,320
my father is honest and just.

245
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,760
Where did he get the silver for bribery?

246
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,000
Consort Xian,

247
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,840
the silver that Na’erbu gave him

248
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,920
was the 500 liang Her Majesty rewarded you

249
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,760
on the lychee banquet.

250
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,560
I gave it to them

251
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,690
so they could send Changshou a doctor.

252
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,480
You're saying that Father used it for bribery?

253
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,800
I’ll never believe it!

254
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,560
I completely believe the character of my father.

255
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,080
What you should be doubting

256
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,240
is the motive of Prince Yi.

257
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,720
Why would I suspect Prince Yi?

258
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,920
Everyone in the imperial court knows

259
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,200
Prince Yi and Noble Consort Gao’s father

260
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,240
are very close.

261
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,780
Somebody may have instructed him

262
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,600
to slander my father of bribing him.

263
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,440
Shut up.

264
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,240
Your Majesty,

265
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,280
I believe that my father would never bribe anyone.

266
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,850
I guarantee it with my life.

267
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,320
It has happened

268
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
and you’re sticking to your obsessiveness.

269
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,560
Very well!

270
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,220
I allow you to go to prison,

271
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,520
so you can ask your honest and dutiful father!

272
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,720
You are falsely accusing a loyal subject.

273
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,120
You will regret it.

274
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,240
Could you let us see

275
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,570
Hoifa-Nara Changshou?

276
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,800
His Majesty has ordered

277
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,460
that you can only see Na’erbu.

278
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,120
Father!

279
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,010
Imperial Consort Xian.

280
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,880
Father, at this time,

281
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,280
forget the formalities!

282
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,440
No matter what,

283
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,970
I'm forever your daughter.

284
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,680
His Majesty allowed you to come here?

285
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,420
His Majesty let me come to see you.

286
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,840
I have no face to see His Majesty any more.

287
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,200
I don’t deserve his graces.

288
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,060
Father, this isn't your mistake.

289
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,240
Prince Yi has always been colluding with the Gao family.

290
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,770
And I refused to bow down to Noble Consort Gao.

291
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
I think she framed you.

292
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,620
You’re suffering this because of me.

293
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,800
Father, don't worry.

294
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,840
I surely will do my best

295
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,720
to clear your name.

296
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,980
I'll go beg His Majesty to reopen the case

297
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,080
and give you justice.

298
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,600
No.

299
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,760
Don't go.

300
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,600
Don’t do it.

301
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,520
Why?

302
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,960
Father,

303
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,160
did you...

304
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,080
I'm so sorry.

305
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,680
I dishonored our Hoifa-Nara clan!

306
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,960
It was all my fault.

307
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,840
I didn’t think much

308
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,220
and committed such a grave crime.

309
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,600
Father, you have always

310
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,160
looked down on those dishonest officials.

311
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,120
You never received any dirty money

312
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,600
in the past 20 years.

313
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,280
How could you bribe?

314
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,880
How is that possible?

315
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,480
I didn't want to do it,

316
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,560
but your mother threatened me with her life.

317
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,310
She forced me to go and beg for leniency.

318
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,160
Finally, they spared the life of Changshou.

319
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,310
Changshou is my only son.

320
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,349
He's the only descendant of our family.

321
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,349
How could I…

322
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,480
To save Changshou,

323
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,440
you bribed Prince Yi?

324
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,360
What about the rules you taught me before?

325
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,520
You said that a person can lose anything

326
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,850
except his conscience.

327
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,520
You said that as an official,

328
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,080
you will never break the law

329
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,920
or go against your initial character.

330
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,480
You didn’t ask for a high position or wealth,

331
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,080
but wished to be honest, upright, and have a guilt-free conscience.

332
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,000
In the palace,

333
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,340
no matter how hard my life was,

334
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,480
I followed your instructions.

335
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,040
Now, you're telling me that

336
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,000
you bribed someone?

337
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,000
Father,

338
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
I believed every word you said.

339
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,320
I've always been proud of you.

340
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,240
But today, you…

341
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,600
It’s my fault!

342
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,360
Shushen,

343
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,200
forgive me!

344
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,320
Sorry. Sorry.

345
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,720
Help me!

346
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,520
Save me!

347
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,280
Shushen...

348
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,080
Zhen'er,

349
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,600
let's go.

350
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,570
Shushen!

351
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,960
Shushen!

352
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,600
Shushen!

353
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,360
Shushen, don't go! Shushen...

354
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,960
In this world, only you can save me now.

355
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,040
Shushen...

356
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,290
consort xian

357
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,320
we're about to enter the Gate of Divine Prowess.

358
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,720
Stop crying.

359
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,440
I'm fine.

360
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,720
No need to worry.

361
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
Imperial Consort Xian,

362
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,000
your mother is here.

363
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,000
Shushen.

364
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,840
Shushen,

365
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,220
your father...

366
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,120
You forced father to beg Prince Yi.

367
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,720
Am I right?

368
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,280
I couldn’t sit still

369
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,360
waiting for your brother to die.

370
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,320
I didn’t know what to do.

371
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,280
So I thought we might beg Prince Yi

372
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,720
to spare him.

373
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,920
Only if he could come out for treatment!

374
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,440
The prison was so dark and moist.

375
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,680
That's not a place for people.

376
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,520
How could he stand that?

377
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,200
So many years,

378
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,360
you kept pressuring father to seek promotion.

379
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,520
Father wasn't willing to join alliances.

380
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,720
You then started forcing Changshou.

381
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,800
Now, you've forced him into the prison.

382
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,060
But that's not enough,

383
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,440
you even forced father to bribe people.

384
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,800
Now even he has gone in prison!

385
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,760
This...

386
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
this is not my fault.

387
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,480
Whose fault is this?

388
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,240
Since I was little,

389
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,600
I’ve been hearing you complain.

390
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,240
Either that father is useless,

391
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,600
or that I'm not thinking of improving my status.

392
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,360
We both are useless people.

393
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
We can’t give you glory

394
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
or wealth.

395
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,360
Now, our family is broken.

396
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,240
Are you happy?

397
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,000
Shushen,

398
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,480
your father has been serving the Court most of his life,

399
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,040
but he's still a mere Assistant Captain.

400
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,600
He is really useless.

401
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,540
I'm eager to outdo others.

402
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,520
Although I kept blaming him,

403
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,160
and ridiculed him,

404
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,960
I also sold all my dowry

405
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,640
to make up for our family expenses.

406
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,560
When I went back to my maiden family

407
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,840
and had some tea,

408
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,840
they rolled their eyes.

409
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,880
Luckily I had you.

410
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,200
I gave you the best food and clothes

411
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,720
without considering your brother.

412
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,930
I only hoped to send you into the Palace

413
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,890
and that you can make a rise.

414
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,920
I'm also a woman!

415
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,080
I want a good future.

416
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,610
I want wealth and splendor!

417
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,200
What’s wrong with that?

418
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,840
I don't want to hear it anymore.

419
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,600
Shushen, it's all my fault!

420
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,120
I’m not demanding anything!

421
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,250
I’m not demanding wealth or splendor!

422
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,120
But you must do something

423
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,980
for your father and your brother.

424
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,520
I also want to save them.

425
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,360
But at this point,

426
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,440
I can't do anything.

427
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,080
Mistress,

428
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,120
Young Master

429
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,200
is gone.

430
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,040
Mistress.

431
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,680
What?

432
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,480
Imperial Consort Xian,

433
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,960
the condition of Young Master rapidly deteriorated.

434
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
He didn't make it.

435
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
He's dead?

436
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,560
Changshou is dead.

437
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,400
Your brother is dead.

438
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,320
If you had cared about him,

439
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,400
you would have begged His Majesty.

440
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,320
He wouldn't have died in that cold prison.

441
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,480
Mother.

442
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,080
You want to be lofty.

443
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,890
You want to be a good person.

444
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,800
Even if I have committed so many mistakes,

445
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,360
I did everything I could for the Hoifa-Nara clan.

446
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,020
What about you?

447
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,720
In this Forbidden City,

448
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,440
a dog is more decent than you!

449
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,920
Did you do anything for anyone?

450
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,600
Mother.

451
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,160
Listen.

452
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,000
Hoifa-Nara Shushen,

453
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,960
our family has broken

454
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,200
because of you!

455
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,960
The most regretful thing I did in my life

456
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,800
is to give birth

457
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,920
to an incompetent daughter like you!

458
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,760
Mother!

459
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,200
Somebody!

460
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,520
Somebody!

461
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,200
Save my mother!

462
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,120
Mother, it’s all my fault.

463
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,240
Come back!

464
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,160
I don't want anything anymore.

465
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,800
Come back!

466
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,600
Mother!

467
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,280
Mother!

468
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,080
Yingluo,

469
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,620
come write something.

470
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,960
Yes.

471
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,160
My god,

472
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,240
are you writing or drawing some caterpillars?

473
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,800
I can't write well,

474
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,560
that's exactly why I want to learn from Her Majesty.

475
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,120
Her Majesty is good at calligraphy.

476
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,360
You won’t be able to do that in 100 years.

477
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,040
How could a student compare with her teacher?

478
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,730
That's disrespectful.

479
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,560
You're such a rascal.

480
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,960
When did Her Majesty admit you as a student?

481
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,360
I was bold

482
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,120
and said the wrong words.

483
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,640
Yingluo was right.

484
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,480
She doesn't know how to do it.

485
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,720
That’ exactly why she must be diligent in practicing writing.

486
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,400
Yingluo,

487
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,080
you are very smart.

488
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,040
I believe that in the future, your handwriting will become very good.

489
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,400
I also am very happy

490
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,420
to have a student like you.

491
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,920
Your Majesty,

492
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,720
bad news!

493
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,220
Palace of Receiving Celestial Favor is in trouble.

494
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,400
That face of Consort Xian

495
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
must be very adorable now!

496
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,200
What a pity I'm currently grounded for pondering.

497
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,120
I can’t go appreciate it.

498
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,920
Your Majesty,

499
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,600
I don't understand.

500
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,080
You could have used the bribery case of Na’erbu

501
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,280
to threaten Consort Xian.

502
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,080
Why did you have to do this?

503
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,000
That woman

504
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
is so stubborn.

505
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,780
Can she live on being content with poverty or striving for virtue?

506
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,120
I repeatedly tried to associate with her,

507
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,980
but she didn't appreciate it.

508
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,640
Why would I give her another chance?

509
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,800
That’s right.

510
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,120
Consort Xian didn't know what's good for her.

511
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,850
It is indeed necessary to teach her some lessons.

512
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,200
But after all, Her Majesty showed her grace first.

513
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,240
No matter what you do now,

514
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,240
she won't feel grateful.

515
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,240
Why not kill the chicken to warn the monkeys

516
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,960
and let the people here in the Forbidden City

517
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,480
see your strengths?

518
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,520
Strengths?

519
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,080
If I have strengths,

520
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,200
I won’t allow a low-down servant to behave wildly.

521
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,720
That is because Her Majesty keeps defending that servant.

522
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,160
She's also a rascal

523
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,520
who dares do anything.

524
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,600
We have our concerns,

525
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,240
so we can’t act freely.

526
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,160
But

527
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,770
although we can't kill her,

528
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,720
someone can.

529
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,680
Who?

530
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,280
We shouldn't bother two persons for one thing.

531
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,840
Your Majesty, don't forget,

532
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,360
we have a Prince Yi.

533
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,960
He?

534
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,880
Although Hongxiao inherited the noble title

535
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,120
of the old Prince Yi,

536
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,080
the power of Prince Yi Mansion has dwindled

537
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,360
after the death of the late Emperor.

538
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,200
Although he is also a legitimate member of the royal family,

539
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,320
he is just serving as a guard at the Gate of Celestial Purity,

540
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,160
and didn't even get promoted into an imperial bodyguard.

541
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,200
He is bearing a huge grudge about this.

542
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,080
Now,

543
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,640
he and Young Lord Gao are best friends.

544
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,920
He is bent on getting your help,

545
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,650
so he surely will play up to you.

546
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,040
Or else, he wouldn't have sent you the news about Na’erbu.

547
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,080
But he is a guard of the Gate of Celestial Purity.

548
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,520
With so many eyes watching,

549
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,280
could his power extend into the Palace?

550
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,360
Empress,

551
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,240
we must hit the snake on its weak spot.

552
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,000
I've already sent people to the Embroidery Workshop

553
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,800
to ask around about Wei Yingluo.

554
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,040
I discovered

555
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,960
she had an affair with a guard.

556
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,640
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

557
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,960
My master locked herself in her room

558
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,400
after she came back.

559
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,400
Nobody could persuade her to open the door.

560
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,860
I'll tell her you're here.

561
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,360
No.

562
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,880
Now that Consort Xian is not in the mood,

563
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,400
I will not force it.

564
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,480
Take good care of her.

565
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,600
Remember?

566
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,880
Yes.

567
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,080
Go.

568
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,690
Let's go.

569
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,490
To Hall of Mental Cultivation.

570
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,200
Your Majesty,

571
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,000
why are we going to Hall of Mental Cultivation?

572
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,480
Na’erbu committed bribery,

573
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,800
and Consort Xian is implicated because of it.

574
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,280
His Majesty is mad with it.

575
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,840
You must not infuriate him.

576
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,360
How could I not know that His Majesty is mad?

577
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,640
But if I don't meddle in this matter,

578
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,880
Na’erbu will be helpless.

579
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,200
That's their problem.

580
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,960
Does that have anything to do

581
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,600
with Palace of Eternal Spring or Your Majesty?

582
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,840
Yingluo,

583
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
what do you think?

584
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,600
Your Majesty, you’re not meddling with state affairs,

585
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,080
but pitying Imperial Consort Xian.

586
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,640
Right.

587
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,320
Consort Xian and I

588
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,840
have known each other for years.

589
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,760
I know her very well.

590
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,280
She's generous and magnanimous.

591
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,520
She strictly adheres to the righteous principles

592
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,180
and has helped a lot of people.

593
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,290
If a person like that

594
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,200
should have this kind of fate,

595
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,700
isn't the heaven being blind?

596
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,080
That's why

597
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,400
I want to help her

598
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,080
and save her father.

599
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,600
Then you must not be frank with your words.

600
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,280
Don't anger His Majesty.

601
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,120
His Majesty is very intelligent.

602
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,680
If anyone is not frank in front of him,

603
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,410
aren’t they inviting trouble?

604
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,320
What do you suggest then?

605
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,520
Speak directly and bluntly, of course.

606
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,540
But you must say it in another way.

607
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,960
You're not begging for leniency for Na’erbu,

608
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,920
but for Consort Xian.

609
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,920
What's the difference?

610
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,250
The difference is huge.

611
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,600
Your Majesty,

612
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,400
Her Majesty is here.

613
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,680
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

614
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,200
What brought you here?

615
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
I heard you've eaten a lot of lychees

616
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,080
these days,

617
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,020
and didn't even eat much of your meal.

618
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,040
Tea made of dried lychee leaves

619
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,960
reduces internal heat and exhaustion.

620
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,490
Your Majesty, give it a try.

621
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,440
Yingluo.

622
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,600
In the past,

623
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,000
you would urge me

624
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,080
against giving into my food craving,

625
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,140
so that my health won't get affected.

626
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,100
How come you didn't mention that at all today

627
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,920
and even made me some tea?

628
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,480
Of course, I want to fawn on you

629
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,040
and make you happy.

630
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,000
Why do you fawn on me?

631
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,840
I

632
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,690
want to ask for leniency for Consort Xian.

633
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,120
Your Majesty.

634
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,080
Your Majesty,

635
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,720
I know that the imperial harem mustn't meddle with state affairs.

636
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,760
But I didn’t come here for Lord Na’erbu,

637
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,000
but for Consort Xian.

638
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,160
Consort Xian

639
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,610
entered Prince Bao Mansion

640
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,240
at the age of 14.

641
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,560
It has been nine years

642
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,000
since then.

643
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,480
Your Majesty,

644
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,600
a woman has been attending to you

645
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,520
for nine years.

646
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,560
She has lost

647
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,040
her mother and brother

648
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,240
in quick succession.

649
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,600
If Na’erbu is executed,

650
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,240
in the future,

651
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,040
Consort Xian will become alone.

652
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,640
Your Majesty,

653
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,160
I

654
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,160
can’t go against the law for personal reasons.

655
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,320
Sure.

656
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,280
Lord Na’erbu bribed Prince Yi

657
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,320
when no mistake could be tolerated.

658
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,650
He was indeed reckless and unpardonable.

659
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,640
But Your Majesty,

660
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,800
I gave Consort Xian

661
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,640
the 500 liang silver.

662
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
If earlier,

663
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,920
I had sent an imperial doctor

664
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,680
to the prison,

665
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,940
the situation might be different today.

666
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,080
But I was worried

667
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,640
people might gossip

668
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,840
that I

669
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
was deliberately associating with Consort Xian

670
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,680
by showing her grace.

671
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,760
Never thought

672
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,040
Changshou died

673
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,840
because I wanted to avoid gossiping.

674
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,000
Your Majesty,

675
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,400
what happened has nothing to do with you.

676
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,160
Don't assume responsibility

677
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,440
for all the offenses.

678
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,880
I earnestly beg you

679
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,920
not to kill

680
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,400
Na’erbu.

681
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,969
You’ll be leaving Consort Xian some decency.

682
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,670
Or else,

683
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,600
not only will Consort Xian be overwhelmed with grief,

684
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,840
even I

685
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,960
will feel guilty for the rest of my life.

686
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,370
consort xian

687
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,680
consort xian

688
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,330
consort xian

689
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,680
I got news from Hall of Mental Cultivation.

690
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,920
Her Majesty went there to beg for leniency.

691
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,450
His Majesty has agreed to pardon your father.

692
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,640
Get out.

693
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,360
Empress.

694
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,760
I told you to go out.

695
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,280
Yes.

696
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,400
In this Forbidden City,

697
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,440
a dog is more decent than you!

698
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,880
Did you do anything for anyone?

699
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,800
Listen.

700
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,440
Our family has broken

701
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
because of you!

702
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,720
The most regretful thing I did in my life

703
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,920
is to give birth to an incompetent daughter like you!

704
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,560
Empress,

705
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,240
where are you going so early in the morning?

706
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,290
To thank Her Majesty for her grace.

707
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,440
Yes,

708
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,760
we should indeed thank Her Majesty.

709
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,610
Greetings to you, Imperial Consort Xian.

710
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,600
I come to greet Her Majesty.

711
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,600
Her Majesty is reading.

712
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,560
I'll lead you to see her now.

713
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,570
Thank you, Miss Erqing.

714
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,560
What are you looking at?

715
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,600
Go back to work!

716
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,840
Consort Xian looks different.

717
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,920
A person who is in mourning

718
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,960
will naturally look different.

719
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,940
Go back to work!

720
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,160
That is what happened.

721
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,440
I will go back then.

722
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,640
Prince Yi!

723
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,850
Prince Yi, who were you talking to?

724
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
That palace maid

725
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,600
looks familiar.

726
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,080
I lost the sheath of my fan.

727
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,610
I asked her if she saw it.

728
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,040
Really?

729
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,460
Are you suspecting that a distinguished prince like me

730
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,120
will have an affair with a palace maid?

731
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,920
I dare not.

732
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,680
Fuheng,

733
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,680
don't look down on me

734
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,440
just because His Majesty favors and trusts your Fuca family.

735
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,800
I inherited my noble title when I was nine.

736
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,440
This title does not degrade in inheritance.

737
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,600
If you want to surpass me,

738
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,680
it's too early.

739
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,800
Greetings to you, Prince Yi.

740
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,200
Rise.

741
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:08,920
Qingxi,

742
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,760
I heard you're preparing to get promoted.

743
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,160
That’s funny.

744
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,450
I'm just a second-grade guard.

745
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,770
Who doesn't want to be on the top level?

746
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,120
If I recommend you,

747
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,400
it surely will not be difficult.

748
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,800
Prince,

749
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,340
you're helping me?

750
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
As long as you help me with one task.

751
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
I'll immediately

752
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,640
see the Grand Minister in Attendance to have you promoted

753
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,040
once you're done with it.

754
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,500
Not to say one task,

755
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,680
I will do it to repay you for your appreciation

756
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,140
even if you ask me to go to the end of the world.

757
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
You just need to kill a little ant.

758
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,280
Step on it and everything will be done.

759
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,800
You don’t have to go to the end of the world.

760
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,960
One who owns the world is the world's master.

761
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,960
One who heads a country is the country's ruler.

762
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,480
I am already its master.

763
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,320
What does this mean?

764
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,200
I am already its master...

765
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,880
King Wen of Zhou saw decaying bones by the road.

766
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,800
He then ordered his men to give them a proper burial.

767
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,040
His officer asked him,

768
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,160
"Why must we bother with decaying bones which no one is claiming?"

769
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,240
King Wen answered,

770
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,720
"If you're blessed to have the world, then you're the world's master.

771
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,850
If you have a country, then you're that country's ruler.

772
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,840
Now that I have seen bones,

773
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,320
I am their owner.

774
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,400
How could I watch it exposed here in the wilderness?”

775
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,320
This story means

776
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,440
an emperor who has the world

777
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,840
is responsible for all the citizens in its territory.

778
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,210
He should give them adequate care.

779
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,000
Am I right, Your Majesty?

780
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,960
But I'm just a lowly palace maid.

781
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,500
What's the use of learning grand principles like this?

782
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,320
Each of us

783
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,520
have a different status and position.

784
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,560
We have to assume our corresponding responsibilities.

785
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,800
For example, the emperor must be diligent in governing, love his citizens,

786
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
and give his blessings to everyone.

787
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,080
And me.

788
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,200
I should manage the imperial harem and be motherly to everyone in the country.

789
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,160
And you,

790
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,880
other than managing your designated duty,

791
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,480
what else could you do

792
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,000
for others?

793
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,880
I feel

794
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,400
I only need to discipline myself.

795
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,560
If you're unsuccessful, pay attention to your moral uplift.

796
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,960
If you're eminent, share it with the world.

797
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,280
Let's talk about that

798
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,240
when I'm really eminent.

799
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,640
Yingluo,

800
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,720
your elbow keeps trembling.

801
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,720
How could you write well?

802
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,240
Whenever I lift a brush,

803
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,400
my elbow involuntarily trembles.
