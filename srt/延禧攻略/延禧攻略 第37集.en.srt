[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 37]

3
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,240
Are you so eager to get into my embrace?

4
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,820
Your Majesty, please forgive me!

5
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,080
This dress...

6
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,160
Those palace maids made a mistake about
my dress and accessories.

7
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,020
I'll change out of them right now.

8
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,420
Aren't you going to take them off?

9
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,200
Why did you stop?

10
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,650
Your Majesty,

11
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,290
my original clothes are soaking wet.

12
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,079
I dare not offend you.

13
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,650
Come over here.

14
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,530
I told you to come over here.

15
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,670
Her Majesty said that...

16
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,910
I've taken a liking to you.

17
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,380
What do you think?

18
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,240
You must be kidding.

19
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,020
There are so many
beautiful ladies in the harem.

20
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm crude and rude.

21
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,230
I'm just a wildflower by the roadside.

22
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,230
I wouldn't dare tarnish your sight.

23
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,840
After thinking about it,

24
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,560
I realised that there are indeed many
beautiful imperial consorts in the palace.

25
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,990
I'm already sick of obedient,
gentle and beautiful ladies.

26
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,250
But a thorn like you...

27
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,800
is quite interesting.

28
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,270
Your Majesty,

29
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,630
-I...
-What?

30
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,649
You're unwilling?

31
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,870
Your Majesty,

32
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,020
I just wish to serve Her Majesty.

33
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,470
Your Majesty, why would your ruin
your relationship with Her Majesty...

34
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,670
just for a moment of interest?

35
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,950
Moreover, you're the emperor.

36
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,280
You own the whole country
and you are broad-minded.

37
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,300
Besides...

38
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,120
Besides...

39
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,080
Besides, with just one imperial decree,

40
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,580
you can summon
the prettiest women in the country.

41
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,240
You can choose any kinds of women
that you want.

42
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,720
There's no need for you
to force me against my will.

43
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,900
I'm not compatible with your status.

44
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,960
Looks like...

45
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,510
you're really unwilling.

46
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,850
How can a sparrow be
in the same group as phoenixes?

47
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,990
I know my place.

48
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,500
The world is vast.

49
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,530
There are beautiful ladies everywhere.

50
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,670
I'm the emperor of Great Qing.

51
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,730
The master of this country.

52
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,640
I can choose any beautiful women...

53
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,030
who I like in this nation.

54
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,970
Why should I force an unwilling woman?

55
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,840
It's not fun at all.

56
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

57
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,030
You were hoping that I would say this.

58
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,140
Let me tell you this.

59
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,200
This is the first time I force
a woman against her will.

60
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,110
I find it very interesting.

61
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,670
The more you reject me,

62
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,180
the more I want to have you.

63
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,680
Your Majesty!

64
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,860
What else do you want to say?

65
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,760
Your Majesty.

66
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,720
Actually,

67
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,710
what I said just now...

68
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,100
was all against my heart.

69
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
I...

70
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,290
actually wanted to get close to you
since a long time ago.

71
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,330
But there are so many beautiful women
in the harem.

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,860
And I am of humble origins.

73
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,490
I had no chance to get closer
to you at all.

74
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,800
So, I...

75
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,320
deliberately provoked you...

76
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,130
to attract your attention...

77
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,080
in an unconventional manner.

78
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,830
Now, you've finally taken a liking to me.

79
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm very happy.

80
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,290
I'm willing to serve you, Your Majesty.

81
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,250
But...

82
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,010
But what?

83
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,980
I don't want to be a palace maid anymore.

84
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,840
I want to be a noble lady.

85
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,750
You are quite the schemer.

86
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,260
So,

87
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,930
you've been waiting for me.

88
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,800
Your Majesty, are you going to
agree to that?

89
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,490
You filthy woman.

90
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
You're not worthy to get into my bed.

91
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,700
Your Majesty.

92
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,000
I was wrong.

93
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,200
Get lost.

94
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

95
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,150
Wait.

96
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,080
From now on,

97
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,700
you'll be a common servant
in Changchun Palace.

98
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,780
Serve Her Majesty earnestly.

99
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,320
Stop having wild delusions.

100
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,140
I'll never want a woman with
ulterior motives. Get lost.

101
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

102
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,750
Miss Ying Luo.

103
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,840
You have to thank me.

104
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,370
I have to thank you?

105
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,420
I'm the one who prepared
this dress for you.

106
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,210
Keep them for yourself!

107
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,020
Your Majesty!

108
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,620
I'm back!

109
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,470
Please open the door, okay?

110
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,350
Your Majesty, please open the door!

111
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,980
-Don't open the door for her!
-Your Majesty!

112
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,090
Your Majesty.

113
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,610
Ask her to leave.

114
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,400
Ying Luo, did you hear
what Her Majesty said?

115
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,360
Leave now.

116
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,350
Your Majesty,

117
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,970
I knelt all the way from
Qianqing Palace to come back to you.

118
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,160
I made so many kowtows that I lost count.

119
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,430
I did it so that I can serve you again.

120
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,220
Your Majesty,

121
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,850
why don't you see me?

122
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,720
Why?

123
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,920
Your Majesty, please let Ying Luo in.

124
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,610
Ming Yu, open the door!

125
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,130
Your Majesty,

126
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,950
I heard that you're awake.

127
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,640
I am really glad.

128
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,150
Have you recovered?

129
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,860
It's none of your business.

130
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,290
Get out.

131
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,460
Your Majesty,

132
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,800
His Majesty has already
issued a decree...

133
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,700
to pardon me for my offence.

134
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,240
I can't enter the Labour House anymore.

135
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,520
If you chase me away,

136
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,110
-where can I go?
-Just go wherever you want.

137
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,330
Changchun Palace doesn't welcome you.

138
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,830
Your Majesty.

139
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,650
Your Majesty,
why don't you tell her the truth?

140
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,760
You were so worried about Ying Luo.

141
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,530
Now that she's back,
why are you chasing her away?

142
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,560
Ming Yu!

143
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,740
Your Majesty,

144
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,260
did I do something wrong?

145
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,920
This is not your fault.

146
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,620
This is my fault.

147
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,180
If it wasn't for protecting me,

148
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,220
you wouldn't be...

149
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,490
sucked into this vortex of power struggle.

150
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,390
Ying Luo,

151
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,040
leave now.

152
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,150
Don't stay by my side anymore.

153
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,310
Your Majesty.

154
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,620
Look at my legs.

155
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,240
I can't stand up anymore.

156
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,200
Although His Majesty
is still taking a good care of me...

157
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,900
given our former affection,

158
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,010
the Great Qing...

159
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,960
doesn't need a crippled empress.

160
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,020
Although Changchun Palace is showing
a flourishing scene of prosperity,

161
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,520
we are actually walking on thin ice.

162
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,800
At time like this,
no one would want to remain here.

163
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,060
Do you understand?

164
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,390
Your Majesty,

165
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,440
if you chase me away,

166
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,560
I will have nowhere to go.

167
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,760
I'll issue an imperial decree...

168
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,050
to release you from the palace.

169
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,590
I'm not going back...

170
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,510
to that house of mine.

171
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,870
My mother died after giving birth to me.

172
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,600
So, my father assumed that
I had jinxed my mother to her death.

173
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,520
He threw me into a river.

174
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,360
How could he treat a baby like that?

175
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,120
My sister found me and saved me.

176
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,830
She brought me home.

177
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,530
It was under her care that...

178
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,340
I was able to...

179
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,140
grow up safely.

180
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,040
Your Majesty,

181
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,900
you treated me so well.

182
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,320
You're like my real sister.

183
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,670
So, I won't leave this palace.

184
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,850
I want to serve you
for the rest of my life.

185
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,810
Ying Luo.

186
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,760
Your Majesty.

187
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,280
Your Majesty,

188
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,230
don't give up.

189
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,320
As long as you keep up
with your physiotherapy,

190
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,670
you will be able to walk
and stand up again.

191
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,620
Even if you...

192
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,730
can't stand up anymore,

193
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,870
I'm willing...

194
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,950
to be your cane forever.

195
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,040
Ying Luo.

196
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,770
Your Majesty. Don't forget about me.

197
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,910
I want to accompany you forever too.

198
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,280
Young Mistress, you are so beautiful.

199
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,410
Du Juan,

200
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,990
the weather...

201
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,020
is getting colder and colder.

202
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,750
Yes.

203
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,630
The wind gently ruffles
the fine willow branches.

204
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,440
The willow weaves together
thousands of sorrows.

205
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,760
Flowering apple has yet to feel the rain
but pear flowers have blossomed like snow.

206
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,420
But half of the spring is gone.

207
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,130
This is "Bewitching Eyes" from Wang Pang.

208
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,620
You like this poem too?

209
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,070
Who is he?

210
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,190
Young Mistress,
he is the Fourth Young Master.

211
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,630
Her Majesty has never mentioned about him.

212
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,200
Four Young Masters in Fuca family.

213
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,560
The first three are the sons
of Old Mistress.

214
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,480
They all have the same mother
as Her Majesty.

215
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,840
Only the Fourth Young Master is
the son of a concubine.

216
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,590
Before this, he was under the care of
the Old Master because he was sick.

217
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,200
Last year, he was ranked Juren
and came first in the exam.

218
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,460
Now, he's preparing for
the metropolitan examination.

219
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,120
Great Qing rose to power
through its military force.

220
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,830
They never settle arguments
through scholarly means.

221
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,830
Of all the high-ranking officials,

222
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,410
only few are chosen from
imperial examination.

223
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,500
Indeed.

224
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,320
Third Young Master is now the
Vice Minister of Ministry of Revenue.

225
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,050
He has a bright prospect ahead of him.

226
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,650
Fourth Young Master is
beyond his depth here.

227
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,960
Hurry up.

228
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,480
De Sheng!

229
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,310
-Miss Ming Yu.
-Where are you delivering all those gifts?

230
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,589
You don't know about it yet? Consort Chun
from Zhongcui Palace is pregnant!

231
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:10,250
His Majesty has rewarded her
with a lot of gifts.

232
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,030
Miss Ming Yu,
please send my regards to Her Majesty.

233
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,290
I'll take my leave now.

234
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,680
Let's go.

235
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,950
Why do you look so mad?
Who offended you?

236
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,080
Your Majesty,
Consort Chun is pregnant.

237
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,690
A crowd of people are delivering gifts
to Zhongcui Palace now.

238
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,720
This is good news.

239
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,770
Select a nice gift from
my personal items...

240
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,270
and deliver it to Consort Chun in person.

241
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,790
You can ask whoever you want
to go but not me.

242
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,440
Ming Yu.

243
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,640
Your Majesty, Consort Chun
has always been very close to you.

244
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,300
But she didn't even tell us
about her pregnancy.

245
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,120
What is the meaning of this?

246
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,350
-Enough.
-I'm just telling the truth.

247
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,590
If she comes here to tell you about it,
you will only be happy for her.

248
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,120
You won't be jealous of her.

249
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,440
I can finally see
the fickleness of friendship...

250
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,030
between two people.

251
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,230
Your Highness,
Ming Yu is too sharp-tongued.

252
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,740
Your Majesty.

253
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,090
Greetings, Your Majesty.

254
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,160
Rise. No need to
go through these formalities.

255
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,000
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-You are pregnant now.

256
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,480
You are different now. Have a seat.

257
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,750
Your Majesty, are you feeling better?

258
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,790
I'm feeling much better now.

259
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,560
You're pregnant now.

260
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,100
If you need anything,
just ask the servants to do it for you.

261
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,830
It's windy outside. Don't catch a cold.

262
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,430
I'm grateful for your concern.

263
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,410
But I can't be disrespectful and rude
just because you are kind.

264
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,190
You are the mistress of the six palaces.

265
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,890
I should have informed you
about my pregnancy beforehand.

266
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,160
Your Majesty, you can't blame Consort Chun
for not informing you about it.

267
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,870
She only found out that she is pregnant
when the imperial physician...

268
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,910
checked her pulse after
she fainted suddenly.

269
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,580
As soon as she feels better,
she braves the cold wind...

270
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,020
to come here to apologise...

271
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,000
she doesn't want you to misunderstand.

272
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,040
Yu Hu.

273
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,950
Consort Chun, that won't happen...

274
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,070
between us.

275
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,990
I've always known you very well.

276
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,350
The most important thing now...

277
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,540
is for you to give birth to the royal heir
without any worries.

278
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,020
Stop plucking it.

279
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,920
This tree is going to go bald
if you keep this up.

280
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,830
What's wrong?

281
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,680
You are angry that
Consort Chun didn't come.

282
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,180
Now, she's here.

283
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,750
Consort Chun used to come to
Changchun Palace so frequently.

284
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,150
But ever since Her Majesty got sick,
she stopped visiting us.

285
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:45,480
I don't know is she's here to apologise
or to show off today.

286
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,690
She clearly knows how sad
Her Majesty is after losing her child.

287
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,810
-How can she do this to Her Majesty.
-Ming Yu, stop.

288
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,380
Her Majesty has always treated
Consort Chun very well.

289
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,110
She is sincerely happy for her.

290
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,070
Why do you have to bring up
unhappy things again?

291
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,740
You'll only make her worry.

292
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,330
Moreover, after Her Majesty
is fully recovered,

293
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,160
she can give birth to a royal heir too.

294
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Fine. You are all so forgiving.
I'm the only bad person here. Satisfied?

295
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,590
Human struggles upwards...

296
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,540
while water flows downwards.

297
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,690
As long as Consort Chun
doesn't harm others,

298
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,020
what's wrong with that?

299
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,510
Ming Yu.

300
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,130
Rather than getting mad here,

301
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,830
why not make a cane with me?

302
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,410
Your Majesty,
take a rest if you are tired.

303
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,160
Your Majesty!

304
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,080
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

305
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,090
Be careful.

306
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,390
Your Majesty.

307
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,300
No.

308
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,760
I really can't.

309
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,870
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

310
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,690
Your Majesty.

311
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,240
Every time the Mistress of
the Vice Minister comes,

312
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,990
she'll go back teary-eyed.

313
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,020
His Majesty often comes to
visit you in secret.

314
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,960
But His Majesty is afraid that
he'll touch a tender spot.

315
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,130
So, every time, he'll leave in secret...

316
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,320
after reaching the inner court.

317
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,410
Your Majesty,

318
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,770
All of us are concerned about you.

319
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,900
So, don't give up.

320
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,870
Okay?

321
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:57,590
♫ I take my time listening to
the sound of falling snow ♫

322
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,370
♫ Closing my eyes and
hoping that it won't stop ♫

323
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,850
♫ You can't approach me ♫

324
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,910
♫ Not because I'm too ruthless ♫

325
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,850
♫ It's just that I want to
see the other world ♫

326
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,400
♫ I take my time listening to
the sound of falling snow ♫

327
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,140
♫ As if you're whispering
sweet nothings in my ear ♫

328
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:31,350
♫ I open my eyes to the ruthless snow
all over the sky ♫

329
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,920
♫ Who will compensate me for
the lost good prospects in this life? ♫

330
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,770
[11th Year of Qianlong]

331
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:02,920
♫ Who will compensate me for
the lost good prospects in this life? ♫

332
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,840
This is such a joyous event.
Why are you crying?

333
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,800
I'm happy.

334
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,950
You've gone too far.

335
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,080
Go ahead and cry.

336
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,680
-My beloved consort.
-Your Majesty.

337
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,080
Greetings...

338
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,000
You are pregnant.
No need for such formalities.

339
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,020
Come here. Have a seat.

340
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,660
I can't sit down.

341
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,950
The baby is kicking me.

342
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:02,030
The imperial physician told me that
the baby keeps disturbing you all night.

343
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,540
The baby is clearly a naughty child.

344
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,440
But you are...

345
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,480
intelligent, mature and talented.

346
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,680
If the baby is a little prince,

347
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,010
he will surely be very intelligent
and win my favour.

348
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,900
If the baby is a little princess,

349
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,390
she will surely be elegant,
graceful and adorable.

350
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,940
Is the baby kicking you again?

351
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,710
Your Majesty,

352
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,200
the baby said that he wants to
hear you play the zither.

353
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,160
You want to hear me play the zither?

354
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,130
Is that okay, Your Majesty?

355
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,810
Sure.

356
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,190
It's the baby's request.
Of course I have to fulfil it.

357
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,720
His Majesty is playing the zither.

358
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,530
How do you know, Your Highness?

359
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,970
Besides being at the top, His Majesty
is also proficient in arts and literature.

360
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,700
How could I not distinguish it?

361
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,370
His Majesty is in a rare aesthetic mood.
If I go in now, I might disturb them.

362
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,750
No need to inform them of my visit.

363
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,880
Yes, Your Highness.

364
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,360
Your Highness,

365
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,710
The mistress of Zhongcui Palace
is now highly favoured.

366
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,900
If she really gives birth
to a little prince,

367
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,630
will her status surpass you?

368
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,040
There are so many women in the harem.

369
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,070
As for whom His Majesty favours and
gets the chance of being pregnant,

370
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,670
it's all up to fate to decide.

371
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,820
Listen to yourself.

372
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,700
Do you want me to stop others
from giving birth?

373
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,700
If I have to do that,
I'll have a full plate.

374
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,800
Your Highness, now is not the time
for you to joke around.

375
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,050
Think about it. Her Majesty is sick now.

376
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,650
Consort Chun is pregnant.

377
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,830
You should seize this opportunity.

378
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,910
Only by giving birth to a royal heir
can you secure your position.

379
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,550
Silly girl.

380
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,920
Now is not the time.

381
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,150
I still have a lot of work to do.

382
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,790
Let's go.

383
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,240
[Qianqing Palace]

384
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,140
Liu He, what a nerve you have!

385
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,910
You dare you cheat on the task
that is assigned to you?

386
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,880
Your Highness.

387
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,190
I've already delivered all the
leather fabrics that you had asked me to.

388
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,120
They are all top-quality fabrics.

389
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,720
How many people
did you send to do the job?

390
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,570
Four eunuchs.

391
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,550
But they kept buttering up
my father to confusion...

392
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,070
and got a reward from him.

393
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,550
Two hundred taels for four people.

394
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:24,050
The Imperial Household Department
is indeed bold.

395
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,900
Your Highness! I...

396
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,180
I didn't know about it.

397
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,360
Although His Majesty
has pardoned my father...

398
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,890
and he has been reinstated,

399
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,040
he's still as uncorrupted as before.

400
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,660
But in order to reward those eunuchs,

401
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,830
he even pawned off the gifts
that I gave him.

402
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,420
Forgive me, Your Highness.

403
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,080
I didn't discipline them well.
I deserve to die.

404
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,340
I deserve to die.

405
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,760
-I deserve to die.
-Enough.

406
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,340
Tell me, how should we handle this?

407
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.
I will get rid of them.

408
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,330
They won't appear in front you ever again.

409
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,100
One of them is your assistant.

410
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,210
If he dies, there'll be a vacancy.

411
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,280
Of course I'll leave it up to you
to choose...

412
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,720
the candidate for that post.

413
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,820
Yuan Chun Wang!

414
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,640
Greetings, Noble Consort Xian.

415
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,090
You did very well as
the supervisor of Labour House.

416
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,860
From now on, follow Supervisor Liu...

417
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,070
and learn how to manage
the palace affairs.

418
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,920
Don't disappoint me.

419
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

420
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,990
I'll do my very best to serve you
at the expense of my own life.

421
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,840
Yuan Chun Wang,

422
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,840
in just a short period, you've been
promoted to assistant supervisor.

423
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,550
You must have spent a lot of effort on
Noble Consort Xian.

424
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,420
Supervisor Liu, you are too kind.

425
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,080
From now on, please guide me well.

426
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,680
You are here, Master Fu Heng.

427
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,140
I'll inform Her Majesty
about your arrival.

428
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,950
Ying Luo, you can leave now.

429
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

430
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,480
Sister,

431
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,330
I heard that you can walk normally again.

432
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,660
Our mother is ecstatic.

433
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,620
She insisted on entering
the palace to visit you.

434
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,280
But since the start of spring,

435
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,000
her vision has gotten worse.

436
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,770
His Majesty has agreed to let Ye Tian Shi
go to the Fuca mansion to diagnose her.

437
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,570
Unfortunately, he said that...

438
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,840
her illness has been
neglected for too long.

439
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,300
It can't be cured anymore.

440
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,330
I'm too unfilial.

441
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,680
This is my fault.

442
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,710
She also said that your full recovery...

443
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,840
means that the amulets are working.

444
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,140
When her eyes are better,
she'll go and ask for more.

445
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:00,310
She hopes that you can live a peaceful
and worry-free life in the palace.

446
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,620
Fu Heng,

447
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,159
His Majesty told me that
you are doing very well in your job.

448
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,090
So, he plans to send you to Shanxi
for more training.

449
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,610
In just a few years,

450
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,739
you have gone up the ranks so quickly.

451
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,960
Now, you're going to become
the governor of Shanxi.

452
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,469
What an amazing grace.

453
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:29,150
But I have to...

454
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,179
remind you this.

455
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:35,940
Being on the rise so quickly...

456
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,360
is not necessarily a good thing.

457
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,790
Sister, don't worry.

458
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,540
I know how to act properly.

459
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,080
I won't disappoint His Majesty...

460
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,440
and bring humiliation to Fuca Family.

461
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,360
You have always been diligent
when it comes to official matters.

462
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,219
So, I've never worried about you.

463
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,570
But lately,

464
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,520
Er Qing has been visiting me very often.

465
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,300
She is full of grievances.

466
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,700
Official work is indeed important,

467
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,100
but can't ignore your wife.

468
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,100
Sister.

469
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,210
There are things that...

470
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,130
need to be let go...

471
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,390
when it's time to do so.

472
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,040
Ying Luo has already let it go.

473
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,800
Why can't you?

474
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,560
Could it be that
you're pettier than a woman?

475
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,510
Sister, don't worry.

476
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,070
I will take good care of Er Qing.

477
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,760
I won't be unfaithful to her.

478
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,020
Ying Luo,

479
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,930
aren't you sad?

480
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,580
Her Majesty has fully recovered.

481
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,820
I'm so happy about it, why would I be sad?

482
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,440
I thought that after seeing
Imperial Guard Fuca,

483
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,100
those sad memories would
come back to haunt you.

484
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,460
Ming Yu.

485
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,240
Have you ever seen a refugee before?

486
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,400
Refugee?

487
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,710
When there is a disaster,
many refugees will enter the capital.

488
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,260
You can buy yourself a slave
with just a bowl of warm soup.

489
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,230
From that moment onwards,
I realised that...

490
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,800
nothing else is...

491
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,890
more important than survival.

492
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,690
So, with this kind of family background,

493
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,240
I don't have the luxury
to be troubled by love.

494
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,900
I'm very busy.

495
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,430
How are you busy?

496
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,410
I'm busy making lotus cake.

497
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,230
Wei Ying Luo, how dare you dirty my face!

498
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,470
I'll settle the score with you!

499
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,870
Have you sent the letter?

500
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,520
Yes. But I'm afraid that Young Master
will be unhappy about it.

501
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,490
Why will he be unhappy about it?

502
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,760
Fuca family and Hitara family
are relatives by marriage.

503
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,820
We stand together and fall together.

504
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:10,680
I wrote to my grandfather
for the sake of mutual help.

505
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,610
He's very inflexible.
So, I'll have to do it instead.

506
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,840
By the way,

507
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,720
I asked you to invite those mistresses
to come for a flower-viewing tomorrow.

508
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,850
-Have you made the arrangements?
-Don't worry. I've sent out the letters.

509
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,480
Look.

510
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
What is it?

511
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,570
Young Mistress, I noticed that
every time you leave your court,

512
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,590
Fourth Young Master
will secretly look at you.

513
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,920
This has happened several times already.

514
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,020
Young Mistress,
that is Young Master's study room.

515
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,510
-Let's go back.
-Why?

516
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,650
I can't enter the study room of Fu Heng?

517
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,060
But Young Mistress,
other than the study room's cleaners,

518
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,720
no one else is allowed to go in.

519
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,580
Young Mistress.

520
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,650
What is it that you are hiding?

521
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,440
I...

522
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,250
I asked, what is it that you are hiding?

523
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,370
Young Master!

524
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,030
Young Master, you're finally back.

525
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,200
-What's wrong?
-Go to the study room now.

526
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,920
Qing Lian is about to die.

527
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,790
Er Qing, what are you doing?

528
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,530
What am I doing?

529
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,350
Isn't it clear?

530
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,400
Take her away.

531
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,820
All of you, get out!

532
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,120
I'm not done with her yet!

533
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,300
I'm not done with her yet!

534
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,160
I've asked everyone to leave...

535
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,940
to save your dignity.

536
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,900
-Are you going to keep on making trouble?
-I'm making trouble?

537
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,360
I'm making trouble?

538
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,090
Fuca Fu Heng,

539
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,090
we've only been married for a year.

540
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,690
You live in your study room every day
and never come into my room.

541
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,560
So, it's all because of her?

542
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,470
What did you say?

543
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,370
I saw it with my own eyes.

544
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,250
I saw her making your bed for you
with my own eyes.

545
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,630
You always study in the company of
a beautiful lady. So pleasurable!

546
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,440
You left me all alone in the room.

547
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,160
How could you treat me like this?

548
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,000
You've misunderstood.

549
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,250
What is it then?

550
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,700
What is it then?

551
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,840
What is it then?

552
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,270
I'm new to the Ministry of Revenue.

553
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,550
I don't have a grasp on it yet
and there are so many things to do.

554
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,610
I neglected you because I am too busy.

555
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,760
But it has nothing to do
with that maidservant.

556
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,720
I won't believe you anymore!

557
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,520
For the past year, I've been longing
and waiting for you every day.

558
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,560
But how did you treat me?

559
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:25,530
You promised me that
we'll live a good life together.

560
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,380
But have you kept your promise?

561
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,960
You've lost your reason.

562
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,520
We'll talk again when you've calmed down.

563
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,270
You are not allowed to leave!

564
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,350
You are no allowed to leave
until you explain it to me!

565
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,860
You have to make this clear to me!

566
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,570
Fuca Fu Heng!

567
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,490
You said that
you don't have an affair with her.

568
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,730
This is the evidence.

569
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,920
This is the evidence!

570
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,400
Fuca Fu Heng!

571
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,010
That hairpin...

572
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,520
was a gift for you initially.

573
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,710
But from the looks of it now,
I don't need to do that anymore.

574
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,330
Fu Heng!

575
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,730
Butler Liu.

576
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,210
-Young Master.
-How is she?

577
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,480
-Young Master, she...
-Be honest with me.

578
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,840
The physician has examined her.

579
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,370
Young Mistress has beaten her up
with a heated iron broomstick.

580
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,760
All of her fingernails
have been plucked out.

581
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,820
Her hands are drenched in blood.
It's really horrible.

582
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,890
She's a lunatic.

583
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,560
Why will a maidservant
enter my study room?

584
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,240
The original cleaner
of your study room is sick.

585
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,970
So, I had someone replaced him.

586
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,130
I never thought that Young Mistress
would walk in on her.

587
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,370
Continue with her treatment.
Tell her to recuperate in peace.

588
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,410
Young Master!

589
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,110
Young Master.
