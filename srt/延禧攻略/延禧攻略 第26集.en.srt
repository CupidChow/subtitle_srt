[Episode 26]

3
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,640
If he likes me,

4
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,380
I can't do anything about it.

5
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,620
If you hadn't been shameless
enough to seduce him,

6
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,330
he wouldn't have liked you.

7
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,640
Ming Yu.

8
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,770
He doesn't like you.

9
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,570
You should go question him.

10
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,000
Why do you want to get even with me?

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,460
You know very well that...

12
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,340
that even if you go see Fu Heng,

13
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,320
you won't get his favour.

14
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,440
If you come and see me,

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,450
you can verbally attack me...

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,110
and save your face.

17
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,540
Aren't you bullying
the weak in another way?

18
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,860
What are you doing?

19
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,880
Have you forgotten how hot-tempered I am?

20
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,840
-It hurts!
-How dare you act wildly here!

21
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,750
It hurts!

22
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,020
I'm being gentle.

23
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,950
-Why are you shouting?
-My bone is about to break.

24
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,260
Let go now!

25
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,050
I hurt my hand.

26
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,730
And you held it.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,079
You're really a bad woman.

28
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,320
It hurts!

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,260
-What are you doing?
-Stop shouting.

30
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,670
It isn't broken.

31
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,130
It's just a hand sprain.

32
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,330
Be gentle!

33
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,840
I'm massaging it for you.

34
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,390
Wei Ying Luo.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Are you trying to take revenge on me?

36
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,290
I learned some massage techniques
from Physician Ye.

37
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,600
It can treat sprains.

38
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,480
If you had broken your bone,

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,540
I wouldn't have been able to help you.

40
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,800
Ming Yu.

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,930
Since Fu Heng doesn't like you,

42
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,480
go find someone else.

43
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,630
Fu Heng...

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,600
isn't the only man in this world.

45
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,610
You're being unscrupulous...

46
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,960
because he likes you.

47
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,370
All men are as stupid as him.

48
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,200
They like evil women like you.

49
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,560
Yes...

50
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,490
I'm an evil woman.

51
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,050
Do you still want me to massage your hand?

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,480
You should do it for me!

53
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,730
Because you stole my crush.

54
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,240
Only if you two like each other
can it be considered stealing.

55
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,520
Yours is one-sided love.

56
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,160
And you had the audacity to scold me.

57
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,910
Don't be proud.

58
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,510
Many people like Guard Fuca.

59
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,380
You'll get into trouble sooner or later.

60
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,470
This is not a trotter!

61
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,320
Can't you do it gently?

62
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,490
Don't use your right hand for days.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
I'm going to practice calligraphy now.

64
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,159
No.

65
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,670
My hand feels much better.

66
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,630
Keep massaging it.

67
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,280
I need to practice calligraphy.

68
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,510
Keep massaging it.

69
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,440
Keep massaging it.

70
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,260
-I won't do it...
-It hurts.

71
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,159
-I won't do it.
-Please.

72
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,440
Does it still hurt?

73
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,080
It feels much better.

74
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,420
Er Qing.

75
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,790
Guard Fuca, you're here.

76
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,560
I'll go tell Her Majesty.

77
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,510
Thank you.

78
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,480
Young Master.

79
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,930
Young Master, don't you see me?

80
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,110
Young Master.

81
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,080
Did you sprain your neck?

82
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,050
Guard Fuca, Her Majesty invites you in.

83
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,160
What did you say?

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,800
Your Majesty.

85
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,780
I said I want to marry Ying Luo.

86
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,520
Fu Heng.

87
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,280
Ying Luo is strong-willed.

88
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,140
Would she be willing to be a concubine?

89
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,960
I'm afraid in less than six months,

90
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,760
she'd turn the Fuca family upside down.

91
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,580
You seem to know Ying Luo better than me.

92
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,580
Since that's the case,

93
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,210
why do you consider her as a concubine?

94
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,840
You mean...

95
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,760
I'm going to marry her...

96
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,790
as my wife.

97
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,880
Fuca Fu Heng.

98
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,080
Do you know what you're saying?

99
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,120
I know.

100
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,920
The Wei family is just a servile family
working in Imperial Household Department.

101
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,740
But I'm confident I can convince
Father and Mother...

102
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,070
to allow me to marry her.

103
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,480
Father is very old-fashioned.

104
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,600
Would he allow you to marry a woman
of unequal social rank?

105
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,560
I have your support, don't I?

106
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,320
I see,

107
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,520
you're counting on me.

108
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,660
I'll never forget...

109
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,490
the love and care that
our parents gave me.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,330
I won't argue with them about my marriage.

111
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,409
That's an unfilial act.

112
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,880
But if you want me to
get married and have a baby,

113
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,840
it'll have to be someone I like.

114
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,330
Otherwise,

115
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,570
I won't get married.

116
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,340
I'd rather be single forever.

117
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,090
Sister.

118
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,520
I'm not being willful or reckless.

119
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,450
And I'm not trying to threaten you.

120
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,900
I just wanted to tell you my thoughts.

121
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,210
You should know me well.

122
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,120
I won't...

123
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,840
go back on my words.

124
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,930
Even if...

125
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,240
I can help you convince Father and Mother,

126
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,900
Ying Luo is...

127
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,310
a palace maid after all.

128
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,800
What will you do?

129
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,970
I'll figure out a way.

130
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,740
Fu Heng.

131
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,270
Ying Luo gets up early...

132
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,760
and goes to bed late
just to practice calligraphy.

133
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,960
She practiced with needles
for eight hours...

134
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,880
just to win a game.

135
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,600
She's patient and determined enough...

136
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,679
to be so ruthless to herself,

137
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,680
not to mention others.

138
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,890
If some day...

139
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,430
you let her downâ€¦

140
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,400
Sister.

141
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,840
I get what you mean.

142
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,400
I sincerely like Ying Luo.

143
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,240
I'm willing to accept
everything about her.

144
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,040
Her strength.

145
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,470
Her weakness.

146
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,450
Her strong love and hatred.

147
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,160
Her gratitude and grudge.

148
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,430
I never make promises.

149
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,940
But if I marry Wei Ying Luo,

150
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,960
I'll treat her well forever.

151
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,930
I'll never let her down.

152
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,350
Fu Heng.

153
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,050
Have you asked Ying Luo?

154
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,430
Is she willing to marry you?

155
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,360
Even if she has a cold heart,

156
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,850
I'll warm it with my sincerity.

157
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,610
I believe...

158
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,260
she'll eventually give me her heart.

159
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,520
Didn't you ignore me?

160
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,880
Since I ignored you,
couldn't you approach me?

161
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,480
I tried to talk to you.

162
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,400
But you didn't answer me.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,750
Tell me, what day is today?

164
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,110
What day?

165
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,650
It's the Daughter's Festival!

166
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,780
Is the Qixi Festival just
the Daughter's Festival?

167
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,160
What else can it be?

168
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,760
Figure out yourself.

169
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,560
It's the Daughter's Festival.

170
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,080
Er Qing.

171
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,160
Ming Yu.

172
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,760
Your hand hasn't recovered.

173
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,520
Why are you sewing?

174
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,410
I brought you ointment.

175
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,080
Apply it and massage your hand.

176
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,240
You'll be fine soon.

177
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,440
Ying Luo has massaged it for me.

178
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,680
I feel much better. Thank you.

179
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,760
When did you and Ying Luo
become good friends?

180
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,840
She even massaged it for you.

181
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,320
Is it because she felt guilty?

182
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,720
Come to think of it,

183
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,560
even if there were not Wei Ying Luo,

184
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,030
Guard Fuca would never like me.

185
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,160
I tried to mess with her...

186
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,880
because I felt defeated.

187
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,560
That's so embarrassing.

188
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,610
Ying Luo is smart and critical.

189
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,840
That makes her
a cunning and crafty person.

190
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,500
And you have a one-track mind.

191
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,220
I'm afraid you'll be bullied.

192
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,890
This is the best time...

193
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,590
for you to give up.

194
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,470
Actually,

195
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,320
I've always thought that...

196
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,000
even though we're all palace maids,

197
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,400
she's born lucky.

198
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,410
Her Majesty protects her all the time.

199
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,790
When she marries...

200
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,080
Guard Fucha...

201
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,490
and becomes the wife of a noble,

202
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,760
she'll be different from us.

203
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,640
Marrying Guard Fucha?

204
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,840
That's impossible.

205
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,960
Why not?

206
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,960
Her Majesty likes her so much.

207
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,690
Of course she won't upset her.

208
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,200
With Her Majesty's support,

209
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,400
the Fucha family won't refuse it.

210
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,920
Both of us...

211
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
are not that lucky.

212
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,330
Er Qing.

213
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,990
You're very pretty and talented.

214
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,420
Your grandfather is
the Minister of Justice...

215
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,160
and the deliberative minister.

216
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,560
You're far better than ordinary beauties.

217
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,970
Unfortunately...

218
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,340
As the bondservants of...

219
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,600
the Bordered Yellow,

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,130
Plain Yellow, and Plain White Banner,

221
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,810
we're directly managed by His Majesty...

222
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,850
We get promoted faster than
the nobles of other banners.

223
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,760
But we can't erase...

224
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,280
our identity as the servants of
Imperial Household Department.

225
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,450
Although my grandfather
is a high-ranking official,

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,770
he has to get down of the palanquin,

227
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,420
salute to these banner heads.

228
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,480
and bow down to them.

229
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,020
This is the rule of Eight Banners.

230
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,850
As for me,

231
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,690
I intended to apply for exemption.

232
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,480
But my father made a mistake...

233
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,400
and the plan failed.

234
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,240
I was left with no choice
but to serve in the palace.

235
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,850
And I'll never...

236
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,680
have my day.

237
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,480
It's not necessarily so.

238
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,670
If His Majesty likes you one day,

239
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,750
you'll become a concubine.

240
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,120
Your family may get promoted
to a higher rank.

241
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,130
Then,

242
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,330
Wei Ying Luo won't compare to you.

243
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,710
Ming Yu.

244
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,080
Stop talking nonsense.

245
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,200
If not, I'll give a slap to your mouth.

246
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,590
I was wrong...

247
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,520
I was just kidding.

248
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,550
Don't worry.

249
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
You've served Her Majesty loyally.

250
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,660
She'll definitely find you a good husband.

251
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,570
Stop it!

252
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,360
If you don't stop,

253
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,320
I'll never talk to you again.

254
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,560
Er Qing.

255
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,120
Help!

256
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,730
Her Majesty has passed out!

257
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,400
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

258
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,360
Her Majesty is pregnant.

259
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,080
Really?

260
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,510
This is about your heir.

261
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,950
I dare not lie to you.

262
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,080
Your Majesty.

263
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,960
Her Majesty has been pregnant
for over two months.

264
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,020
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

265
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,920
Empress.

266
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,440
Did you hear that?

267
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,510
His Majesty,

268
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,000
I did.

269
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,540
We've got a son again.

270
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,650
I'm so happy.

271
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,880
His Majesty,

272
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,680
don't count your chickens
before they hatch.

273
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,210
We're not sure if
it's a prince or a princess.

274
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,190
No.

275
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,880
It must be a little prince.

276
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,260
God took Yong Lian away.

277
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,640
He'll give me a son.

278
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,880
I'll reward everyone
in the Changchun Palace.

279
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,800
No.

280
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,320
I'll reward everyone
in the Forbidden City.

281
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,270
His Majesty, don't do that.

282
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,280
If you celebrate like this,

283
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,930
it'll do our child's fortune harm.

284
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,680
You're right.

285
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,970
I can't do our child's fortune harm.

286
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,920
Listen here.

287
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,440
Starting from today,

288
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,040
do take good care of Empress.

289
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,580
If Empress get injured...

290
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,320
due to your negligence,

291
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,770
I'll kill you all.

292
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,830
-Yes.
-Yes.

293
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,840
Yes.

294
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,359
Stop.

295
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,490
Greetings, Your Highness.

296
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,310
Consort Xian, you're in a hurry.

297
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,280
Where are you going?

298
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,609
Your Highness,

299
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,250
I'm going to the Changchun Palace
to congratulate Her Majesty.

300
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,450
If I'm not mistaken,

301
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,970
your mother...

302
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,840
passed away not long ago, right?

303
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,560
Yes.

304
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,630
Your mother and brother just passed away.

305
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,760
And you're going to congratulate others.

306
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,520
I really admire...

307
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
your forbearance.

308
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,540
Mourning is all about sincerity.

309
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,290
One should be filial...

310
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,160
when his parents are still around.

311
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,390
After they die,

312
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,350
he shouldn't pretend to be filial.

313
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,050
Moreover,

314
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,560
I'm in the palace.

315
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,200
If I mourn for my late mother,

316
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,860
it'll be a great disrespect
to the royal family.

317
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,400
But...

318
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,310
I'll always remember her.

319
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,960
It sounds like you resent me.

320
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,800
I dare not.

321
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,680
Since you can tell the sincere filialness
from the insincere one,

322
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,880
why can't you tell the genuine kindness
from the fake one?

323
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,670
What do you mean?

324
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,760
Figure it out by yourself.

325
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,600
Let's go.

326
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,930
Greetings, Your Highness.

327
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,900
How's Her Majesty doing?

328
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,950
Her Majesty is doing well.

329
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,300
Don't worry.

330
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,000
But I'm so regret...

331
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,450
to find out about your brother's death...

332
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,830
because I didn't treat him at once.

333
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,190
Your Highness.

334
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,580
You have my deepest condolences.

335
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,210
Treating Chang Shou?

336
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,780
I was instructed by Her Majesty...

337
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,640
to go to the prison
of Ministry of Justice.

338
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,680
But I don't know why I was withdrawn.

339
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,340
Had I been able to treat
your brother at once,

340
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,670
he might have survived it.

341
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,980
Enough.

342
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,760
Your Highness.

343
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,980
I'm going to greet Her Majesty.

344
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,880
You may go now.

345
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,040
Yes, Your Highness.

346
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,820
Did you know?

347
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,280
Although His Majesty didn't
celebrate it in a big way

348
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,100
he wore his smile for days.

349
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,830
I've never seen him acting that way.

350
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,160
Since the establishment of Great Qing,

351
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,030
there wasn't an empress
who gave birth to a son.

352
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,000
His Majesty has been meaning
to have a son with Your Majesty.

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,320
-And now...
-Here.

354
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,150
His Majesty is happy...

355
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,560
because...

356
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,710
God cruelly...

357
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,480
took away our first son.

358
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,470
And now He granted us
a prince as compensation.

359
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,640
But in my opinion,

360
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,320
I don't care it's a boy or a girl,

361
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,350
or whether he would become...

362
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,070
a crown prince.

363
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,660
I just want him to grow up...

364
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,660
safely and healthily.

365
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,040
Yes...

366
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,320
You're right.

367
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,640
I shouldn't have said that.

368
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,310
Please forgive me.

369
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,360
No.

370
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,160
You're a considerate person.

371
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,940
But I've always...

372
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,230
felt uneasy...

373
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,440
about one thing.

374
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,160
You told me that
Consort Xian's brother was gravely ill.

375
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,200
I asked the imperial physician...

376
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,930
to treat him at the prison
of Ministry of Justice.

377
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,250
But I found it inappropriate afterwards.

378
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,320
I was afraid people would talk about it...

379
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,800
and think that...

380
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,250
I was trying to bribe her...

381
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,800
for some motive.

382
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Thus,

383
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,720
I withdrew the imperial physician...

384
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,650
and granted her some gold instead.

385
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,160
I thought...

386
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,680
if I rewarded her with the gold
before everyone,

387
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,370
she could use it as she liked.

388
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,160
His Majesty always praises Her Majesty...

389
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,230
for being virtuous,
magnanimous, and selfless.

390
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,460
In my opinion,

391
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,200
she always tries to fish for fame
and pretends to be kind.

392
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,760
She could have asked the
imperial physician to save Young Master.

393
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,360
Instead, she decided to
grant you with the gold.

394
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,120
It looks like she wanted to help you.

395
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,920
In fact, she simply wanted to...

396
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,170
show everyone how virtuous she is.

397
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,800
Shut up!

398
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,210
Your Highness,
I'm taking up the cudgels for you.

399
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,700
Life and wealth...

400
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,370
are determined by Him.

401
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,330
It's destined in the unseen world.

402
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,240
That's the disaster in his life.

403
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,610
Your Majesty, you're not to blame.

404
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,850
Moreover,

405
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,070
I suggested...

406
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,460
to withdraw the imperial physician.

407
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,460
God should blame me...

408
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,790
for what happened.

409
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,210
This matter...

410
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,840
has been bothering me...

411
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,910
for so long.

412
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,780
I think...

413
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,150
I've wronged Consort Xian.

414
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,040
I feel like...

415
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,690
making an apology to her.

416
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,840
Your Majesty.

417
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,500
You can't do that.

418
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,410
Now,

419
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,580
Consort Xian no longer
indulges in sadness.

420
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,120
And she looks after
Fourth Prince wholeheartedly.

421
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,720
Why do you have to...

422
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,290
bring up her sad memories?

423
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,970
Your Majesty.

424
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,320
You're pregnant now.

425
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,140
You shouldn't overthink.

426
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,780
Instead, you should get more rest.

427
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,770
Hailan Cha.

428
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,090
Where is Fu Heng?

429
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,520
Your Majesty.

430
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,970
Guard Fuca went to
congratulate Her Majesty.

431
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,410
He frequents the Changchun Palace.

432
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,080
Besides visiting Empress,

433
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,600
does his crush work there?

434
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,040
Your Majesty, you're observant indeed.

435
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,480
I dare not lie to you.

436
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,530
But this is a private matter.

437
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,720
You should ask Fu Heng yourself.

438
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,510
I can know anything I want.

439
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,760
Yes...

440
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,320
And you'll help him if you want to.

441
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,010
How dare you talk with me like this.

442
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,200
Ask him to come and see me
when he gets back.

443
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,070
Yes.

444
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,040
[Changchun Palace]

445
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,160
Her Majesty is taking her nap.

446
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,760
You may have to wait for some time.

447
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,050
I'm taking my leave.

448
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,330
Stop.

449
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,280
Young Master,

450
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,800
what else can I do for you?

451
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,600
Have you figured out what I asked you to?

452
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,090
I'm not well read.

453
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,750
And I'm not knowledgeable.

454
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,640
I kept thinking about it.

455
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,280
But I still can't figure out
why you were angry.

456
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,410
Keep thinking until you figure it out.

457
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,760
Wei Ying Luo.

458
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,360
I'm so mad at you.

459
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,050
Don't talk to me now.

460
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,270
Young Master, are you really mad at me?

461
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,320
In fact,

462
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,110
I've made a perfume pouch...

463
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,770
and intended to gift it to someone.

464
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,740
But now,

465
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,860
I don't think it's necessary.

466
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,810
Where's the perfume pouch?

467
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,630
Young Master.

468
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,790
Isn't this...

469
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,390
inappropriate?

470
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,580
Give me the perfume pouch.

471
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,040
Were you mad at me...

472
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,790
because of the perfume pouch?

473
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,310
The cowherd and the weaver girl
meet during the Qixi Festival.

474
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,910
I wished my crush would
gift me a perfume pouch.

475
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,500
-Couldn't I?
-Who?

476
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,560
Who's your crush?

477
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,480
I've accepted the pouch.

478
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,530
You can't take back your words.

479
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,640
If not,

480
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,520
I'd complain to Her Majesty...

481
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,380
that you're being unfaithful...

482
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,010
and had abandoned someone.

483
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,440
Abandon?

484
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,520
It's not a word to describe a woman.

485
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,620
Young Master, stop teasing me.

486
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,540
Ying Luo.

487
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,520
Actually, I didn't come
to visit my sister,

488
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,590
I'm here to see you.

489
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,200
I have something important to tell you.

490
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,880
I know you're an overthinker.

491
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,970
But I hope...

492
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,560
you'll eventually stop being stubborn...

493
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,240
and find your own happiness.

494
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,120
Before then,

495
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,250
I'll protect you...

496
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,560
and wait until you open your heart to me.

497
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,540
Guard Fuca, you're back at last.

498
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,140
His Majesty has been
waiting for you. Hurry.

499
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,210
What's wrong with your eye?

500
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,430
I just did you a big favour.

501
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,590
You should thank me.

502
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,690
Guard Fuca!

503
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,520
Investigating censor Shen Shi Feng...

504
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,680
claimed that the Minister of Justice,
Lai Bao...

505
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,010
is incompetent for the position...

506
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,860
because he's inexperienced,

507
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,110
in spite of his diligence.

508
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,800
Fu Heng.

509
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,670
What do you think?

510
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,570
Lai Bao was diligent...

511
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,920
and was highly spoken of...

512
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,950
when he worked at the Ministry of Works.

513
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,840
Although he's still not familiar
with the justice affairs,

514
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,280
with his diligence,

515
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,560
he'll manage the Ministry of Justice
sooner or later.

516
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,030
I think

517
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,800
you should give him an opportunity.

518
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,790
How dare you!

519
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,380
How dare you defend Lai Bao...

520
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,890
for your own interests.

521
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,170
That's outrageous.

522
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,440
What do you mean...

523
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,750
by my own interests?

524
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,000
Enough!

525
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,080
Stop pretending to be ignorant...

526
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,920
in front of me.

527
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,950
I know your character well.

528
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,160
If you didn't like her so much,

529
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,190
you wouldn't have
frequented the inner court.

530
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,640
However,

531
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,490
among Her Majesty's maids,

532
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,300
Er Qing...

533
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,900
is gentle.

534
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,730
Ming Yu...

535
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,600
is a bit eccentric.

536
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,840
And the other one...

537
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,020
She's indescribable.

538
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,240
Thus,

539
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,160
you like Er Qing.

540
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,800
I totally get it.

541
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,070
Don't worry.

542
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,000
I'll promote her entire family...

543
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,640
so that she won't
bring disgrace upon your family.

544
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,470
Your Majesty.

545
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,870
I don't like Er Qing at all.

546
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,460
I defended Lai Bao...

547
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,300
simply because he's competent.

548
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,040
It's not Er Qing?

549
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,330
Could it be Ming Yu?

550
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,120
No.

551
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,880
Don't tell me...

552
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,640
you like Wei Ying Luo.

553
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,960
Your Majesty.

554
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,720
I don't want to lie to you.

555
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,320
But I do like Wei Ying Luo.

556
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,280
Darn it!

557
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,150
I really like Miss Ying Luo.

558
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,620
-Please give us your blessings.
-You...

559
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,280
I knew it!

560
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,510
That woman...

561
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,130
is vain and outrageous!

562
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,120
How dare she seduce you
when you went to visit Empress!

563
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,100
Your Majesty.

564
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,760
I like her,

565
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,260
but she never shows me any favour,

566
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,810
let alone seducing me.

567
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,560
You can just blame me.

568
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,140
It has nothing to do with Wei Ying Luo.

569
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,800
She has nothing to do with it?

570
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,590
Fu Heng.

571
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,760
With your character and family background,

572
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,360
you should marry a gentlewoman
from a noble family.

573
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,890
Not only was Wei Ying Luo...

574
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,000
born into a servile family working for
the Imperial Household Department,

575
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,920
she's an outrageous and cunning woman.

576
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,640
Fuca Fu Heng.

577
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,860
You should marry a virtuous wife.

578
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,600
If I let you marry such an immoral woman,

579
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,650
she'll ruin your life.

580
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,740
Listen here.

581
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,590
I can let you marry...

582
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,880
any gentlewoman...

583
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,960
from the Eight Banners,

584
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,200
except...

585
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,970
this woman.

586
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,270
-Your Majesty.
-Guard Fuca.

587
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,820
His Majesty is very angry.

588
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,900
Stop provoking him.

589
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,840
It's not good for Miss Ying Luo either.

590
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,880
Your Majesty.

591
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,220
I know Wei Ying Luo better than you.

592
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,340
Since I've made up my mind,

593
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,690
I won't give up easily.

594
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,090
I'm taking my leave.

595
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,120
Your Majesty, don't get angry...

596
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,060
Since he speaks so highly of Wei Ying Luo,

597
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,480
I'll show him...

598
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,880
what kind of woman she is.

599
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,480
If His Majesty likes you one day,

600
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,290
you'll become a concubine.

601
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,770
Your family may get promoted
to a higher rank.

602
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,710
Then,

603
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,890
Wei Ying Luo won't compare to you.

604
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,400
Greetings, Your...

605
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

606
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,370
Your Majesty.

607
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,050
You...

608
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,050
I'm sorry.
Please don't get angry, Your Majesty.

609
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,790
I felt giddy.

610
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,230
Why?

611
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,820
I accompanied Her Majesty yesterday night.

612
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,560
And I didn't sleep at all.

613
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,860
I was in a daze.

614
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,600
Please don't get angry, Your Majesty.

615
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,670
Forget it.

616
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,250
Go...

617
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,440
get some clean clothes
and gave them to Li Yu.

618
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,470
I'll get a change.

619
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,580
Yes.

620
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
Your Majesty.

621
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,310
I've been looking for Supervisor Li.

622
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,280
But he's nowhere to be found.

623
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,560
I'll help you get a change then.

624
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,450
Ask Wei Ying Luo in.

625
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
Your Majesty.

626
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,160
Didn't you hear me?

627
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,370
His Majesty's clothes are wet.

628
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,720
Send this for him.

629
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,640
It's Supervisor Li and
eunuchs' responsibility...

630
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,570
to help His Majesty get changed.

631
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,390
Why me?

632
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,760
It's His Majesty's order.

633
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,090
I dare not question him.

634
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,370
Go now.

635
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,490
Your Majesty.

636
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,400
Your clothes are here.

637
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,890
Your Majesty.

638
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,860
Wei Ying Luo.

639
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,160
I asked you to serve me.

640
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,470
How dare...

641
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,720
you ask others to do it!

642
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,830
Get in here.

643
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,510
Sister Ying Luo, His Majesty
wants you to serve him.

644
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,870
Your Majesty.

645
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,980
Change my clothes.

646
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,200
Yes.

647
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,120
Your Majesty.

648
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,930
Tell me.

649
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,800
Why on earth did you...

650
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,040
approach Fuheng?

651
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,480
Your Majesty.

652
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,920
I don't know what you're saying.

653
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,660
Stop pretending.

654
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,770
I've seen through
this pretty face of yours.

655
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,230
Fu Heng...

656
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,290
was born into a noble family...

657
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,010
and has good character.

658
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,250
You tried your best to approach him...

659
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,400
so that you could break away from
the fate as a servant...

660
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
and become the wife of a noble.

661
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,080
But don't you forget that...

662
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,590
Fu Heng is my brother-in-law.

663
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,290
Fucha family...

664
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,890
is my trusted subordinate.

665
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,260
I won't allow a woman like you...

666
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,920
to marry into the Fucha family.

667
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,350
I've never thought of marrying a noble.

668
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,800
I don't know why...

669
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,580
Your Majesty thinks so.

670
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,190
I don't know...

671
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,980
why Your Majesty...

672
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,200
has despised me...

673
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,340
since the very beginning.

674
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,440
Because you...

675
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,760
are rude...

676
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,160
and hateful.

677
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,860
Your Majesty is friendly with...

678
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,230
Ming Yu and Er Qing.

679
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,510
Do you hate me...

680
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
just because I'm not polite enough?

681
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,180
Other servants...

682
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,470
can perform their duties well.

683
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,880
I'm glad to reward them.

684
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,880
But you...

685
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,960
never...

686
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,560
respect others.

687
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,630
And you always break the rules.

688
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,280
If Her Majesty hadn't stopped me,

689
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,680
I would've killed you long ago.

690
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,510
If you want to climb up the ladder,

691
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,300
why don't you come on to me?

692
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,640
I can give you anything you want.

693
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,530
Thank you for your favour, Your Majesty.

694
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,780
I'm just a humble servant.

695
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,340
I dare not aim high.

696
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,930
I dare you to say that again.

697
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,540
I'm just a humble servant.

698
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,880
-I dare not aim high.
-You...

699
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,570
Wei Ying Luo.

700
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,770
For the sake of Empress,

701
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,670
I won't punish you!

702
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,080
But I'm warning you.

703
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,870
From today onwards,

704
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,840
stay away from Fucha Fu Heng!

705
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,230
What's that sound?

706
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,160
His Majesty was here.

707
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,680
I accidentally spilled the tea
on His Majesty's clothes.

708
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,140
Ying Luo went to serve him.

709
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,140
She...

710
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,090
Your Majesty.

711
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,070
There's something I want to say.

712
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,340
But I'm not sure if I should say it.

713
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,530
You've served me for so many years.

714
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,780
Just say it.

715
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,240
Your Majesty. Now that you're pregnant,

716
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,560
someone has started...

717
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,760
to misbehave.

718
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,620
You should be more cautious.

719
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,940
You mean Ying Luo?

720
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,440
It's impossible.

721
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,840
Of course Ying Luo won't do that.

722
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,240
It's not long
since she entered the palace.

723
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,520
But I can tell that...

724
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,560
she's loyal to Your Majesty.

725
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,660
She won't betray you.

726
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,910
What do you want to say?

727
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,010
Ying Luo won't betray you.

728
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,460
But others may do so.

729
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,560
Your Majesty.

730
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,230
If you want to promote someone,

731
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,540
why don't you recommend
Ying Luo to His Majesty?

732
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,610
Just to consolidate your love.

733
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,540
And she's from the Changchun Palace.

734
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,330
She'll definitely agree
to be your right hand...

735
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,320
because you've been taking care of her.
