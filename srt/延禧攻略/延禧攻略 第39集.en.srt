[Episode 39]

3
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,460
Is he willing...

4
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,610
to be my son again?

5
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,300
Your Majesty,

6
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,310
you're drunk.

7
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,710
Let's return to Yangxin Hall to rest.

8
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,270
Your Majesty.

9
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,820
I'm not going anywhere!

10
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,530
I want to stay here with Her Majesty.

11
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,180
I will stay with Her Majesty.

12
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,870
Li Yu.

13
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,070
It's late...

14
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,540
and chilly.

15
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,530
His Majesty just drank.

16
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,840
I'm worried he may get a chill.

17
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,450
Have His Majesty
stay with me tonight then.

18
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,940
Yes.

19
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,890
Ming Yu,

20
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,490
invite His Majesty
to rest in the east hall.

21
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,690
I will escort Your Majesty back inside.

22
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
So His Majesty feels the same as I do.

23
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,310
He has never forgotten Yong Lian.

24
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,370
Your Majesty,

25
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,250
don't think too much.

26
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,880
Have a good rest.

27
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,310
-Ying Luo.
-Hush.

28
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,460
Did you arrange matters
well in the east hall?

29
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,260
Supervisor Li is on guard.

30
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,810
His Majesty isn't happy...

31
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,030
so I ordered them to stay away...

32
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,110
to avoid getting into trouble.

33

[Ask Yong Lian.]

34
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,790
[I was busy with state affairs back then.]

35
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,580
[I never spent a day with him.]

36
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,330
[I never even hugged him.]

37
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,650
[Does he blame me?]

38
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,810
[Is he willing to be my son again?]

39

with Wei Ying Luo.]

What is this?

44
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,550
Hangover soup.

45
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,070
Hangover soup?

46
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,910
Go in.

47
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,940
Eunuch Li.

48
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,860
Who entered just now?

49
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:22,980
Eunuch Li,

50
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,520
she was delivering hangover soup.

51
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,580
-Did you check it?
-Yes, I did.

52
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,050
Your Majesty.

53
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,600
-Your Majesty!
-What are you doing?

54
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,020
There is noise inside.

55
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,730
Noise?

56
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,170
His Majesty favours her.

57
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,270
-That is her blessing.
-Yes.

58
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,810
Your life may be in danger...

59
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,030
if you peep inside again.

60
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,380
Yes...

61
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,840
Hu Po.

62
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,140
Did you deliver the hangover soup?

63
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,720
Yes, I did.

64
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,490
Then you can go to sleep now.

65
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,520
Yes.

66
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

67
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,630
Your Majesty.

68
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,760
Get lost!

69
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,690
Get lost!

70
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,900
Get lost!

71
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,200
Hu Po!

72
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,660
Sister Ming Yu.

73
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,620
What are you doing?

74
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,110
Last night, His Majesty was drunk
and vomited everywhere.

75
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,450
Supervisor Li ordered me to clean it up.

76
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,080
But why are you so nervous?

77
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,730
I have lots of chores to do.

78
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,440
I need to leave.

79
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,710
Wait.

80
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,560
Ming Yu.

81
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,150
Er Qing?

82
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,130
I'm leaving the palace today.

83
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,250
I came here...

84
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,039
to say farewell to you.

85
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,860
-So suddenly?
-Fu Heng is back to the capital.

86
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,680
I shouldn't stay here any longer.

87
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,050
Please send a message
to the Fuca's mansion...

88
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,760
when Her Majesty delivers.

89
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,130
Goodbye.

90
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,680
What's wrong?

91
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,390
His Majesty slept in
the east hall yesterday.

92
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,810
It seems he slept with a palace maid.

93
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,170
This is Changchun Palace.

94
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,610
If His Majesty is fond of a palace maid,

95
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,610
why wouldn't he tell Her Majesty?

96
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,350
Even if you're telling the truth,

97
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,510
why didn't the palace maid...

98
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,490
ask for promotion today
after getting favoured?

99
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,200
You're right.

100
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,590
But...

101
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,910
Never mind.

102
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,970
Maybe I saw it wrongly.

103
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,030
Third Sister-in-law!

104
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,130
You needn't be so formal.

105
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,970
I haven't seen you for a few days.

106
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,830
How are you, Fourth Young Master?

107
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,610
Thank you for your concern.

108
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,420
I've been well.

109
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,650
It seems you are very happy.

110
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,210
Is something good about to happen?

111
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,600
Well, of course.

112
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,740
I've endured for a quite long time.

113
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,750
Finally I found the best way
to vent my anger.

114
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,640
How can I not be happy?

115
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,530
I don't understand what you are saying.

116
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,730
What did you paint?

117
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,900
Open and let me see.

118
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,130
It's nothing.

119
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,010
You painted me.

120
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,060
So it's up to me...

121
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,640
to decide if it should be destroyed.

122
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,470
Third Sister-in-law.

123
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,990
You painted it very nicely.

124
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,850
Your Majesty,

125
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,770
all physicians from
the Imperial Academy of Medicine are here.

126
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,360
Her Majesty is blessed...

127
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,710
and she will surely give birth smoothly.

128
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,410
Hurry.

129
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,730
Water. More water.

130
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,190
Come on.

131
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,290
Your Majesty.

132
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,630
Ming Yu, this isn't good.

133
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,870
Your Majesty.

134
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,730
The baby's legs are facing downwards.

135
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,580
It's a breech birth.

136
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,570
Your Majesty, don't scare me.

137
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,250
I am so scared.

138
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,330
-You longed for this prince for so long!
-Your Majesty!

139
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,150
Don't give up, Your Majesty!

140
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,830
-Go and have a look now.
-Yes.

141
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,930
Hurry, find a solution...

142
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,790
If you can't save Her Majesty,

143
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,290
you won't end up well either.

144
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,320
The only solution is
to put a hand into the birth canal...

145
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,730
to touch the prince's foot.

146
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,450
May God bless Her Majesty.

147
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,610
If the prince is smart enough
to hold his own head,

148
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,020
there's still a chance.

149
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,520
Try it now.

150
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,140
But the chance is very slim.

151
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,780
It's too...

152
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,710
But it's better than seeing
Her Majesty's life in danger.

153
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,840
Hurry and try it.

154
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,550
Ying Luo, help me hold her upper body.

155
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:23,810
Hurry!

156
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,570
Ying Luo.

157
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,410
Ying Luo, what are you doing?

158
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,850
- Miss Ming Yu, are we still trying it?
-Your Majesty!

159
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,670
Yes!

160
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,990
Your Majesty.

161
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,310
Your Majesty.

162
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,020
-Ying Luo.
-Your Majesty.

163
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,210
Ying Luo.

164
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,850
Is Ying Luo here?

165
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,050
-Your Majesty, hold on.
-Ying Luo.

166
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,320
-Your Majesty, do your best.
-Your Majesty, don't give up.

167
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
Don't give up.

168
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,780
Your Majesty, push.

169
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,730
Push, Your Majesty.

170
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,720
Your Majesty, push...

171
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,350
Ying Luo, what is...

172
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,060
Did something go wrong?

173
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,280
Your Majesty, push.

174
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,600
Master Fu Heng,

175
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,760
Her Majesty is in labour.

176
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,450
Please wait in the side hall.

177
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,860
Your Majesty, push.

178
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,340
Push, Your Majesty!

179
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,250
Your Majesty, don't give up.

180
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,210
-Your Majesty.
-Almost..

181
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,010
-I am here.
-Your Majesty, push.

182
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,010
Your Majesty.

183
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,170
Your Majesty!

184
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,430
Your Majesty, push harder!

185
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,850
-Your Majesty!
-Push harder.

186
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,930
Cover your ears so you won't hear that.

187
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,670
Her Majesty isn't your mother.

188
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,060
She won't die.

189
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,870
She will be safe.

190
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,100
The tragedy will not repeat.

191
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,180
Everything will be fine.

192
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,230
In the past, you were bullied,

193
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,360
humiliated...

194
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,630
and even punished.

195
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,970
But you never cried.

196
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,000
Now you are crying.

197
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,720
Are you that scared?

198
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,070
Thank you, Lord Fu Heng.

199
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,900
I have to go back.

200
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,920
Ying Luo.

201
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,620
Greetings, Your Majesty.

202
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,210
Her Majesty gave birth smoothly,

203
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,740
so His Majesty is thrilled.

204
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,290
That was why he ignored you.

205
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,300
Let's go to have a look, too.

206
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,140
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

207
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,450
Both mother and baby are well.

208
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,920
It's a prince.

209
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,370
Your Majesty.

210
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,730
You have been waiting the whole day.

211
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,560
Now it's almost midnight.

212
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,820
Since everything is going on well,

213
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,570
-You should go back and rest...
-Li Yu.

214
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,050
Empress Dowager has been waiting too.

215
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,970
She must be anxious. Go and inform her.

216
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:44,950
Yes.

217
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,010
Your Majesty,

218
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,490
Seventh Prince is well-featured.

219
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,840
He has a propitious appearance.

220
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,900
This child...

221
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,480
resembles me.

222
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,070
Such a look...

223
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,760
is more than propitious.

224
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,330
His future blessings...

225
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,130
are boundless.

226
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,060
Right?

227
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,060
Right?

228
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,750
Everyone else is smiling.

229
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,580
Why are you crying?

230
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,000
Your Majesty.

231
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,180
I never saw you so frightened.

232
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,680
And I never saw you run away.

233
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,290
I'm sorry.

234
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,400
I was...

235
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,270
Everyone is elated due to
Seventh Prince's birth.

236
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,190
You're the only one...

237
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,700
by my side.

238
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,730
I understand...

239
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,930
your affection to me.

240
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,170
Thank you.

241
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,980
At that time,

242
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,240
I was really scared.

243
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,750
I lost my mother...

244
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,940
and my sister.

245
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,750
I was left alone.

246
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,290
Thank you for staying alive.

247
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,080
Empress,

248
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,260
I name him...

249
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,820
Yong Cong.

250
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,520
Do you like it?

251
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,580
Yes.

252
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,540
Ying Luo,

253
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,840
do you know...

254
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,290
what did His Majesty name Seventh Prince?

255
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,990
Yong Cong.

256
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,140
-Do you know what "Cong" means?
-I don't know.

257
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,450
Fool.

258
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,390
"Cong" means ware in an imperial court.

259
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,720
His Majesty intends
Seventh Prince to succeed...

260
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,450
Disaster emanates from careless talk.

261
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,610
But it's true.

262
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,330
Sixth Prince's name, "Rong"...

263
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,330
is the sound emitted
when jades collide with each other.

264
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,940
But the name of our Seventh Prince
means ware in an imperial court.

265
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,340
It is very obvious which one
is more important to His Majesty.

266
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,450
Yes.

267
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,090
I'm busy boiling medicine.

268
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,650
Why are you not happy at all?

269
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,080
When Her Majesty bore Seventh Prince,

270
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,080
she almost died of haemorrhage.

271
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,300
And the imperial physician
said that would shorten her life.

272
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,690
Why should I be happy?

273
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,310
As an Empress,

274
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,050
she has to have an heir
to hold her position firmly.

275
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,980
That is true for not just consorts,

276
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,720
but also for women elsewhere.

277
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,010
If one dies,

278
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,250
I don't see the point of...

279
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,050
being powerful and wealthy.

280
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,560
But Her Majesty doesn't care
about power or status.

281
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,090
She is satisfied with having
Seventh Prince.

282
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,500
A woman is still a human.

283
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,830
Her own life is the most important...

284
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,240
at all times.

285
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,870
Her Majesty is so lucky...

286
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,190
as she survived.

287
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,910
But what if she couldn't survive?

288
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,910
She would leave her baby motherless.

289
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,490
Can the baby survive
in the Forbidden City?

290
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Those bearing babies
at the risk of their own life....

291
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,340
are all fools.

292
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,480
Can I put it here?

293
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,860
Noble Consort Chun.

294
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,940
Noble Consort Xian.

295
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,970
Why...

296
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,130
is this chess still placed here?

297
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,730
I haven't figured it out yet,

298
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,190
so I kept it there.

299
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,140
Please sit down.

300
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,950
Her Majesty is frail...

301
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,850
and Seventh Prince is a newborn.

302
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,250
His Majesty has ordered that...

303
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,310
this New Year's Eve family dinner...

304
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,850
should be arranged at Qianqing Palace.

305
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,170
It should also end earlier...

306
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,630
lest Seventh Prince catch a chill.

307
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,030
I have never seen His Majesty...

308
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,570
cherish any prince...

309
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,340
this much.

310
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,050
Yong Cong is his legitimate son.

311
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,710
On his birthday, it rained...

312
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,810
and eased the great drought in Gansu.

313
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,970
Not just His Majesty,

314
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,970
even the Empress Dowager
said he is blessed by the heavens...

315
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,480
and has a good fortune.

316
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,510
Many people believe that...

317
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,880
when Seventh Prince grows up,

318
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,360
he will be most suitable successor.

319
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,730
Successor?

320
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,580
Late Emperor stated clearly...

321
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,330
that a successor
should be chosen secretly, right?

322
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,370
But that's just an apparent rule.

323
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,700
Don't you remember?

324
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,610
Though Late Emperor did not say expressly,

325
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,770
all the imperial clansmen
and ministers in court...

326
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,600
knew His Majesty
would be the future Emperor.

327
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,770
Now His Majesty cherishes
Seventh Prince so much.

328
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,420
They would surely understand it tacitly.

329
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,010
Even vassal kings
and foreign ambassadors...

330
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,910
sent in congratulatory gifts.

331
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,050
That's right.

332
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,970
Here, prince.

333
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,350
-Again.
-So His Majesty...

334
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,080
loves Seventh Prince so much.

335
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,850
In all generations of
the Great Qing emperors,

336
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,810
no legitimate heir
has ever succeeded the throne.

337
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,530
Not even Emperor Kangxi.

338
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,930
Thus, His Majesty
regards it as his aspiration.

339
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,570
Seventh Prince is still young.

340
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,530
Who knows whether he will qualify?

341
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,410
-How can he just inherit the throne?
-Yu Hu.

342
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,000
Don't talk recklessly.

343
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,900
Here.

344
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,470
Being a legitimate son...

345
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,130
is a great advantage.

346
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,180
How about arranging them in this way?

347
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,390
[When Seventh Prince grows up,]

348
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,190
[he will be the most suitable successor.]

349
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,130
[Being a legitimate son...]

350
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,390
[is a great advantage.]

351
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,920
It is done.

352
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,250
Don't cry...

353
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,060
I'll do it again for you.

354
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,860
Your Highness, what's wrong?

355
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,230
I'm sorry, Yong Rong.

356
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,200
It's all my fault.

357
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,970
I lost my temper and startled you.

358
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,660
I'm sorry.

359
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,170
I promise you.

360
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,300
I will give you...

361
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,010
all the best in the world.

362
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,940
Your Highness,

363
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,630
how about tattooing a lotus flower?

364
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,820
A lotus emerged untainted from the muck.

365
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,730
Raising cleanly above ripples of
water with an unaffected grace.

366
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,040
It is the most untainted flower,

367
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,520
just like your character.

368
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,330
Your Majesty,

369
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,160
have I said something wrong?

370
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,100
A lotus emerged untainted from the muck.

371
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,980
Raising cleanly above ripples of
water with an unaffected grace.

372
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,030
Wonderful.

373
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,880
What a wonderful idea.

374
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,340
Her Majesty agrees.

375
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,750
You can start now.

376
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,090
Yes.

377
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,140
Your Highness.

378
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,170
You said keeping this scar

379
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,460
will make His Majesty take pity on you.

380
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,310
As time passes by,

381
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,320
guilt and pity will become disgust.

382
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,540
I am not that dull.

383
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,470
Your Highness is wise.

384
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,430
Your Majesty,

385
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,340
do you think Noble Consort Chun
will take action?

386
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,110
Human greed knows no limit.

387
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,480
In the beginning, she only wanted a child.

388
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,350
But once the child is born,

389
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,900
she wants more.

390
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,530
I planted a thorn in her heart.

391
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,320
It will torment her day and night.

392
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,140
When she can no longer endure it,

393
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,440
it's time for her to make the move.

394
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,960
Who is there? Come out.

395
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,270
Your Majesty, just now,

396
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,160
I left a needle here carelessly.

397
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,990
Take it and leave.

398
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,140
Yes.

399
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,610
Former best friends are about to fight...

400
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,540
against each other for the title
of the crown prince.

401
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,290
I am...

402
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,030
looking forward to that so much.

403
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,360
Great.

404
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:51,500
-I don't know it's a girl or a boy.
-Mother.

405
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,410
You summoned me to return urgently.
What happened?

406
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,620
Fu Heng,

407
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,740
I'll tell you the big news.

408
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,540
You will be elated.

409
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,200
What is it?

410
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,400
Your wife...

411
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,600
is pregnant.

412
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,970
Her Majesty is fully recovered.

413
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,140
And Seventh Prince
is loved by His Majesty.

414
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,410
I wasn't worry about anything else...

415
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,320
except you.

416
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,650
But now,

417
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,760
I can be at ease.

418
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,140
Er Qing.

419
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,200
-Mother.
-You are a great blessing to our family.

420
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,830
Fu Heng,

421
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,930
you must take good care of her...

422
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,240
as good as possible.

423
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,440
Yes.

424
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,090
Let go of me!

425
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,080
Whose child is it?

426
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,230
Guess.

427
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,560
Tell me.

428
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,100
Whose child is it?

429
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,040
Many say...

430
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,590
Fuca Fu Heng is remarkably smart...

431
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,950
and shrewd.

432
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,250
You're working in the Grand Council
at a young age.

433
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,730
You're highly trusted by His Majesty,

434
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,710
with a promising prospect.

435
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,700
But to me,

436
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,780
that's vain talk.

437
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,500
Your own wife is pregnant,

438
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,950
but you don't even know who did it.

439
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,560
How funny.

440
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,120
What's wrong?

441
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:33,240
You can favour a maidservant.

442
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,450
I can turn to others, too.

443
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,540
The good reputation of the Fuca family...

444
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,330
and my mother's wish...

445
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,290
can't be destroyed by you.

446
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,850
I will not kill a woman.

447
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,530
You do it yourself.

448
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,560
So, no matter how lenient a man is,

449
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,120
he still can't allow
his wife to have an affair.

450
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,240
What a pity.

451
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,980
You can't kill me.

452
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,940
I won't kill myself either.

453
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,730
Because the family name of this child...

454
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,910
is Aisin Gioro.

455
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,070
Did you hear that clearly?

456
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,490
The child is a royal heir.

457
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,550
His father is the Emperor.

458
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,020
If you dare to hurt me,

459
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,790
you will face imminent catastrophe.

460
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:38,910
No.

461
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,730
His Majesty couldn't do such an act.

462
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,460
He will not.

463
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,870
But I could.

464
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,700
To find the chance,

465
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,520
I put in so much effort.

466
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,070
Why did you aim at His Majesty?

467
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,640
Fuca Fu Heng,

468
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,740
you are a gentleman.

469
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,130
A lot of women in the nation
wish to marry you.

470
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,850
Even Wei Ying Luo...

471
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,900
is completely infatuated by you too.

472
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,310
But I just want you to...

473
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,840
be humiliated.

474
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,170
I want to see you suffer.

475
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,210
Every time you kneel before His Majesty,

476
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,190
you will think of this.

477
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,800
Every time you are promoted,

478
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,710
you will attribute it to my pregnancy.

479
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:30,980
You hate me,

480
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,120
but you can't kill me.

481
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,590
You loathe this child,

482
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,700
but you have to raise him all your life.

483
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,050
I've thought of this idea for so long.

484
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,300
Isn't it extremely amusing?

485
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,060
You are not only evil and mean,

486
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,030
you are also crazy!

487
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,840
I am crazy!

488
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,980
That's because you and Wei Ying Luo
forced me into madness.

489
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,310
This is the price
you pay for insulting me.

490
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,590
You can never get rid of me in your life!

491
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:15,840
Don't go.

492
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,770
Don't go!

493
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,950
Come back!

494
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,830
Come back!

495
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,450
Are you scared now?

496
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,830
Why are you scared of turning around?

497
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,600
Fuca Fu Heng!

498
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,950
You're scared now.

499
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,560
You're scared now.

500
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,700
He's scared.

501
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,500
You hurt both him and yourself.

502
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,260
Why did you do that?

503
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,140
In the palace,

504
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,150
I served as a servant.

505
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,990
I endured and waited for six years.

506
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,820
I finally married him.

507
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,240
I thought I got a gentle and warm man...

508
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,480
with a brilliant future.

509
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,520
But in the end,

510
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,370
I was left alone...

511
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,120
miserably.

512
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,870
Why should I be...

513
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,620
the only one to endure such pain?

514
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,850
Fuca Fu Heng.

515
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,250
Your suffering...

516
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,440
has just begun.

517
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,710
Young Master.

518
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,600
From now on,

519
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,810
order someone to deliver
three meals a day to her room.

520
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,780
Young Mistress isn't allowed
to step out of her room.

521
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,810
Young Master, how can we do that?

522
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,120
What if your mother asks about it?

523
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,810
Young Mistress has a hereditary hysteria.

524
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,970
It gets worse upon getting pregnant.

525
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,640
To prevent her
from harming others and herself,

526
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,389
no one is allowed to visit her,
including my mother.

527
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,670
Hysteria?

528
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,480
Just do as I said.

529
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,170
Yes.

530
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,080
Ying Luo,

531
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,170
have you distribute
the New Year's Eve meal...

532
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,690
and bonus?

533
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,310
When I went to ask about it,

534
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,290
Noble Consort Xian
has already made the arrangements.

535
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,280
This year, everyone
in the palace gets a share.

536
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,290
Because the Imperial Household Department
received more tributes,

537
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,930
the bonus increased
by 10% compared to last year.

538
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,450
Everyone is thrilled.

539
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,630
Noble Consort Xian
does a good job as expected.

540
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,550
No wonder everyone praises her.

541
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,750
Why are you standing there?

542
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,340
Come here.

543
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,380
Come here.

544
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,260
Ignore her, Your Majesty.

545
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,830
She's petty.

546
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,700
She still blames
Seventh Prince for endangering your life.

547
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,860
It's been so long,
yet she has never looked at him.

548
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,460
Come.

549
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,620
Let me carry you.

550
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,330
Ying Luo, come here.

551
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,120
Let me carry Yong Cong.

552
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,470
Amuse him.

553
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:00,820
Your Majesty!

554
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,220
Ming Yu!

555
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,150
How do I amuse him?

556
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,240
Amuse him.

557
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:10,930
You...

558
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,520
You smile.

559
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,200
How do I amuse him?

560
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,010
Smile.

561
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,310
Carry him higher.

562
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,040
-Your Majesty.
-Give me a smile.

563
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,490
-Smile.
-There are news from the Wei family.

564
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,530
Miss Ying Luo's father is
gravely injured from falling off a horse.

565
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,330
He begs that Your Majesty allows
his daughter to go home to visit him.

566
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,290
Don't cry...

567
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,640
Ying Luo,

568
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,250
take my warrant...

569
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,660
and go out of the palace.

570
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,170
No,

571
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,560
I'm not going.

572
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,500
Just for a low position,

573
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,970
he used his own daughter...

574
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,930
as a bargaining chip.

575
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,990
I don't need a father...

576
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,540
like that.

577
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,340
Ying Luo,

578
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,650
filial piety is the foundation
of all virtues.

579
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,260
If you don't return home today,
in the future,

580
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,490
you will surely be criticised by others.

581
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,500
Your Majesty.

582
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:13,960
The more grudges you have in
your heart, the more pain you will feel.

583
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:19,150
The more gratitude you have in your heart,
the more blessing you will own.

584
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:25,010
This is a beaded bracelet
that I've always carried along.

585
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,330
Take it.

586
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,780
It can bless your father to be safe.

587
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,660
I'll go now and
get back as soon as possible.

588
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,060
If you return today,
the palace will surely be locked by then.

589
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,520
I'll return tomorrow.

590
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,280
Go now.

591
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,210
I'll be waiting for you here.

592
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,690
Your Highness,

593
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,030
Wei Ying Luo has left the palace.

594
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,750
Baby, go sleep now.

595
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,670
Baby, go sleep now.

596
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,800
Nuan Pavilion is on fire!

597
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,350
-Help!
-Your Majesty!

598
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,040
Nuan Pavilion is on fire!

599
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,880
Help! Help!

600
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,490
It's on fire! Nuan Pavilion is on fire!

601
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,610
Put out the fire! Hurry, put out the fire!

602
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,540
Help!

603
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,770
Hurry! Go get water!

604
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,840
Yes!

605
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,930
Hurry up! Go get water!

606
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,490
Why is it frozen?

607
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,650
You, go to the kitchen.

608
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,250
You two go to the back yard.
Get well water!

609
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,230
Yes!

610
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,210
The fire is too big.
We can't get in. What should we do?

611
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,290
What are you all doing?

612
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,050
Look for people to put out the fire now!

613
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,450
You two go to the backyard
and get well water!

614
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,520
-Yong Cong!
-Your Majesty!

615
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,560
-Yong Cong!
-Your Majesty! You can't go in!

616
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,090
Your Majesty!

617
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,630
-Let me go!
-Your Majesty!

618
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,760
Let me go!

619
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,400
Your Majesty! You can't go in!

620
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,100
Your Majesty!

621
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,010
Your Majesty!

622
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,670
-Help!
-Your Majesty!

623
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,820
Help!

624
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,130
Your Majesty!

625
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,560
Hurry!

626
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,080
Hailan Cha,
Her Majesty and Seventh Prince are inside!

627
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,840
Hurry, spray water!

628
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,890
Splash water!

629
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,390
Your Majesty!

630
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,970
Your Majesty!

631
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,570
-Be careful.
-Hurry!

632
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,930
Your Majesty!

633
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,280
Be careful!

634
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,210
Your Majesty!

635
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,300
Your Majesty!

636
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,020
Your Majesty!

637
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,340
Your Majesty, hurry and come out.

638
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,070
-Your Majesty.
-Yong Cong.

639
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,650
Seventh Prince.

640
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,000
Yong Cong.

641
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,830
Yong Cong!

642
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,430
Your Majesty,

643
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,460
Nuan Pavilion of Changchun Palace
has no underground flame path.

644
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,530
The charcoal brazier inside the room...

645
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,310
started the fire.

646
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,210
The brazier...

647
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,360
has a cover.

648
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,740
Where did the sparks come from?

649
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,570
Although the white coal
used in the brazier...

650
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,950
burns easily,

651
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,180
it easily produces sparks.

652
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,730
I suspect...

653
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,150
the eunuchs might've failed
to close the cover tightly,

654
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,970
causing the sparks to get out.

655
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,510
Jixiang jar...

656
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,170
has metal inner lining...

657
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:13,130
and charcoal to heat it up.

658
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,170
Why...

659
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,280
did the water still freeze?

660
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,400
Your Majesty,

661
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,960
eunuchs of Flame Department...

662
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,170
should have used
black charcoal to heat the water jar...

663
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:30,770
before the water freezes.

664
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:32,970
But...

665
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,510
yesterday was New Year's Eve.

666
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,570
The eunuchs...

667
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,610
They were negligent in their work?

668
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,700
Your Majesty,

669
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,850
there are a total of 12 eunuchs involved.

670
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,930
They are at your disposal.

671
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:55,890
Your Majesty!

672
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,810
I closed the brazier tightly.

673
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:00,250
I did check it beforehand, Your Majesty!

674
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

675
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,890
Four Jin of charcoal are burned in
the Jixiang jar every day.

676
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,030
Since the first day of November,

677
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,330
we have burned charcoal every single day!

678
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:06,450
I really don't know...

679
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,370
why the water froze.

680
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,490
I'm innocent!

681
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,690
The charcoal sparks indeed spread out
and the water in the jar indeed froze!

682
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,980
How dare you claim innocence!

683
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,300
All...
