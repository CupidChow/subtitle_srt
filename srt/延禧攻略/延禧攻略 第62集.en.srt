[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 62]

3
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,690
Where did this come from?

4
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,520
Your Highness,

5
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,070
the day before Sister Ming Yu
was due to leave the palace,

6
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,550
Concubine Shun sent her senior maid
to return an embroidery pattern.

7
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,990
At the time, I saw her
holding a carved box.

8
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,440
Madam Liu,

9
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,640
Her Highness is feeling unwell.

10
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,710
I'm afraid she won't be able to listen to
the lecture with Empress Dowager.

11
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,040
Is she alright? Have you
summoned the imperial physician?

12
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,040
I've urged her to do so many times...

13
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,010
but she's worried that His Majesty...

14
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,990
will be concerned and
make a big deal out of it.

15
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,240
She said she'll be fine
just eating some ginger soup.

16
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,450
And he's working on
the embroidered scripture...

17
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,640
for Empress Dowager.

18
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,590
She won't rest
no matter how I urge her to.

19
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,680
You ought to talk to her
and ask her to take care.

20
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,960
I'll go and inform Empress Dowager now.

21
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,890
Yes.

22
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,690
Mistress!

23
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,500
Mistress, you're getting wet!

24
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,890
Mistress!

25
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,530
Do I make myself clear?

26
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,330
That's Concubine Ling!

27
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,050
-The umbrella!
-I'll go get it.

28
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,740
Your Highness.

29
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,970
Your Highness, it's raining so hard.
Why are you here?

30
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,510
I want to see His Majesty.

31
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,970
His Majesty isn't seeing anyone.

32
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,240
Supervisor Li,

33
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,370
please tell His Majesty that I'm here.

34
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,250
I have an urgent matter.

35
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,330
Your Highness, it's not that
I don't want to help you.

36
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
-It's just that...
-Supervisor Li,

37
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,880
please help me.

38
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,550
I'll forever remember your kindness.

39
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,490
Your Highness,

40
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,120
I'll give it a try...

41
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,310
Your Highness, please leave.

42
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,400
His Majesty said he won't
see you no matter what.

43
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Let's go!

44
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,280
Mistress!

45
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,909
Mistress!

46
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,690
Mistress, you're getting wet!

47
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,320
Mistress, Concubine Ling is here.

48
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,750
Ying Luo.

49
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,530
You're here.

50
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,240
I was just about to go and see you.

51
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,670
See me?

52
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,680
I've given it a thought after I came back.

53
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,610
I think I'm partially responsible...

54
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,950
for Ming Yu's death.

55
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,410
How are you responsible for it?

56
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,560
She told me about her illness...

57
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,090
but she asked me to not tell anybody.

58
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,000
I didn't want you to be sad...

59
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,510
so I had kept it from you.

60
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,930
I never thought that she'd kill herself.

61
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,550
Ying Luo.

62
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,880
What are you laughing about?

63
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,670
Did you...

64
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
gift this to Ming Yu?

65
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,200
I noticed that her tools were all old...

66
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,320
so I gifted her a gold set.

67
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,810
I never thought that
it'd become her death sentence.

68
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,800
If I hadn't asked you,

69
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,000
would you have told me?

70
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,770
No.

71
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,960
Why?

72
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,740
I finally earned your trust.

73
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,919
I can't let this thing
alienate us from each other.

74
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,720
Ying Luo.

75
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,960
Ming Yu did something foolish
and I kept the truth from you.

76
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,010
We're just trying to protect you.

77
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,400
Tell me!

78
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
Why did you intentionally...

79
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,360
approach me?

80
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,790
I wanted to be your best friend.

81
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,470
Do best friends...

82
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,540
keep secrets from each other?

83
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,230
I did that for your sake.

84
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,420
You are lying.

85
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,780
I'm not.

86
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,600
Then why did you drive Ming Yu to suicide?

87
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,110
I didn't!

88
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,160
It's her own choice.

89
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,900
My biggest mistake...

90
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,420
was that I couldn't stop her.

91
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,870
But in turn,

92
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,560
I've helped you get rid of misery.

93
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,980
What are you saying?

94
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,110
Ying Luo.

95
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,120
Ming Yu was incurable.

96
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,950
But you must live well!

97
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,360
For better is a little loss
than a long sorrow.

98
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,960
Even if she were still alive,

99
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,360
how long could she live for anyway?

100
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,250
One day?

101
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,010
Two days?

102
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,760
Or a month?

103
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,010
She would only be more miserable
after marrying into the Dolar clan!

104
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,280
Choosing to end her own life...

105
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,250
was the biggest mercy for her!

106
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,130
I've helped you in my own way.

107
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,070
How can you blame me?

108
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,540
You're crazy!

109
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,610
Ying Luo, I'll say this one last time.

110
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,750
Ming Yu was living in great pain.

111
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,550
Death was the best choice for her.

112
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,930
You're not a god.

113
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,590
You're a human!

114
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,780
You can't control other people's emotions!

115
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,360
Let her go.

116
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,200
And you'll be free.

117
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,800
Shut up!

118
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,880
I did hide the truth from you.

119
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,180
And I even turned
a blind eye to her death.

120
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,400
If you can't forgive me...

121
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,240
What are you doing?

122
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,730
Take these scissors...

123
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,670
and stab them in my heart then!

124
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,640
Let go!

125
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,150
Let go!

126
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,960
Let go!

127
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,640
Don't just stand there! Stop her!

128
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,000
Your Highness!

129
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,620
Your Highness!

130
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,040
Your Highness!

131
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,680
-Chen Bi!
-Your Highness!

132
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,040
-Your Highness!
-Chen Bi!

133
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,230
-Chen Bi!
-Stop!

134
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,470
Chen Bi.

135
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,670
-Empress Dowager.
-Chen Bi!

136
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,120
Move!

137
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,150
-Chen Bi.
-Empress Dowager.

138
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,350
Let me see.

139
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,200
Summon the imperial physician now!

140
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,520
Summon the imperial physician!

141
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,470
Chen Bi.

142
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,290
Ying Luo.

143
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,570
Why?

144
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,960
Why did you do this to me?

145
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,710
Take her down!

146
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,010
Empress Dowager!

147
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,370
-Empress Dowager!
-Mistress!

148
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,120
-Chen Bi.
-Empress Dowager!

149
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,070
Empress Dowager!

150
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,520
Empress Dowager!

151
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,750
Empress Dowager!

152
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,030
Mother.

153
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,120
What happened?

154
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,810
Ask her.

155
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,330
Say it.

156
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,390
Today, Concubine Ling arrived angry.

157
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,800
She blamed Concubine Shun
for Miss Ming Yu's death.

158
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,590
But actually,

159
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,730
Ming Yu was gravely ill and incurable.

160
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,620
Concubine Shun pitied Ming Yu
and helped her cover up her illness.

161
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,720
And she got blamed for having done so.

162
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,270
Concubine Ling worked herself up
and accidentally...

163
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,890
stabbed Concubine Shun.

164
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,960
I'll go check on Concubine Shun.

165
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,090
Wait!

166
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,230
Mother,

167
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,910
I'm...

168
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,970
very worried about her injury.

169
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,610
The imperial physician has checked on it.

170
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Although there's a lot of bleeding,

171
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,830
it's a superficial wound.

172
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,910
Her life isn't in danger.
Don't worry, Emperor.

173
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,020
You should think about
how to handle the perpetrator.

174
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,790
Mother, have you interrogated
those at the scene?

175
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,910
I've interrogated her.

176
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,480
There's also the palace maid Zhen Zhu.

177
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,530
I've sent her to
the Bureau of Internal Affair...

178
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,720
for interrogation.

179
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,410
As for Concubine Ling,

180
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,970
I'll leave her to you, Emperor.

181
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,300
Mother,

182
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,530
I thought...

183
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,020
you've always liked Ying Luo.

184
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,360
But I can't allow her to hurt He An!

185
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,460
Mother,

186
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,990
Concubine Shun isn't He An.

187
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,120
She is to me!

188
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,230
Whether it's accidental or intentional,

189
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,480
it's very outrageous of
Concubine Ling to do that!

190
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,770
She must be taught a lesson!

191
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,670
Leave.

192
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,720
-Yes.
-Yes.

193
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,120
Your Majesty,

194
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,930
please forgive me
for being unable to get up...

195
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,560
for I'm gravely injured.

196
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,490
You're really something.

197
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,180
What are you saying?

198
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,690
Concubine Ling attended to
Empress Dowager dedicatedly.

199
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,560
They stayed together in
the Yuanming Garden for three years.

200
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,400
And their relationship was so close
that no one could ruin it.

201
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,210
In the Forbidden City,

202
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,430
Empress Dowager was her greatest backer.

203
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,840
But you,

204
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,740
in less than three months,

205
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,730
were able to make Empress Dowager
treat you like her own daughter,

206
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,810
protecting you in every way she can.

207
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,240
It's so impressive.

208
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,530
I'm flattered.

209
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Concubine Ling is very scheming
and hard to deal with.

210
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,830
Thus, you made your move...

211
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,610
while she's overwhelmed by
the death of Ming Yu.

212
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,680
You really blew my mind.

213
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,370
Your Majesty,

214
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,070
would you like to work with me?

215
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,600
You and I?

216
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
That's right.

217
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,250
We are sworn enemies.
How can we work together?

218
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,430
She's our mutual enemy.

219
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,010
Of course we can work together.

220
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,090
Concubine Shun,

221
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,100
I'm liking you more and more.

222
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,960
You may get up.

223
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,440
Your Majesty.

224
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,020
The imperial physician said...

225
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,020
that you haven't fully
recovered from the old injury.

226
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,970
You have to take good care now.

227
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,870
Stay in your bed.

228
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,290
Empress Dowager...

229
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,490
wants to punish Concubine Ling severely.

230
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,760
You've always been close to her.

231
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,450
Let me ask you.

232
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,680
How should we deal with her?

233
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Your Majesty, Concubine Ling
lost her best friend...

234
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,150
and got instigated by others.

235
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,920
Her situation is quite pitiable.

236
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,990
But she worked herself up
and accidentally hurt another.

237
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,720
Such a crime can't be pardoned.

238
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,420
In my opinion,

239
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,840
we should severely punish
the servant who instigated her.

240
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,380
As for Concubine Ling,

241
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,080
just ground her so that
she can reflect on her actions.

242
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,210
Chen Bi,

243
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,500
what do you think?

244
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,920
I think...

245
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,660
Concubine Ling didn't hurt me on purpose.

246
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,010
Your Majesty,

247
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,240
please be lenient with her.

248
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,530
Okay.

249
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,940
I'll ground her and have her
reflect on her actions.

250
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,140
Who among you instigated Concubine Ling?

251
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,950
You'd better admit it now!

252
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,740
Her Majesty is benevolent

253
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,310
She's giving you all a chance.
Confess now...

254
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,110
or else you'll all be dead when
sent to the Bureau of Internal Affair!

255
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,780
Take them away.

256
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,510
Your Majesty, it's him!

257
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,760
He's the most favoured eunuch
of Concubine Ling!

258
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,760
He did it! It must be him!

259
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,360
Don't you slander me!

260
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,440
Your Majesty, I'm innocent.

261
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,360
I never instigated Concubine Ling.

262
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,910
If it wasn't you, who did it?

263
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,340
Try to recall it.

264
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,370
What has Concubine Ling said or done?

265
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,400
If you can recall something,
you'd receive a lighter punishment.

266
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,860
If you can't, you'll be severely punished
together with them.

267
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,990
Your Majesty,

268
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,750
I always heard Concubine Ling curse
Concubine Shun behind her back.

269
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,290
What did she say?

270
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,080
She called her a seductress and shameless.

271
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,960
She's like Daji who harms
the state and its citizens.

272
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,640
When she learned that Concubine Shun
kept Ming Yu's condition from her,

273
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,360
her hatred toward Concubine Shun
welled up in her heart.

274
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,600
And she hurt her on impulse.

275
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,360
That means...

276
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,480
Concubine Ling had planned it beforehand?

277
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,940
I'm not sure about that.

278
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,980
But Concubine Ling
despises Concubine Shun.

279
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,620
That's for sure.

280
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,590
Take them all away.
Interrogate each one of them thoroughly.

281
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,760
Imperial Household Department
will then deal with them.

282
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,920
Take them away!

283
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,310
-Your Majesty, please have mercy!
-Get up!

284
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,860
Move! Hurry!

285
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,630
-Move!
-Move! Hurry!

286
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,040
Move...

287
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,380
I see, you've joined hands
with Concubine Shun.

288
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,720
Concubine Ling,

289
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,080
His Majesty's favour.
Empress Dowager's trust.

290
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,720
Your best friend's company.
Your freedom.

291
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,420
You've lost them all.

292
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,410
If I were you, I'd think about
how I ended up like this.

293
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,530
Your Highness, please have your meal.

294
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,660
Your Highness, you've caught a cold.

295
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,230
Should I call for the imperial physician?

296
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,740
No imperial physician
will come to my palace.

297
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,430
Don't bother.

298
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,800
Your Highness, you're such a nice person.

299
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,840
But that lowly Xiao Quan Zi
has tarnished your reputation...

300
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,420
and been transferred to
the Qianqing Palace.

301
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,330
Humans always aim for the top.

302
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,140
Water always flows downhill.

303
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,160
It's nothing to be surprised about.

304
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
But one should have a conscience.

305
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,640
Every servant in our palace got flogged,

306
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,990
except for him.

307
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,620
Supervisor Yuan.

308
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,430
Get out.

309
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,120
Was Ming Yu that important?

310
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,760
She's just a servant.

311
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,930
Is it worth it?

312
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
Because of her,

313
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,320
the distinguished and
intelligent Concubine Ling...

314
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,320
went to confront Concubine Shun,

315
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,430
ending up falling into her trap!

316
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,620
Starting from today,

317
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,500
you're not allowed to
send Concubine Ling food.

318
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,410
He'll take charge of...

319
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,930
the Yanxi Palace.

320
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,560
Supervisor Yuan.
As for Concubine Ling's meal…

321
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,900
Don't you ever...

322
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:58,080
ask anything about this palace.

323
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,530
It's the survival rule.

324
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,950
Get it?

325
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,840
Leave.

326
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,560
Yes.

327
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,110
You used to go against me all the time.

328
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,120
Do you know why I'm still using you?

329
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,280
I've betrayed Concubine Ling.

330
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,170
If she's alive, I won't benefit from that.

331
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,960
You're smart.

332
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,160
I like to work with smart people.

333
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,860
Thank you, Supervisor Yuan.

334
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,040
Remember,

335
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,900
I don't want to hear any rumours.

336
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,420
Yes.

337
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,080
It's you.

338
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,950
Your Highness.

339
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,260
It's indeed a small world.

340
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,410
I'm back.

341
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,560
It looks like I'm meant to...

342
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,220
serve you after all.

343
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,960
Is this my meal?

344
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,550
You've been suffering from
abdominal pain for the past two months.

345
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,520
The imperial physician said that
you'll have a bowl of congee every day.

346
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,410
Is this congee or water?

347
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,040
You've got to face the reality.

348
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,610
Things are different now.

349
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,320
You should feel lucky
to have this bowl of congee.

350
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,480
Xiao Quan Zi,

351
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,240
how did I treat you?

352
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,800
How could you betray me?

353
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,630
I betrayed you?

354
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,890
Your Highness,

355
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,550
take a good look around!

356
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,720
Look!

357
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,130
Who's willing to come to
this crappy place other than me?

358
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,650
You don't deserve my mercy!

359
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,230
You don't want to drink it?

360
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,200
Starve yourself then!

361
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,820
What a useless servant!

362
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,150
Sister,

363
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,460
look at yourself.

364
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,740
It's been only a few days
and you've become skinnier.

365
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,790
And you look so pale.

366
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,340
I feel so sorry for you.

367
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,990
Only that venomous Concubine Ling
could do such a cruel thing!

368
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,320
Sister,

369
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,400
these are some of
the medicines I collected.

370
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,400
They're suitable for
those with a weak body.

371
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,570
Just let me know
if you need anything else.

372
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,360
If I have it, I'll give it to you.

373
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,640
Sister.

374
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,490
I've thought it over.

375
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,730
You reunited with your parents
and family not long ago.

376
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,600
Of course His Majesty and
Empress Dowager would favour you.

377
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,290
But you're such an honest person.

378
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,200
That's why you became the target of
that jealous petty person...

379
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,240
and victim of dissension.

380
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,190
Sister.

381
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,480
That crafty one used to instigate me.

382
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,720
That's why I misunderstood you.

383
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,870
Yes.

384
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,030
I did make a lot of mistakes.

385
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,790
I hope you can forgive me.

386
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:00,450
The fate brought us all together
and had us become sisters.

387
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,540
We've got to get along well in future.

388
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,300
You saw both Consort Jia
and Concubine Ling get punished.

389
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,070
You're worried that
you'll end up like them, aren't you?

390
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,590
Concubine Shun.

391
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,600
Sister Nalan is sincerely
asking for your forgiveness.

392
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,470
Please don't give her a hard time.

393
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,170
You want to be...

394
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,270
my sisters?

395
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,310
Dream on!

396
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,870
You...

397
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,950
How arrogant you are!

398
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,890
Why don't you leave?

399
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,210
Now that you're the most popular one
in the Forbidden City,

400
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,160
Concubine Ling
can no longer compare to you.

401
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,710
Could you please show her mercy...

402
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,320
and let her go?

403
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,930
Are you pleading on
Concubine Ling's behalf?

404
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,500
Yes.

405
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,050
I'm pleading on her behalf.

406
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,950
I thought...

407
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,130
the women of Forbidden City...

408
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,370
are only good at getting jealous...

409
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,420
and fighting with each other.

410
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,960
We are all women,

411
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,840
There are those like you,

412
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,220
who enjoy His Majesty's favour
and keep getting promoted.

413
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,920
And there are those like me,

414
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,720
who have limited power and
only manage to survive.

415
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,610
But to me,

416
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,240
the Forbidden City is
no different than His Majesty's court.

417
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,160
Empress is the head.
And the consorts are her colleagues.

418
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,840
The harem is quiet and boring.

419
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,660
Isn't it a good thing...

420
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,970
to have a good friend with whom...

421
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,880
you can view flowers and play chess,
and who can keep you company?

422
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,940
Did I say something wrong?

423
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,120
As you said,

424
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,840
it's not that you dare not fight.

425
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,610
It's because you can't afford to lose.

426
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,500
You don't have the right to plead with me.

427
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,280
Fine.

428
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,220
It's true that I can't afford to lose.

429
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,320
But Concubine Ling
has been drove to the edge.

430
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,050
Can't you just let her go?

431
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,120
I'm not the one...

432
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,920
who wants to get her killed.

433
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
Yi Zhu,

434
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
see the guest out.

435
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,190
Fu Heng.

436
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,010
Why did you exile Liu De Zhao...

437
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,710
as his punishment?

438
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,680
As per my investigation,

439
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,720
though Liu De Zhao lied
and acted deranged,

440
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,090
he's just a madman who can't
even tell summer and winter.

441
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,630
The river commissioner of
Shandong, Bai Zhong Shan,

442
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,800
searched his house...

443
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,730
and found the anti-Qing
and pro-Ming words he wrote.

444
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,220
Can a madman...

445
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,230
accomplish such an act?

446
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,450
Fu Heng.

447
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,200
Don't let that
treacherous criminal fool you.

448
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,230
Your Majesty.

449
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,730
This man has really gone crazy
and he's totally illiterate.

450
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,220
I assume...

451
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,010
the so-called anti-Qing
and pro-Ming words...

452
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,640
was a scheme designed by
the local officials...

453
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,040
in pursuit of promotion.

454
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,130
What do you mean?

455
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,860
To capture a madman.

456
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,000
Or to capture a traitor.

457
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,360
Which is the greater merit?

458
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,240
Fu Heng.

459
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,400
Instead of the suspect,

460
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,200
you're suspecting your own men.

461
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,720
I'm wondering...

462
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,160
if you're truly a subject of Great Qing.

463
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,720
People can tell what's right or wrong.

464
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,050
You don't need to argue.

465
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,320
Discussing the court matters
of Great Qing in public...

466
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,380
is a disobedience to the God's order.

467
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,720
Even if he's a madman,

468
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,960
his crime isn't pardonable.

469
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
Here's my decree.

470
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,640
Liu De Zhao will be sentenced to
death by a thousand cuts.

471
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,320
And make it a warning
for all the provincial governors.

472
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,190
Anyone who dares slander the court
will be executed.

473
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Your Majesty, you are indeed a sage.

474
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,570
Here's another urgent matter.

475
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,000
In the Tongshan County of Jiangsu,

476
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
the dike on the south bank
of Yellow River is breached.

477
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,920
Minister Li Dun and General Zhang Bin
of Tongshan...

478
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,940
stole from the state treasury
and delayed work.

479
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,080
Hence, they should be beheaded
in accordance by the law.

480
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,210
But...

481
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,600
we're waiting for your decree
for Gao Bin's punishment.

482
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,520
Your Majesty.

483
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,280
Gao Bin is indeed suspected of
sheltering his underlings,

484
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,000
but he did not fail in his duty.

485
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,560
Gao Bin...

486
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,480
has been receiving money for years
to renovate the dikes.

487
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,950
At this critical moment,

488
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,000
he chose to repay me this way.

489
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,720
Gao Bin has governed the rivers for years.

490
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,120
And he's always been earnest and diligent.

491
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,380
It's a make-or-break time
for resolving the flood.

492
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,780
Maybe we can remove him
from his post for the time being...

493
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,200
but retain him for future work.

494
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,360
Gao Bin hasn't been strict
with his underlings...

495
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,880
and turned his back against your grace.

496
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,610
Now that the dike is destroyed,

497
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,160
as the river viceroy,

498
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,680
he's responsible for it.

499
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,900
Lord Fu Heng,

500
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,820
what favour has he given you...

501
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,050
that you're pleading for him?

502
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,110
My family and the Gaos have been enemies.

503
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,210
It'd be such a big joke...

504
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,330
that he were to bride me.

505
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,420
If we kill Gao Bin,
who will go control the flood?

506
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,120
Prince He, do you understand?

507
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,160
-You...
-Enough.

508
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,510
Minister Li Dun...

509
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,240
and General Zhang Bin
are to be executed on the spot.

510
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,550
As for Gao Bin,

511
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,810
take him to the execution ground as well.

512
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,540
-Your Majesty.
-You're right.

513
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,040
Gao Bin is still useful.

514
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,150
I cannot kill him.

515
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,600
Even though he won't be executed,
he still needs to be punished.

516
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,540
Let him watch the execution
before releasing him.

517
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,770
Do not tell him in advance.

518
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,670
Have him believe that he'll be dead.

519
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,700
He'll learn from this lesson.

520
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
You may leave now.

521
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,510
I'm taking my leave.

522
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,830
Anything else?

523
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,200
Regarding Gao Bin's punishment...

524
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,400
You think...

525
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,670
I'm being too cruel to him?

526
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,440
Your Majesty, why must you frighten him?

527
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,770
As the viceroy, he missed the best time...

528
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,520
to control the floods
in Hongze and Gaoyou.

529
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Yet, I spared him.

530
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,080
The governor of
Henan Outer River, Chen Ke Ji,

531
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,760
was found to have caused
a shortfall in the treasury.

532
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,200
He kept harbouring him.

533
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,780
Yet, I pardoned him again.

534
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,630
This time, Tongshan's breaching...

535
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,160
not only threatens the Gaojiayan dike...

536
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,100
but also floods Huaiyang.

537
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,360
His incompetence cannot be pardoned.

538
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,590
I'm being merciful enough
to not execute him.

539
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,730
Your Majesty.

540
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,470
You do know that...

541
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,960
Gao Bin is a competent official.

542
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,400
It's always been hard to control flood.

543
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,040
He can't change the situation.
But he tries his best to manage it.

544
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,950
Furthermore,

545
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,159
he's the father of
the late Noble Consort Huixian.

546
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,850
And he's about 70 years old.

547
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,800
Your Majesty can kill or exile him.

548
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:17,750
You cannot humiliate him
or else the people will misunderstand you.

549
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,760
Fu Heng.

550
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,469
Who exactly are you...

551
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:37,150
pleading mercy for?

552
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,360
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

553
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,880
You asked me to do it for old times' sake.

554
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,090
You don't seem to be defending
Noble Consort Gao.

555
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,719
You're trying to defend
the Yanxi Palace, aren't you?

556
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,590
Your Majesty,

557
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,050
I wouldn't dare meddle in palace affairs.

558
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,230
You'd better not.

559
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,910
You may leave now.

560
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,530
I'm taking my leave.

561
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,210
Lord Fu.

562
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,660
Lord Hailan Cha drinks all day.

563
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,560
Please try to stop him.

564
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,840
Lord Fu Heng, wait.

565
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,430
Concubine Shun,

566
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,480
you plotted to lure me
an external official here.

567
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,960
Aren't you afraid that
people will find out...

568
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,420
and ruin your reputation?

569
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,440
If you're not afraid that
Concubine Ling is in danger,

570
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,560
you may leave now.

571
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,360
Concubine Shun,

572
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,160
if this is your scheme to win favour,

573
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,760
you've outshone everyone
in the entire harem.

574
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,050
Why are you still trying
to get rid of Ying Luo?

575
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,920
You...

576
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,830
love Wei Ying Luo, don't you?

577
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,160
That day, I noticed
that special pattern...

578
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,030
on your perfume pouch.

579
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,930
After I entered the palace,

580
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,300
I started getting to know that...

581
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,660
the one you love...

582
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,120
is Wei Ying Luo.

583
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,520
But why...

584
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,070
did you lose her?

585
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,810
Just spit it out.

586
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,620
Stop beating around the bush.

587
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,440
She could've been your woman.

588
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,450
Yet, you've watched her being taken away.

589
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,700
And now you're abandoned and defeated.

590
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,180
How do you feel now?

591
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,320
Nonsense!

592
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,750
Wei Ying Luo...

593
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,170
is going to take her last breath soon.

594
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,560
What did you say?

595
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,100
She offended too many people.

596
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,220
Now that she's ended up like this,

597
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,360
people will settle scores with her.

598
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,340
She's isolated...

599
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,400
and only served water every day.

600
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,630
How long can she live?

601
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,280
It's all because of you!

602
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,270
No.

603
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,140
It's because of you.

604
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,260
Because of me?

605
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,290
Both of you promised to get married...

606
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,260
and she's destined to be your wife.

607
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,960
And you?

608
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,670
You abandoned her without hesitation.

609
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,870
It's because of you...

610
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,900
that she ended up like this.

611
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,490
You can't deny that, can you?

612
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,440
All these years,

613
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,090
whenever you hear her name,

614
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,080
do you feel pain,

615
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,370
sadness, and regret...

616
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,260
in your heart?

617
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,080
Since I chose this path,

618
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,160
I have nothing to regret.

619
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,760
You're scared!

620
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,770
Of what?

621
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,880
You're scared of facing the past.

622
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,810
You're scared of facing yourself.

623
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,740
You're obviously in deep sorrow,
but you keep telling yourself...

624
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,800
that you don't regret.

625
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,720
It's all in the past.

626
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,510
Everything will get better.

627
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,400
Are you lying to others...

628
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,850
or yourself?

629
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,520
Ying Luo should have had a happy life.

630
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,360
But because of you,

631
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,810
her life is completely ruined.

632
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,410
See,

633
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,710
you're clearly very furious.

634
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,760
If it were another man,

635
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,950
he'd be cursing me by now.

636
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,160
But you?

637
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,290
You're clearly very angry...

638
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,760
but you don't forget your deep-rooted
morality and manners!

639
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,620
And that's exactly...

640
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,410
the reason why you've lost your true love.

641
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,830
Are you done?

642
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,720
I still have things to do.

643
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,980
Why did you give your love to another man?

644
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,440
Just because he's the emperor
and the ruler of the world,

645
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,750
so he could seize your love?

646
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,680
Fu Heng.

647
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,360
That person who seized your lover
doesn't cherish her at all.

648
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,640
But you still respect
and serve him every day.

649
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,020
That's not fair.

650
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,070
Do you know what would happen to you...

651
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,470
if His Majesty heard...

652
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,090
what you just said?

653
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,710
Will he believe you?

654
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,040
Now,

655
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,140
he's certain that both of you
still love each other.

656
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,960
Whatever you say...

657
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,400
will all become excuses for her.

658
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,010
What?

659
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,440
I guessed it right?

660
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,070
Fu Heng.

661
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,720
You've been fettered by
the rules for so long.

662
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,950
You must be very gloomy.

663
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,330
You must feel suffocated.

664
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,450
And you're going crazy.

665
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,110
Wake up already!

666
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,340
Water.

667
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,880
Water.

668
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,870
What?

669
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,740
Water.

670
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,720
You've served me for years.

671
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,550
How did I treat you?

672
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,660
His Majesty only ordered
to have me grounded.

673
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,050
If I die,

674
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,790
will you survive?

675
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,910
Supervisor Yuan.

676
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,030
One cup of water per day.

677
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,440
She's had her share for today.

678
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,400
Yes...

679
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,630
You may leave now.

680
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,320
We don't need you here.

681
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,680
Yes.

682
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,690
Yuan Chun Wang,
you really hate me that much?

683
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,070
You can't wait for me to die?

684
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,410
What do you think?

685
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,590
Only one cup of water per day.

686
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,390
You're trying to kill me.

687
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,970
Ying Luo.

688
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,960
You know what I want to hear.

689
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,040
Why can't you just say it?

690
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,290
You want me to beg you for forgiveness?

691
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,490
Never!

692
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,230
Supervisor Yuan.

693
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,790
Starting from today,

694
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,600
stop giving her...

695
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,640
congee.

696
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,890
Supervisor Yuan, that won't do.

697
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,160
If she dies...

698
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,410
She's just a consort
who's no longer favoured.

699
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,870
If she stays in this cold palace,

700
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,520
she'll be dead sooner or later.

701
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,440
No one will notice.

702
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,470
It's just a matter of time.

703
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,660
Concubine Ling is tough and aggressive.

704
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,330
After experiencing such a setback,
she is totally defeated...

705
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,670
and falls ill.

706
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,320
-Wait! Supervisor Yuan, will...
-Don't panic!

707
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,280
Even the Imperial Academy of Medicine
won't say otherwise!

708
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,470
Yes, I got it...
