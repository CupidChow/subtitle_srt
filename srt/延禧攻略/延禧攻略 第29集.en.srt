[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,320
Let me tell you that
a gentleman is also a man.

4
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,240
You're wrong.

5
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,780
You!

6
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,490
You really know where to poke.

7
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,460
Since it was you who provoked me first,

8
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,840
I will never let you
repay me in this manner.

9
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,480
I'll let you owe me forever
until you feel guilty.

10
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,390
Once you married me,

11
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,370
I will then slowly make you pay.

12
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,600
Young Master,

13
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,610
you really think that day will ever come?

14
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,340
If you're not willing to face
His Majesty, I won't force you.

15
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,600
If you want to stay here
in Labour House, I will wait for you.

16
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,180
I will wait until you abandon
your grudges and let go of your burdens.

17
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,140
No matter how long, even if a lifetime,

18
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,310
I will be waiting for you.

19
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,740
You were just bluffing.

20
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,330
-You...
-Go back. I'll get going now.

21
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,810
Quickly fasten your dress.

22
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,380
-Li Yu.
-I am here.

23
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,560
How long has that servant been
scrubbing commodes in the Labour House?

24
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,350
Your Majesty, it's more than
half a month.

25
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,850
She didn't cry?

26
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,110
She didn't beg for mercy?

27
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,840
I bet she won't stand down
without some extreme measures.

28
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,330
Even at death's doorstep,
she would go in for a cup of tea.

29
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,610
I understand what Your Majesty means.

30
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,829
I will increase her workload.

31
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,380
Until she cries.

32
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,790
Yes.

33
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,170
She's Wei Ying Luo?

34
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,550
Ying Luo, come here and bow.

35
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,820
What did you put inside the commode?

36
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,180
Supervisor Zhang, I placed charcoal ashes
on the ordinary commodes,

37
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,830
and placed fine sands on those
of the imperial consorts.

38
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,960
I couldn't find any better materials.

39
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,610
How could it be better?

40
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,980
The dust of agarwood is the best.
I guarantee you the stench will be gone.

41
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,850
Look at how clear that water is.
You can use it as mirror.

42
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,480
Well done, Wei Ying Luo.

43
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,910
I now know why Her Majesty
praised you so.

44
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,210
Supervisor Zhang, I am flattered.
I'm just doing my job well.

45
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,050
You heard that? Do as she said.

46
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,560
Yes.

47
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,850
Leave her here is a waste of her talent.

48
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,640
Find her something less toiling.

49
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,280
Wei Ying Luo,

50
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,290
you're able to clean commodes
even better than all the others.

51
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
You are clearly being pretentious.

52
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,720
Start washing them.
After washing, dispose of the water.

53
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,470
A cursed and foolish ingrate.

54
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,070
You are born with a handsome look.

55
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,960
Why are you also born with a stiff brain?

56
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,850
For Supervisor Zhang to like you
is the good karma of your past life.

57
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,960
If you follow him, you don't need
to be this most lowly eunuch position.

58
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,480
I'm a man,

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,540
not a bunny.

60
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,800
Just you wait. You'll suffer.

61
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,930
So, you can speak.

62
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,650
You're sure that she brings
that man food every day?

63
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,620
He is usually cautious of others
and he fights fiercely.

64
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,440
He never touches our food here.

65
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,600
Now, we finally find a chance.

66
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,040
Eat.

67
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,360
You haven't eaten for a day.

68
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,000
So, you're here drinking cold water.

69
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,930
This is a bun I left for you. Eat it.

70
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,580
You think I want to be your friend?

71
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,290
If you get sick, I'll be the one to
deliver the dung out of the palace.

72
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,890
Eat it.

73
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,650
Chun Wang, there is nowhere to run now!

74
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,930
Why are you still lying down? Get up!

75
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,020
Get up. Let's go.

76
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,510
Hurry! Let's go!

77
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,580
Quickly, go!

78
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,260
If we leave him here and he talks,

79
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,760
none of us can live.

80
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,710
Okay. I'll help you one more time.

81
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,840
Tomorrow morning,

82
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,520
the dung cart would be
transported out of Forbidden City.

83
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,760
A manure cart is very dirty.
The guards are already used to seeing it.

84
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,450
They surely will not check it.

85
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,280
Without a waist badge, he would be
leaving without permission.

86
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,210
If he returns, he will be executed.
He won't dare to come back.

87
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,330
Why are you looking at me?

88
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,430
Look at me.

89
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,160
I think I am considered a beauty.

90
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,900
I think my face is
considered pretty enough.

91
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,080
Why doesn't Supervisor Zhang like me,

92
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,240
and instead he likes you?

93
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,130
Too bad...

94
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,160
His eyes have failed to spot
this beauty right here!

95
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,350
That's more like it.

96
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,540
A person like that is a villain.
Don't punish yourself because of him.

97
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,730
Without him, you can be at ease
and eat now.

98
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,900
You no longer have to eat
the food disposed in the canal.

99
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,560
Or, drinking cold water.

100
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,650
How did you know?

101
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,360
I...

102
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,140
I'm smart.

103
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,310
I was so scared just now.

104
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,840
I'm so scared that my hands
are still trembling now.

105
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,640
But this man inside this cart
is a huge trouble.

106
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,370
Be careful tomorrow.

107
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,340
Leave me be, I can handle him.

108
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,310
Okay.

109
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,400
What are you doing?

110
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,360
You're talking.

111
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,760
Hey, you haven't talked to me
the whole day today.

112
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,140
I thought that you've become a mute too.

113
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,950
Wei Ying Luo, when you
first came to Yong Alley,

114
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,270
you approached me just to
learn more about me.

115
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,860
Now that I found out,
why are you not talking anymore?

116
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,500
Yuan Chun Wang.

117
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,920
You're the one who knocked
Supervisor Zhang unconscious.

118
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,360
Why do you still act
as if nothing happened?

119
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,320
-Aren't you afraid that...
-Mind your tongue.

120
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,900
It's you who knocked him out.

121
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,200
Have you forgotten?
That night, you didn't even blinked.

122
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,090
Exposing me would mean
exposing yourself as well.

123
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,160
We are now on the same boat.

124
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,270
-You won't be that stupid.
-You!

125
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
What was that for?

126
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,060
Getting too frustrated?

127
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,400
Wei Ying Luo, it has always been you
threatening others,

128
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,530
and never the other way around, right?

129
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,410
Do you feel so mad right now?
So want to chop me into pieces?

130
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,470
Come...

131
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,910
Yes! It's my first time meeting someone
more evil and shameless than I am.

132
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,720
Forbidden City is indeed a place
that never ceases to amaze.

133
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,000
There is always something worse.

134
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,750
That's more like it.
Let me tell you, Wei Ying Luo,

135
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,680
the Forbidden City hides
many secrets and surprises!

136
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,520
There is always something worse.

137
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,240
This is a disrespectful way
to talk to a lady, do you know that?

138
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,230
What should I be afraid of?
It's not like we are in love or something.

139
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,210
Moreover, I'm not some young master
from a respectable and noble family.

140
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,780
I've never been educated
and I don't understand any logic.

141
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,600
-Get up.
-No.

142
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,000
Get up!

143
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,480
So many ladies here fancy you.
I don't want to be their common enemy.

144
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,870
Don't worry. This is the Yong Alley.

145
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,290
What does that mean?

146
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,060
It means the most lowly handmaiden
of the Labour House...

147
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,890
will also look down
on the lowly eunuchs here.

148
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,840
What they really like is nothing,
but my handsome look.

149
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,110
Your friend Jin Xiu
has never stepped into here.

150
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,880
Such affection is something
I won't accept.

151
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,480
That's why you don't like her?

152
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,990
I don't like women.

153
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,650
Then you like, men?

154
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,890
-What are you laughing about?
-I don't like men...

155
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,440
You don't like men nor women.

156
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,670
I just like myself, okay?

157
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,270
Wei Ying Luo, onto a more serious topic.

158
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,410
Fuca Fu Heng will forever
stand under the sunlight.

159
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,690
You can only stay in the shadow.

160
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,800
You two can never be together.

161
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,350
I'm telling you the truth.

162
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,120
Hey! What is it now?

163
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,050
Yuan Chun Wang! Did you peek that day?

164
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,520
No! No! I really didn't!

165
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,500
-I just...
-You...

166
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,160
-I just saw a little.
-What did you see?

167
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,240
Pink...

168
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,340
I didn't see anything!

169
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,220
-I saw no colour that day.
-You!

170
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,760
-I didn't see it. I really didn't see it.
-Yuan Chun Wang!

171
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,070
-I didn't see it.
-You pervert!

172
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,590
I saw nothing!

173
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
-Shut up!
-It was pink.

174
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,850
-It was pink!
-Stop right there! Don't talk!

175
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,310
Did you hear it?
Supervisor Zhang went missing.

176
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,480
Chief Wu got so mad saying
that he did things so carelessly.

177
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,690
He wants him captured and be punished.

178
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,820
A fiend like him should be gone forever.

179
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,570
Stop gossiping! Get to work!

180
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,420
Her Majesty is coming. Kneel!

181
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,359
Kneel!

182
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,990
Kneel!

183
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,350
Get back to work.

184
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,860
What are you looking at?

185
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,360
You are now a lowly slave
in the Labour House.

186
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,820
Do you think Her Majesty
would remember you?

187
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,610
You are not getting out of here.

188
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,100
Get back to work.

189
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,930
Work!

190
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,880
You! I told you to remove the grasses,
so stop snagging around!

191
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,740
-Work! Don't slack off!
-I won't slack off again!

192
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,070
Quickly!

193
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,140
A heart higher than the sky,
a life thinner than a paper.

194
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,020
That is the life you are born into.

195
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,980
If you don't work, you won't get any food.

196
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,560
Start working!

197
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,970
Stop waving your hand. I can see.

198
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,500
Wei Ying Luo got sent to the Labour House.

199
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,130
You're not worried at all?

200
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,880
Consort Dowager Yu suddenly died
and raised disturbance in the palace.

201
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,530
Being sent to the Labour House
is actually a way to protect Ying Luo.

202
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,660
That maybe right, but Ying Luo's
workload is tremendous.

203
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,950
A lady getting sent to do hard labours,

204
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,700
will she really not hold any grudge?

205
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,790
Still scrubbing?

206
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,990
Yuan Chun Wang?

207
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,690
Call me Brother Yuan.
Don't be disrespectful.

208
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,460
So cheesy. I'm not calling you that.

209
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,680
After I exposed your true nature,
you've become more unbridled.

210
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,170
Give me your hand.

211
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,560
-What are you doing?
-Know to appreciate a good intention.

212
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,760
This is called Cephalanoplos thistle.
It relieves inflammation and pain.

213
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,540
Does it hurt?

214
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,900
People like us are just petty lives
in the eyes of rich and powerful.

215
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,950
We are only useful their guard dogs.

216
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,800
When they have no use of us,
even if you died on the street,

217
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,530
no one would even care.

218
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,230
Hence, one must cherish our own life.

219
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,740
Is that clear?

220
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,750
Do it yourself.

221
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,580
Look at how good I am to you.

222
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,240
Can that Fuca Fu Heng of yours
love you like I do?

223
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,660
It doesn't matter how much he loves you.

224
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,720
He likes you because you're young,
beautiful, fresh, and interesting.

225
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,960
After a few years,
when that freshness dies out,

226
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,680
will he still love you like he used to?

227
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,140
I doubt he will.

228
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,350
I know that you are capable and smart.

229
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,970
So what?

230
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,330
Don't forget. Fu Heng lost the trust
of His Majesty because of you.

231
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,350
Do you think he won't hate you?

232
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,520
I just like him.
You can't do anything about that.

233
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Ask Fu Heng to scrub this for you then!

234
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,100
I didn't ask you to scrub it for me!

235
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,690
Take this back.

236
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,820
Wei Ying Luo!

237
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,040
I'm doing this for your own good,
do you know that?

238
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,690
You're jealous of me.

239
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,370
You're jealous I am loved,
That I have a way out and hope.

240
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,540
Why are you looking at me?

241
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,010
I know everything just
by looking in your eyes.

242
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,200
Wei Ying Luo! Did you notice it?

243
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,770
The two of us are completely the same.

244
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Just a look into your eyes
and I can tell you are up to no good.

245
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,380
You can predict my action
just by the word I said.

246
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,330
It's like looking into a mirror.

247
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:23,230
Wei Ying Luo, stop liking Fu Heng, okay?

248
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,700
Like me instead. How does that sound?

249
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,380
Two snakes are don't make
each other warm-blooded.

250
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,690
We can't get any warmth from each other.

251
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,200
If we can't provide heat for each other,

252
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,330
we could at least take care of each other.

253
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,500
Ying Luo, let's make a pact, how about it?

254
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Making an alliance should be fine, right?

255
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,580
An alliance?

256
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,370
How?

257
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,120
What are you doing?

258
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,740
Wei Ying Luo, come up here.

259
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,270
Are you coming up or not?

260
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,980
Wei Ying Luo killed Supervisor Zhang!

261
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,640
Are you crazy, Yuan Chun Wang?

262
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,900
Ying Luo, look at the galaxy above.

263
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,400
Actually, no matter how noble
the status of a person is,

264
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,640
even if he is the descendant
of the heaven,

265
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,370
he's still just a very small star
inside the bright galaxy.

266
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,300
How much more prestigious
can one really be?

267
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,830
Ying Luo, look.

268
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,980
One day, I will make everyone know...

269
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,340
that I, Yuan Chun Wang, a wild man
who came from nothing...

270
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,590
will amount to some greatness
in this Forbidden City.

271
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,910
Ying Luo, I have an idea.

272
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:41,560
Starting today, I'll be your big brother
and soul mate.

273
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,550
Let me protect you.

274
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,890
We'll have each other's back
and supporting each other.

275
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,420
We'll survive in this dark palace!

276
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,390
Okay!

277
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,830
Is it okay for me to be your lover?

278
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,830
Dream on!

279
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,920
Yuan Chun Wang!

280
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,660
I told you I can predict your every move.

281
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,330
Say it, "Big Brother".

282
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,580
Clean up the mess and go back!

283
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,990
Take a close look.
Noble Consort wants to make rouges.

284
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,840
She wants the petals
with the purest colour.

285
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,320
All others are rejected.

286
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,100
Your Highness, look.
This colour is very nice.

287
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,440
Don't be so rough. You'll hurt the flower.

288
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,120
Okay. Yes.

289
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,770
Greetings, Noble Consort.

290
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,710
Consort Xian, you're such a kind person.

291
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,700
You show so much care for a merely flower.

292
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,190
Recently, I've been personally leading
my maids to make rouge.

293
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,850
I come here to pick fresh flowers
every day early in the morning.

294
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,450
Consort Xian is here to...

295
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,360
Noble Consort, I'm here
to harvest dew for tea.

296
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,280
Make tea?

297
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,180
I doubt that is true.

298
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,660
Since Her Majesty got pregnant,

299
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,920
you would collect dew every morning
and send it to Changchun palace.

300
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,780
Don't you think you fawning is overdone?

301
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,460
I can't understand.

302
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,160
Why must you take after Consort Chun?

303
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,940
You are following Her Majesty
like her personal lapdog.

304
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,050
What are you after?

305
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,540
Noble Consort, be careful with
your words. I'm still a consort.

306
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,290
If I am a lapdog,
what does that make His Majesty?

307
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,390
Zhi Lan, did I hear it correctly?

308
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,200
Did you manage to understand
what Consort Xian said just now?

309
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:42,500
Your Highness, Consort Xian advised you
to mind your words.

310
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,390
The sun has risen from the west!

311
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,180
The Consort Xian who is usually be
very cautious in speech and actions...

312
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,680
has become so sharp-witted and demeaning.

313
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,890
Who gave you the boldness to question me?

314
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,090
Noble Consort has unmatched beauty.

315
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,580
You also have the Gao clan to support you.

316
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,650
Of course you could terrify
the inner palace and walk without fear.

317
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,250
But don't forget,

318
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,960
nothing lasts forever in this world.

319
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,070
Once Her Majesty gave birth to a son
and he becomes the crown prince,

320
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,970
by then...

321
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,810
Her Majesty loves sour plum soup.

322
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,280
I shall collect some plums
for Her Majesty now.

323
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,050
I will take my leave now.

324
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,150
You...

325
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,520
Your Highness, Consort Xian
is overstepping the line!

326
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,020
She sassed at you right before everyone!

327
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,510
I don't care much about what she said.

328
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,610
For her to be so arrogant,

329
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,410
isn't all because she has
Her Majesty backing her up?

330
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,520
No matter how you look at it,
it's all because Her Majesty is pregnant.

331
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,560
His Majesty has always been hoping
for a child to succeed the throne.

332
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,890
If this prince is born safely,

333
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,650
I fear what Consort Xian said
will come true,

334
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,950
Your Highness will lose
all the status and influence.

335
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:24,420
We'll see if the prince
will be born safely.

336
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,000
Your Highness, you have a new plan?

337
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,810
I can't keep waiting anymore.

338
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,530
Or else, I will be like the soil
of the Imperial Garden,

339
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,070
everyone will trample me.

340
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:48,150
Zhi Lan, I want Noble Lady Shu
at the Chuxiu Palace.

341
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,700
Say that I have an important matter
to discuss with her.

342
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,320
You clearly knew Noble Consort will
be here everyday to collect fresh flowers.

343
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,270
Why did you not go somewhere else?

344
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,140
It's because I want her to see it.

345
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,660
I don't understand.

346
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,680
Haven't you always been tolerating?

347
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,080
Why did you purposely
run into her just now?

348
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,970
You will understand in the future.

349
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,040
Let's go to Changchun Palace
and deliver the dew.

350
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,570
I order Zhong Yong Tan to meet
with Governor Zhou Xue Jian...

351
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,170
to provide disaster relief.

352
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,940
But before I gave the order,
everyone has already known about it.

353
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,000
How was my secret letter leaked?

354
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,220
Your Majesty, based on my investigation,

355
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,330
it's because Zhong Yong Tan and
the Orongan, the eldest son of Ortai,

356
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,880
are very close.

357
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,920
The news was initially
leaked by Zhong Yong Tan.

358
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,970
He has a lot of guts.

359
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,150
He was bold enough to leak
the secret imperial letter.

360
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,110
In your opinion,
how should I deal with him?

361
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,170
Your Majesty, Zhong Yong Tan
is an important ally of Ortai.

362
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,000
If we don't deal with him properly,
it might incite an uproar.

363
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,490
May Your Majesty be cautious.

364
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,820
Spread my decree! Zhong Yong Tan
leaked a secret imperial letter...

365
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,400
and will be removed from his post
and taken to Bureau of Internal Affair.

366
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,320
Order Prince Zhuang, Prince Lu,
Prince He, and Prince Ping...

367
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,270
Grand Secretaries Zhang Ting Yu
and Xu Ben,

368
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,920
and Minister Necin to do the public trial.

369
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,550
Not only Zhong Yong Tan,
Orongan will also be imprisoned.

370
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,560
Your Majesty, you're going
to confront the Ortai?

371
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,950
Indecision invariably leads to trouble.

372
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,930
They have challenged
my limit multiple times.

373
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,390
I want them to know that whether
it's Ortai or Zhang Ting Yu,

374
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,640
I would not allow anyone
to violate the imperial power.

375
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,240
One more thing.

376
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,330
Viceroy Yin Ji Shan of the two rivers...

377
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,200
and Viceroy Bai Zhong Shan
of the Southern Yangtze River.

378
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,560
They are against Gao Bin's flood
prevention and water conservation...

379
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,610
in Yellow River and Hongze Lake.

380
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,640
What is your opinion about this?

381
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,750
Dividing the downstream water flow...

382
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,000
and preventing the upstream from
overflowing should be the top priority.

383
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,440
According Gao Bin, the river water
conservation project...

384
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,200
would affect the provinces of Su,
Huai, Xu, Hai, Feng, Ying, and Si.

385
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,330
There would be an estimated
148 ditches and canals made.

386
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:45,780
If the project is a success, it would
surely benefit the nation and its people.

387
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,560
Hence, I must heavily reward Gao Bin...

388
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,570
and release 1.9 million taels of funds...

389
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,930
mainly for the management
of the riverway of the lakes.

390
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,700
Your Majesty is wise.

391
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,470
How am I wise?

392
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,380
Not only will the people benefit
from this achievement,

393
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,800
Gao Bin will also serve you with loyalty.

394
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,130
He and Ortai will now be
on separate paths.

395
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,720
The Ortai alliance is falling apart,
the Zhang alliance will be on high alert.

396
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,150
Isn't this a good thing?

397
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,020
Fu Heng,

398
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,960
if you are more precise
in choosing a woman...

399
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,120
like the way you handle state affairs,

400
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,340
that will be a greater relief.

401
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,570
Your Majesty, I still believe
my choice is right.

402
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:41,040
Your Majesty, the banquet
in Yujing Pavilion is now ready.

403
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,040
I'm handling state affairs.

404
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,960
Inform the Empress to make sure
everything is handled properly.

405
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,000
Yes.

406
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,540
One day, I will tear off
the mask of Wei Ying Luo.

407
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,670
Slowly.

408
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,560
Your Majesty, the imperial physician
said you should rest well.

409
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,070
Empress Dowager is holding
a banquet in Yujing Pavilion.

410
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,130
It's inconvenient for a pregnant woman
to walk around.

411
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,820
Why not just ask to be excused from it?

412
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:36,010
Empress Dowager has always been forgiving.
She won't blame you.

413
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:45,100
Ming Yu, because of Consort Dowager Yu,
Empress Dowager has been depressed.

414
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,540
Now that she finally have the spirit...

415
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,520
to hold a banquet
for Double Ninth Festival,

416
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,630
if Her Majesty doesn't go,
won't that kill everyone's joy?

417
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,800
Although Empress Dowager
won't say anything,

418
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,950
that mistress of Chuxiu Palace
would surely make a wave out of it.

419
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,390
She'll surely say Her Majesty
is using the child...

420
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,760
as an excuse to have special treatment.

421
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,320
But Her Majesty is clearly
not feeling well.

422
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:12,380
Your Majesty, should we have
an imperial physician come with us?

423
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,150
Look at how nervous you two are.

424
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,230
I'm feeling very well.

425
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,770
It's just that lately, I feel so tired.
I am too lazy to move around.

426
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,210
Groom for me, I don't want to be late.

427
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,640
I'll accompany you later.

428
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,860
Me too!

429
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,410
If you two both go, who would
take care of Changchun Palace?

430
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,150
Er Qing will stay behind today,
Ming Yu will go with me to the banquet.

431
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,390
Yes.

432
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,280
Yes.

433
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,770
I've been looking so pale lately.

434
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,450
Put on some rouge for me,
don't let Empress Dowager see it.

435
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,310
I don't want her to be worried.

436
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,120
Stop crying and don't let others hear it.

437
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,100
Enough. Come.

438
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,300
Wipe the tears away. Stop crying.

439
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,950
Stop crying...

440
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,660
Stop crying.

441
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,400
Don't draw too much attention
or the guards will kill the both of you.

442
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,950
Stop scaring them!

443
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,140
Stop crying. Be good.

444
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,300
Why are you crying?

445
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,330
My lady,

446
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,040
as preparation for Empress Dowager's
birthday, Noble Consort...

447
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
had us stay here in the palace...

448
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,200
to perform our special act
"Thousands of Purples and Reds".

449
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,500
Then he...

450
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,550
What happened to him?

451
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,130
"Thousands of Purples and Reds" is...

452
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,780
the splashing molten iron
on the brick wall.

453
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,800
It's like the blooming
of a thousand flowers.

454
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,640
It's beautiful beyond any words.

455
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,190
Commander Gao Heng knew about
our performance.

456
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,940
He used the excuse of sending
a birthday greeting...

457
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,440
to abduct us into the palace.

458
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:01,950
He even forced some of our co-villagers
and my grandson to learn it.

459
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,840
We need strength for this performance.

460
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,430
-Ying Luo...
-He's still a child.

461
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,190
How could he not get hurt?

462
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,490
Don't meddle with this.
We can't help them.

463
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,720
Ying Luo, quickly go.

464
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,570
Stop pulling me! I can walk by myself.

465
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,750
Miss, just leave.

466
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,270
Let's go.

467
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,650
If I don't pull you away,
you surely will meddle.

468
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,250
I know you too well.

469
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,350
Not only...

470
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,150
the "Thousands of  Purples and Reds",

471
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,000
even those embroidery maids
from your Embroidery House,

472
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,360
they surely would be working happily
as mere commoners outside the palace.

473
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,750
Once you entered the Forbidden City,
you have to work to your bone.

474
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,160
And before you hit 30 years old,

475
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,890
you would lose both your sight and limbs,
you would become useless.

476
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,280
This is the Forbidden City. This is power.

477
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Unless you become one of
the rich and powerful around,

478
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,240
your fate will never
be your own to control.

479
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,080
Hence, while you can barely
save your own skin,

480
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,090
don't be nosy and pretend
you see nothing.

481
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,760
Enough. It's already late.
Let's get moving.

482
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,950
The stairs of Yujing Pavilion
is so inconvenient.

483
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,220
Didn't I tell you to rest
in Changchun Palace?

484
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:35,430
Your Majesty is in a good spirit,
I should be attending by your side.

485
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,670
Moreover, I'm healthy.

486
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,800
Just because I'm pregnant,
His Majesty ordered that...

487
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,530
I just lie down in Changchun Palace.
I really can't take it anymore.

488
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,090
This banquet would be a great chance
for me to have some fresh air.

489
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,110
Of course this is
all because of your grace.

490
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,050
You...

491
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,120
You should still prioritize
in taking care of your health.

492
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,340
Stop pushing yourself too hard.

493
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,520
There are a lot of affairs to manage.

494
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,640
I indeed am sensing my stamina
couldn't catch up with it.

495
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,800
I hope Empress Dowager can be merciful...

496
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,040
and remove the heavy duty on me,

497
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,450
so I can focus on taking care of myself.

498
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,650
Who is your choice
to manage the inner palace?

499
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,320
I find Consort Chun
reliable and thoughtful.

500
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,400
Consort Xian has noble character
and  is respected by the six palaces.

501
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,660
If the two will work together, I am sure
they can take good care of the affairs.

502
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,440
His Majesty will have
no unnecessary worries.

503
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:42,580
I also am quite fond of
the people you recommended.

504
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,760
Starting today, you two must
work together to manage the affairs.

505
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,970
Don't disappoint the Empress.

506
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,550
I surely will do my best to share
Her Majesty's burden.

507
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,590
-Get up.
-Yes.

508
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,210
Today is a family banquet,
so no need for formalities.

509
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,230
Everyone, please take your seat.

510
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,240
Yes.

511
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,520
This chrysanthemum wine
is refreshing and sweet,

512
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,440
it's good for both
the liver and the sight.

513
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,000
His Majesty even ordered the kitchen...

514
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,020
to use the remaining black chrysanthemum
from last year to make wine.

515
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,380
Empress Dowager, try it out.
See if this wine tastes better.

516
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,690
It seems to be more bitter.

517
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,580
Empress Dowager,
for this chrysanthemum wine,

518
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,540
we added angelica,
foxglove, and wolfberry.

519
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,000
It's a great nourishment for the body.

520
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,200
Consort Chun is indeed
well-versed in the medical field...

521
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,480
A sniff is enough to tell you
everything about the wine.

522
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,110
Wine cures the illnesses,
chrysanthemum can hinder ageing.

523
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,980
Your Majesty, why are you not drinking?

524
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,840
Noble Consort,
Her Majesty is now carrying a child.

525
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,800
Chrysanthemum wine
brings coldness to the body,

526
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,300
which could harm Her Majesty.

527
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,960
I've already prepared
a warm milk tea for Her Majesty.

528
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,080
I see. I wasn't being thoughtful enough.

529
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,600
May Your Majesty forgive me.

530
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,800
I knew you were not feeling well today,

531
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,530
I ordered the cook to prepare
a hot pot for us.

532
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,680
We cancelled the crabs,
and have venison instead.

533
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,150
You don't have to drink the wine.

534
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,980
Drink some hot soup and warm yourself up.

535
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,120
I thank Empress Dowager for understanding.

536
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,210
Is everything in place?

537
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,080
Noble Lady, don't worry.
Everything has been arranged.

538
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,690
Your Majesty.

539
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,720
Although deer blood is very nutritious,

540
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,850
but it increases circulation.
Her Majesty mustn't eat it while pregnant.

541
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,370
Get rid of it!

542
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,900
Can't you see? Get rid of it!

543
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,620
Yes, right away.

544
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,910
It was my doing!
Empress Dowager, please forgive me!

545
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,870
Can you do nothing right?
Clean that up now!

546
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,490
Yes!

547
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,950
The stench of raw meat is too strong.
