[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,490
I hate my teacher.

4
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,800
He once showed me kindness.

5
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,450
But at the moment of life and death,
he pushed me out without any hesitation!

6
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,580
How could the respected Consort Xian...

7
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,740
do something so lowly?

8
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,400
Scoundrel! How dare you steal
from the palace in secret!

9
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,930
I didn't do anything wrong!

10
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,120
-Still deny it? You are doubly guilty now.
-I didn't do anything wrong!

11
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,510
And I hate this evil heaven more.

12
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,050
This laughable world.

13
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,000
What did I do wrong?

14
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,670
Why do I have to suffer so many hardships?

15
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,120
I have the same noble blood

16
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,640
as all of my other brothers.

17
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,270
Each and every one of them lives
a lofty life. But what about me?

18
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,670
I had to endure...

19
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,050
the greatest insults in this world...

20
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,370
and be the lowliest servant.

21
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,210
I have to crawl on the ground.

22
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,220
So, Ying Luo,

23
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
the ways of the heaven are unfair...

24
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,920
and the ways of the world are cruel.

25
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,480
If you don't want to become the prey,

26
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,600
you have to become the hunter.

27
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,070
But it's okay.

28
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,370
I'm your brother.

29
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,270
Sister,

30
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,280
I, Yuan Chun Wang, swear that...

31
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,570
I will protect you.

32
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,800
Because...

33
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,750
Because we are one.

34
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,930
You are me...

35
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,180
and I am you.

36
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,920
Consort Chun.

37
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,060
Yu Hu, go and keep guard outside.

38
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,730
Yes, Your Highness.

39
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,110
Your Highness, why did you ask for me?

40
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,510
Why are you marrying Er Qing?

41
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,330
-This is His Majesty's edict.
-No!

42
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,100
You agreed to this marriage...

43
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,820
to save Wei Ying Luo...

44
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,790
and clear her name.

45
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,250
Just for a servant in Labour House.

46
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,680
Is it worth it?

47
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,300
This is my personal matter.

48
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
No need to concern yourself with it.

49
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,640
Fu Heng!

50
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,909
You really don't remember me?

51
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,720
Consort Chun, what are you talking about?

52
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,490
Your sister and I are close friends
even before we got married.

53
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,720
In the past,

54
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,760
I had always gone to Fuca Mansion to play.

55
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,880
[Jing Hao, what do you want to eat later?]

56
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,130
[I'll ask the kitchen staff
to prepare it.]

57
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,260
[Mung bean pastry!]

58
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,260
-[What about snow fungus soup?]
-[Sure!]

59
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,010
[Jing Hao.]

60
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,960
[Miss.]

61
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,920
[Fu Heng!]

62
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,280
-[Sister.]
-[Accompany me to...]

63
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,610
[the tea house at Zhengyang Street
for an opera tomorrow.]

64
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,790
[I also want to go to the jewellery store
at Xiceli Street.]

65
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,880
[Don't forget about it. Another thing.]

66
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,970
[Let's go for a horse ride
the day after tomorrow.]

67
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,760
[Later, go to the stable
to check on Comet for me.]

68
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,260
[I remember.]

69
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,110
[Look at your pendant.
It's so old already.]

70
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,390
[I'll make you a new one tomorrow.]

71
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,909
[Jing Hao, let's go.]

72
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,760
My sister had a lot of close friends
before she was married.

73
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't remember you.

74
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,850
I don't believe it.

75
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,040
If you don't remember me,

76
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,730
why do you keep wearing
the pendant I gave you?

77
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,300
Wasn't this from my sister?

78
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,150
[Miss, let's go.]

79
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,820
[Hold on.]

80
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,110
Your Highness,

81
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,310
if there is nothing else,
I'll take my leave now.

82
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,440
Your Highness,
Fu Heng is an unfaithful man.

83
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,570
Why can't you forget about him?

84
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,500
Yes,

85
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,630
No matter how good he is,

86
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,560
you have already entered the palace
and became a consort.

87
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,020
You should focus on being in His Majesty's
favour and stabilising your position.

88
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,300
But instead, you keep defending...

89
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,560
Her Majesty for him...

90
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,690
to the point of avoiding His Majesty.

91
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,020
But what did you get in the end?

92
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,060
He has never placed you in his heart.

93
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,620
Everything that you did is meaningless.

94
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,900
Shut up!

95
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,140
I really can't take it anymore.

96
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,500
Even if you don't want to hear it,
I have to tell you about it.

97
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,130
You're an intelligent person.

98
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,330
But why are you so foolish
when it comes to him?

99
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,440
Stop being sad for him.

100
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,460
Stop doing stupid things, okay?

101
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,800
I asked you to stop! Get out!

102
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,900
Stop right there.

103
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,850
Your Highness.

104
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,620
Where's that letter of mine?

105
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,800
Back then,

106
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,520
I asked you to give Fu Heng a letter.

107
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,210
[Remember. You must personally
hand this letter to him.]

108
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,570
I did it for your sake.

109
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,840
All this time, I thought that...

110
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,000
he accepted that pendant...

111
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,930
because he had feelings for me.

112
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,010
But because I went into
Prince Bao Mansion...

113
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,510
and became a princess there,

114
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,740
he deliberately distanced himself from me.

115
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,330
But all along,

116
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,760
that love letter of mine...

117
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,710
has never reached him!

118
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,310
Why?

119
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,330
Why did you do it?

120
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,050
-Tell me, why?
-Your Highness!

121
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,320
Master had long decided that...

122
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,720
that he was going to marry you
to Prince Bao.

123
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,490
You were always destined to enter
the prince mansion.

124
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,770
If I gave that letter to him,

125
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,950
it would have destroyed you
and the Su family!

126
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,830
So, you just watched...

127
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,450
while I fell deeper and deeper
into this sinkhole...

128
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,640
and kept on deceiving myself!

129
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,810
And then, you watched while I...

130
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,990
lost all of my dignity
in front of him, right?

131
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,320
Your Highness.

132
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,170
You were so obsessed with Fu Heng.

133
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,520
You even refused to enter
the prince mansion...

134
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,490
at the expense of your life.

135
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,290
Only when you knew that Miss Fuca
would be married to Prince Bao...

136
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,250
did you agree to enter the mansion too.

137
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,640
You said that you'd
accompany and protect her...

138
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,360
on behalf of Fu Heng.

139
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,190
I saw how you pulled yourself
together again.

140
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,320
How could I bear to tell you the truth?

141
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,200
I just wished for you to feel
the same way as I do for you.

142
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,890
Then, you wouldn't disappoint me
for the affection that I have for you.

143
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,020
I saw him...

144
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,070
wearing that pendant every day.

145
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,990
I thought that...

146
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,520
he had some feelings towards me too.

147
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,420
Yu Hu,

148
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,330
I didn't ask for much.

149
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,720
I didn't even need him to love me.

150
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,790
I just hoped that...

151
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,290
he would remember
and think about my love for him.

152
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,360
And that would be enough.

153
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,820
But,

154
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,680
since the very beginning,

155
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,120
Fu Heng didn't know anything.

156
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,250
He didn't understand anything!

157
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,540
All the protections that I had given
to Her Majesty all these years...

158
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,740
and my infatuation for so many years...

159
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,260
are just a joke!

160
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,200
Do you know that?

161
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,740
Your Highness.

162
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Do you know how painful my heart is?

163
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,780
Do you know who much pain am I in?

164
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,160
You don't know!

165
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,180
This kind of delusion...

166
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,860
is the greatest kind of humiliation!

167
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,690
Your Highness.

168
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,650
I only mean well for you, Your Highness.

169
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,090
My name can be easily changed.

170
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,840
But no one has ever cherished your heart.

171
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,000
You've been foolish for ten years.

172
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,030
It's time to wake up.

173
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,560
Greetings, Noble Consort Xian.

174
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,730
Your Highness,
quickly wipe away your tears.

175
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,900
You mustn't let anyone notice anything.

176
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,970
Your Highness,
even if it's not for yourself,

177
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,910
think about Su family and your siblings.

178
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,980
Consort Chun, what important matter do you
have that kept me waiting for so long?

179
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,960
Noble Consort Xian.

180
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,080
We are sisters who get along well.

181
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,040
No need to be bothered with
this pretentious etiquette.

182
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,280
Just address me like how you used to.

183
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,330
Yes, Your Highness.

184
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,360
Why are you here today?

185
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,530
Why are you looking at me like this?

186
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,190
Bring her in.

187
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,220
This old servant is such a greenhorn.

188
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,320
She blurted out everything
after just a few beatings.

189
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,180
Consort Chun,
do you want to know what she said?

190
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,730
Your Highness,

191
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,100
vile slaves like her often
slander someone over measly things.

192
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,360
But when they are interrogated,
they can't wait to blame others for it.

193
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,690
You can't believe any words she said.

194
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,360
Yu Hu, don't deny it.

195
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,020
Consort Chun is the one who
ordered me to frame Wei Ying Luo.

196
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,770
-This is really Consort Chun's doing!
-Rubbish!

197
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,830
Her Highness has no grudge
against that palace maid.

198
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,880
Why would she frame her?

199
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,730
You were clearly instructed
by someone else.

200
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,280
But you are accusing Consort Chun instead.

201
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,380
Consort Chun, what do you have to say?

202
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,490
Sister,

203
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,160
this is slander.

204
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,970
I know very well
what kind of a person you are.

205
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,050
I won't allow you to slander Consort Chun!

206
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,860
Guards!

207
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,800
Cut off her tongue.

208
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,130
No!

209
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,360
Servant like her who speaks evils of
another and slanders her mistress...

210
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,890
should be punished severely
to serve as a reminder to everyone.

211
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,590
From now on,

212
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,970
no one will dare disrespect
their superiors,

213
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,120
speak nonsense and slander
their mistresses anymore.

214
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,000
Thank you for your trust in me.

215
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,760
Why are your hands so cold?

216
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,290
Did I scare you earlier?

217
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,480
Take her out!

218
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,320
Sister, your body have always been
weaker and you are afraid of cold.

219
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Now, the weather is getting cold.
You must take good care of your health.

220
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,880
Yes, Your Highness.

221
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,950
She has changed.

222
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,079
Noble Consort Xian has changed
into another person.

223
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,349
Your Highness.

224
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,520
No matter what,

225
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,000
we've safely survived it.

226
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,080
No.

227
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,610
She knows.

228
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,300
I have an intuition that...

229
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,860
she knows everything.

230
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,700
It's true.

231
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,670
What is she doing?

232
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,550
I don't know. Let's go and have a look.

233
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,400
-You scared me!
-What are you doing?

234
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,360
-Getting ready to ridicule someone.
-What?

235
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,950
You don't know yet.

236
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,960
Wei Ying Luo has gotten really hurt
for trying to climb the social ladder.

237
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,560
I'm waiting to watch her cry.

238
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,570
What are you doing?

239
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,710
She said that she's here to ridicule you.

240
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,840
You!

241
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,640
Let go of me.

242
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,290
-What are you doing? Let go of me!
-Don't you want to laugh?

243
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,090
Sure. Let me help you.

244
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,530
-Laugh!
-You're hurting me!

245
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,550
Wei Ying Luo, let go of me!

246
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,570
Wei Ying Luo, let me tell you.

247
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Lord Fuca is about to marry
another woman soon!

248
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,520
Just continue acting tough!

249
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,740
Before you laugh at me,

250
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,780
try rubbing your own stomach.

251
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,720
Isn't it empty?

252
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,240
It's already noon now.

253
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,240
If our chief finds out that
you are all loafing on your job,

254
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,840
there'll be no lunch for you.

255
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,650
You can't even fill your own stomach, yet,
you have the leisure to ridicule others.

256
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,240
Let's go now!

257
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,860
Let's go.

258
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,880
You're really a cold-hearted woman!

259
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,440
Yes.

260
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,470
I'm indeed cold-hearted.

261
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,970
Do you still want to laugh?
I'll help you.

262
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,170
Laugh!

263
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,560
Let go of me! You crazy woman!

264
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,680
What are you laughing at?

265
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,370
I wonder who was the one
that cried so much yesterday...

266
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,390
and has to wash her eyes
early in the morning today.

267
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,160
Are you afraid they'll find out that
you cried from your swollen eyes?

268
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,280
I cried because I was upset.

269
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,670
But by letting others see me cry,

270
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,720
I'll just get a cold shoulder.
It's meaningless.

271
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,540
Are you not upset anymore?

272
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,210
I still have to work and eat
even if I'm upset.

273
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,700
After I'm done being upset,
I should do what I should.

274
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,790
I wonder who was the one that cried
to the point of fainting yesterday.

275
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,520
Was it you?

276
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,000
Those who abandoned me
are just a past to me now.

277
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,930
We should never hold on to the past.

278
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,320
No matter how upset I am,
I have to tell myself that...

279
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,770
it's fine.

280
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,800
Because one day,
I will definitely have something better.

281
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,150
Great! That's the spirit.

282
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,240
Brother Yuan,

283
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
I know who killed Noble Consort Gao.

284
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,790
Her Majesty is awake.

285
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,840
Her Majesty is awake!

286
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,650
Guards!

287
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,480
Your Majesty!
Yu are finally awake, Your Majesty!

288
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,040
I want to get up.

289
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,120
Ming Yu.

290
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,300
My legs.

291
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,720
-Calm down, Your Majesty.
-What happened to my legs?

292
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,380
I'll call for the imperial physician
at once. He will be here soon!

293
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,110
Don't call for the physician.

294
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,770
Ask Fu Heng to come here.

295
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,680
I want to see him.

296
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,660
Tell him to come here.

297
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,390
All of you,

298
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,160
come over here.

299
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,420
Do you know that
Jin Xiu ran away last night?

300
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,230
Ran away? She actually ran away?

301
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,520
The Forbidden City is heavily guarded.

302
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,320
-Where can she escape to?
-That girl is too bold.

303
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
-Isn't she afraid to die?
-Listen to me carefully.

304
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,850
If you have any news about her,
you have to report it to me.

305
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,890
Or else, you will be punished
for being her accomplice.

306
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,690
Alright now. End of discussion.
Go back to work.

307
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,440
That girl is so audacious.

308
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,480
-Doesn't she want to live anymore?
-That's right.

309
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,710
Brother!

310
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,560
Look for her over there first.

311
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,060
Go.

312
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,040
What is it?

313
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,520
Has Jin Xiu really gone missing?

314
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,380
When did I say that she has gone missing?

315
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,200
She ran away last night.

316
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,980
If she had planned on running away,
why weren't there any signs before this?

317
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,960
Moreover, Forbidden City
is heavily guarded.

318
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,670
She doesn't have wings.
Where can she go?

319
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,720
How is that your business?

320
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,250
Look at the wounds on your hand.

321
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,460
Your hands are soaked in water every day.

322
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,260
Your wounds will only get worse.

323
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,930
No.

324
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,060
I can't let you stay here anymore.

325
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,280
-Go to the Heating Department instead.
-Heating Department?

326
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,600
The Heating Department
is under the Fuel House.

327
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,300
They are in charge of supplying fuel
to all palaces.

328
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,790
It's not yet winter.

329
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,720
They don't need to supply the charcoal.
So, they might have a lighter workload.

330
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,000
Use this chance to rest.

331
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,350
Don't be so diligent
in your work from now on.

332
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,340
You must learn how to slack off. Got that?

333
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,600
Fine. I got it.

334
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,850
-Jin Xiu...
-Stop mentioning her. Come.

335
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,260
Remember to apply the medicine
I gave you every day.

336
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,920
You mustn't skip it for even a day.
Do you hear me?

337
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,610
As for those matters that
don't concern you,

338
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,410
no need to be bothered with them.

339
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,950
Let's go.

340
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,610
Your Majesty, you're finally awake.

341
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,660
I was really worried.

342
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,050
I could hear everything you said...

343
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,940
all the time.

344
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,880
I just...

345
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,930
couldn't open my eyes.

346
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,660
It was like...

347
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,760
being trapped in a dark nightmare.

348
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,680
I couldn't wake up.

349
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,930
Now,

350
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,660
everything has passed.

351
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,450
Your Majesty.

352
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,670
You need not worry.

353
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,010
Ye Tian Shi already said that you can't...

354
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,220
move your legs because
you were unconscious for too long.

355
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,970
But you'll be able to recover
for sure after some time.

356
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,690
Sister!

357
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,320
Greetings, Your Majesty!

358
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,210
Your Majesty.

359
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,490
I still have state affairs to attend to.
I have to return to Yangxin Hall.

360
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,750
I'll accompany you again at night.

361
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,770
-Fu Heng.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

362
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,890
-Keep your sister company.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

363
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,410
After talking to her,

364
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,160
come to Yangxin Palace to see me.

365
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,850
I still have a task for you.

366
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:04,670
Her Majesty just woke up.
Don't exhaust her.

367
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,170
Sister.

368
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,830
Where's Er Qing?

369
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,770
Sister.

370
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,260
You are so foolish!

371
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,040
If I didn't agree with the marriage
bestowed by His Majesty,

372
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,970
I wouldn't be able to save Ying Luo.

373
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,990
With Ying Luo's personality,

374
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,120
she would rather
go through death with you.

375
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,830
Do you know that...

376
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,270
from the moment you said yes,

377
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,020
she will never forgive you?

378
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,460
Are you really ready...

379
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,700
to part with her forever?

380
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,510
This matter is too unfair...

381
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,930
for you,

382
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,450
for Ying Luo...

383
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,070
and for Er Qing.

384
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,160
No matter how high a price I must pay,

385
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,780
I will beg His Majesty
to take back his decree.

386
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,990
Sister,

387
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,440
the decree has been promulgated.

388
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,440
Er Qing has already left the palace
to prepare for the wedding.

389
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,480
There's no going back.

390
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,310
If you beg His Majesty
to retract his decree,

391
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,720
you'll just destroy
the reputation of Fuca family...

392
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,580
and Er Qing will lose her dignity.

393
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,230
You'll force her to death.

394
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,100
Besides, she agreed to this marriage...

395
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,560
just to help me.

396
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,640
In terms of friendship and righteousness,
I can't do this to her.

397
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,480
At first, I thought that...

398
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,990
at the very least,

399
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,920
you and Ying Luo...

400
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,660
could find your happiness together.

401
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,250
I never thought that...

402
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,240
the ending is still the same.

403
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,890
-Sister.
-Leave.

404
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,130
-I don't want to see you.
-Sister.

405
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,410
Just leave.

406
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,450
Fu Heng!

407
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,600
This is about your lifetime of happiness.

408
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,120
Have you really made up your mind?

409
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,920
Yes.

410
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,320
I'm really worried about you.

411
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,490
You will regret this
for the rest of your life.

412
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,510
Sister,

413
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,970
everyone must take responsibility
for their own decision.

414
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,630
Please forgive me.

415
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,020
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

416
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,790
Her Majesty just woke up.

417
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,680
The imperial physician said that
she can't receive any visitors yet.

418
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,340
I will inform Her Majesty
about your kind visit.

419
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,980
Please go back first.

420
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,250
Her Majesty doesn't want to
see me either?

421
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,070
I thought that the rumours are fake.

422
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,540
Looks like they are not
groundless rumours.

423
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,860
Rumours?

424
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,760
Haven't you heard?

425
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,600
Her Majesty is against the marriage
of Imperial Guard Fuca.

426
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,160
She is gloomy all day long.

427
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:12,190
She doesn't even want to see
His Majesty now.

428
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,880
But no matter what, this is
a familial matter of Fuca family.

429
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,140
It's right for Her Majesty to be worried.

430
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,300
If you are free, why not spend
some time with me at my palace?

431
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,110
I would love to do that.

432
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,240
Your Majesty, eat something.

433
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
Your Majesty!

434
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,950
Your Majesty!

435
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,160
Leave us.

436
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,430
No matter what is
your reason for being angry,

437
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,080
you shouldn't punish your body for it.

438
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,760
-You're here.
-Yes.

439
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,510
I'm here.

440
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,500
But it's very obvious that...

441
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,970
your mind...

442
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,680
is no longer here.

443
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,680
Your Majesty.

444
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,410
Can you tell me...

445
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,730
what is it that you are thinking about?

446
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,080
Your Majesty,

447
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,800
I'm begging you.

448
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,700
Can you cancel the marriage
that you've bestowed in Fu Heng?

449
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,570
Impossible.

450
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,950
Since you've already said no,

451
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,400
I have nothing more to say.

452
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,860
Your Majesty,

453
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,460
I don't understand.

454
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,290
Er Qing is elegant, composed,
good-looking and intelligent.

455
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,430
Her grandfather is the minister
of the Ministry of Justice.

456
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,890
I even raised the status
of her whole family.

457
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,430
No matter it's in terms of
personality or status,

458
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,370
she is not unworthy of Fu Heng.

459
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,310
Everyone is happy about it.

460
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,520
Why are you the only one
who is upset about it?

461
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,730
Everyone is happy?

462
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,240
Your Majesty.

463
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,140
Do you really think so?

464
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,630
Isn't that true?

465
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,880
Your Majesty,

466
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,160
you are the ruler of this empire.

467
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,000
Every word you speak
is as precious as gold.

468
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,880
No one would dare disobey you.

469
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,340
I've been attending to you for many years.

470
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,850
I want to...

471
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,920
ask you one question.

472
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,410
Why do you have to break apart...

473
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,430
Fu Heng and the woman he loves?

474
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,910
I already said it many times.

475
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,350
She's not worthy of him.

476
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,690
Your Majesty. Fu Heng doesn't even care...

477
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,130
whether she is worthy or not.

478
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,860
But why do you care?

479
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,990
One must choose a virtuous wife.

480
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,080
Fu Heng is the right-hand man I chose.

481
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,110
He will be of great use in the future.

482
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,790
I won't allow him...

483
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,389
to have a sinister and manipulative wife.

484
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,889
I'm protecting him...

485
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,739
from being seduced by a vicious woman...

486
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:17,400
and committing
the biggest mistake in his life.

487
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,500
What are you laughing at?

488
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,630
Didn't you do it out of
your own selfish motives?

489
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,350
What selfish motives do I have?

490
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,810
Perhaps...

491
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,469
you've taken a liking to Wei Ying Luo...

492
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,840
and wants her for yourself.

493
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,120
Your Majesty, have you been
unconscious for too long...

494
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,280
until your brain is fuzzy now?

495
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,280
Let me tell you.

496
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,210
This is just your delusion.
A crazy delusion!

497
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,680
Your Majesty!

498
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,920
-Your Majesty.
-I beg you.

499
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,790
-I beg you.
-This will never happen.

500
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,080
Your Majesty, Fu Heng is not someone
who can have a change of heart so easily.

501
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,140
Or else, I wouldn't have interfered.

502
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,540
I'm his sister. I know him.

503
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,280
Your Majesty. You are wealthy
and do not lack any women.

504
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,920
I'm begging you.

505
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,900
Can you be magnanimous...

506
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,540
and let him marry the one he loves?

507
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,510
Your Majesty!

508
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,580
Your Majesty!

509
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,600
Get the Imperial Academy of Medicine
to treat her.

510
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,460
She has to recuperate from her illness.

511
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

512
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,470
Your Majesty, why did you do it?

513
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,200
There's no turning back now.

514
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,760
Fu Heng is my most important
family member.

515
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,320
I thought that...

516
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,330
at least the both of them could be happy.

517
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,640
But...

518
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,720
Your Majesty.

519
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,970
But...

520
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,250
Miss Ming Yu, what do you want?

521
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,310
Her Majesty is so heartbroken
because of Imperial Guard Fuca.

522
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,840
But he is totally indifferent.

523
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,520
-How could he do that?
-This marriage is bestowed by His Majesty.

524
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,180
What do you expect him to do?
Go against the decree?

525
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,140
I...

526
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,930
What is it? You have
no retort for that, right?

527
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,710
Stop giving him a hard time.

528
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,750
You men are all useless creatures!

529
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,770
How could you just kick me?
You didn't give me any warning at all.

530
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,530
Miss Ming Yu,

531
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,960
why are you crying over
Fu Heng's marriage?

532
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,180
I'm angry.

533
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,560
I'm sad.

534
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,480
Why are you angry and sad?

535
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,730
I'm angry because Fuca Fu Heng
didn't fight harder for it.

536
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,560
I'm sad...

537
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,020
because I regret being
infatuated with him in the past.

538
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,680
What are you laughing at?

539
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,670
-Come with me.
-Where are we going?

540
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,960
We are almost there. Be careful.

541
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,760
Where are you taking me?

542
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,970
Come here, Miss Ming Yu.

543
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,460
Miss Ming Yu, take a look.

544
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,690
No matter what worries you have,

545
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,450
climb to a high place
and take in the view.

546
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,570
It'll make you feel better...

547
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,160
and all of your worries will be gone.

548
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,670
What do you know?

549
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,520
People in a bad mood might
want to jump down from here...

550
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,530
to end everything.

551
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,890
Didn't you want to die?
Let me fulfil your wish.

552
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,920
Why are you holding on to me so tightly?

553
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,280
You are a lunatic!

554
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,860
I was just citing an example.
Just an example. Understand?

555
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,160
I don't like Fuca Fu Heng now.

556
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,150
I won't kill myself just because
he's getting married.

557
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,680
Looks like a woman's heart
changes very quickly.

558
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,280
Before this, you even
gave him a perfume pouch.

559
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,690
You don't like him now?

560
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,730
I just feel outraged for Ying Luo.

561
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,510
How could Fuca Fu Heng have
a change of heart without any signs?

562
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,940
I just feel outraged for Her Majesty too.

563
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,300
She's trying so hard to help her brother
until the point of defying His Majesty.

564
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,500
But in the end, no one is grateful at all.

565
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,480
Miss Ming Yu.

566
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,200
As humans, is love
the only thing worth pursuing?

567
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,640
A good man should aspire
for greater things.

568
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,000
Why should they be tied down by love?

569
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,560
You sound so righteous.
What do you want to do then?

570
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,640
Me?

571
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,360
I want to fight on the battlefield.

572
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,110
I want to make contributions
to the nation.

573
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,210
I want to go down in history.

574
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,690
-You don't want a family of your own?
-Yes, I don't.

575
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,330
One can die at any time
on the battlefield.

576
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,640
If I'm alive, my wife will have to
live alone for years and years to come.

577
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,690
It'll be even more terrible if I die.
She will become a widow.

578
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:40,830
Dead or alive,

579
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,060
it'll still be a disaster.

580
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,820
I want to live happily all by myself.

581
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,320
One day, I will lead hundreds of thousands
of mounted and foot soldiers...

582
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,470
to bring victories to Great Qing.

583
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,590
Miss Ming Yu,

584
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,650
don't be sad for what you have lost.

585
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:08,130
When you look back at it ten years later,
it will just be a minor thing.

586
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,740
Smile and everything will pass.

587
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,120
You are right.

588
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,580
-What are you doing?
-You pushed me and I stepped on your foot.

589
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,990
We are even now.

590
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,490
Smile and everything will pass.

591
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,100
You are really something.

592
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,300
You are not young anymore.

593
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,220
You should start planning for yourself.

594
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,080
Life is lonely in the palace.

595
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,970
If you have a son...

596
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,390
No, a daughter will be good too.

597
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,460
You'll lead a happier life.

598
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,680
When you wake up...

599
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,750
and hear your child's laughter or cries
every day, even a bigger palace...

600
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,050
will become very lively in an instant.

601
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,060
I know you are loyal to Her Majesty.

602
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,740
But there aren't many offsprings
in the harem.

603
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,640
And Her Majesty is...

604
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,840
What's wrong with Her Majesty?

605
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,440
Physician Zhang said that
Her Majesty has ruined her health.

606
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,800
So, it'll be even harder for her
to bear any child again.

607
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,860
Why did I talk about this.

608
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,640
I have caused you to worry.

609
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,560
Yong Cheng.

610
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,050
Come, this is for you.

611
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,280
You like this one?

612
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,780
The fourth prince is really
lively and adorable.

613
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,580
Come. Over here.

614
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,060
Your hair is messy.

615
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,260
Let me comb it for you.

616
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,600
-Zhen, take Yong Cheng out.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

617
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,360
You are beautiful,
outstanding and talented.

618
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,530
If you are willing to work on it,
it'll still not too late for you.

619
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,760
No matter how well Her Majesty
treats you and how lenient she is to you,

620
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,500
she still can't live your life for you.

621
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,500
You are young and beautiful now.

622
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,960
But year after year,

623
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,470
if...

624
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,630
beautiful women continue to
flood the palace,

625
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,060
your beauty will wane along with your age.

626
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,330
One year,

627
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,570
ten years, twenty years.

628
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,350
We are trapped inside this palace...

629
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,870
and have to live a lonely and boring life.

630
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,950
If...

631
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,560
you don't have a child of your own,

632
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,520
your life in the future
will be cold and lonely.

633
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,520
You might not be able to accept
what I'm saying now in the past.

634
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,640
But now...

635
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,410
Did I hurt you?

636
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,160
Remember this.
Pain will wake you up to your senses.
