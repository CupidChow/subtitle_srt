[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 69]

3
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,870
Let's go.

4
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,390
Your Majesty, Prince He
is in charge of security.

5
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,830
He said that he'll meet you later.

6
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,750
I understand.

7
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,830
Your Majesty, there's one
more thing I must report to you.

8
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,310
When we arrived at Yangzhou,

9
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,500
there was an opera
performance organized...

10
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,980
by local officials and merchants...

11
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,990
for His Majesty and the
empress dowager to enjoy.

12
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,390
But before we left, they put...

13
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,370
two beautiful and talented lean mares
on the escort ships.

14
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,740
The mares have been delivered
to the emperor's ship today.

15
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,620
When you see them
upon entering the main hall,

16
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,980
please don't get mad.

17
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,030
-Lean mares?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

18
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,550
How dare they send in...

19
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,390
courtesans from the brothel!

20
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,870
Your Majesty.

21
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,770
You have been inspecting the
local municipalities and river works...

22
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,829
while caring for the local citizens.

23
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,270
Your meritorious deeds are widely praised.

24
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,560
But it's a shame that
the local officials...

25
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,120
sent these courtesans here
as an vulgar act of flattery.

26
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,910
If news of this gets out,
it will damage your reputation.

27
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,340
In my opinion,

28
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,420
we should send these courtesans away...

29
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,220
and have the imperial
musicians perform instead.

30
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,950
Your Majesty, my words
may not sound pleasant,

31
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,070
but true advice has always been harsh.

32
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,940
If I were not the empress,

33
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,240
I could let this pass
like how others will do.

34
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,150
But as the empress,

35
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,390
if I just sit here and enjoy
such obscene music with you,

36
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,270
I might be the target of public criticism.

37
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,510
The empress dowager just went to rest.

38
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,040
If she learns of this,

39
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,310
she surely will blame me
for dereliction of duty.

40
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,459
-Pardon my late arrival, Your Majesty.
-Sit.

41
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

42
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,030
Consort Ling.

43
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,670
As a noble consort, you are
obliged to advise the emperor.

44
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,710
Now that these
lean mares are on this ship,

45
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,670
what do you say?

46
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,950
This girl has a charming smile
and large beautiful eyes!

47
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,590
Compared to the beauties
in Forbidden City,

48
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,350
she does look exotic.

49
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,630
No wonder you enjoy
the performance, Your Majesty.

50
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,070
I find this delighting too.

51
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,150
Beautiful sceneries, beautiful wine
and beautiful ladies...

52
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,910
do paint a beautiful picture.

53
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,830
What exquisite taste you have, Ying Luo.

54
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,630
Consort Ling.

55
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,190
Your Majesty.

56
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,350
Confucius said that appetite
and lust are only natural.

57
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,200
People all enjoy beautiful things.

58
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,020
I just hate that I'm not a man.

59
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,910
If I were a man...

60
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,300
What would you do?

61
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,460
Have the beauties all to myself
and enjoy the pleasure of life!

62
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,230
But you're a woman, forget about it!

63
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,430
Not necessarily.

64
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,020
I may not enjoy having beautiful ladies,

65
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,720
but I can enjoy the company
of handsome eunuchs.

66
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,150
Some occasional eye candies
would satisfy me enough.

67
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,230
Your Majesty, I think...

68
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,180
Eunuch De Sheng at your palace
will be a good choice.

69
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,040
Your Majesty, may I have him?

70
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,230
Your Highness, please
don't make fun of me.

71
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,600
Consort Ling, De Sheng
is a clever servant.

72
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,350
His Majesty wouldn't give him up.

73
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,890
Maybe you should choose another one.

74
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,540
I have some handsome eunuchs in my palace.

75
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,440
I'll send you some when we go back.

76
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,570
I only have sloppy men in my palace.

77
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,520
I don't wish to foul your sight.

78
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,570
But if you like, I can pick some for you.

79
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,040
Thank you, everyone!

80
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,340
Remember, not only must they be handsome,

81
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,920
they need also be eloquent and humorous.

82
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,240
Balderdash!

83
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,580
Stop dancing.

84
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,170
Get the imperial musicians here.

85
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

86
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,600
Your casual remarks
would bring me trouble...

87
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,740
if the censor officials hear them.

88
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,910
You are right, Your Majesty!

89
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,800
Some of them are among us.

90
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,900
Their spit is enough to drown us all.

91
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,800
Consort Ling, you should
be more careful with your words.

92
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,500
I just want some handsome
eunuchs in my palace...

93
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,070
for occasional delight.

94
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,780
What's wrong with that?

95
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,270
Shut up already.

96
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,470
Anyway,

97
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,750
we'll arrive in Hangzhou soon,

98
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,210
a paradise full of beauties.

99
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,550
You can't stop me
from looking, Your Majesty.

100
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,350
I've heard of a beautiful and
talented courtesan in Hangzhou.

101
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,280
Her lilting voice can stun the world.

102
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,510
I shall hire her to perform here
no matter how much it costs!

103
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,150
If I don't hire courtesans here,
neither will you.

104
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,350
If the censors take note of this,

105
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,970
I'll become a laughing-stock
for the future generations.

106
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,240
Perhaps you don't feel
embarrassed, but I do.

107
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,290
Your Majesty, I shall
retreat to my chamber.

108
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,780
-Your Highness.
-Have you found him?

109
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,760
Yes, Your Highness,
we have found Physician Ye.

110
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,429
I'm in charge of security in this tour.

111
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,309
As long as we plan meticulously,

112
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,590
we surely will succeed.

113
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,710
We don't have much time.

114
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,630
You can't hesitate anymore!

115
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,070
Even if you don't think for yourself,

116
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,770
you need to consider the Twelfth Prince.

117
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,640
Please believe me.

118
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,470
I will help you.

119
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,490
Over the years, only you
would always support me.

120
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,990
I remember your feelings
and understand your heart!

121
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,430
Of course I believe you.

122
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,190
Don't worry.

123
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,920
I will follow your plan.

124
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,310
What's wrong?

125
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,550
Her Majesty has another plan.

126
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,890
As the saying goes, a witty
rabbit has three burrows,

127
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,950
let alone a meticulous person
like Her Majesty.

128
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,540
She's still as cautious as ever
even when she is ill.

129
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,990
Will there be a change in our plan?

130
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,150
It's fine.

131
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,950
I will inform Prince He to act sooner.

132
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,630
Your Highness, do you feel anything here?

133
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,910
When the weather changes,
it hurts a little.

134
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,700
But I can't exert any strength there.

135
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,630
I can only walk with a cane.

136
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,220
Physician Ye, can my leg still be cured?

137
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,070
Of course it can.

138
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,420
If your leg nerves
have been completely severed,

139
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,390
your right leg wouldn't
feel anything at all.

140
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,430
But...

141
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,670
But what?

142
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,430
Your Majesty.

143
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,550
I have to break the bone and
remove the necrotic tissues...

144
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,350
so the bone can rebuild itself.

145
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,680
However, this is a dangerous method.

146
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,720
It might even sever his
leg nerves completely,

147
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,930
and the pain will be unbearable.

148
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,840
I can try.

149
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,670
Yong Qi.

150
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,430
Think carefully.

151
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,980
This procedure will be
an extremely painful ordeal.

152
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,710
As long as I can walk normally,

153
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,460
I'm willing to do anything.

154
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,430
Ying Luo.

155
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,430
Have trust in Ye Tian Shi...

156
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,000
and also in Yong Qi.

157
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,670
Are you angry?

158
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,950
Your Majesty.

159
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,270
You shouldn't have agreed to that.

160
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,670
What if Ye Tian Shi fails?

161
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,110
What about Yong Qi?

162
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,750
Yong Qi is my son.

163
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,470
I know him better than anyone.

164
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,630
He'd rather die than
walking with a cane...

165
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,710
for the rest of his life.

166
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,510
Even if he can never stand up again,

167
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,300
it's much better than losing his life.

168
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,600
Yong Qi won't be able to bear the shame.

169
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,790
The calmer his demeanour,

170
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,540
the worse he feels inside.

171
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,430
You must understand him.

172
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,750
But...

173
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,710
Ying Luo.

174
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,670
He has grown up.

175
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,910
Don't arrange everything for him.

176
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,630
Got it?

177
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,190
Your Majesty, there are
signs of rebellion in Hangzhou.

178
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,430
Prince He waiting to meet you.

179
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,230
Your Majesty, just go ahead.

180
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,510
I'll accompany Yong Qi here.

181
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,110
Physician Ye, I'm ready.

182
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,710
Your Highness.

183
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,560
Breaking a bone can
be horrendously painful.

184
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,830
I fear you might not endure it, so...

185
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,190
It's still not too late
to change your mind.

186
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,910
The one who can't endure it
is Consort Ling.

187
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,670
That's why I insisted her to leave.

188
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,190
Physician Ye,

189
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,870
I want you to be honest with me.

190
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,950
What is my chance of being cured
after this procedure?

191
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,430
80%.

192
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,510
To be honest, 40%.

193
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,830
What will happen to me if you fail?

194
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,670
Your Highness, your leg was
injured from an explosion.

195
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,510
We need to break the bone
and let it regrow.

196
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:09,190
Some people may die from fear
when removing the necrotic tissues.

197
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,710
Once the anesthesia wears off,
the pain will be excruciating.

198
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,110
Even if the bone regrows,

199
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,070
there may be other
side effects in the future...

200
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,910
such as joint deformity,
gangrene and bone necrosis.

201
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,510
These are all unpredictable.

202
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,670
If anything happens,

203
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,710
please tell my father...

204
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,880
that I'm extremely sorry...

205
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,230
for letting him down.

206
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,030
There's also something important
that I want you to tell Consort Ling.

207
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,950
Her Highness is just outside waiting.

208
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,790
Consort Ling cares about me...

209
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,190
much more than her own children.

210
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,520
I know that she fears
disappointing my mother.

211
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,790
Please thank her for me.

212
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,670
Tell her that she has done everything...

213
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,630
my mother had asked her.

214
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,790
And she did an excellent job.

215
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,710
I'll remember her kindness forever.

216
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,430
Oh, and tell my fifteenth brother...

217
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,370
that I've made the wooden bow
I've promised him.

218
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,980
I've placed it under his bed.

219
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,400
Your Highness, don't worry.

220
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,080
I will remember to tell him.

221
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,470
Your Highness.

222
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,630
I'm counting on you, Physician Ye.

223
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,510
Right now, the rebels are
hiding in Suzhou and Hangzhou.

224
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,310
I'm sure that a huge
conspiracy is under way.

225
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,870
Last time, the ship
couldn't sail smoothly...

226
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,470
because there were
too many soldiers on board.

227
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:07,800
That's why I reduced the number
of guards and soldiers on this trip.

228
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,160
I think the rebels will use
this opportunity to wreak havoc.

229
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,250
Why don't we steer clear of Hangzhou?

230
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,950
Steer clear?

231
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,430
We can't.

232
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,310
Moreover,

233
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,510
the itinerary has been set.

234
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,380
If we change it now,

235
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,470
what will the people say?

236
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,190
In addition,

237
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,270
we have three shifts
of guards protecting us.

238
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,030
There are other soldiers
standing guard at the riverbank too.

239
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,430
That's more than enough.

240
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,430
Very well.

241
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,140
I should've suppressed my fear.

242
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,190
I heard that Physician Ye
is treating the Fifth Prince.

243
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,190
Aren't you going to check on him?

244
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,390
I have more important things to do.

245
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,990
Your turn.

246
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,350
Hurry! My medicine box!

247
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,830
Hang in there!

248
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,120
Your Highness, this is a saprophage.

249
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,420
It can remove the necrotic
tissues on your leg.

250
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,580
Don't move!

251
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,790
Hang in there!

252
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,430
Yong Qi!

253
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,390
Ye Tian Shi, what are you doing?

254
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,550
This isn't right!

255
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,220
What are those?

256
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,630
What are they?

257
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,420
Your Highness, I don't know!

258
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,960
These are not the
saprophages I usually use!

259
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,600
Zhen Zhu, call for help!

260
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,880
-Yes, Your Highness!
-Hurry!

261
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,720
Guards!

262
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,340
Yong Qi!

263
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,880
-Yong Qi!
-Your Highness!

264
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,550
Your Highness!

265
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,030
Help!

266
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,820
Your Majesty, I shall check the commotion.

267
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,150
I shall go myself.

268
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,300
Guards!

269
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,470
Your Majesty!

270
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,110
Your Majesty, the empress
dowager's chamber is on fire!

271
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,070
Li Yu!

272
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,380
Hurry!

273
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,870
Put out the fire!

274
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,580
Hurry! Go get water!

275
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,550
Hurry up! Hurry!

276
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,310
Water! Hurry!

277
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,590
Go get water now!

278
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,030
We need more people!

279
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,260
Brother, you can't go in!

280
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,940
No, if I don't save my mother,

281
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,750
-then I am worse than a beast!
-Brother!

282
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,100
-Brother!
-Your Majesty!

283
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,310
Save the emperor!

284
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,750
Save the emperor!

285
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,430
Save the emperor!

286
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,070
Your Majesty!

287
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,670
Over here! Hurry!

288
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,190
Hurry!

289
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,350
Put out the fire! Hurry!

290
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,220
Get more water!

291
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,510
Hurry!

292
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,990
The rebels have attacked!

293
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,910
Over there!

294
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,790
Hurry!

295
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,620
Your Majesty, the empress
dowager's chamber is on fire.

296
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,150
The fire is spreading,
and there are rebels attacking.

297
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,310
Please follow Prince He's arrangement
and board the lifeboat...

298
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,020
-Your Majesty!
-I won't go anywhere without the emperor.

299
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,540
Your Majesty, it's dangerous!

300
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,830
Your Majesty!

301
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,490
-Soldiers, follow me!
-Yes, sir!

302
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,470
Hurry, this way!

303
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,830
-This way!
-We need more people!

304
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,150
This fire is too strong.

305
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,870
It's too late.

306
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,700
Save them! It's an order!

307
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,780
Do you hear me?

308
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,030
-I said it's too late!
-Your Majesty.

309
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,510
The emperor.

310
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,700
The emperor is inside!

311
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,300
If the fire continues to spread,

312
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,150
the whole ship will be destroyed.

313
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,680
Go to the adjacent rooms...

314
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,020
and burn all flammable items!

315
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,940
-Yes, Your Highness!
-Stop the fire's spread!

316
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,700
-Yes, Your Highness!
-His Majesty is inside!

317
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,300
-Your Majesty.
-His Majesty is inside!

318
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,100
He's your own brother! Save him!

319
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,190
Your Majesty!

320
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,070
It's too late to regret!

321
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,390
It's too late!

322
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,030
I have to assume command
while the emperor is absent.

323
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,700
Once the fire spreads,

324
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,790
the whole ship will be destroyed.

325
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,960
Your Majesty,
please think of everyone else,

326
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,420
think of the hundreds
of lives on this ship!

327
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,550
Go away!

328
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,750
Your Majesty!

329
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,470
Prince He!

330
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,220
Prince He.

331
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,500
The rebels will be attacking here soon.

332
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,150
The Flower Hall is tightly-guarded.

333
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,750
Take the empress there.

334
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,310
Leave the rebels to me.

335
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,380
Once I subdue them, I'll meet you there.

336
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,630
Yes, Your Highness,
you can count on me!

337
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,710
How dare you rebels commit arson...

338
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,550
and wreak havoc here!

339
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,270
Kill them all!

340
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,350
Leave none alive!

341
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,550
Yes, Your Highness!

342
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,380
Your Highness, I sent some men
to the Fifth Prince's chamber,

343
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,510
but no one is inside!

344
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,460
-No one?
-Yes, Your Highness.

345
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,710
Maybe they've escaped during the chaos.

346
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,510
I shall send soldiers to give chase.

347
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,770
Search the whole ship.

348
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,140
We must catch them.

349
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,350
Yes, Your Highness!

350
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:34,120
Your Highness, the governor of
Hangzhou has sent reinforcements.

351
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,270
So soon?

352
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,430
Your Majesty.

353
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,230
Are you all satisfied now?

354
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,910
Your Majesty,

355
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,890
Prince He is doing this for the sake
of the Twelfth Prince and you.

356
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,630
Please don't blame him.

357
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,230
Your Majesty.

358
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,800
I've subdued the rebels
and extinguished the fire.

359
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,470
Unfortunately, the empress dowager's
chamber has been reduced to ashes.

360
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,940
I've sent men to search for...

361
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,110
the remains of the emperor
and the empress dowager.

362
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,070
Your Majesty!

363
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,630
Your Majesty!

364
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,750
Your Majesty!

365
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,670
Your Majesty!

366
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,870
Your Majesty.

367
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,110
Your Highness.

368
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,270
I couldn't locate
Consort Ling and the Fifth Prince.

369
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,950
But I did find the other
two imperial consorts.

370
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,580
When the chaos started,

371
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,830
they hid under a bed and
inside a cabinet respectively.

372
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,030
They spent the whole night in fear.

373
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,820
Luckily, the rear
chambers weren't attacked,

374
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,920
so they survived.

375
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,590
Your Majesty.

376
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:20,790
I thought my life would
end here on this ship.

377
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,070
If I knew it'd be this dangerous,

378
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,610
I would have stayed in
the Forbidden City...

379
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,630
so I wouldn't be in this sorry state!

380
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,870
Consort Ling and the
Fifth Prince are still missing.

381
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,390
Did something happen to them?

382
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,690
Have you searched the whole ship?

383
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,350
Li Yu has brought some
men with him to search.

384
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,260
Where is he?

385
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,670
Has he gone missing too?

386
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,440
Yes, Your Highness.

387
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,990
Were they abducted by the rebels?

388
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,110
Or maybe...

389
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,540
Maybe they fell into
the water during the fight.

390
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,650
More than half of the rebels have escaped.

391
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,550
It's possible that they have abducted
Consort Ling and the Fifth Prince.

392
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,310
If that's really the case,

393
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,790
I fear the worst has happened.

394
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,630
What should we do then?

395
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

396
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,420
I am Liu Zhen, Governor of Hangzhou.

397
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,230
Your Highness, have the emperor
and the empress dowager...

398
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,690
Last night, the empress dowager's
chamber was set on fire.

399
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,590
His Majesty risked his life...

400
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,630
and ran inside the burning chamber...

401
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,230
to save the empress dowager.

402
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,190
Then, the beams collapsed...

403
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,950
and blocked the exit.

404
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,280
The empress dowager and His Majesty...

405
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,150
It's all my fault.

406
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,870
Had I entered the chamber earlier,

407
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,070
things wouldn't have come to this state.

408
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,750
Your Majesty!

409
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,870
Your Majesty!

410
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,900
I was late to save you!

411
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,030
No!

412
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,670
It's my fault.

413
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,990
I failed as the head of security here.

414
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,090
I deserve to be minced to death...

415
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,590
and die a million times.

416
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,870
I can never atone for my sins!

417
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,590
Prince He.

418
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,190
Now is not the time to be grieving.

419
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,590
Everyone is still waiting for you
to handle the situation.

420
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,020
The local officials are
waiting for His Majesty.

421
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,620
What should we do next?

422
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,710
Your Majesty!

423
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,290
Greetings, Your Majesty and Your Highness!

424
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,710
Oh, you're all here.

425
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,990
Your Majesty.

426
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,350
Your Highness.

427
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,940
When I heard of your supposed demise,

428
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,710
I almost fainted from crying.

429
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,060
Fortunately, the heavens protected you!

430
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,780
Long live the empress dowager.

431
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,830
Thank goodness you are safe and sound!

432
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,150
Your Highness.

433
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,230
Are you alright?

434
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,390
I'm fine.

435
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,190
Your Majesty, are you alright?

436
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,750
Mother, please have a seat.

437
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,220
Brother, I failed to save you.

438
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,030
I almost committed a grave sin.

439
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,230
Brother, please forgive me.

440
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,670
Still, how did you...

441
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:38,600
There are secret
passageways in this ship.

442
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,030
What?

443
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,140
Didn't Fu Heng tell you?

444
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,550
Lord Fu Heng?

445
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,870
Yes.

446
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,910
Fuca Fu Heng.

447
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,210
This ship has an intricate
network of secret passageways.

448
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,590
All passageways are safe and well-hidden.

449
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,270
Fu Heng designed them.

450
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,390
I see.

451
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,140
I still lack experience, it seems.

452
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,860
I'm not as considerate as Lord Fu Heng is.

453
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,960
It was brilliant of him to design
these passageways for emergencies.

454
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,900
Your Majesty, I came late in rescuing you.

455
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,390
I was so frightened.

456
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,910
Fortunately, both you and
the empress dowager are safe.

457
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:24,190
This is a huge blessing for
the people and the empire!

458
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,630
Rise!

459
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,110
Well done.

460
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,470
You arrived here before
my cavalries and guards at the bank.

461
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:38,030
The cavalries safeguard the riverbank.

462
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,710
It's true that their
base camp is quite far,

463
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,350
and they can't see the fire on the ship.

464
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:48,430
But we have other soldiers
surrounding the ship...

465
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,430
on constant guard and observance.

466
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:53,290
Why didn't anyone report anything?

467
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,110
Bring him in!

468
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,710
Kneel!

469
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,870
Mother.

470
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,260
This person is in charge
of communicating...

471
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,470
between the land cavalries
and the ship's soldiers

472
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,790
His shift changes every eight hours,
and he will follow us on his horse.

473
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,390
When the ship was in trouble,

474
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,230
instead of alerting the cavalries,

475
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,110
he ran away.

476
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,220
Mother, do you know why?

477
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,350
How dare you collude with the rebels?

478
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,930
No, I didn't.

479
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,430
Still denying?

480
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,380
If it's not collusion,

481
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,060
then why did you abandon your duty?

482
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,990
He didn't abandon his duty.

483
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,350
He received an order from his superior...

484
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,590
to ignore any fires should
they happen on the ship.

485
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,110
I wonder who is the superior...

486
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,770
who would issue such an order?

487
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,990
Hong Zhou.

488
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,430
You are in charge of the tour's security.

489
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,150
How could this happen?

490
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,350
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

491
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,630
I failed in my duties.

492
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,000
But, I will surely find the culprit...

493
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,290
who bribed the soldiers to revolt here!

494
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,910
Hong Zhou.

495
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,790
Drop the act.

496
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,440
Emperor?

497
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,940
Mother, you are wise.

498
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,180
I'm sure you've figured the culprit out.

499
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,310
Why are you still in denial?

500
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,870
Hong Zhou!

501
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,070
How dare you commit treason!

502
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,830
Brother!

503
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,430
I didn't!

504
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,070
It was the rebels
who wanted to destroy the dynasty!

505
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,790
Why would I dare do this?

506
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,110
I didn't do this.

507
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,430
I didn't!

508
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,910
The rebels who escaped
has been arrested onshore.

509
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,590
Shall we have them testify?

510
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,320
I want to know
the identity of the culprit...

511
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,540
who weakened the security...

512
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,750
and colluded with the rebels.

513
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,270
Of course.

514
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:30,230
Perhaps the rebels...

515
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:34,150
are only assassins who work for you!

516
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,870
Brother.

517
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,150
Did you and Fu Heng set this trap up...

518
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,750
to lure me into admitting?

519
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,270
You abetted the local officials
to send courtesans here...

520
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:52,150
and misled everyone into thinking
that I am searching for beauties.

521
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,469
You set the empress
dowager's chamber on fire.

522
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,070
Even if I didn't die in the fire,

523
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,530
I would have died at
the hands of your rebels.

524
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,230
Everyone would think
that a hedonistic emperor...

525
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,800
deserved to die!

526
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,440
Meanwhile, you would only be blamed
for failing to protect the emperor.

527
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,800
Once you return to the Forbidden City,

528
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,530
you would swear allegiance
to the new emperor...

529
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,710
and become the second Dorgon.

530
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,230
Brother.

531
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,790
You have a vivid imagination.

532
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,230
What new emperor?

533
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,390
My empress.

534
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,230
What do you say?

535
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,350
Your Majesty.

536
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,750
How am I related to Prince He's rebellion?

537
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,110
When chaos broke on the ship,

538
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,710
Prince He sent assassins
to kill Consort Ling and Yong Qi.

539
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,870
No one went to Consort Qing
and Consort Shu's aid.

540
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,830
Only you, my empress,

541
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,460
had a lifeboat prepared,

542
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,990
so you can leave first.

543
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,040
I guess...

544
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,270
the new emperor...

545
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,570
must be the Twelfth Prince.

546
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,150
Your Majesty, when the fire broke out,

547
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,790
I did not leave.

548
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,820
When the rebels attacked,

549
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,390
I did not leave too.

550
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,430
That's because you're still on the ship.

551
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,630
How can you suspect me?

552
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,310
Governor Liu, tell His Majesty.

553
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,990
Who alerted you that...

554
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,270
His Majesty would be in danger
and needs your assistance?

555
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,350
Your Majesty.

556
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,940
It was the empress
who alerted me in advance.

557
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,150
That's why I rushed here.

558
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,190
Your Majesty, you are not
on good terms with Prince He.

559
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,900
Prince He tried to garner my support,

560
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,590
but I refused.

561
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,310
I wanted to tell you in advance,

562
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,740
but you trust him so much.

563
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,550
I didn't want to alarm him,

564
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,310
and I was worried that
the cavalries may have been bribed.

565
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:01,110
That's why I alerted Hangzhou,
which was the closest city.

566
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,630
Your Majesty, you may suspect
anyone else in the world,

567
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,830
but you should not suspect me.

568
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,070
Is that so?

569
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,510
Of course.

570
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,310
Your Majesty!

571
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,590
I shall not protect the empress anymore.

572
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,950
Your Majesty.

573
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:27,630
The empress and Prince He
are having an affair!

574
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:32,660
They have already planned
to kill you and the empress dowager...

575
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,340
on the way back to the palace,

576
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,030
then instate the Twelfth Prince
as the new emperor!

577
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,830
What a horrendous act of treason!

578
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,750
Yuan Chun Wang,
what are you talking about?

579
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,140
In order to gain my support,

580
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,700
she even betrothed
her own maid, Zhen, to me!

581
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,670
Your Majesty,

582
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,180
though this is a marriage by name,

583
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,070
it's actually to monitor me day and night,

584
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,180
so I won't betray her!

585
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,180
Your Majesty, it's not true!

586
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,100
It's not true!

587
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,500
Yuan Chun Wang is lying!

588
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,020
He plotted the whole conspiracy!

589
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,950
Your Majesty!

590
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,140
I have evidence to prove...

591
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,710
that the empress and Prince He
are having an affair!

592
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,990
If you don't believe me,
you can search on Prince He.

593
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,630
Search him!

594
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,830
De Sheng.

595
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,470
I've seen you...

596
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,150
wear this jade pendant before.

597
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,960
What will you say now?

598
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,110
You betrayed me!

599
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,750
Her Majesty...

600
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,830
needs some motivation from you.

601
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,070
Me?

602
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:13,250
Give me an item from
the empress's jewelry box.

603
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,590
Your Majesty.

604
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,990
I didn't.

605
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,800
It was Yuan Chun Wang who told me
that it was all for your own good...

606
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,360
and for the Twelfth Prince!

607
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,550
Your Majesty.

608
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,630
I stole the jade pendant.

609
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,860
Her Majesty knew nothing.

610
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,790
She knew nothing!

611
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,030
If she really wanted to rebel,

612
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,220
why would she request for help?

613
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,430
To provide herself a way out, of course.

614
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,840
If the revolt fails, then everything...

615
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,140
can be blamed on Prince He alone.

616
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,440
Shut up!

617
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:04,150
I'm just pointing out the truth!

618
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,870
Your Majesty.

619
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,720
What a brilliant scheme.

620
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,030
Hong Li.

621
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:16,150
It's true that I am
enamored with the empress.

622
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,230
But she has nothing to do with this.

623
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,470
She almost lost her own life
in order to save yours.

624
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,510
You should not suspect her.

625
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,470
Your Majesty.

626
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,910
You and I have been together for decades.

627
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,590
Even if everyone in the world
wants to harm you,

628
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,430
I would never.

629
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:48,790
The jade pendant was stolen by Zhen.

630
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:53,630
And the revolt was planned by
Prince He and Yuan Chun Wang.

631
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:58,100
I'm sure you are absolutely innocent
and ignorant, Your Majesty!

632
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,910
Your Majesty!

633
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,670
You know what kind of person I am!

634
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,830
Without the empress's permission,

635
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,260
even if I were to die,

636
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,990
I would never do such a thing!

637
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,790
Consort Ling, this way.

638
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,630
You are still alive?

639
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,940
Your Majesty.

640
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:58,020
His Majesty ordered me to guard
Consort Ling and the Fifth Prince,

641
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,150
of course they are safe and sound.

642
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,200
Empress.

643
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,710
What are you laughing about?

644
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,280
Aisin-Gioro Hong Li.

645
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,020
I regarded you as my beloved husband.

646
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,360
I love you, respected you
and devoted my entire life to you.

647
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,790
Prince He did commit treason.

648
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:25,630
But even if he can
make Yong Ji the emperor,

649
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,150
I have never thought of betraying you!

650
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,510
So, why didn't I tell you
about Prince He's scheme?

651
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,380
Because I wanted you to know that
even if the entire world leaves you,

652
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,040
I would still stand by
your side and protect you.

653
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,760
That's why I'd rather trample
on Hong Zhou's feelings...

654
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,950
to win your heart.

655
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,270
But, what about you?

656
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,630
What have you done?

657
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,590
-My empress.
-Yes.

658
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,910
I coveted power and
the position of empress.

659
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,350
I am ridden with sins.

660
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,900
I've betrayed the whole world,

661
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,750
but I've never betrayed you.

662
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,670
Hong Li.

663
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,670
You can resent me, blame me and hate me.

664
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,430
But you cannot humiliate
me or suspect me, no!

665
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,130
We will discuss this another time.

666
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,990
Go back to your chamber and rest now.

667
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,870
I will only ask you this.

668
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,190
When chaos broke out on the ship,

669
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,030
did you think of me just a little?

670
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,070
Did you?
