[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 49]

3
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,870
I was born into a poor family.

4
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,130
I had very little education.

5
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,240
I never expected much from my life.

6
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,820
My only wish is to be by your side.

7
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,450
I want to share your worries and thoughts.

8
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,800
When I address as my young master,

9
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,290
your gentle smiles...

10
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,730
is the best thing in
the world I can ask for.

11
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,230
I knew you wouldn't let me go so easily.

12
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,170
But I insisted to stay here.

13
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,780
Please do not see my
action as selfishness.

14
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,040
Every piece of bookmark I got...

15
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,970
were made by your hands
using dried leaves.

16
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,480
You were worried that reading at night
would damage my eye sight,

17
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,590
you changed the oil of my lamp
with wolfberry oil.

18
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,920
You even placed a pot of
acorus gramineus to absorb smoke.

19
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,310
You always washed
repeatedly each garment...

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,890
you made for me before I wore it.

21
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,810
You wanted to make the clothings
softer and more comfortable.

22
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,860
This very study...

23
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,380
has been well tended all thanks to you.

24
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,480
Qing Lian.

25
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,980
You have done so much for me,

26
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,890
more than the duty of a servant.

27
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,920
I know it all.

28
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,250
I'm always grateful to you.

29
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,450
Young Master,

30
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,660
I am not as capable as you think.

31
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,420
I...

32
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,000
I hate Young Mistress so much.

33
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,420
I had been seeking an opportunity...

34
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,000
to meet you.

35
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,010
But now that I've met you,

36
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,440
I regret it so much.

37
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,130
I shouldn't have let you see me...

38
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,860
in such a sorry state!

39
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,240
Qing Lian.

40
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,810
I was too late.

41
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,900
Young Master,

42
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,290
in another lifetime,

43
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,280
will youâ€¦

44
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,770
Just as I expected,

46
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,930
you are too honest...

47
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,200
to tell me...

48
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,470
even a white lie.

49
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,320
But Young Master,

50
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,450
stop being so obsessive with that woman.

51
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,840
Move on from the past memory.

52
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,810
It's impossible.

53
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,860
It's never going to come true.

54
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,720
Young Master,

55
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,170
I wish...

56
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
you to live more happily.

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,159
Qing Lian,

58
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,580
thank you.

59
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,490
Fu Heng, you're back.

60
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,840
[Dissolution Letter]

61
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,330
Are you insane?

62
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,140
You want to disown me?

63
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,080
You sold Qing Lian to illegal brothel,

64
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,910
she was so desperate
she took her own life!

65
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,030
And you pretend like nothing's happened?

66
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,780
You are disowning your own wife over...

67
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,300
a dead servant?

68
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,960
Of the seven clauses to disowning,

69
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,390
you've offended three,

70
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,800
namely lewdness, jealousy and wordiness.

71
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,860
This is beyond my tolerance!
Pack your belongings now.

72
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,240
I want you out of Fuca's manor.

73
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,870
This marriage was arranged by His Majesty!

74
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,520
I will explain everything to His Majesty.

75
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,460
Once I am married into this family,
I will never leave.

76
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,830
Disown me if you want,

77
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,320
but not unless I'm dead!

78
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,950
Does life mean nothing to you?

79
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,000
Even a servant has the right to live!

80
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,750
Won't you conscience be haunted
by the sins you committed?

81
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,890
What are you laughing at?

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,900
My conscience would be haunted?

83
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,080
Back in the Forbidden City,

84
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,210
it's common for the masters to
have their servants killed over nothing.

85
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,580
They weren't afraid, why should I be?

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,150
Not to mention,

87
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,570
Qing Lian intended to kill Little Master.

88
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,250
If I hadn't pled for her to be spared,

89
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,210
your mother would have
killed her even sooner.

90
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,860
Qing Lian would never
pushed An into the water.

91
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,800
She was forced to leave here.

92
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,260
I had thought it would be good for her.

93
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,850
But I never thought you could
be so vile and insane!

94
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,710
She was born a servant.

95
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,980
That illegal brothel was
a perfect place for her.

96
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,970
She died a quick death.

97
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,850
She should be grateful for that!

98
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,040
Enough.

99
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,220
Pack your things and leave.

100
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,230
I won't go.

101
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,330
You have just become one
of the Grand Council.

102
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,930
Your position is unsecured.

103
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,790
Yet you are in such a hurry
to disown your wife...

104
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,130
over a mere dead servant.

105
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,500
If word gets out,

106
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,810
you will be seen as the incompetent fool
who couldn't manage his own family matter.

107
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,100
When that happened,

108
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,850
let's see just how long you can stay
on your rank as the Military Executive.

109
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,850
I order you...

110
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,289
to leave Fuca's manor immediately!

111
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,679
I've told you many times!

112
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,659
Even if I died,

113
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:46,200
I will still be your wife!

114
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,230
You are a woman.

115
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,680
I won't resort to violence.

116
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,380
Since you're not willing to leave,

117
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,180
I have to ask others to escort you out.

118
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,430
Come in!

119
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,970
Young Mistress, excuse me.

120
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,770
She's no longer Young Mistress.

121
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,230
-Get her out!
-Are you crazy?

122
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,230
Let go of me!

123
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,620
Fuca Fu Heng! I will not leave you.

124
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,480
-I will not leave you!
-Er Qing!

125
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,650
-Mother.
-Er Qing.

126
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,120
-Er Qing.
-Help me.

127
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,480
Fu Heng.

128
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,880
Fu Heng wanted to disown me
over Qing Lian's death!

129
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,050
Mother,

130
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,250
she acts like she has a kind heart.

131
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,810
but Qing Lian died because of her!

132
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,640
Qing Lian was only a servant..

133
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,480
You want to disown your wife
because of a mere servant?

134
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,030
That woman next to you...

135
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,090
was engulfed in hate because
of her jealousy.

136
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,360
She spread rumours to bring us trouble.

137
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,950
She's not worthy to be
the daughter-in-law of the Fuca family!

138
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,920
If I allow her to remain here,

139
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,490
she will be a tumour
growing in our family!

140
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,590
Listen to him.

141
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,490
Listen what he's said.

142
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,630
-Listen to him.
-Fu Heng,

143
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,730
Are you really going
to disown your wife...

144
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,840
just right after you got promoted into
the Grand Council?

145
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,600
Do you not care about your own career?

146
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,090
I am unworthy of the rank unless
I set thing right in my family.

147
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,230
Chase her out!

148
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,830
No. Mother!

149
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,280
-Er Qing.
-Help me, Mother.

150
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,390
Escort my mother back to her room.

151
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,900
Fu Heng!

152
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,510
How can you be so cruel?

153
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,790
I don't want to go!

154
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,160
I don't wantâ€¦

155
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,630
An! All of you, let go of me!

156
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,550
An!

157
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,810
Fu Heng, He needs my care.

158
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,370
You can't chase me out.

159
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,150
You can't chase me out.

160
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,950
With a vile mother like to raise him,

161
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,610
he will grow up to become a villain
just like yourself.

162
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,910
Take Little Master away!

163
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,520
No! I won't let you take him from me!

164
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,200
He's my son. He's my son!

165
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,940
Fu Heng, this has gone too far!

166
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,950
How can you be so cruel to your own wife?

167
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,890
You pity this woman
shedding bitter tears.

168
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,490
But have you seen...

169
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,200
her smug, ugly face...

170
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,480
when she took an innocent life?

171
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,630
Have you ever thought...

172
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,770
how sad Qing Lian's parents will be?

173
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,820
She was their beloved, too.

174
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,560
You spent many years reading
the works of saints.

175
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,150
Have you learnt nothing but to turn
a blind eye to evils and deception?

176
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,460
Qing Lian, it's all about Qing Lian!

177
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,970
Fuca Fu Heng, listen closely.

178
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,330
Even if I died,

179
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,360
I would die in Fuca's mansion.

180
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,090
You can never get rid of me,

181
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,960
not a chance.

182
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,580
Young Mistress!

183
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,800
Young Mistress!

184
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,770
Fu Heng, severing ties for
the greater good is respectable,

185
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,280
but are you going to let your wife die
because of a mere servant?

186
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,590
-Young Mistress.
-If she dies here,

187
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,550
-Young Mistress.
-Hitara Clan would want revenge,

188
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,510
the reputation of Fuca clan
will be tarnished.

189
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,090
Er Qing.

190
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,690
Er Qing, don't worry.

191
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,440
I won't let Fu Heng disown you!

192
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,520
Mother.

193
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,880
I won't go.

194
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,200
I know.

195
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,880
Fu Heng, you disappoint me too much.

196
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,870
Er Qing is your rightful wife,
she was married into our family to you!

197
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,320
Even if she has made numerous mistakes,

198
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,270
you have to forgive her!

199
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,630
Brother Fu Heng.

200
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,730
just listen to our mother.

201
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,050
Fine, I won't disown her.

202
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,300
Really?

203
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,730
From now on,

204
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,190
she must live in the Buddhist temple,

205
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,730
she will follow the way of a nun
for the rest of her life...

206
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,350
as to repent for her sins.

207
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,520
Old Mistress.

208
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,840
Fu Heng.

209
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,760
Consort Ling, what took you so long?

210
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,370
His Majesty has been waiting for you
and he was about to get angry...

211
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,990
after such a long wait.

212
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,140
Did something upsetting happen
at the morning court?

213
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,150
Well...

214
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,830
Your Majesty, Consort Ling is here.

215
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,040
What are you doing here?

216
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,150
I didn't ask you to bring her here.

217
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,760
-It's time for a meal?
-Back to Yanxi Palace if you are hungry.

218
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,110
Serve the meal.

219
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,690
Yes.

220
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,810
What are you doing?

221
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,530
Your Majesty is always eating alone.

222
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,240
That must be boring.

223
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,510
I can accompany you.

224
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,580
This is inadequate.

225
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,050
Your Majesty often spends
an hour to finish the meal.

226
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,310
I'm supposed to stand serving.

227
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,670
That's too tiring.

228
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,770
It is a great honour to be allowed
stand serving, is that clear?

229
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,570
Even Her Majesty was serving me,

230
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,170
she should stand serving.

231
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,600
You Majesty can let whoever likes
that honour to serve you instead.

232
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,020
If Your Majesty wants me around,

233
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,970
I must sit.

234
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,010
You're the most unruly one.

235
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,080
Sit. Sit. Sit down.

236
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,570
If I don't let you sit,
you'll find another way to torment me.

237
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,040
Your Majesty,

238
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,490
this dish is delicious.

239
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,020
Try it, Your Majesty.

240
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,250
Consort Ling,
you mustn't do that.

241
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,670
Well,

242
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,790
at meal time, you cannot urge a tasting.

243
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,420
This is a rule passed down
from our ancestors.

244
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,530
Very well, I'll eat it myself.

245
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,230
One should not speak
while eating and sleeping.

246
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,390
Is it really so delicious?

247
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,079
Consort Ling,

248
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,500
His Majesty is asking you a question.

249
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:17,579
One should not speak while
eating and sleeping, Your Majesty.

250
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,960
Consort Ling,

251
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,310
but if His Majesty asks,
you still have to answer.

252
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,119
It's delicious, Your Majesty.

253
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,020
These cuisines are better
than what I get inside my palace.

254
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,270
-Your Majesty?
-Shut up.

255
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,110
Why?

256
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,200
I know.

257
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,950
You are about to ask me for the chef.

258
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,650
Your Majesty,

259
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,400
I am not that greedy.

260
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,060
Last month,

261
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,010
you took my writing-brush washer.

262
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,520
The day before yesterday,
you took my pocket watch.

263
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,850
Yesterday you took away the jade bowl
you found attractive.

264
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,810
Of the entire Forbidden City,
you are the most greedy one.

265
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,850
The Forbidden City?

266
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,520
No.

267
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,860
All people in the entire country
are your servants.

268
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,290
Why does a servant need to be aspiring?

269
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,510
I don't know how others see it,

270
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,680
but since the day
you entered the palace...

271
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,430
Yes.

272
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,130
Since the day you entered the palace,

273
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,590
you never stopped
claiming to be my servant.

274
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,950
Yet you have never bow down to me.

275
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,190
This is really a discomfort to me.

276
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,450
Your Majesty will get used to it one day.

277
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,810
Only people get used to
my way of doing things.

278
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,200
But no one asks me to get used to them.

279
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,570
You are too ruthless.

280
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,880
Just now,

281
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,660
did something upset Your Majesty.

282
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,860
Consorts and concubines cannot
intervene with the state affairs.

283
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,240
Fine, ignore my question.

284
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,810
I've eaten enough of this dish.

285
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,950
-You may leave now.
-Yes.

286
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,990
That was very demeaning of you.

287
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,250
You clearly know I am upset,
but you won't try to console me?

288
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,530
But Your Majesty just said it,

289
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,400
consorts and concubines
can't get involved in state affairs.

290
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,900
Why is it always wrong for me
to ask and not to ask?

291
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,690
Life is too hard.

292
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,680
The two chiefs of
Huolan Tribe are rebelling.

293
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,720
Afan was sent to appeal for surrender
but was killed.

294
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
The whole Lu Camp was wiped out.

295
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,210
General Zhao Hui is
stranded at Heishui Camp.

296
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,080
I asked for volunteer to save him.

297
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,800
Every officers in the imperial court...

298
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,920
kept silent,

299
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,250
except one person.

300
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,300
Master Fu Heng?

301
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,070
You speak so bluntly,

302
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,660
don't you have the slightest discretion?

303
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,840
Since I have nothing to hide,

304
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,370
why is discretion needed?

305
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,900
Fu Heng...

306
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,430
is heroic on the battlefield.

307
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,850
But he is reckless.

308
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,460
During the battle of Jinchuan,

309
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,630
I sent several decrees to him,

310
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,680
but even those have fail to
summon him back from the battlefield.

311
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,660
I am worried...

312
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,610
Generals always risk death.

313
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,490
To Master Fu Heng,

314
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,200
serving the country...

315
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,560
at the expense of life...

316
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
is the best reward for himself..

317
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,050
But with that said, what if
the late Empress blames you for...

318
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,120
encouraging Fu Heng to
risk his life on the battlefield?

319
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,560
I believe that...

320
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,920
Her Majesty is the person...

321
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,060
who knew Master Fu Heng the best.

322
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,330
Your Majesty's protection for him...

323
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,510
is just another form of
scorn and a shackle.

324
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,320
What Master Fu Heng wanted...

325
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,230
is to defend our country against invasion,

326
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,080
instead of staying safe at home.

327
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,970
In the battle against Huolan Tribe,

328
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,700
General Yarhashan was dismissed,

329
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,870
Commander Shun De Na and Ma De Sheng
were beheaded on spot,

330
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,230
and even General Zhao Hui
who showed prowess in battles...

331
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,440
is stranded at Heishui Camp.

332
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,790
You must be very careful this time.

333
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,000
Don't worry. I got it.

334
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,620
How can I not worry?

335
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
His Majesty rejected your request.

336
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,200
What changed his mind over the night?

337
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,340
With so many women in the world,

338
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,210
you fell in love with the wrong one.

339
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,670
I am sure if you should
count yourself lucky.

340
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,000
The person I adore is also my soulmate.

341
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,120
Of course I'm lucky.

342
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,410
soulmate?

343
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,860
Did Consort Ling
propose to His Majesty to...

344
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,270
But could it be?

345
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,500
She was bold enough to intervene
with state affair?

346
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,100
I think you got it all wrong.

347
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,600
Why are you smiling?

348
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,040
I'm so happy she came
to say goodbye to me.

349
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,400
Fu Heng, have you gone mad?

350
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,430
She didn't come to see you.

351
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,540
You just ran into her by coincidence.

352
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,370
She said nothing to you.

353
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,810
Sometimes,

354
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,400
you don't have to say it out loud.

355
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
But the intention was clear enough.

356
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,550
Let's go.

357
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,940
What do you mean?

358
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,230
Consort Ling said that...

359
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,640
you were wasting your talent
at Old Summer Palace.

360
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,310
If you're willing,

361
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,720
you can pick whichever post
at the Imperial Household Department.

362
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,010
That's all she said?

363
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,890
You're Consort Ling's sworn brother.

364
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,340
You have a choice of
returning to the Forbidden City...

365
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,470
or going to an external precinct.

366
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,560
I envy your fortune.

367
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,880
You were visionary.

368
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,980
You actually became
Consort Ling's sworn brother.

369
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,180
With her support,

370
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,840
you will get a promising career.

371
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,620
Come here.

372
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,650
Was that all she said?

373
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,390
Yes.

374
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,770
Try to recall the details.

375
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,440
There was also a pair of shoes.

376
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,670
Consort Ling...

377
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,470
made them herself.

378
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,640
She said she wanted to give them
to you back at Old Summer Palace.

379
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,960
but she didn't make it in time.

380
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,490
I forgot it just now.

381
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,610
Listen.

382
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,160
I know your intention.

383
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:16,780
You were afraid I would replace you
after I got promoted, am I right?

384
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,150
Don't you dare try to be smart
in front of me again.

385
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:22,860
Get lost.

386
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,540
Get lost!

387
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,680
Yes. Yes. Calm down.

388
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,010
I'll get lost now, I'll leave.

389
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,000
Why did you suggest for
Master Fu Heng to join the battle?

390
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,240
He did me a favour.

391
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,720
So I returned the favour.

392
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,440
Now we are even.

393
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,610
The floral arrangements
late Empress made...

394
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,790
were very mesmerizing.

395
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,490
But look at mine,

396
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,130
they are awful.

397
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,850
This is why His Majesty
said you're vulgar.

398
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,760
Calligraphy, painting and chess,

399
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,020
they can be mastered by practice.

400
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,050
But one's vision and capacity
take years of cultivation.

401
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,160
Her Majesty was born in a noble family.

402
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,500
But I grew up in a poor family,

403
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,260
I am no match for her of course.

404
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,790
Why do you still keep practising?

405
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,360
If a day won't do, then make it a year.

406
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,710
If a year won't do,
then make it ten years.

407
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,980
If I am not gifted with the talent,
then more practices will make perfect.

408
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,090
I can ignore calligraphy,
painting and chess,

409
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,540
but I must know something,
so I can talk to His Majesty.

410
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,890
Your Highness, it is done.

411
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,950
His Majesty also sent you
a set of horseback outfits.

412
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,850
His Majesty will teach you
horse riding tomorrow.

413
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,170
Horse riding?

414
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,530
Yes.

415
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,320
His Majesty will take Your Highness
along for the Mulan Hunt.

416
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,120
So His Majesty needs you to know
how to ride a horse.

417
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,260
Who said I want to go hunting?

418
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,070
Let him take back his words.

419
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,860
Your Highness, I wouldn't dare
to tell His Majesty that.

420
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,520
Your Highness, His Majesty will
coach you personally.

421
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,030
It is a great honour!

422
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,330
Horse riding?

423
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,690
Horse riding?

424
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,200
His Majesty is right.

425
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,420
It is fun to learn horse riding.

426
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:05,810
Xiao Quan Zi,

427
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,250
spread the word of His Majesty
coaching me personally.

428
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,050
The Noble Consort had
the finest ginseng picked,

429
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,220
it's specially for the Fifth Prince.

430
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,930
I appreciate Her Highness's gift.

431
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,610
But the Fifth Prince
is having a bad cough.

432
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,080
Imperial physicians have been
treating him with fritillary bulbs.

433
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,510
I fear we won't need a tonic like ginseng
for his medication.

434
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,940
I'm afraid I'll have to return it.

435
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,670
Ginseng is not applicable
for common cough.

436
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,490
But I have inquired
the imperial physicians.

437
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,980
The Fifth Prince has bad cough
due to his lung deficiency.

438
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,360
This ginseng will help cope
with the deficiency.

439
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,960
The storage has over a tonne of ginseng.

440
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,770
I hand-picked the
finest for the Fifth Prince.

441
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,620
You have nothing to be worried.

442
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,090
I thank Your Highness on his behalf.

443
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,600
It's my pleasure. Rise.

444
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,690
Consort Yu, have you heard...

445
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,460
that His Majesty will take Consort Ling
on horse riding tomorrow?

446
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,820
Let's not talk about that.

447
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,360
I am tired.

448
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,290
I need to rest early.

449
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,380
Don't disappoint me.

450
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,600
Stay steady even while you are riding.

451
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,880
Slower. Slower!

452
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,480
Grab your reins tightly!

453
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,790
Your Majesty.

454
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,670
Be more relaxed.

455
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,390
You're not a wooden doll.

456
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,840
Relax.

457
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,550
Liyu, start running

458
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,880
-Li Yu.
-Don't worry, Your Highness!

459
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,270
Why are you running?

460
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,640
-It's fine.
-Slower.

461
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,070
Slower.

462
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,770
Have the horse walk slowly. Yes.
Keep it going.

463
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,760
This horse is no good.

464
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,500
It doesn't listen to me.

465
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,410
This is my favourite Ferghana horse.

466
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,500
The others can't even touch it,
so stop complaining.

467
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,890
You should blame yourself
for being so clumsy.

468
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,800
Your Majesty, slower.

469
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,220
What's wrong?

470
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,840
Nothing.

471
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,770
I've never seen His Majesty
show so much affection towards a consort.

472
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:15,290
There's no love without cause.

473
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,050
In order to earn His Majesty's favour,

474
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,320
Her Highness has made great efforts.

475
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,340
You look so proud of yourself
when we talked about Consort Ling.

476
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,610
Can you ride by yourself now?

477
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,250
I can. I can do it.

478
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,390
This horse is too big.

479
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,220
-Li Yu.
-Yes.

480
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,410
Go and fetch me the more tamed horse
I ordered you to prepare.

481
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,510
-Bring it here.
-Yes.

482
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,160
You must be careful on your own.

483
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,840
I'll leave you be.

484
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,050
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

485
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,270
Come.

486
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,950
Be careful.

487
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,940
Relax your hands.

488
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,889
Yeah, yes.

489
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,150
Master, urgent military report.

490
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,969
Clamp onto the horse's belly!

491
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:29,170
Your Majesty, a military report comes.

492
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,620
What does it say?

493
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,639
Horton flooded our camp, but our men
dug trenches to drain the water.

494
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,000
They have defended for ten days...

495
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,790
until Master Fu Heng led reinforcements
to Heishui Camp.

496
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,530
He and General Zhao Hui
launched a pincer attack.

497
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,520
They killed around 5,000 enemies.

498
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,199
General Zhao Hui fell off the horse...

499
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,920
and hurt his leg slightly...

500
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,000
after his horse was stuck in mud.

501
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,830
Master Fu Heng is pursuing Horton.

502
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,160
But as of now,

503
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,700
there's been no update from him.

504
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,240
I had warned him.

505
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:11,360
Horton is crafty and good
at luring the enemy into a trap.

506
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,170
He must not act too rashly.

507
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,290
Your Majesty, don't worry.

508
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,220
Master Fu Heng will know what to do.

509
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,820
Consort Ling!

510
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,360
Ying Luo.

511
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,410
-Your Majesty, no.
-Your Majesty.

512
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,110
-Your Majesty!
-Consort Ling!

513
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,520
-Your Majesty!
-Consort Ling!

514
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,990
Ying Luo!

515
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,690
Imperial physician! Bring him here!

516
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,950
Hurry up! Summon an imperial physician!

517
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,590
Your Majesty, Consort Ling
has a fracture on her right arm.

518
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,370
The injury is rather severe.

519
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,770
I have applied warm
poultice on her arm...

520
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,660
It will help ease her pain
for the time being.

521
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,460
Why don't you fix her injured arm first?

522
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,320
If I do so now,

523
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,400
the pain will be unbearable.

524
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,870
I can only set her bone after the medicine
takes effect and eased her pain.

525
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,480
Don't forget, as soon as the poultice
has gone cold,

526
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,370
you need to replace it with a new one.

527
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,570
Do not let her out of your sight.

528
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,850
I will remain here,

529
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,440
I'll change the medicine
as soon as it cools.

530
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,030
Later, I'll fix her injured arm.

531
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,040
I am afraid the pain will be so intense
that she won't be able to sleep.

532
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,980
You must take good care of her.

533
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,870
Don't let her touch the injury.

534
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:47,960
Yes.

535
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,490
Your Majesty, the second
military report comes.

536
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,840
Ming Yu,

537
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,320
take good care of your master.

538
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,780
Yes.

539
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,810
Your Majesty.

540
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:19,650
Your Majesty, I checked
the horse just now.

541
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,290
Get to the serious matter first.

542
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,740
Yes.

543
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,680
Your Majesty,

544
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,720
Master Fu Heng annihilated
the fleeing enemy bravely.

545
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,660
Horton escaped with
about a dozen riders.

546
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,400
Master Fu Heng and General Zhao Hui...

547
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,800
are currently consolidating
the troops for the next battle.

548
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,200
I got it.

549
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,250
Your Majesty,

550
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,090
I checked the horse's manger,

551
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,070
the food has been tempered with.

552
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,900
It caused the usually
tamed horse to go amok.

553
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,970
That's why it shook
Consort Ling off its back.

554
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,690
If Your Majesty hadn't made it in time,

555
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,120
Consort Ling would have fell on her head.

556
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,520
I am afraid she could have died.

557
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,600
I want all members of...

558
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,100
the Imperial Horsemasters,

559
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,800
including supervisors and supernumeraries,

560
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,970
to be detained for interrogation.

561
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,800
Yes.

562
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,890
Your Majesty, there's been
a drought in East of Zhejiang.

563
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,180
the military executives are having
a meeting in the West Hearth Room.

564
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,420
But as for Consort Ling.

565
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,660
Issue my instructions.

566
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,120
Order Physician Zhang and
Physician Ye to must take turn...

567
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,770
to watch over Yanxi Palace.

568
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,640
They are to inform me
if Consort Ling wakes up.

569
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,740
Yes.

570
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,700
Prince He,

571
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,990
any solution for the drought
in Eastern Zhejiang?

572
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,580
Your Majesty,

573
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,640
there harvest has been poor and
the people has no food source.

574
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,020
I'm afraid we won't be able to collect...

575
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,730
all the taxes this year.

576
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,770
I propose tax exemption
to as good will from the Imperial Court.

577
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,020
I surveyed the drought a few days ago.

578
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,800
The drought has affected countless homes.

579
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,000
We would need 200,000 taels of silver
as disaster relief.

580
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,230
Tax exemption and subsidy
are commonly used measures.

581
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,130
Subsidy is one step.

582
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,870
To appease the people,

583
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,440
I will be on the Black Dragon Pool to
pray for rain on the ninth of this month.

584
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,450
I will order the Minister of Justice
to summary lawsuit...

585
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,410
and reduce sentences of flogging or less.

586
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,340
Your Majesty, Zhili Governor Fang Guan
has a report.

587
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,850
Locust has been reported in 43 provinces
including Dongguang and Wuqing.

588
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,890
Your Majesty.

589
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,050
Continue.

590
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,040
Locust swarm has been spotted in...

591
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,610
Jinan of the Shandong province.

592
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,730
The locust plague this year
may spread even further,

593
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,590
causing even greater damage.

594
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,360
Your Majesty,

595
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,650
Yunnan Governor Shuo Se
sent a secret report.

596
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,960
It says someone was spreading
poem inciting rebellion...

597
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,320
written by Sun Jia Gan,
the lead master of Imperial Academy.

598
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,040
The poem slanders Your Majesty
with extreme perversion.

599
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,890
Sun Jia Gan...

600
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,720
is a loyal officer who speaks frankly.

601
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,480
Do not put too much
trust into such rumours.

602
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,840
Order the Commander of Infantry
to investigate it secretly.

603
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,680
Be sure to get to the bottom of it.

604
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,390
As for the locust plagueâ€¦

605
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,970
As for the locust plague,

606
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,020
I worry it occurs not just
in Zhili and Shangdong.

607
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,740
Order every governor and
to supervise closely.

608
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,180
They are to report immediately as soon
as the locust swarm is spotted.

609
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,270
Anyone who fail to report,
or to stop locusts,

610
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,680
as to let the locusts grow wings
and damage more crops.

611
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,590
will be removed from their posts.

612
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,570
Your Majesty.

613
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,980
You may leave now.

614
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,690
It's my fault.

615
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,330
I shouldn't have...

616
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,360
asked you to ride horse.

617
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,920
Earlier...

618
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,950
But you are fine now.

619
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,940
I'll keep you company, all right?

620
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,070
No.

621
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,310
You really don't need my company?

622
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,340
Your Majesty.

623
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,180
It hurts, right?

624
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,690
Someone wants to kill me.

625
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,380
Don't be paranoid.

626
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,930
This was only an accident.

627
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,240
Someone wants me dead.

628
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,380
Ying Luo, don't jinx yourself.

629
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:43,570
Your Majesty,

630
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,600
if you hadn't caught me in time,

631
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,880
my neck would have been broken.

632
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,470
It was my fault.

633
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,200
I am to be blamed.

634
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,960
You are hurt because of me.

635
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,480
If one day,

636
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,780
we catch the murderer,

637
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:12,110
will Your Majesty bring them to justice?

638
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,140
I will.

639
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,520
I will not hesitate.

640
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,230
Your Majesty!

641
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,930
Your injury is so severe!

642
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,640
Why didn't you summon
an imperial physician?

643
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,060
Consort Ling has too many enemies.

644
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,440
I didn't want to draw attention.

645
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,800
And I got busy and forgot the wound.

646
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,620
All right, enough talking.

647
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,440
Just patch me up.

648
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:11,220
Your Majesty, the imperial physician
should have a look at this.

649
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,710
Go and get something to stop the bleeding.

650
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,630
Yes.
