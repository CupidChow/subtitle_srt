1
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,280
Chen Mingxia offered a Western gun as tribute before.

2
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,280
But it can’t compare to the guns

3
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,880
you confiscated from the battlefield.

4
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,800
The guns you gathered can hit further

5
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
and more accurately.

6
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,780
I've instructed the Imperial Armory and the Imperial Workshop to imitate them.

7
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,040
Your Majesty,

8
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,079
Zhang Tingyu has died of illness.

9
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:22,200
His son is earnestly asking permission to bring his body back to his hometown.

10
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,960
In his last years,

11
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,840
he was muddled

12
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,320
and did a lot of wrong things.

13
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,240
But he, after all, contributed greatly to our Great Qing.

14
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Spread my decree.

15
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,320
Follow the decree of the late Emperor and allow him to enjoy a spot in the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

16
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,050
Your Majesty, I thank you on behalf of Lord Zhang.

17
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,040
Rise.

18
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,320
I know that

19
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,130
since my fourteenth year in reign,

20
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,440
I'd been demoting and reprimanding him a lot.

21
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,640
You’ve all been discussing this behind my back too,

22
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,100
saying that I'm too heartless, haven’t you?

23
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,200
But whenever

24
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,840
I think about the hardships of Liu Tongxun,

25
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,100
I got more irritated about

26
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,800
how muddled Zhang Tingyu was.

27
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,160
Both were the pillars of the Great Qing.

28
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
One broke down from constant overwork

29
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,440
to the point of vomiting blood,

30
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,640
while the other

31
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,380
only cared about glory in his afterlife.

32
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,520
I understand.

33
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,440
He and I

34
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,440
had fought for so many years.

35
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
Now that he's suddenly gone,

36
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,000
I feel lonely

37
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,160
and ashamed.

38
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,880
Your Majesty,

39
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,180
being able to share an ancestral temple spot

40
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,480
is the best honor that a subject can get.

41
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,280
Lord Zhang's soul in heaven

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,360
will surely feel very grateful for it.

43
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,620
He surely will curse me

44
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,880
for I’ve frightened him before.

45
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,360
I heard that

46
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,140
you went to the Summer Palace to visit Empress Dowager.

47
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,520
I did go to the Summer Palace,

48
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,360
but unfortunately, Her Highness Empress Dowager was praying to Buddha so I didn’t get to see her.

49
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,620
I instead saw Her Highness Consort Ling.

50
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,720
I told her that

51
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,400
Lord Aibida brought back a stunning beauty

52
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,080
and offered her to Your Majesty.

53
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,240
In less than three days,

54
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,970
she packed up her bags and returned to the palace.

55
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:33,760
Really?

56
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,240
Your Majesty,

57
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
there is still a pile of memorials in the Council of State office.

58
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,120
I must go back to work now.

59
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,850
I'll return later to inform Your Majesty of the important matters.

60
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,260
I'll take my leave.

61
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,720
Fuheng, wait!

62
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,530
Your Majesty, do you still have any other instructions?

63
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,580
You usually are busy with official work.

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,680
Let Fu Kang'an come to the Forbidden City

65
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,360
and study with the princes.

66
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,360
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

67
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,440
Rise.

68
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,740
How is Consort Ling’s condition?

69
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,440
Replying to Your Majesty,

70
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
other than being unable to sleep at night,

71
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,040
Her Highness Consort Ling also shows signs of disharmony between her liver and stomach.

72
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,880
I've prescribed some fragrant thyme and stomach-soothing soup

73
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,010
to slowly nurse Her Highness' health.

74
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,680
Disharmony between the liver and stomach?

75
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,610
Because of irregular meals, her stomach would ache.

76
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,570
How have you been attending to her?

77
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
How come she's having irregular meals?

78
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,440
Your Majesty,

79
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,640
Her Highness Consort Ling uses her own blood to copy the Avatamsaka Sutra.

80
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,640
She continued to do so even when we were in the Summer Palace.

81
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,880
As days passed by, she’s lost a lot of blood and energy,

82
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,080
and in turn lost her appetite. So now her stomach is upset.

83
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,960
Mingyu,

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
organize the twentieth volume,

85
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,280
and ask someone to deliver it to the Summer Palace.

86
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,600
Your Majesty?

87
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Your Majesty, how come you are here?

88
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,280
No need.

89
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,720
You're sick,

90
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
so stop acting tough.

91
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,540
Thank you for understanding, Your Majesty.

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
What's wrong with your hand?

93
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,920
It's nothing.

94
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,760
Just a small wound from bleeding myself.

95
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,600
I order you

96
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,210
to stop writing!

97
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,040
Your Majesty,

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,760
please forgive me but I can't obey you.

99
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,160
You...

100
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,760
Since I've promised Empress Dowager

101
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,600
that I'll complete the eighty volumes,

102
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,920
I can't stop midway.

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,520
I

104
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,770
was going to let you perish on your own.

105
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,840
But giving consideration to

106
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,240
how you meticulously cared for Empress Dowager,

107
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,700
I thus gave you a reminder.

108
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,920
If you are not listening, then there’s nothing else I can do.

109
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
But you must

110
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,780
bear all the consequences yourself.

111
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,320
If Empress Dowager asks about it in the future,

112
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,640
you’ll be responsible for it.

113
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,720
I understand.

114
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,530
Does Your Majesty still remember your promise to me?

115
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,460
Your Majesty said that

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,880
you wouldn't let anyone bully me.

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,120
Tonight, Your Majesty came to my Palace.

118
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,200
Everyone in the imperial harem has seen it.

119
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,400
If you leave now,

120
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,820
how can I make a foothold here in the Imperial harem?

121
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,480
I fear that I won't be able to stay any longer

122
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,480
in the Forbidden City.

123
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,360
Tonight,

124
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,760
I'll sleep here

125
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,800
to preserve your honor.

126
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,400
As for the others, don't even think about them.

127
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:32,960
Li Yu.

128
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,760
I'm here.

129
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,799
Go

130
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,419
and clean up the side chamber.

131
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,640
Tonight,

132
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll sleep here.

133
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,240
Well…

134
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,280
Yes.

135
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,040
Get out!

136
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,520
Your Majesty.

137
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
There's a rat in my chamber.

138
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,800
I'm afraid.

139
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,320
If there's a rat, ask them to catch it.

140
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,250
I'm not leaving!

141
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,360
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

142
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,720
I didn't wear shoes.

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,330
If I go out like this, my feet will get cold.

144
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,960
Your Majesty!

145
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,040
Wei Yingluo,

146
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,770
I haven't forgiven you.

147
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,440
Get out!

148
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,920
I'm not leaving.

149
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,480
Get down!

150
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,720
You...

151
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,080
Your Majesty,

152
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,170
I took contraceptive medicine

153
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,120
because I am afraid.

154
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,720
Of what?

155
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,370
I'm afraid of dying.

156
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,450
I don't understand.

157
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,090
When a woman gives birth, it’s like

158
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,690
one of her feet steps into the gate of hell.

159
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,880
I'm selfish.

160
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,290
I'm afraid of dying.

161
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,520
I don't want to be like my mother,

162
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,080
dying in bed because of a difficult labor.

163
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,880
I'm so afraid.

164
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
So very afraid...

165
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,520
That’s why

166
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,460
I asked Ye Tianshi for contraceptive medicine.

167
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,200
Your Majesty,

168
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,940
I don't have the courage to get pregnant and have children.

169
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm not yet ready to be a mother.

170
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,020
Why didn't you tell me about this before?

171
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,650
When my mother passed away,

172
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,080
everyone said that she was great

173
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,560
for continuing the descendants of the Wei family.

174
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,280
But do women live

175
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,520
just to give birth to children?

176
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,960
Don’t their lives have other meanings?

177
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,600
Your Majesty.

178
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,720
Now that I have told you this,

179
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,440
will you think that I'm strange?

180
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,720
I understand.

181
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,660
If you are not willing,

182
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,880
no one will force you.

183
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,250
Your Majesty, are you still angry with me?

184
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,800
You know that

185
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm angry with you

186
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,400
not only because of this matter.

187
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,580
Regardless of what the reason is,

188
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,160
it's already in the past.

189
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,210
Your Majesty, don't be angry with me anymore.

190
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,280
Yingluo,

191
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,400
you knew what I wanted to ask.

192
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,970
Why did you avoid answering me?

193
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,040
What are you laughing about?

194
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,040
It’s rare to see that you failed in your plan.

195
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,680
His Majesty left in the early morning.

196
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,080
He didn't even say anything.

197
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,480
Then why are you so happy?

198
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,480
Whose side are you on?

199
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,440
Ok, stop being angry.

200
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,960
It didn’t work this time,

201
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,360
then try again next time.

202
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,160
With your ability,

203
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,020
you’ll surely win His Majesty’s heart back.

204
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,440
I fear it won't be that easy this time.

205
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,640
Come in.

206
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,880
Your Highness,

207
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
His Majesty has gone to Hall of Fairview

208
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,610
to have breakfast with Imperial Concubine Shun.

209
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,960
Greetings, Your Highness the Empress.

210
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,480
Rise.

211
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,260
Thank you, Your Highness.

212
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,840
Our sister Consort Ling stayed for a long time at the Summer Palace.

213
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,970
Now that she's back,

214
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,370
can’t everyone recognize her?

215
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,600
Consort Ling

216
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,880
is proud and arrogant.

217
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,370
Can’t believe you come here today.

218
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,800
Is it because you lost your position to Imperial Concubine Shun

219
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,600
so you finally remembered us?

220
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,160
Consort Jia, the conflicts between you and Consort Ling

221
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,490
are already in the past.

222
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,720
You have been pardoned,

223
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,120
had the Eleventh Prince and been promoted.

224
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,720
It’s time for you to let go.

225
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,880
That's right.

226
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,760
Whether we were friends or enemies in the past,

227
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,000
we have

228
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,640
a common enemy now.

229
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,920
Why can't we get along?

230
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,280
Sister Consort Ling,

231
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,320
I have offended you many times in the past.

232
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,920
Please forgive me.

233
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,520
Consort Shu is now a fourth-ranked consort,

234
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,600
unlike before,

235
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,880
you don’t need to kneel to me.

236
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,600
Ok.

237
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,460
Since you are all here,

238
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,880
take a seat then.

239
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,800
In treating Imperial Concubine Shun,

240
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,360
His Majesty cherish her so much that he’d fear to break her when holding her in hands,

241
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,420
or melt her when putting her in mouth.

242
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,880
Speaking of the favor she gets,

243
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,800
even the then Sister Consort Ling

244
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,240
couldn’t compare to her.

245
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,520
She's just a woman from the wild mountain.

246
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Does she really think she's a fairy?

247
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,400
Your Highness,

248
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,040
we are just like headless flies.

249
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,920
When encountering this,

250
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,760
we still have to count on you.

251
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,599
There are many consorts and concubines in the harem.

252
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,359
I have never been jealous of anybody or fought for favors.

253
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,290
I have also never cared about who His Majesty favors.

254
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,880
Imperial Concubine Shun is behaving improperly now.

255
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,760
The singing and dancing are nonstop at Hall of Fairview,

256
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,160
drawing His Majesty to indulge in sensual pleasures,

257
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,400
causing the Imperial court to debate on this.

258
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Your Highness,

259
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,240
what should we do?

260
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,880
I have an idea about how to deal with Imperial Concubine Shun.

261
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,160
When the time comes, I will need the cooperation of the three of you.

262
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,360
We’ll for sure succeed easily.

263
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,400
Yingluo, I feel uneasy

264
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,920
about your gathering just now.

265
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,880
It seemed like a gathering of bad women, did it?

266
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,960
I wanted to know

267
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,960
what they are going to do,

268
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,360
and learn more about this Imperial Concubine Shun.

269
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,840
But I'm afraid you will be misguided by the Empress

270
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,570
and will find it hard to get out.

271
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,560
Whatever I want,

272
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,140
His Majesty will give it to me.

273
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,120
But

274
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,530
I still want to go out of the palace.

275
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,880
The green tiles and the red walls in the Forbidden City

276
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,680
make one feel suffocated.

277
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,680
When I feel bored,

278
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,320
I’d ride my pony

279
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,900
and circle again and again

280
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,880
Inside of Hall of Fairview.

281
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,800
This way,

282
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,280
it makes me feel like I have gone back to the past.

283
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,500
Imperial Concubine Shun,

284
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,260
your steps must be stable.

285
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,480
That's right.

286
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,920
Look ahead

287
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,940
and hold the position.

288
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,520
Yingluo,

289
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,800
if I ask His Majesty

290
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,280
to go out with me

291
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,120
in the near future,

292
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,920
would he agree?

293
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,840
Yingluo?

294
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,680
Yingluo?

295
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,320
Your Highness!

296
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,400
Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness!

297
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,330
Are you alright?

298
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,120
Your Highness!

299
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Yingluo! Your Highness! Are you ok?

300
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,120
Yingluo! Are you ok?

301
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,640
I'm sorry.

302
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,650
I'm still not used to

303
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,280
these "flower pot" soled shoes.

304
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,410
Are you really fine?

305
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,460
Imperial Concubine Shun,

306
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,300
you dropped this by accident.

307
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,280
Let me see.

308
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,600
His Majesty personally engraved this

309
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,930
and gifted it to Imperial Concubine Shun.

310
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,800
The calm moon shadow is reflected in the bottom of the water, like a piece of jade that sinks.

311
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
I don't quite understand this poem.

312
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,440
I wonder what it means.

313
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,040
His Majesty is praising you.

314
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,260
That you're like a jade within the water, so perfect and flawless.

315
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm tired today.

316
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,860
Let’s continue tomorrow.

317
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,320
But I still...

318
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,520
Escort the guest out.

319
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,040
Yingluo,

320
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,000
why are you suddenly angry?

321
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,160
Is it because of this jade?

322
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,520
Can't you tell that

323
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,480
I didn't like you from the start?

324
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,440
With your personality,

325
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,220
if you really hated me,

326
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,620
you would have kicked me out earlier.

327
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,420
You heard me babbling.

328
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,130
This proves that you don't hate me, right?

329
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,840
Are you two

330
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,320
deaf?

331
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
See the guest out.

332
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,940
I didn’t approach you on purpose.

333
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
It's just that...

334
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,120
It's just that I feel lonely.

335
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,490
I merely wanted to find someone to talk to.

336
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,120
And I am not wearing this jade

337
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,320
for showing off.

338
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,480
Xiaoquan!

339
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,800
Imperial Concubine Shun, please leave.

340
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,480
Yizhu,

341
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,820
why did you talk so much today?

342
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,900
Your Highness,

343
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,040
this was a gift from His Majesty.

344
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,160
I didn't say anything wrong.

345
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,960
But hearing this,

346
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,720
Consort Ling would think that I deliberately show off.

347
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,520
Consort Ling wasn’t nice to you.

348
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,320
She wasn't even serious in teaching you the rules.

349
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,040
Why did you go to her?

350
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
Because I like it.

351
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,250
I don't understand.

352
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,440
She was so rude to you.

353
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,060
Why do you like her?

354
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,210
A person who has a cold smile on her face

355
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,290
is far better than those women with sinister smiles.

356
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,800
I don't understand what you are talking about.

357
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,460
You will never understand

358
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,280
what I mean.

359
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,400
Your Highness, you haven’t changed at all!

360
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,960
If you are seen by others,

361
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,610
they’ll say you don’t have manners again.

362
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,460
Chamberlain Yuan.

363
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,080
for the requirements in the death anniversary of Princess He'an,

364
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,880
Imperial Concubine Qing is currently preparing them

365
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,000
and will deliver the list to the Imperial Household Department later.

366
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,280
For the meals,

367
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,560
pastries,

368
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,800
milk tea, liquor,

369
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,800
and fresh fruits,

370
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,220
just prepare them according to the list.

371
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,840
As for the praying lama…

372
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,530
Yingluo,

373
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,200
only in the ceremony for Emperors and Empresses

374
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,880
may there be a lama praying.

375
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,600
As for ranks from the Imperial Noble Consort downward,

376
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,880
there isn't such a tradition.

377
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,800
Even if the Imperial Household Department agrees to it,

378
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,880
those censors will not.

379
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,680
They won't dare complain about Empress Dowager,

380
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,280
thus they will surely vent their anger on you.

381
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,880
Yuan Chunwang,

382
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,240
I…

383
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,840
are you confused?

384
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,210
How dare you to call me directly by my name?

385
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,860
Yuan Chunwang,

386
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,160
ever since you betrayed me,

387
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,440
you've no longer been my sworn brother.

388
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,120
You're just a servant.

389
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
You’d better remember your status.

390
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,200
Yes.

391
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,460
It's indeed not appropriate to have lamas pray,

392
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,960
but we can allow it

393
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,480
in consideration for the love of Empress Dowager to her daughter.

394
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,400
In my opinion,

395
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,680
just set the praying lamas in front of the tomb of Princess He'an.

396
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,340
Invite a female shaman into the palace instead.

397
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,360
Just for a minor thing, you have angered Consort Ling.

398
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,600
Leave us now.

399
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,360
Yes.

400
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Your Highness,

401
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,840
sorry I didn’t welcome you appropriately.

402
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,360
Please forgive me.

403
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,720
Empress Dowager personally chose you to organize the ceremony.

404
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,120
It must be very tiring.

405
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,600
I've checked it earlier.

406
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,170
Everything is in order.

407
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,240
It's all thanks to you knowing the likes of Empress Dowager so well

408
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,480
that everything has been done so smoothly.

409
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,680
Thank you for your praises, Your Highness.

410
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,440
I'm just doing my best to organize it.

411
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,260
Hope Empress Dowager will be satisfied with it.

412
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,720
Since you're here,

413
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,140
can Your Highness give me some guidance?

414
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,360
Everything is fine,

415
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,080
except

416
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,320
a little Buddhist flower is missing.

417
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,600
if you burn it in front of the offering table,

418
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,520
Empress Dowager might be happier to see it.

419
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,800
Little Buddhist flower?

420
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,400
Every death anniversary offering ceremony or during the year-end ceremony,

421
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
the little Buddhist flower will be used.

422
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,000
Seeing His Majesty puts great importance

423
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,460
to the death anniversary of Princess He'an,

424
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,200
Empress Dowager and His Majesty will surely reconcile with each other.

425
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,600
Thank you for your advice, Your Highness the Empress.

426
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,800
I will keep it in mind.

427
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,400
Empress Dowager hasn't seen Imperial Concubine Shun yet.

428
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,460
When the day comes,

429
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,970
Please introduce her to Empress Dowager.

430
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,960
Yingluo,

431
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,040
what's wrong?

432
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,530
Empress is making her move.

433
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,530
Making her move?

434
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,250
Great trouble will soon befall on Imperial Concubine Shun.

435
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,760
Empress Dowager, Consort Ling is currently in the Imperial Household Department

436
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,360
verifying the items needed for the offering ceremony.

437
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,520
She asked me to let you review the list again

438
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,880
and see if there's still anything missing,

439
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,120
so she can immediately have them prepared.

440
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,380
It’s been three years,

441
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,840
you've become more prudent.

442
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,120
Consort Ling said

443
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,930
that you exerted a lot of effort for this offering ceremony.

444
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,800
It is my honor

445
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
to do something for Princess He'an.

446
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
Empress Dowager,

447
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,360
you have journeyed for quite a long time to come back.

448
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,520
You haven't yet noticed that Hall of Fairview

449
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,880
has been renovated, right?

450
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,440
Hall of Fairview?

451
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,860
I heard that

452
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,090
songs and dances were played there all night yesterday.

453
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,120
It seems like Imperial Concubine Shun has choreographed a new dance which was absolutely fabulous.

454
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,160
Even His Majesty was greatly impressed.

455
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,200
If given a chance,

456
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,920
I also want to see it.

457
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,880
I fear that

458
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,360
you won't dare to watch it.

459
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,560
Why won't I?

460
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,720
I heard that she would remove one piece of clothes

461
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,450
after each certain period of time while dancing.

462
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,840
Once the dance is done,

463
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,640
she’ll become totally naked!

464
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,040
Would you dare watch?

465
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,440
Empress,

466
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,040
I wasn't here in the Forbidden City for a long time.

467
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,880
Such a person suddenly entered the palace,

468
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,410
why don’t you do something?

469
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,200
Empress Dowager, please forgive me.

470
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,800
I already warned His Majesty

471
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,480
that he's over favoring Imperial Concubine Shun.

472
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,200
If I say too much, I fear that it might lead to an opposite effect.

473
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,040
So I can only proceed carefully.

474
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,280
the Emperor is such a big fuss for a woman!

475
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,480
This is so ridiculous!

476
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,240
As the Empress, you have the power to manage the Imperial harem.

477
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,770
Now that such a bewitching woman has appeared in the palace,

478
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,040
you instead are passing the blame.

479
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,960
This is so outrageous.

480
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,700
Empress Dowager, I accept your lecture.

481
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,920
I have a gentle temperament,

482
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,560
and wouldn't dare meddle too much in His Majesty's personal matters.

483
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,620
I'm afraid of having a reputation as a jealous Empress.

484
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,680
Now that you're back in the palace, Empress Dowager,

485
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,200
I now have a backer.

486
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,760
I will do everything according to your instructions.

487
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,560
Good.

488
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,160
So,

489
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,420
you're attending to me like Bodhisattva

490
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,520
so that you can hug onto my feet

491
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,840
when the time is right!

492
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,080
Empress, you're in charge of the imperial harem.

493
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,000
You should decide

494
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
what to do.

495
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,700
Respectfully sending off Empress Dowager.

496
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,040
Your Highness, the preparations for the offering ceremony hasn't been completed yet.

497
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,370
I will take my leave now.

498
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,450
she got promoted

499
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,880
because of Consort Ling.

500
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,820
Now that there is trouble,

501
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,440
she's still weak and inept.

502
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,720
Your Highness,

503
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,400
Empress Dowager doesn't seem interested in meddling in this matter.

504
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
What should we do?

505
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,700
That's right, Your Highness.

506
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,640
If Empress Dowager won't intervene,

507
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,040
shall we allow Imperial Concubine Shun to continue with her arrogance?

508
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,200
You two have went through so many things,

509
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,730
when will you be able to change your attitude?

510
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,760
Who said Empress Dowager won’t intervene?

511
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,920
Is the preparation for the offering ceremony all done?

512
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,520
Everything has been arranged appropriately. May Your Highness not worry.

513
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,180
What about the female shaman?

514
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,600
I've made

515
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,720
the arrangement.

516
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,640
I know I can count on you!

517
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
You may leave now.

518
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,360
Yes.

519
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,120
Yingluo,

520
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,280
His Majesty keeps favoring Imperial Concubine Shun.

521
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,010
I fear that he won't come back to you any time soon.

522
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,800
If the plan of the Empress is successful,

523
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,290
it means your eyesore will be removed.

524
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,440
In my opinion,

525
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,480
just pretend you don't know anything.

526
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,320
Okay?

527
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,740
Help neither of the two sides.

528
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,280
It’ll all up to Imperial Concubine Shun herself now.

529
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,820
I didn’t approach you on purpose.

530
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,720
It's just that I feel lonely.

531
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,810
I merely wanted to find someone to talk to.

532
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,330
In this Forbidden City,

533
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,360
we all live under a pretentious mask.

534
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,010
Being able to be oneself in front of each other

535
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,640
is such a good thing.

536
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,800
This is the first time that Empress Dowager has invited me over to Palace of Longevity and Peace

537
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,730
I should’ve worn my banner clothes

538
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
to show respect.

539
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,760
You couldn't even wear these shoes well.

540
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,690
If you slip and fall, won't that be too embarrassing?

541
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,320
It's all Consort Ling's fault

542
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,450
for not being serious in teaching you.

543
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,480
It's not her fault.

544
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,920
I'm the one to blame.

545
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,370
Don’t speak ill of Consort Ling again.

546
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,920
-Consort Ling!  -Yingluo!

547
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,240
what are you doing?

548
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,240
Yingluo!

549
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,520
Yingluo!

550
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,580
What are you doing?

551
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,400
Saving your life!

552
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,800
Where are you going?

553
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,120
The shaman is here!

554
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,360
This is so weird.

555
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,280
On the death anniversary of a princess,

556
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,080
why should we be here to pray Buddhist scriptures?

557
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,610
This is too inappropriate!

558
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,200
I have only heard of praying to the heavens, to the earth, to the ancestors.

559
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,680
I've never heard of doing any death anniversary ceremony

560
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,760
for a dead princess.

561
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,690
His Majesty is known as filial son.

562
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,320
As long as it can make Empress Dowager happy,

563
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,580
he's willing to be follow her every whim.

564
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,000
If it’s not because today is a major court meeting day,

565
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,530
His Majesty would even personally come here.

566
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,640
You're unhappy?

567
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,130
Then go tell Empress Dowager that.

568
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,680
Have you memorized "The Sutra of the Fundamental Vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva"?

569
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,280
If Empress Dowager hear you reciting it wrong,

570
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,080
you’ll fail in fawning on her and get punished instead!

571
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,560
You...!

572
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,080
Please stop talking.

573
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,280
Being able to copy sutras for the Princess

574
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,240
is also accumulating good karma for oneself.

575
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,440
What's bad about it?

576
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,280
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

577
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,640
This is the "Sutra of the Fundamental Vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva" that I've copied for the Princess.

578
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,500
Hope the Princess can go to the paradise in the west.

579
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,080
Fire!

580
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,240
Fire!

581
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,600
Put out the fire, now!

582
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,720
He'an!

583
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,760
Fire!

584
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,360
My He’an!

585
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,770
put out the fire!

586
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,720
He'an!

587
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,520
He'an!

588
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,000
He'an! My He’an!

589
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,200
Your Highness, be careful.

590
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:32,680
My He'an!

591
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,920
Splash water! Hurry!

592
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,440
My He'an!

593
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,380
I’ve held death anniversary ceremony for He'an for years.

594
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,120
An accident like this has never happened before!

595
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,520
What's going on today?

596
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,440
It's just an accident.

597
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,840
Don't worry.

598
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,280
Grand Shaman.

599
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,640
The offering ceremony got interrupted!

600
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,240
Will it affect my He'an?

601
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Empress Dowager,

602
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,800
Princess He'an died at a young age.

603
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,640
Her lifespan has ended, yet still hasn't reincarnated.

604
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,960
So she had no chance of going to the west.

605
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,800
Empress Dowager, however, wanted the Princess

606
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,240
to go to the paradise in the west,

607
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,640
so you keep doing kind and charitable deeds all your life.

608
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,840
Actually, you'll attain your wish in just two more years.

609
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,400
But what a pity that today

610
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,120
it got destroyed by this evil witch!

611
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,520
What evil witch?

612
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,200
When she appeared, the Buddhist flower and offering items were all burnt to ashes.

613
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,880
You're making up nonsense!

614
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,960
Imperial Concubine Shun, behave yourself!

615
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,290
Grand Shaman, are you speaking the truth?

616
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,250
How dare you to question me?

617
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,480
I didn't do anything.

618
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,000
Your Highness the Empress, I know that you've always been benevolent.

619
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,640
But

620
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,120
this Imperial Concubine Shun was born with such a stunning face,

621
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,040
and her actions are bewitching the Emperor.

622
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,160
Perhaps she's really an inauspicious person!

623
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,040
Grand Shaman

624
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,680
is the envoy who bridges the communication with the ghosts and deities.

625
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
We can’t doubt her words!

626
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,480
Consort Ling,

627
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,360
anything you want to say?

628
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Empress Dowager,

629
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,440
I don't know much about ghosts and deities.

630
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480
I dare not make any rash conclusion.

631
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,360
Consort Ling,

632
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,920
by saying this,

633
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,400
you clearly are defending that inauspicious woman.

634
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Empress Dowager,

635
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,920
allow me to say a few words.

636
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,450
Your thirty years of effort

637
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,920
all got destroyed today.

638
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,920
Princess He'an got dragged down by this inauspicious woman.

639
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,240
It’s impossible for her to go to the paradise in the west now!

640
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,700
If you still tolerate her,

641
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,240
more people will

642
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,600
be affected by her!

643
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Empress Dowager!

644
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,200
Arrest her!

645
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,920
Empress Dowager!

646
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,480
Hurry!

647
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
Empress Dowager!

648
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,800
I am framed!

649
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,600
I really don't know what has happened.

650
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,660
You're saying that

651
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,000
you are framed?

652
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,880
Yes!

653
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Someone must have bribed the Grand Shaman!

654
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,520
And the offering stage was rigged too!

655
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,880
Now that everything has been burned into ashes,

656
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,560
I'm unable to show you any evidence.

657
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,820
But if you interrogate the Grand Shaman,

658
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,000
you will know the truth?

659
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,760
Even Empress Dowager shows respect

660
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,280
to Grand Shaman!

661
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,400
How dare you to trash her?

662
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,040
Even if His Majesty was here, he wouldn't be able to save you!

663
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,360
But I swear to God, I

664
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,980
really don't know what has happened!

665
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,920
I'm not an inauspicious person!

666
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,240
Take her away!

667
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,480
Let go! Let go!

668
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,360
Empress Dowager! Empress Dowager!

669
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,320
Please look at me!

670
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,920
I'm a person with blood and flesh,

671
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,320
a living human being!

672
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,520
Take her away!

673
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,560
Don't! Wait!

674
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,600
You...

675
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,560
Come with me.

676
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,000
What's going on?

677
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,000
Grand Shaman has said that she's an inauspicious being.

678
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,720
Why did Empress Dowager let her off?

679
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,240
Your Highness the Empress,

680
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,880
this..!

681
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,920
Respectfully sending off Your Highness the Empress.

682
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,720
When were you born?

683
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,840
Answer me!

684
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,640
Zi hour, on the fifteenth of September.

685
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,080
Why do you ask me this, Empress Dowager?

686
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,290
on the fifteenth of September,

687
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,160
Zi hour.

688
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,010
Take her away first.

689
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,960
Aunt Liu.

690
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,060
what are we doing here?

691
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,360
Please wait here for a while.

692
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,360
When it's time to release you, you'll be released.

693
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
Empress Dowager.

694
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,560
Sit.

695
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,240
Your Highness has taken Grand Shaman’s word.

696
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,330
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

697
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,220
Do you still remember that I once told you

698
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,580
that when He'an was gravely sick,

699
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,460
I went to beg for mercy to all temples,

700
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,520
kowtowing and burning incense to Buddha everywhere,

701
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,440
hoping to sacrifice ten years of my life

702
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,600
in exchange for He'an's life?

703
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,480
That time, there was a prestigious monk who told me

704
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,760
that I could leave a mark on the child.

705
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,930
Even if I'm unable to save her in this life,

706
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,640
I would still get a chance to reunite with her in her next life.

707
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,320
Hence, I hardened my heart

708
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,200
and placed two holes

709
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,120
at the bottom part of her lips.

710
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,480
Right around here.

711
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,440
They were the size of needle eye.

712
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,840
But earlier,

713
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,320
when Imperial Concubine Shun threw herself at me,

714
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,050
I discovered that she also has…

715
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,320
The theory of reincarnation

716
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,480
is too absurd.

717
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
You shouldn't believe such things.

718
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,600
But her birthday

719
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,240
was also at zi hour on the fifteenth of September!

720
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,640
Same birthday and same mark.

721
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,700
It can’t be just coincidence!

722
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,680
Hurry! Hurry!

723
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,160
Hurry up!

724
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,680
Respectfully greets Royal Mother.

725
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

726
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,080
Royal Mother,

727
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,210
where is Imperial Concubine Shun?

728
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,040
Royal Mother,

729
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,420
you mustn't believe the words of the shaman.

730
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,720
Chenbi surely isn't some inauspicious being.

731
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,720
Emperor,

732
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,680
you gave Grand Shaman a title of worship,

733
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,400
but you're asking me to not believe her.

734
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,800
Isn't that contradictory?

735
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,640
Royal Mother,

736
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,080
I gave Grand Shaman a title and position

737
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,040
so she can do her duty during the day and night offering ceremonies.

738
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,320
It is to continue the old customs of our old ancestors,

739
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,240
so as to urge everyone to not forget

740
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,840
how hard this empire was obtained.

741
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,720
Not to let her dominate your thoughts

742
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,250
and dictate your decision.

743
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,900
Please believe me that

744
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,520
Chenbi is just an ordinary woman.

745
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,760
She surely isn't some inauspicious being.

746
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,440
Your Majesty, don't worry.

747
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,170
Imperial Concubine Shun is currently very safe.

748
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,440
I left you by the side of Empress Dowager

749
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,720
not for you to sow discord

750
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,520
or eliminate your competition.

751
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,720
I have never said anything bad against Imperial Concubine Shun.

752
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,320
You've misunderstood Yingluo.

753
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,140
She's not that kind of person.

754
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,360
Royal Mother,

755
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,740
you are too fond of this woman.

756
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,000
Maybe...

757
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,920
she's not as kind as you think.

758
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:33,960
Chenbi,

759
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,100
come over here.

760
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,600
Okay, Emperor.

761
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,800
Let’s put this thing to an end.

762
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,100
Don't be too hard on Grand Shaman either.

763
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,040
Take your beloved Imperial consort away then.

764
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,220
Thank the Empress Dowager for her grace.

765
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,840
Thank you for your grace, Empress Dowager.

766
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:08,960
Let's go.

767
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,400
Wait!
