[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,460
Your Highness, you're awake.

4
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
That thing earlier must have startled you.

5
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,979
A little eunuch...

6
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,450
ran into the screen.

7
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,320
His Majesty was furious because of it.

8
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,790
He left after he got so angry.

9
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,759
So that's what happened.

10
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,160
I thought something serious had happened.

11
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,520
The utmost priority of Changchun Palace
is you and the child you are bearing.

12
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,560
Nothing else comes first.

13
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,900
Ying Luo,

14
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,250
someone just suggested for me...

15
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,550
to marry you to His Majesty.

16
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,910
Are you willing?

17
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,880
Your Majesty,

18
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,800
I am not willing.

19
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,200
Why?

20
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,090
You are always so proud and confident.

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,600
Should you ever become one
of the Imperial Consorts,

22
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,040
no one would dare to look down
on you ever again.

23
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,950
Ying Luo,

24
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,090
this is a grace from Her Highness.

25
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,580
Think it through before
you give an answer.

26
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,380
If you really become an consort,

27
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,050
you never be short on respect
from the others.

28
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,240
I appreciate your concern.

29
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,450
But I doubt I deserve it.

30
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,050
You always claim to
be loyal to Her Majesty.

31
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,360
Her Majesty is with child no and
she can't tend to His Majesty's needs,

32
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,220
there is no better display of loyalty
other than serving in her stead.

33
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,600
I owe my life to Her Majesty.

34
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,630
There will never be a day when I can
repay all of Her Majesty's kindness.

35
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,160
If I ever become an Imperial Consort,

36
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,950
there will be no chance to display
my loyalty if I wasn't favoured.

37
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,660
If I did get favoured,

38
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,560
if I bear His Majesty's child,

39
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,890
I will surely grow selfish over
the I am serving His Majesty,

40
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,260
how can I ever be devoted
to serving Her Majesty again?

41
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,230
I am trying to be fair.

42
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,840
What about your personal reason?

43
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,190
I hope...

44
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,360
Your Majesty wouldn't mind.

45
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,260
Because in my heart,

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,589
you are more than just my master,

47
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,950
but also my benefactor.

48
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,800
I've got used to seeing you
as my own sister.

49
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,960
I've made an oath,

50
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,670
I will serve you forever.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,659
His Majesty is your husband,

52
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,230
the person you care about the most.

53
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,150
Even if all women in this world
become His Majesty's consorts,

54
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,620
I can never be one of them.

55
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,120
Doing so would be
an act of betrayal to Your Majesty.

56
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,300
I would also betray my own promise.

57
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,910
Er Qing,

58
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,840
did you hear that?

59
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,230
Ying Luo is right.

60
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,390
Come over here.

61
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,360
Ying Luo,

62
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,720
you didn't disappoint me.

63
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,120
Don't worry.

64
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,490
I won't force you
to attend to His Majesty.

65
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,159
Because doing so...

66
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,430
will be unjust for you.

67
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,030
Someday,

68
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,220
I will marry you off...

69
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,080
in a grand manner.

70
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,520
Thank you for your grace.

71
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,600
Stop right there!

72
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,230
What is it, Ying Luo?

73
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,640
What have you told Her Majesty earlier?

74
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,050
Don't get me wrong.

75
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,780
I merely suggested the idea to Her Majesty
for her own good.

76
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,210
Fine.

77
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,200
Since that's the case,

78
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,820
I should be honest with you.

79
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,650
Her Majesty...

80
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,780
will never use her own servants
to win the favour of His Majesty.

81
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,970
Please do not bring this up again.

82
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,230
Ying Luo, why are you being so serious?

83
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,250
You're scaring me.

84
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,800
It's normal here for consorts to
maintain their influence.

85
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,740
I was wrong for thinking you
as one of them.

86
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,680
I won't mention it again.

87
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,020
Er Qing,

88
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,080
you've been serving Her Majesty for years.

89
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,640
You should know how much
she loves her husband.

90
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,500
But because of the code and ethic
as the Empress, she can't express it.

91
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,310
If someone she trusts took advantage
of her pregnancy...

92
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,340
to seek His Majesty's favour,

93
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,030
that would break her heart
beyond any mending.

94
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,740
Which is why I will not agree to this,

95
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,370
neither would I let anyone from
Changchun Palace to have such idea.

96
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,420
Sister.

97
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,789
what brings you here?

98
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,799
This painting looks very familiar.

99
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,890
It's one of Her Majesty's
prized collection.

100
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,370
I borrowed it to admire it.

101
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,800
I remember.

102
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,830
It must be the "Four Seasons"
Guard Fuca gave her.

103
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,230
Such an exquisite masterpiece.

104
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,350
May I borrow it?

105
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,740
Yu Hu.

106
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,220
Sister, I meant the genuine painting.

107
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,780
You shall have it back
after I made a copy of it.

108
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,160
Yet you are lending me a replica,

109
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,240
that seems rather petty of you.

110
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,420
Sister, I apologize.

111
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,730
The genuine artwork must be
returned to Her Majesty.

112
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,980
If it suffers any damage,

113
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,960
it will be hard to explain to Her Majesty.

114
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,370
Hence, I could only lend you
the replica I have.

115
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Even your replica is a worthy treasure,

116
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,140
I will cherish it.

117
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,860
Your Highness, is something bothering you?

118
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,530
Zhen,

119
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,680
what kind of person
do you think Consort Chun is?

120
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,820
It's hard to say.

121
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,480
But everyone here in the palace knows
Consort Chun is loyal to the Empress.

122
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,290
She has no intentions of winning favours.
She's a trusted ally.

123
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,470
That's right.

124
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:58,390
There were even gossips
about their intimate relation.

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,240
What do you think
Consort Chun is aiming for?

126
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,620
If she does have any ulterior motive,

127
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,960
she would want to
please His Majesty instead.

128
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,420
Why would she fawn on Her Majesty?
That is counterproductive.

129
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,440
In my opinion, Consort Chun
is honestly loyal to the Empress.

130
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,560
Is that so?

131
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,130
No.

132
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,770
Perhaps Consort Chun's
target is someone else.

133
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,470
De Sheng.

134
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,520
Miss Ying Luo.

135
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,680
As soon as His Majesty got angry,

136
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,400
you started avoiding us.

137
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,760
That wasn't very nice.

138
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,030
Please, Miss Ying Luo.

139
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,930
It's not that I'm avoiding you.

140
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,920
The Bureau of Astronomy
predicted thunderstorm for tomorrow night.

141
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,600
I'm in a hurry to inform all the palaces,

142
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,800
they need to be ready for it.

143
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,940
Thunderstorm?

144
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,910
Rains are common in summer.

145
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,490
So is thunderstorm.

146
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,970
Is there anything strange about that?

147
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,460
Listen, giant thunderclouds
are gathering in the sky.

148
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,400
It's better to inform everyone beforehand,

149
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,460
we don't want the consorts to
be frightened by thunder.

150
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,240
Thunder?

151
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,970
What do you want to say?

152
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,720
Miss Ying Luo, I don't want to
be too nosy,

153
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,190
but it's not like there is any woman
His Majesty wants and cannot have.

154
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,010
You will never be able to escape
the Forbidden City.

155
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,200
Not to mention the Emperor
is talented and handsome,

156
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,060
he stands above the whole nation.

157
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,070
Refusing his offer...

158
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,880
would likely doom yourself.

159
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,030
De Sheng. Who told you this?

160
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,130
That was far from the truth.

161
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,400
I wasn't insinuating anything,

162
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,950
I have work to do, I should go now.

163
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,280
Thunder-crash?

164
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,960
What are you doing?

165
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,560
What do you want?

166
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,500
Ying Luo, did His Majesty
ask the impossible of you?

167
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,960
-No.
-Don't lie to me.

168
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,720
Why did you bring it up
if you knew His Majesty was upset?

169
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,470
I told you that I like you
and want to marry you.

170
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,150
Thank you for your good intentions.

171
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,740
I will never forget that.

172
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,980
But...

173
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,600
His Majesty's objection cleared my mind.

174
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,500
We live in different worlds,
we will never be together.

175
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,810
Ying Luo,

176
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,240
no matter what His Majesty says,
it will not change my decision.

177
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,530
Fu Heng!

178
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,910
Your decision is none of my business!

179
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,840
If you don't like me,

180
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,340
what was fragrance pouch for?

181
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,320
Yes.

182
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,320
I admit it, I do like you!

183
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,300
But in my heart,

184
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,930
revenge is the only purpose in my life.

185
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,920
Men? Love?

186
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,570
Neither of them matters!

187
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,200
If you get in my way,
I'll get rid of you.

188
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,810
This is me! Now you see who I really am!

189
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,780
Do you mean what you said?

190
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,660
Fu Heng,

191
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,560
from now on,

192
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,690
you stay as far as you can...

193
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,890
away from me.

194
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,140
If you ever get in my way again,

195
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,640
you will regret it.

196
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,780
Master,

197
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,510
this is for you own good.

198
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,200
This is the only way.

199
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,440
Sorry.

200
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,360
-Careful.
-Hold it tightly.

201
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,760
Fasten it.

202
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,310
Will you be done soon?

203
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,530
Consort Dowager, they've
delivered the window screen.

204
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,800
We'll be done by noon.

205
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,560
I think you people are simply
looking down on us.

206
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,760
Your work would have been done so much
quicker if the Empress Dowager lives here.

207
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,870
But now, we have to beg and urge for you.

208
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,380
You clearly are lazing around.

209
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,590
I wouldn't dare.

210
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,940
These drapes are custom-made in
the Embroidery Workshop.

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,890
They used the lightest
and thinnest chiffonette.

212
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,790
It takes a lot of time and effort.

213
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,930
Who told you it's the lightest
and thinnest chiffonette?

214
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,050
I touched it earlier, it was stiff.

215
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,930
I bet you gave us the rejects.

216
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,950
Miss Bai Ling, that is not true.

217
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,200
I would rather die before I would dare
to make any mistake in Shoukang Palace.

218
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,240
Enough. Just let them hurry.

219
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,160
If there's nothing else, don't bother me.

220
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,290
-I'll be reciting the scriptures.
-Yes, Your Highness.

221
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,460
You heard it, get it done by sunset.

222
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,000
-Yes.
-Pay attention to the seams.

223
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,980
Don't let any bug in and disturb
Consort Dowager Yu.

224
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
Hurry up! Quickly.

225
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,400
Looks like it will rain.

226
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
Ma Nao, Fei Cui, hurry!

227
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,190
-Come! Hurry!
-What is it?

228
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,480
Cover the flowers with rain clothes.

229
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,120
-Quickly, go.
-Yes!

230
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,670
You too.

231
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,350
Come on. Hurry up.

232
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,830
Hurry! Hurry!

233
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,030
Hurry up!

234
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,870
-Make haste!
-Yes.

235
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,780
-Help me out.
-Open it up.

236
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,960
Coming.

237
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,600
There, hold it.

238
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,500
Everyone, work faster!

239
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,520
-Cover the place here.
-Yes.

240
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,410
Er Qing!

241
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,980
-Come and help.
-What are you doing here?

242
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,430
Your hand hasn't fully recovered yet.

243
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,840
-You'll make things worse.
-I can't sit still.

244
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,780
-Hurry! Hurry! Get working.
-Yes.

245
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,150
Where's Wei Ying Luo?

246
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,599
Why is she not here when we need her?

247
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,920
I've sent Zhen Zhu for her. Don't worry.

248
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,880
That area too. Flatten it.

249
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,130
Hurry up!

250
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,849
Flatten it out!

251
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,980
Er Qing, Ying Luo isn't in the stockroom.

252
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,060
It will rain soon. Where did she go?

253
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,730
-Forget it. Just go help out.
-Okay.

254
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,829
Hurry up!

255
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,000
I have an urgent matter to
speak to Consort Dowager Yu.

256
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,140
Please inform her.

257
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,600
Consort Dowager is meditating.

258
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,080
No one is allowed to disturb her.

259
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,830
I must see her today.

260
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,440
-You can't go in.
-Who do you think you are?

261
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,880
You dare come here and
ask to see Her Highness?

262
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,940
What? Her Highness feels too guilty
to see me in person?

263
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,210
Wei Ying Luo, heed my advice,

264
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,680
you are in Shoukang Palace.

265
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,210
A servant can't just come and go
as you please in here.

266
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,280
I'll spare you some dignity
seeing you serve in Changchun Palace.

267
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,120
Leave before I chase you out of here.

268
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,140
Consort Dowager Yu,

269
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,120
I know something big about Prince He.

270
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,090
I must report it to you immediately!

271
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,100
Don't stand there. Drag her out!

272
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,290
-Yes.
-Consort Dowager Yu!

273
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,450
Guards!

274
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,960
It concerns your reputation
and Prince He's!

275
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,560
-I have to let you know!  Come out!
-Drag her out!

276
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,620
I must report it to you immediately!

277
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,440
Consort Dowager Yu!

278
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,910
What's going on?

279
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,360
Your Highness, this peasant must
have lost her mind.

280
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,820
She is making a scene in your presence,
I'll remove her at once.

281
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,060
Wei Ying Luo,

282
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,560
have you forgotten my warning for you?

283
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,840
From now on, be mindful
not to raffle with my feathers,

284
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,680
do not upset me in anyway.

285
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,410
If you dare offend me again,

286
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,710
not only will you will get executed,

287
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,780
the whole Wei Clan must die with you!

288
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,760
I didn't forget the warning you gave me.

289
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,380
But my sister died so tragically,

290
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,250
I won't forget that either.

291
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,810
If I can't find her killers,

292
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,920
bring you and your son to justice,

293
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,520
I, Wei Ying Luo, will not die in peace.

294
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,630
Everyone, listen!

295
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,560
On January 10th,

296
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,800
Prince He, trespassed
into the inner palace...

297
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,050
and raped the embroidery maid Man.

298
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,410
That's his first crime.

299
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,150
To cover up her son's crime,
Consort Dowager Yu...

300
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,430
had the innocent victim killed.

301
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,720
That's the second crime.

302
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,530
Is she saying the truth?

303
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,720
Impossible. Violating a handmaiden
means execution.

304
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,350
Prince He is not enough to
have himself killed over pleasure.

305
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,560
The two of them,

306
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,960
one has no shame of
his preposterous manners.

307
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
The other is an utterly hypocrite.

308
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,790
Because I saw it,

309
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,770
they even wanted to sabotage
the evidence and kill me!

310
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,920
Consort Dowager is
the most benevolent person.

311
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,440
She doesn't even eat meat,
why would she kill a girl?

312
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,680
-But she seems very certain.
-Who knows?

313
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,120
She wouldn't dare to barge in here
yelling at us if she wasn't certain of it.

314
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,240
-Shut her up!
-Did you hear it?

315
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,540
Did you hear it?

316
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,360
If she didn't do it,
why would she be afraid of rumours?

317
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,500
Why would she want to silence me?

318
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,030
-Did you all hear it?
-Wait.

319
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,280
The truth will prevail.

320
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,480
Conscience is embodiment of justice.

321
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,140
I've put my faith in Buddha
and been benevolent.

322
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,420
I've never wronged
or killed anyone all my life.

323
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,160
What you said just now
was utter nonsense and absurd!

324
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,920
Wei Ying Luo openly slandered Consort
Dowager Yu, that means execution.

325
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,260
Take her down!

326
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,080
You claim to be religious.

327
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,200
Why don't you swear
in the name of Buddha...

328
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,060
that you never tried to cover up
your son's sins?

329
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,160
That you never killed Man
who was innocent?

330
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,600
That you never abused your power
to trample on others?

331
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,870
Listen,

332
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,490
being a vegetarian and reciting
Buddhist scriptures every day...

333
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,930
won't atone for the blood on your hands.

334
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
If you lie about any of those,

335
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,290
the heavens will surely punish you,

336
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,240
you will be cast to the deepest
abyss of hell!

337
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,300
You will suffer the inferno forever!

338
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
-Is the heaven answering?
-Was she telling the truth?

339
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,170
No way.

340
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,560
I have committed no sins.

341
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,610
My conscience is clear as water.

342
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,630
Accuse me however you like,

343
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,730
I can swear in the name of all gods,

344
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,760
that I've been a kind and
charitable person my entire life,

345
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,320
I've never wronged or killed anyone.

346
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,600
If I lied, I am willing to accept
heaven's punishment.

347
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,660
God of heaven,

348
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,320
please listen to her words,

349
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
each and every word
Consort Dowager just said!

350
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,500
If she did lie in any way,

351
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,370
please punish her on behalf of Buddha!

352
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,240
Wei Ying Luo,

353
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,290
you will be cast into the inferno
of hell if you slander on the innocent!

354
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,730
I'm benevolent, so I won't punish you.

355
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,160
But the palace has rules,

356
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,260
I can't allow you to spout rubbish
and slander an innocent.

357
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,040
No even your master the Empress
can save your neck this time.

358
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,040
-To the Bureau of Internal Affair!
-God in heaven!

359
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,640
I pray to You!

360
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,140
If Consort Dowager Yu
is really the murderer,

361
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,420
please bring her to justice
with Your might!

362
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,140
Bring her to justice with Your might!

363
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,490
She's totally insane!

364
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,120
Show us Your might!

365
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,600
Bring her to justice!

366
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,560
Bring her to justice!

367
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,110
-Consort Dowager!
-Bring her to justice!

368
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,330
Consort Dowager Yu!

369
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,460
Consort Dowager!

370
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,360
Consort Dowager!

371
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,710
-Consort Dowager!
-See for yourselves!

372
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,920
Did you all see it?

373
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,400
Did you see it?

374
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,480
Get the physicians!
Save Consort Dowager Yu!

375
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,880
Go get the physicians!
See for yourselves!

376
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,550
My prayer has reach the heaven!
Justice is served!

377
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,940
It's heaven's will.

378
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,480
It's heaven's will.

379
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,200
It's heaven's will.

380
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,400
Justice is served!

381
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,400
It's heaven's will.

382
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,750
Your Majesty!

383
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,580
Imperial Consort Dowager Yu
has been struck by lightning.

384
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,100
Consort Dowager Yu...

385
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,730
had been a hypocrite...

386
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,210
for all her life.

387
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,880
But from now on,

388
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,360
when people mention her,

389
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,670
she will be known as the vile being...

390
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,080
who enraged the heaven.

391
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,780
A sinner.

392
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,640
Sister,

393
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,360
I remember that you once told me...

394
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,680
handmaiden from previous dynasty...

395
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,810
was not accepted in the new Empire,

396
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,660
they were buried down a well.

397
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,060
I know you disdain
to be buried in the family tomb.

398
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,490
I know you didn't want to leave me.

399
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,360
I'll bury you here then.

400
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,840
Sister,

401
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,980
I hope you'll find peace...

402
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,300
in the afterlife.

403
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,290
What is it?

404
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,160
-What happened?
-Have you heard?

405
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,200
Something big went down in
Shoukang Palace last night.

406
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,470
-What happened?
-Everyone saw it,

407
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Consort Dowager Yu
was struck by lightning.

408
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,280
She must have committed
unspeakable sins and enraged heaven.

409
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,650
How is that possible?

410
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,420
Consort Dowager Yu is
a Buddhist and a kind soul.

411
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,520
She had been putting up an act all along!

412
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,120
Shoukang is in disorder right now.

413
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,400
Chief Li handled her body personally
and ordered the men not to talk about it.

414
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,680
But this is too huge of a story
to cover up.

415
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,680
Now, everyone in the Forbidden City knows.

416
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,600
Your Majesty, did something happen?

417
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,490
Were you there when Shoukang Palace...

418
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,370
was struck by lightning last night?

419
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,530
Yes.

420
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,320
What were you doing there?

421
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,600
I heard that...

422
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,380
Consort Dowager Yu had my sister killed.

423
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,020
I went there to confront her.

424
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,600
And then?

425
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,360
And then, she was struck
by lightning and died.

426
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,990
I came back without any answer.

427
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,520
Are you not going to tell me the truth?

428
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,950
Your Majesty!

429
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,270
I asked Consort Dowager Yu
if she was the killer.

430
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,480
She swore in the name of heaven...

431
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,260
that she committed no sins
nor had she killed anyone.

432
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,490
If she lied, she would go to hell.

433
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,360
As soon as she finished the sentence,

434
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,880
a huge bolt of lightning struck
and she fell down.

435
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,840
Really?

436
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,280
Wei Ying Luo!

437
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,920
How dare you lie to me?

438
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,040
Yes.

439
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,550
I admit it.

440
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,000
I was rude to Consort Dowager Yu.

441
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,130
But my prayer was answered.

442
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,940
the sinner was struck down eventually.

443
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,930
No one else was hurt despite
the lightning struck so close to us.

444
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,600
Only Consort Dowager Yu got punished...

445
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
and killed by the lightning strike.

446
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,320
That proves she did kill someone!

447
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,620
And it enraged the heaven
when she swore.

448
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,180
She was unforgivable!

449
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,010
You...

450
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,390
You are good at denying it.

451
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,000
I don't want to argue with you.

452
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,500
Changchun Palace is huge enough,

453
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,100
but as of now,

454
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,280
we have no place for your insolence!

455
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,050
Your Majesty...

456
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,680
you are banishing me?

457
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,860
Yes.

458
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,750
Starting today,

459
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,380
I no longer need your service.

460
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,920
Go to Labour House.

461
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,900
Reflect on your mistakes!

462
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,320
Your Majesty,

463
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,900
I owe my life to you.

464
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,400
I vowed to be loyal to you
to the day I die.

465
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,590
Don't drive me away.

466
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,960
From now on,

467
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,980
I'll be mindful of every word
I say and action I take.

468
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,260
I will never disrespect
Your Majesty again.

469
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,790
I don't need you to repay me.

470
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,600
Pack your things.

471
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,480
Leave this place at once.

472
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,440
Your Majesty is with child right now.

473
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,240
The others are plotting against you.

474
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,260
Let me stay until your delivery.

475
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,790
If you give birth to a prince,

476
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,850
I'll leave for good.

477
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,370
You will never see me again.

478
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,600
If Your Majesty refuses to hear me out,

479
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,940
I can stop talking.

480
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,250
But please,

481
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,020
let me stay.

482
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,450
Do you even listen to yourself?

483
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,720
You're full of confidence and arrogance.

484
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,990
What?

485
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,280
Do you think without your service here,

486
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,500
I can't take care of myself?

487
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,900
Er Qing and Ming Yu have
served me for many years.

488
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,430
None of them have caused me trouble
or made me worried.

489
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,480
If I let you stay,

490
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,530
you will bring nothing but more troubles.

491
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,790
Leave!

492
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,820
I want you out of here now!

493
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,290
Your Majesty.

494
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,520
Your Majesty is right.

495
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,070
I have...

496
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,170
brought nothing but troubles.

497
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,390
I am too ashamed to stay here.

498
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,700
But I have...

499
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,580
received great kindness from Your Majesty.

500
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,320
I will never forget that.

501
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,720
If it to a day when you need me,

502
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,410
I'm willing to...

503
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,380
give up my life for you...

504
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,030
as a mean to repay you.

505
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,280
Enough!

506
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,000
Leave my sight now.

507
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,440
I...

508
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,840
wish Your Majesty...

509
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,810
stay well and vigorous,

510
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,380
and stay safe for the entire life.

511
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,880
Your Majesty, Consort Dowager Yu
was punished by the heaven.

512
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,160
Everyone saw it.

513
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,190
She was a sinner.

514
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,160
Why must you banish Ying Luo?

515
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,770
All of you, dismiss.

516
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,050
I want to be alone.

517
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,300
Your Majesty.

518
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,600
Get out!

519
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,240
You, go out.

520
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,890
You can't leave!

521
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,040
Ming Yu.

522
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,290
What are you doing?

523
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,600
Wei Ying Luo,

524
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,560
aren't you always so resourceful?

525
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,020
You could have begged
Her Majesty for mercy!

526
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,610
The Empress is kind.

527
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,800
If you keep begging her sincerely,

528
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,360
she gets soft-hearted...

529
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,600
and will allow you to stay.

530
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,900
Ming Yu,

531
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,179
aren't you the one who
wants me to leave the most?

532
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,320
Why are you asking me to stay?

533
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,909
Right.

534
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,300
Once you left,

535
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,889
I can have Guard Fuca to myself!

536
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,300
Yes.

537
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,280
Which is why you should be celebrating.

538
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,090
I really am happy.

539
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,880
I'm happy.

540
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,520
I must be happy.

541
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,570
You're not evil after all.

542
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,040
I can forgive you.

543
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,600
Can you not leave?

544
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,640
Ming Yu,

545
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,360
please don't cry.

546
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,040
You must remember my words.

547
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,580
Her Highness the Empress is too kind.

548
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,950
She always let her guard down
around people.

549
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,570
But here in the Forbidden City,

550
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,200
people are always
putting up a disguise.

551
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,170
Once I left,

552
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,460
you must take good care of the palace.

553
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,250
Check every item...

554
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,720
given to Her Majesty.

555
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,140
Remember,

556
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,410
do not trust anyone easily.

557
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,720
If you ever need help,

558
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,950
feel free to come to me.

559
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,700
What are you afraid of?

560
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,790
We have Er Qing.

561
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,820
Rather than trusting others,

562
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,290
it's better to trust yourself.

563
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,400
Keep that in your mind.

564
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,800
Don't forget it.

565
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:50,510
[Changchun Palace]

566
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,370
[Stop right there!]

567
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,660
[Don't run!]

568
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,450
[Once I catch you...]

569
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,230
What happened last night?

570
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,300
Bai Ling, His Majesty
is asking you a question.

571
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,560
Lightning strike, from heaven!

572
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,320
A beam of light flashed.

573
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,040
And Imperial Consort Dowager is dead!

574
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,120
Gone!

575
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,310
Gone!

576
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,940
Lightning?

577
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,920
From heaven?

578
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,180
Your Majesty, it's common that...

579
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,810
palaces caught on
fire by lightning strikes.

580
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,480
I didn't expect it would also
take Consort Dowager Yu with it.

581
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,120
It's dreadful!

582
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,680
No! It's that woman!

583
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,760
It's her! It must be her!

584
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
Consort Dowager killed her sister.

585
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,100
She cursed her to be struck by lightning.

586
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,000
She's horrible, horrible!

587
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,620
Who is she?

588
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,400
Your Majesty, Bailing isn't
in her mind after witnessing...

589
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,480
Consort Dowager Yu's death by lightning.
She is not making any sense,

590
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,800
don't believe her.

591
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,250
I'm asking you all.

592
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Who is the woman Bai Ling mentioned?

593
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,410
Your Majesty,

594
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,210
it's Her Majesty's servant, Wei Ying Luo.

595
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,560
She confronted Consort Dowager Yu
if Her Highness killed her sister.

596
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,560
The Consort Dowager swore to heaven
that if she did kill anyone,

597
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,160
she's willing to take on
heaven's punishment.

598
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,510
Then, a bolt of lightning...

599
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,200
It's Wei Ying Luo again.

600
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,160
Your Majesty, Consort Dowager Yu
lied to heaven.

601
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,490
-It's heaven's rage.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

602
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,950
I saw it with my eyes.

603
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,400
The lightning struck right after
she finished her words.

604
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,550
Consort Dowager Yu
must have enraged heaven.

605
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,410
That's right...

606
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,430
Greetings,

607
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,400
Your Majesty.

608
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,570
Rise.

609
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,010
Pay respect to your mother.

610
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,600
Mother!

611
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,560
Mother!

612
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,120
Your Majesty, the Emperor is here.

613
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,930
His Majesty seems furious,
something might have happened.

614
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,470
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

615
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,920
You don't seem worried at all.

616
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,860
What will come,

617
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,850
is inevitable.

618
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,850
Li Yu!

619
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,820
-Arrest Wei Ying Luo!
-Yes!

620
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,250
There's no need.

621
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,640
She's not here in my palace.

622
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,930
What do you mean?

623
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,880
Wei Ying Luo had disrespected me.

624
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,650
I was upset with her behaviour,

625
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,930
as punishment,

626
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,990
she was sent to Labour House.

627
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,500
Your Majesty, you're too late.

628
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,880
Looks like you know what happened.

629
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,760
That's why you deliberately
punished her first,

630
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,690
so she could avoid interrogation.

631
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,770
If you're talking about
Consort Dowager Yu passing,

632
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,220
that's most likely a misunderstanding.

633
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,410
Her death has nothing to do with Ying Luo.

634
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,800
Yet what I find the most confusing...

635
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,110
is that you keep defending her.

636
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,050
What magic did she employ...

637
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,540
to bewitch you like a fool?

638
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,340
Even if you sent her to the Labour House,

639
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,200
she will never get away with this!

640
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,400
Your Majesty, don't you want to know
why I never stop defending Wei Ying Luo?

641
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,340
Are you willing to tell me?

642
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,000
Because...

643
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,280
she's my hope.

644
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,360
What did you say?
