1
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,080
Don’t always

2
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,250
lock yourself in Palace of Eternal Peace.

3
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
When you’re free,

4
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,520
go to Palace of Eternal Spring for a visit.

5
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,780
And come to the garden too to look around.

6
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,880
But you must instruct your servants

7
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,470
that you must be accompanied.

8
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Your Majesty,

9
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,130
I will never be able to repay you

10
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,360
for your grace.

11
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,200
I am the Empress.

12
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,720
It's my duty to take care of the imperial harem.

13
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,380
You don’t need to be grateful.

14
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,440
If everyone in the Palace

15
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,000
could be as magnanimous as Your Majesty,

16
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
there wouldn't be so many conflicts.

17
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,560
Consort Yu,

18
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,720
no need to be too fearful.

19
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,880
In this world,

20
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,160
if there are good people,

21
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,960
there are bad people.

22
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,480
As long as you keep a usual mind,

23
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,780
in that case...

24
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,000
Empress!

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,760
What's wrong?

26
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,360
Snowball!

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,560
Empress, look at how adorable Snowball is.

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,520
It’s humanized.

29
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Reward!

30
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,200
Your Majesty, I'm afraid of dogs.

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,460
I'll take my leave now.

32
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,360
Empress,

33
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,240
Her Majesty is here with Consort Yu.

34
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,960
Escort Consort Yu back.

35
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes.

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

37
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,210
I will take my leave.

38
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,600
Wait!

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
How come you are rushing to leave

40
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
after seeing me?

41
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,200
I am not a tiger.

42
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,079
You think I'll bite?

43
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,050
Noble Consort Empress.

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,890
Greetings to you, Noble Consort Empress.

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,160
Your Majesty.

46
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,210
Consort Yu is not feeling well.

47
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,690
We should let her go back for a rest.

48
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,760
I have to say,

49
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,480
Your Majesty,

50
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,410
you have gathered quite a strange lot around you.

51
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,080
Either they are so cowardly like a mouse,

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,000
or they are so bold as to be afraid of nothing.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,400
How weird is that?

54
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,760
Sister Yu,

55
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,760
stay with us and watch Snowball perform.

56
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,880
It's fun.

57
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,760
Empress,

58
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,640
I'm not feeling well. I'll take my leave.

59
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,920
- Don’t come here! - Consort Yu!

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,850
Don’t come here!

61
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,260
Get rid of that dog!

62
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,810
Don’t come here!

63
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:36,900
Go away!

64
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,600
Go away! Go away!

65
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,080
Go!

66
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:39,840
Go!

67
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,800
Consort Yu!

68
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,200
What's to fear about a bad dog?

69
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,060
Come over here!

70
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,120
Wei Yingluo,

71
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,680
how dare you!

72
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:54,290
You dare hurt the favorite dog of Noble Consort Empress?

73
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,040
Check if it’s hurt.

74
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,080
Empress.

75
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,640
How is it?

76
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,280
Empress,

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,520
it has a huge swelling on its abdomen.

78
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,760
You low-down servant

79
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,960
dared hurt my beloved dog.

80
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,800
You’ll pay with your life.

81
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,100
Noble Consort Gao,

82
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,080
I did all that

83
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,960
for your sake.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,960
Nonsense!

85
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,040
You hurt my beloved pet

86
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,320
and you dare to quibble?

87
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,800
Consort Yu

88
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,880
is pregnant with the Emperor’s offspring.

89
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,440
She's especially valuable now.

90
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,520
If your beloved dog

91
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,159
harmed the offspring in Consort Yu's womb,

92
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,340
and if anything bad happened,

93
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,159
some inconsiderate persons

94
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,680
might accuse you of attempting to murder the Emperor’s offspring.

95
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,720
I dare them?

96
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,240
Rumors are more ferocious than a tiger.

97
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,320
There are so many inconsiderate people.

98
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,560
They are always bumping on others for no reason.

99
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,290
If you get hurt because of it, it would be not good.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,720
So,

101
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,800
earlier,

102
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,760
I kicked off that bad dog.

103
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,960
I eliminated the possible disasters that might befall you.

104
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,680
Although I was a bit reckless,

105
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,080
I preserved your reputation.

106
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,240
You…

107
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,680
Just now,

108
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
I saw that dog was behaving well.

109
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,440
How come

110
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,260
it suddenly created a ruckus?

111
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,760
If my guess is right,

112
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,360
I heard this dog

113
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,130
barking wildly.

114
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,680
Go check

115
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
if anything is wrong with it.

116
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,480
Empress,

117
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,220
I didn't find anything wrong.

118
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,600
Should we take it back to our palace and do a thorough check?

119
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,360
Who dares?

120
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,080
If anyone hurts my beloved dog by a hair,

121
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,760
I will tear her apart.

122
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,570
Your Majesty, Noble Consort Empress,

123
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,520
they say that dogs have natural instincts to defend their masters.

124
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,320
They chase after villains as soon as they see them.

125
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,920
So I'm guessing

126
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,360
maybe it was because

127
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,160
Consort Yu was leaving in a rush,

128
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,280
and Snowball misunderstood it.

129
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Sister Yu,

130
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,840
are you alright?

131
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,160
Thank you for your concerns, Consort Jia.

132
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,560
Consort Yu just got scared and will be fine.

133
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,480
You reacted very fast.

134
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,200
You're more nimble than a dog.

135
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,960
Thank you for your praises, Consort Jia.

136
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,600
Escort Consort Yu back to Palace of Eternal Peace.

137
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,520
Yes.

138
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,640
Noble Consort,

139
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,040
Yingluo was right.

140
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
If today your beloved dog

141
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,560
hurt Consort Yu,

142
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,000
this matter

143
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,260
will surely raise a colossal uproar.

144
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,480
In my opinion,

145
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,640
you need to watch over people around you.

146
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,080
If they keep being this incompetent,

147
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
can't even keep watch of one dog

148
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,640
and create troubles again,

149
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,840
I won't tolerate it.

150
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,850
Consort Jia,

151
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,200
how have I treated you?

152
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,680
I came from

153
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,760
a lowly family.

154
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,300
Fourth Prince is not favored.

155
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,520
Without your care,

156
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,920
my son and I

157
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,860
wouldn't have a place to stand in the Palace.

158
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,440
I've always liked your intelligence and quick wit.

159
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,640
Whenever I see any benefit,

160
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,370
I will think of you and your son.

161
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,780
I never mistreated you even a bit.

162
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,920
Yes.

163
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,400
I will forever remember your grace.

164
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,840
Who told you to betray me?

165
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,280
Who told you to use Snowball to harm Consort Yu?

166
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,680
Who gave you the courage?

167
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,080
Noble Consort Empress...

168
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,080
I did that...

169
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,240
I did that

170
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,880
for your sake!

171
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,800
For my sake?

172
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,680
No.

173
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
You did that for your Fourth Prince.

174
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,060
You're afraid that Consort Yu may give birth to a prince

175
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,300
and disturb your beautiful plan.

176
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,850
Empress,

177
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:53,960
yes,

178
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,320
I indeed am afraid

179
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,380
Consort Yu may give birth to a prince.

180
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,520
But I really did that

181
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,880
for your sake!

182
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,120
Empress, you failed in the previous plan

183
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,320
and incurred hatred of Palace of Eternal Peace.

184
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,640
If we don't completely sever this hope of Consort Yu,

185
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,560
we may have unending future troubles!

186
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,720
Please believe me!

187
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,280
Were you really thinking

188
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,840
a dog

189
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,760
could seriously harm someone?

190
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,920
You are right.

191
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,000
How could I be that stupid?

192
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,840
Snowball is just a start.

193
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,840
Empress,

194
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,720
just wait to see a good show.

195
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,400
Consort Yu.

196
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,320
Her Majesty gave me some instructions.

197
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,080
She said that the pearl powder she gave you last time

198
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,480
should have been used up.

199
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,380
She told me to deliver some today.

200
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,200
Yingluo,

201
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,730
you're here.

202
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,240
These days,

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,360
you helped a lot.

204
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,880
After getting traumatized by that bad dog, Consort kept having nightmares.

205
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,480
She needs to take in nerve-calming pills before she can sleep.

206
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,040
But the imperial doctor said it's bad for the Emperor’s offspring,

207
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,440
so she mustn't take much.

208
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,240
Fortunately we have the pearl power

209
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,100
Her Majesty has been delivering.

210
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,380
Or else, the illness of Consort Yu would have worsened.

211
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,450
Fangcao, what's wrong with your hand?

212
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,120
When I was preparing the pearl balls for Consort,

213
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,720
I touched some of the powder.

214
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,180
I'll go wash it off.

215
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,360
Repeat your words.

216
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,320
Yingluo, what's wrong?

217
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,480
I told you to repeat your words!

218
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,600
Consort.

219
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,440
Yingluo,

220
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,760
what's wrong?

221
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,660
Consort, look.

222
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,480
The color of pearl powder is white.

223
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,700
The powder on the nails of Fangcao is clearly light yellow.

224
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,020
This is not the color of pearl powder.

225
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,760
Fangcao,

226
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,720
what did you put

227
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,120
in the pearl balls you prepared?

228
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,720
I don't know why.

229
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,360
The pearl powder was sent by Her Majesty.

230
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,120
This is your plan.

231
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,220
Consort Yu,

232
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,760
this is the pearl powder

233
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,220
delivered by Her Majesty.

234
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,720
Look. Is it of the same color with the powder

235
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,640
on her nails?

236
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,720
Look.

237
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,640
These pearl balls are white on the outside.

238
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
The powder inside

239
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,240
shimmers in the light.

240
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,120
This is not pearl powder.

241
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm not an imperial doctor.

242
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,840
I don’t know what it is.

243
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,480
Pearl powder

244
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,240
doesn’t shimmer.

245
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,320
Shell powder does.

246
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,850
Fangcao,

247
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,440
why did you replace the pearl powder

248
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,560
delivered by Her Majesty?

249
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
I was wrong!

250
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,200
My mother

251
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,680
is sick.

252
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,600
We didn’t have enough money for her treatment.

253
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,240
I didn’t know what to do.

254
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,240
I knew shell powder was cheap

255
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,970
and pearl powder was valuable,

256
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,400
so I stole the pearl powder

257
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,240
and traded it for money.

258
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,200
Consort,

259
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,240
I have meticulously cared for you.

260
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,200
Please spare me.

261
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,480
Fangcao,

262
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,220
you've been serving me for so many years.

263
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,000
If you told me that your mother was sick,

264
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,320
you think I wouldn’t help?

265
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,640
I was muddled.

266
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,960
Consort,

267
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,680
I won't do it again.

268
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
Even you would do such a thing!

269
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,160
I’m disappointed.

270
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
Please forgive me, Consort.

271
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,080
I will do everything I could to repay you in the rest of my life.

272
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,680
Fangcao has served me for so many years.

273
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
She probably didn't mean to hurt me.

274
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,240
We may let it go this time.

275
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,410
Consort, don't believe her so easily.

276
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,090
Replacing pearl powder

277
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,370
with cheap shell powder

278
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,640
might look like theft.

279
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,880
Shell powder is yellow.

280
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,320
Then the balls can’t appear pure white.

281
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,760
But the shell powder balls Fangcao gave you

282
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,420
are snow white on the outside.

283
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,880
The shimmering powder is limited to the inside.

284
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,940
We can’t see the difference unless the ball is crashed.

285
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,720
What did you add in it?

286
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,080
No, I didn't add anything!

287
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,490
We’ll tell if you did

288
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,970
in front of Her Majesty!

289
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,640
Go!

290
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,360
You disloyal servant

291
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,400
dared lie?

292
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,320
That's an additional crime.

293
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,200
Let's see if Her Majesty will skin you

294
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,520
if she learns of it.

295
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,480
- Go!  - No!

296
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,440
No! No!

297
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,640
Go!

298
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,200
I'll tell you! I'll tell you everything!

299
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,720
Say it!

300
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,720
Consort,

301
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,960
Consort Jia instructed me to do this.

302
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,240
What?

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,040
Consort Jia?

304
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,880
Yes.

305
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,200
Since Consort Yi left,

306
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,680
you’ve been the only master left

307
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,600
in Palace of Eternal Peace.

308
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,160
But you’ve kept staying in your bedroom.

309
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,420
Always living in fear.

310
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,050
Consort Jia said

311
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,180
even if you gave birth to a prince,

312
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,880
you would not be favored.

313
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,610
Our Palace of Eternal Peace

314
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,600
would be forgotten forever.

315
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,240
So

316
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,400
even you betrayed me?

317
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,380
A person should move upwards.

318
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,720
Consort Jia promised me that after the task was done,

319
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,880
she'd transfer me to Palace of Gathered Elegance.

320
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,520
No wonder

321
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,180
when Consort ordered you to leave last time,

322
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,099
you were so obedient and left.

323
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,520
No wonder that day at the garden,

324
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,760
when you were the person nearest to Consort,

325
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,480
you pretended to be afraid of dogs.

326
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,640
So from the start,

327
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,560
you have been bribed.

328
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,829
Unfaithful.

329
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,880
Consort,

330
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,109
I had no choice.

331
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,800
Consort Jia has Noble Consort Gao behind her.

332
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,260
Who would dare offend her?

333
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
What did you add to the shell powder?

334
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
To change the color of shell powder,

335
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,480
you must wash it with dye.

336
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,130
Consort Yu is pregnant.

337
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,770
Dyes are poisonous.

338
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,560
Would she give birth to a healthy child after long-term taking?

339
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,040
How evil is that!

340
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,080
Fangcao!

341
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,280
How dare you!

342
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,440
Aren't you afraid this matter may get exposed?

343
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,120
Even if it gets exposed,

344
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,860
they have two choices as a backup.

345
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,800
Either they would say that the servants in the Imperial Household Department

346
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,660
replaced pearl powder with low-grade shell powder

347
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,280
and reaped profits from it.

348
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,200
Or they would say the pearl powder was from Her Majesty.

349
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,360
Blame everything on Her Majesty.

350
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,240
After all,

351
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,420
it was Her Majesty who invited you

352
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,000
to tour the Imperial Garden.

353
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,640
And you started taking in pearl powder

354
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,640
after you got startled by Snowball.

355
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,240
How did they know

356
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,560
Her Majesty would give me pearl powder?

357
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,340
Not only the pearl powder,

358
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,330
but also the ginseng

359
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,420
and the nerve-calming pills.

360
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,160
As long as Fangcao is around,

361
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,620
would they worry about the chance to make a move?

362
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
I'm going to report it to Her Majesty

363
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,000
and ask her to punish Consort Jia immediately!

364
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,530
- Consort. - Consort, wait.

365
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,130
Fangcao,

366
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,660
when Consort Jia gave you the powder,

367
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,300
were there any witnesses?

368
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,360
No.

369
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,740
Without any evidence,

370
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,810
if you rashly make a complaint,

371
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,810
you can’t strike down Consort Jia,

372
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,440
but will invite yourself more trouble.

373
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,120
What should we do now?

374
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,600
To prevent Consort Jia from making any more evil attacks,

375
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,120
you must keep this disloyal servant

376
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,760
by your side.

377
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,680
So we can deceive Consort Jia into thinking

378
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,540
you're still taking in the poisonous shell powder.

379
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
You're saying...

380
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,940
In half a month,

381
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,280
tell Consort Jia

382
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,460
the shell powder has been used up.

383
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,000
Ask her for some more.

384
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,240
Understand?

385
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,960
Are you blind?

386
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,690
Don’t you know who he is?

387
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,520
Indeed. Don’t you look around on the road?

388
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,450
Are you alright?

389
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah.

390
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,000
This lad!

391
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,280
Wait.

392
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,520
What do you want to do?

393
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,780
Isn't this Brother Chunwang?

394
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,840
When he was following Chamberlain Zhao,

395
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,600
he was so impressive.

396
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,360
How come he’s in such a pitiful state?

397
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,290
Emptying commodes?

398
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,120
Don't you know it?

399
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,210
He smuggled items out of the Palace

400
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,160
and got lashed 100 times by the Office of Punishment.

401
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,000
He’s a eunuch of eunuchs now.

402
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,240
This little thing is quite pitiful.

403
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,800
No wonder Chamberlain Zhao liked you.

404
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,960
Even I

405
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,840
can’t help touching you.

406
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,880
Fuck off!

407
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,880
You bastard,

408
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,250
you can’t even do a task like this well?

409
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,200
Quickly clean it!

410
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,290
- Indeed. - Clean it! - Hurry up!

411
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,200
Why should I clean it?

412
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,300
Lick it.

413
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,360
Lick all those dirty things

414
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,480
off the ground.

415
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,840
Lick it!

416
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,160
Let me go!

417
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
If you don't lick it clean,

418
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,800
I'll report it to the chamberlain.

419
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,600
I'll tell him you deliberately dirtied the corridor of the Palace

420
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,260
and let him take off your head!

421
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,890
What are you waiting for? Beat him!

422
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,560
Go!

423
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,800
Beat him! Use all your strength!

424
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,440
Bastard!

425
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,720
Beat him!

426
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,290
Enough. Enough.

427
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,760
Don't kill him.

428
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,560
Let's go.

429
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,040
Let's go.

430
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Bastard!

431
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,560
Let’s go.

432
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,370
My dog ancestor, don’t be so picky.

433
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,400
What you eat is the best dried meat.

434
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,760
I even added some sesame oil.

435
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,290
That’s better than my food.

436
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,280
Eat. Eat.

437
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,600
Go away. I’ll eat it.

438
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,730
Who’s there?

439
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,850
Who's there!

440
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,660
What scoundrel would steal the dog food?

441
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,490
Keep up. Keep up.

442
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,160
Hold it stably. Hold it stably.

443
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,440
What are they doing?

444
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,680
What's going on?

445
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,840
What's in those wooden casks?

446
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,440
I don't know. They are making it so mysterious.

447
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,640
What could it be?

448
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,820
They are covered by red cloth.

449
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,780
So many of them.

450
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,040
Lightly. Lower it down.

451
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Lower it down.

452
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,920
Lightly. Lightly.

453
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,640
Greetings to you, Your Majesties.

454
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,400
Your Majesties,

455
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,720
we have delivered the tributes.

456
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,080
Your Majesty,

457
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,920
these are...

458
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,760
Uncover them.

459
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,720
Yes.

460
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,120
Uncover them.

461
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,360
Lychee?

462
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,000
How could there be lychee trees in this season?

463
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,810
This is "March red",

464
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,720
the lychee species that matures the earliest.

465
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,360
Viewed from Chang'an, Mount Li seemed a piece of embroidery;

466
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,960
Countless gates opened one after another on a hill-top.

467
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,160
At the horse raising red dust the imperial concubine smiled;

468
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,090
No one knew it was for the lychee fruit it had brought.

469
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,120
Your Majesty,

470
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,810
before, lychees were transported by horses.

471
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,360
Now,

472
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,420
these lychee trees...

473
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,280
Fujian is a thousand li away from the capital.

474
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,760
If transported by the land route,

475
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,960
these lychees would have lost their freshness after arriving in the capital.

476
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,160
What's fun in that?

477
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,530
So I ordered them

478
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,600
to put the lychee trees with soil in wooden casks

479
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,040
once they bear fruit.

480
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,720
They could arrive in the capital in a month's time

481
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,880
by the water route.

482
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,820
At this time, the fruit would be ripe, fresh and flavorful.

483
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,120
This year,

484
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,920
the Fujian Governor gave a total of 100 casks as tribute.

485
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,050
After rewarding some high officials,

486
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,720
I ordered people to choose the best lychee trees

487
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,440
and deliver them to Palace of Eternal Spring.

488
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

489
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,920
Your Majesty,

490
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,300
I was also planning

491
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,880
to hold a tea party.

492
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,380
These lychees came at the right time.

493
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,730
If you like them,

494
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,600
my efforts are well paid.

495
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,440
Your Majesty, these lychee trees are very precious.

496
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,770
You can leave them to me.

497
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,560
Yingluo.

498
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,200
Yingluo!

499
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Your Majesty.

500
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,210
These lychees are very precious. Take good care of them.

501
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,160
Your Majesty, I could be careless.

502
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,320
I might not be able to care about them.

503
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,000
In this palace, I trust you the most

504
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,280
except Erqing.

505
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,360
Erqing has to attend to me

506
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,760
and doesn’t have the time.

507
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,420
Help me take good care of them.

508
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,810
Don't slack off.

509
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,920
I won’t.

510
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
Your Majesty,

511
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,920
when do you think is the best time

512
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,400
to hold the lychee party?

513
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,640
You can hold it

514
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,820
whenever you want.

515
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,640
Li Yu,

516
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
remember the items Her Majesty needs.

517
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,840
Urge the Imperial Household Department to deliver them as soon as possible.

518
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,440
Yes.

519
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,320
Erqing,

520
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,680
look at her.

521
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,560
She has won the favor of Her Majesty so quickly.

522
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,680
What trick did she play?

523
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,440
Mingyu.

524
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,080
How long has she been in Palace of Eternal Spring?

525
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,880
In so short a time…

526
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,080
Enough. Enough.

527
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,520
Let's do

528
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,920
whatever our master tells us to.

529
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,780
There are a lot of things that we can never question.

530
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,440
Chamberlain Wu, may I ask

531
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,770
how many lychees there are in these trees?

532
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,040
We selected the smallest species

533
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,900
for convenient transportation.

534
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,080
In the 100 trees that were transported,

535
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,680
a total of 895 lychees were recorded in Fujian.

536
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,080
No one knows how many of them fell off

537
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,960
on the way here.

538
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,000
Honestly, regarding the number, we currently...

539
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,040
I did some rough counting.

540
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,760
There are three casks of trees and a total of 48 lychees.

541
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,320
Yes.

542
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,080
Chamberlain Wu, could you count it again

543
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,680
so we can make our hand-over?

544
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,360
Miss Yingluo, you are so young,

545
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,120
but you do things very appropriately.

546
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,560
Thank you, Chamberlain Wu.

547
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,360
The lychees were transported from a thousand li away.

548
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,020
They are extremely precious.

549
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,920
Let's verify the number

550
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,880
in case we may disagree to the number

551
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,640
in the future.

552
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,640
That’ll be bad.

553
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,160
What are you waiting for?

554
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,080
Quickly count the lychees.

555
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,560
Yes.

556
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,440
See?

557
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,160
While you are complaining,

558
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,080
she has already done part of the task.

559
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,940
Why do you think

560
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,170
Her Majesty should rely on you?

561
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,640
It really worked?

562
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,360
Yes.

563
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,620
Fangcao said Consort Yu kept having nightmares

564
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,170
and abdominal pain.

565
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,240
She had to constantly take in pearl powder to calm her nerves.

566
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,480
Fangcao secretly replaced it

567
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,080
and no one has discovered it.

568
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,000
Our Snowball just barked a few times

569
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,520
and she got scared like that.

570
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,400
She's useless.

571
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,600
First, Consort Yi died.

572
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,280
Then, she was almost killed.

573
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,810
Plus Snowball's provocation,

574
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,480
she surely would be seriously scared.

575
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,520
I think

576
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,010
she won't even dare go to the Imperial Garden.

577
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,560
What else did she say?

578
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,480
Fangcao said

579
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,660
the shell powder you gave her was almost used up.

580
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,960
She needed some more.

581
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,280
I promised her that after reporting it to you,

582
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,140
I would quickly deliver it to her.

583
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,280
Go ahead. Be careful.

584
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,040
Yes.

585
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,000
Wait.

586
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,640
Empress, do you have more instructions?

587
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,640
You said Consort Yu had serious abdominal pain.

588
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,600
She said that Consort Yu had frequent severe abdominal pains.

589
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,480
They asked Director Zhang of Imperial Hospital to check her.

590
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,760
He prescribed pregnancy preserving medicine and didn't notice anything wrong.

591
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,560
He thought that it was caused by psychological trauma.

592
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,160
The dosage of pearl powder was also increased.

593
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,440
Her symptoms are so obvious?

594
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,980
That's what Fangcao said.

595
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,440
If you have no more additional instructions,

596
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,480
I'll go deliver her shell powder.

597
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,360
Wait.

598
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,900
Tell her that shell powder

599
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,240
must be meticulously made.

600
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
We still need two more days to prepare it.

601
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,800
Tell her to meet you

602
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,560
during the lychee party.

603
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,640
But

604
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,000
we have shell powder.

605
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,200
Just do as I said.

606
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,040
Yes.

607
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,720
What's wrong?

608
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,690
Yingluo,

609
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,040
why don't we pick the fruit now,

610
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,560
clean them, and deliver them during the lychee party?

611
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,400
Master told me

612
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,740
to pick them on site tomorrow,

613
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,980
so they would be fresh.

614
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,120
I also want to taste these lychees.

615
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,520
Too bad

616
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,380
each of them has been assigned

617
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,960
to a specific consort.

618
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,740
This is the yearly tribute of Fujian.

619
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,460
Certainly they are precious.

620
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,730
If you really want to eat it,

621
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,530
after you get out of the palace,

622
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,680
you can go to Fujian by a boat.

623
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,200
Eat as much as you want.

624
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,600
Isn't that more fun?

625
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,760
That’s a bold idea!

626
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,130
You can leave them to me.

627
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,240
I'll verify it again.

628
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,960
Yingluo.

629
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,480
Yingluo,

630
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
you said that as long as I make up for what I did,

631
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,960
I will be forgiven.

632
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,160
Is that true?

633
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,170
You have my word.

634
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Consort Jia said she'd let Ah-Shuang

635
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
give me some shell powder tomorrow.

636
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,680
You only said Consort Yu was taking in pearl powder

637
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,490
and didn't mention anything else?

638
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,160
You didn't add any more details?

639
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,360
Add any more details?

640
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,200
No.

641
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,880
You are too eager to make up for what you did.

642
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,010
Too much is as bad as too little.

643
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,200
Don't worry. I surely didn't make any mistake.

644
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,360
But you must do as you said.

645
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,320
Ok.

646
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,980
I'll report it to Her Majesty.

647
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,360
We’ll catch the turtle in the jar.

648
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Ungrateful.

649
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,080
Don't you remember how much Empress helped you

650
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,280
when you were in need?

651
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,640
Forget it.

652
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,920
Empress, how can we forget it?

653
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,400
When Consort Ying had such austere days,

654
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,720
you gave her half of your allowance.

655
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,040
You didn't even forget to send her food.

656
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,040
Why is it so hard

657
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,380
to ask her for help?

658
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,800
Zhen'er, stop it.

659
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,760
Consort Chun, this is...

660
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,800
Sister, you're going everywhere to borrow money.

661
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,320
But most people you helped

662
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,320
are of a lower rank.

663
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,760
Even if they want to help, they are not able to do it.

664
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,090
Other consorts hate you

665
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,980
because you have an illustrious and respected name in the Palace.

666
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,280
They surely will not support you.

667
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,670
I think

668
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,480
after being refused

669
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,920
for three days,

670
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,690
you should know what to do.

671
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,440
So

672
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,880
I bring you some money.

673
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,670
Empress, you don't need to worry about it anymore.

674
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,670
We now have money.

675
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,030
Consort Chun,

676
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,000
what do you mean

677
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,960
by giving this money?

678
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,159
Sister, don't worry.

679
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,210
I’m not like Noble Consort Gao.

680
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,960
I won’t require you to disobey your heart

681
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,360
and harm other people.

682
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,120
But from the moment I accept this money,

683
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,890
I will never have my own stand anymore.

684
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,600
I must always

685
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,160
stand on the side of Her Majesty.

686
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,160
Her Majesty is virtuous, wise, and magnanimous.

687
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,420
She's kind and gentle.

688
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,530
Why can’t you stand on her side?

689
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,640
When people are caught in the whirlpool of fighting,

690
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,360
they will just keep falling deeper.

691
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,160
It will be harder and harder to differentiate right and wrong.

692
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,220
They will keep lowering their limit.

693
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,240
In the end, when left with no other choice,

694
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,500
they will harm others.

695
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,840
So the day I entered the Palace, I swore

696
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,740
I would never get involved in any fights.

697
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,960
I'll only guard my Hall of Receiving Celestial FavorPalace of Receiving Celestial Favor

698
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,420
and spend my days quietly.

699
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,620
If I accept your offer,

700
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,780
that's going against my initial intention.

701
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,600
But you need money, don’t you?

702
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,600
Yes.

703
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,080
Changshou is in prison,

704
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,700
waiting for me to save him.

705
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,740
Sister, we entered the palace together.

706
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,080
We've accompanied each other for so many years.

707
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,600
Let’s count it as a loan.

708
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,360
I would return it to you twice the amount.

709
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,080
No,

710
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,360
three times.

711
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,200
Is that ok?

712
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,960
Sister,

713
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,820
what I'm lending you is not money,

714
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,760
but favor.

715
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,600
If you insist on refusing it,

716
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
I can only apologize.

717
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,920
Empress, we can't delay any more.

718
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,560
Otherwise, Young Master will be dead.

719
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,760
No.

720
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,460
I can't take it.

721
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,840
Empress!

722
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,240
Yuhu,

723
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,240
let's go.

724
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,530
Imperial Consort Chun!

725
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,120
Imperial Consort Chun!

726
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,450
Imperial Consort Chun!

727
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,970
Empress, what should we do now?

728
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,360
Imperial Consort Xian is really a wooden-head.

729
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,690
No one can persuade her.

730
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,450
Go to Palace of Eternal Spring.

731
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,240
It's late.

732
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,770
Why are you going to Palace of Eternal Spring?

733
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,080
Let's go.

734
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,200
Greetings to you, Your Majesty!

735
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,360
Forego the formalities.

736
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,540
Everyone, please take a seat.

737
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,360
Fujian offered some lychees as tribute.

738
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,440
In this tea party,

739
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,600
we’ll have a taste of them.

740
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,720
His Majesty loves Her Majesty so much.

741
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,920
I haven't seen even one lychee,

742
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,720
but he sent you the trees.

743
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,880
It's not the first time

744
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,840
His Majesty has shown how much he loves Her Majesty.

745
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,360
Noble Consort Gao, you're not used to it?

746
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,280
Where are the lychees?

747
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,540
Noble Consort Gao, a moment, please.

748
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Lychees can cause excessive internal heat.

749
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,120
Let's drink some light chrysanthemum tea first.

750
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,000
Help yourselves.

751
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,400
Sister Nalan,

752
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,520
are lychees really that precious?

753
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,680
Certainly.

754
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,040
They are transported here from Fujian

755
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,170
after crossing mountains and waters.

756
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,440
I heard that a lot of lychees have fallen off

757
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,520
because they are not used to the new environment.

758
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,960
The rest will be distributed

759
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,960
to Empress Dowager, Her Majesty, and the concubines.

760
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,080
And those highly-favored officials and relatives.

761
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,880
It’ll be a great fortune

762
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
if we can eat one.

763
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,890
You dare secretly switch the pearl powder of Consort Yu?

764
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,760
You're attempting to kill the Emperor’s offspring.

765
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,690
What did you say?

766
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,850
You are a close maid of Consort Jia.

767
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,540
If we catch you doing that,

768
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,140
Consort Jia can't escape.

769
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,920
At this point,

770
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,610
what else do you have to say?

771
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,580
Sorry, Sister Ah-Shuang.

772
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,810
I've told them everything.

773
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,080
You think

774
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,720
Consort Jia ordered me

775
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,960
to switch the pearl powder of Consort Yu?

776
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,840
Isn't that so?

777
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,810
This is a blessing pouch

778
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,120
Consort Jia made

779
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,120
for the future prince.

780
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,800
It only has some fragrant herbs inside.

781
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,690
Impossible.

782
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,800
How come?

783
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,840
Consort Jia is really vigilant.

784
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,560
She already prepared for this.

785
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,360
Wei Yingluo,

786
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,560
if you have no evidence,

787
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,840
don't make irresponsible remarks.

788
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,520
When you walk at night too often,

789
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,920
you’ll bump into a ghost.

790
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,320
You've escaped this time.

791
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,520
What about next time?

792
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,040
You...

793
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,720
Wei Yingluo!

794
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,720
Don't go!

795
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,820
Explain yourself!

796
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,320
What's there to explain?

797
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,200
You tried to catch me for no reason.

798
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,930
Don't you need to explain that?

799
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,760
Did I hit you

800
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,480
or did I tie you up?

801
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,560
You didn't use force,

802
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,080
but you slandered me.

803
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,000
You must apologize to me.

804
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,920
Also,

805
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,130
you must apologize to Consort Jia.

806
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,900
Why are you trying to trap me here?

807
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,800
We need to talk about it, of course.

808
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,720
Consort Jia asked you to draw me away.

809
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,780
Now, you're trying to delay the time.

810
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,140
What are you planning?

811
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,240
What do you mean, draw you away?

812
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,880
You followed me here.

813
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,740
You falsely accused me first.

814
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,720
Wei Yingluo!

815
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,320
Wei Yingluo, you're a coward!

816
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,600
You don’t even dare talk to me!

817
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,400
Wei Yingluo!

818
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,280
Fence sitter!

819
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,160
I'll get even with you later.

820
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,720
Consort Jia has noticed something was wrong.

821
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,120
Why did she ask Fangcao to meet her servant?

822
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,160
Unless...

823
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,770
Why are you running around?

824
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,080
Empress, don't worry.

825
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,650
Everything is in place.

826
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,610
I won't ever see that low-down servant again, will I?

827
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,680
I promise

828
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,120
she won’t bother you again.
