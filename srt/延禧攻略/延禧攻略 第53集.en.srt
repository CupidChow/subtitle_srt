[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 53]

3
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,810
I'm just an incompetent woman.

4
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,830
I can't even protect my own child,

5
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,620
let alone frame other people.

6
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,580
But you framed Noble Consort Chun.

7
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,479
You sided with her...

8
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,450
and chose to make me your enemy.

9
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,780
When she thought she had it all,

10
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,050
you stabbed her in the back.

11
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,600
You managed to bring her down.

12
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,960
You knew...

13
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,270
The Fifth Prince was so talented...

14
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,530
and cherished by His Majesty all along.

15
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,920
Noble Consort Chun
tried to get rid of me...

16
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,079
by hurting the Fifth Prince
in such an evil way.

17
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:37,540
His Majesty would surely be
infuriated upon finding this out.

18
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,320
Consort Yu,

19
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,990
So, youâ€¦

20
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,930
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

21
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,860
His Majesty almost had you killed.

22
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,840
If I told His Majesty...

23
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,600
I befriend Noble Consort Chun...

24
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,660
because I wanted to
gather evidence of her crimes,

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,610
His Majesty would surely think...

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,960
you and I had joined hands to set her up.

27
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,530
Which is why...

28
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,970
there was no other way.

29
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,320
Consort Yu.

30
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,440
You are too foolish.

31
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,060
Ying Luo.

32
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,140
I have always been a weak woman.

33
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,000
I had to watch as my best friend...

34
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,890
died in front of me,

35
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,470
but I could not avenge her.

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,810
If it hadn't been for you and
the late Empress helping me all the way,

37
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,620
I wouldn't have been able to save Yong Qi.

38
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,200
Though I am weak,

39
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,530
but I understand...

40
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,670
that kindness received...

41
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,430
must be repaid in times fold.

42
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,250
You once helped me.

43
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,380
I shall repay your kindness even
if it costs me my life.

44
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,550
I am not smart enough.

45
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,000
This is the only method
I could come up with.

46
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,070
In order to gain
Noble Consort Chun's trust,

47
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,130
I had to hurt you.

48
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,140
I hope you don't blame me.

49
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,040
You are not weak at all.

50
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,790
You are the bravest woman I've ever seen.

51
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,409
Ying Luo.

52
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,750
After today,

53
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,780
I will never be allowed to
return to the Forbidden City.

54
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,370
There's a person...

55
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,570
whom I must entrust to you.

56
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,330
Say no more,

57
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,320
I understand.

58
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,360
Consort Yu.

59
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,930
Please understand...

60
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,260
my feelings as a mother.

61
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,980
Accept this bow from me.

62
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,710
It's getting late. We need to go.

63
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,550
Take care.

64
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,400
Why are you crying again?

65
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,770
It's the wind.

66
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,900
Greetings to Your Majesty.

67
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,520
You're making a kite again?

68
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,050
Yes. I'm making a kite.

69
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,130
Stop making it.

70
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,230
Your hand was injured.

71
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,500
Bamboo strips can easily hurt you again.

72
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,970
Don't ever make these again.

73
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,940
-Then I'll have others make them for me.
-I said,

74
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,440
no more kite.

75
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,040
-Why?
-No reason.

76
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,610
I taught you to play the qin before,

77
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,400
but you said the qin wasn't good enough.

78
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,360
So I commanded for the search of "Sound
of Moon Dew" I used for learning.

79
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,500
From now on, you can use that.

80
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,700
All right?

81
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,510
Move these things away.

82
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,440
Stop.

83
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,530
Ying Luo, if we don't take them away,

84
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,880
how can I give you the qin lesson?

85
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,890
Your Majesty, I don't want to learn.

86
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,330
My interest lies with kite making.

87
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,560
Consort Ling, this qin was brought
from the Summer Palace for you.

88
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,120
Others don't even get to touch it.

89
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,250
Safe journey, Your Majesty.

90
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,200
His Majesty came here in a good mood.

91
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,440
Why must Your Highness upset him?

92
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,260
Ying Luo, you knew cause of
Noble Consort Chun's death.

93
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,080
You should not draw any attention.

94
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,780
You need to stop making kites.

95
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,480
So if I don't make kites,

96
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,890
will the others not suspect me?

97
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,549
You are trying to do the opposite?

98
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,970
I was so scared for you.

99
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,600
I thought you were ignoring His Majesty
and going against him.

100
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,400
"Sound of Moon Dew".

101
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,670
It is a great qin.

102
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,530
Take it inside.

103
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,970
It's a precious thing, don't break it.

104
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,680
What in the world are you trying to do?

105
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,290
You heard what Ming Yu said.

106
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,940
Acting the opposite way.

107
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,750
You clearly know Noble Consort Chun
was killed with kite thread.

108
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,600
Seeing you with kite thread would
surely upset His Majesty.

109
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,060
You were making him angry on purpose...

110
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,610
and pushing him away.

111
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,330
Yes.

112
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,300
It was so hard to gain the royal favour.

113
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,560
Why should I distance
myself from His Majesty?

114
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,410
Get rid of it.

115
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,080
Yes.

116
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,250
Your Majesty.

117
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,340
Though Consort Ling is stubborn,

118
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,530
she doesn't seem like someone so cruel.

119
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,960
I said too much.

120
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,820
I'm angry because she doesn't even care.

121
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,380
She won't even explain anything.

122
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,020
She is so certain that I will protect her.

123
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,850
Your Majesty, once Consort Ling
comes to her senses,

124
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,410
I'm sure she'll come to apologize.

125
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,500
If she comes here, keep her outside.

126
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,130
His Majesty came out of
Yanxi Palace looking upset.

127
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,560
The handmaidens and
the eunuchs saw it.

128
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,970
Of all the consorts, only Wei Ying Luo is
bold enough to go against His Majesty.

129
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,800
Sooner or later,

130
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,700
His Majesty's patience
for her will be gone,

131
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,870
and her happy days will end.

132
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,550
However,

133
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,890
this is a great opportunity.

134
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,030
Sister Nalan,

135
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,050
what are you going to do?

136
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,800
She pushed His Majesty away herself.

137
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,020
She can't blame me
for seizing the opening.

138
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,760
Your Majesty, should I knock the door?

139
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,940
Great!

140
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,120
She shutting me out on purpose!

141
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,640
Your Majesty!

142
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,890
Such an ingrate!

143
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,390
Hurry and follow!

144
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,050
Your Majesty.

145
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,770
Your Highness, will this flower
really bloom tonight?

146
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,900
I think it should be these couple of days.

147
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,960
Though I am not sure
if it will bloom tonight.

148
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,460
If we are not sure, then let's go back.

149
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,290
Waiting so long for a flower
is not worth the while.

150
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,960
What if you catch a cold?

151
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,860
A clear tune of high
tones isn't so easily played.

152
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,840
Elegant epiphyllum does not bloom easily.

153
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,400
Since it's not easily bloomed,
it's worth the wait.

154
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,280
That must be Sui Yuan's poem.

155
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,690
I am grateful for Your Majesty's arrival.

156
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,550
Rise.

157
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,280
You are still in
the Imperial Garden at this hour,

158
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,680
all for this epiphyllum?

159
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,120
Yes.

160
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,650
Sui Yuan travelled the world
and his poetry is legendary.

161
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,810
I've heard of this poem,

162
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,040
but I've never seen a real epiphyllum.

163
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,930
I can't help but yearn for it.

164
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,380
Now Yunnan has sent in one as tribute,

165
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,660
so I wanted to take a look
during its blooming season.

166
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,760
I never thought I would
disturb Your Majesty.

167
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,620
You didn't disturb me.

168
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,510
I actually disturbed you.

169
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,870
It's blooming. It's blooming!

170
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,430
Your Majesty, look!
The flower's bloomed!

171
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,960
You really like it so much?

172
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,510
I really do!

173
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,060
Your Majesty, smell it.

174
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,340
There seems to be
a sandalwood fragrance too.

175
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,170
In the Lotus Sutra, Buddhist beads
after cremation done by Buddhist teaching,

176
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,650
are as excellent as a basin of pipe vine,

177
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,920
appearing in time.

178
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,560
Today I got to see
this epiphyllum flourish,

179
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,170
all thanks to Your Majesty's
grace and presence.

180
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,850
I got to see it thanks to you.

181
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,580
Li Yu.

182
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,810
I'm here.

183
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,310
This beautiful scenery of
flowers calls for a graceful tune.

184
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,880
Go to Yanxi Palace,

185
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,640
and retrieve "Sound of Moon Dew".

186
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,010
I will enjoy the pleasant moon tonight
with Imperial Concubine Shu.

187
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,120
Your Majesty, Consort Ling might
already be asleep.

188
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,850
Then knock the door down!

189
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,630
Yes.

190
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,580
Who is it?

191
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,890
I will go check it immediately, Master.

192
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,060
Who is it?

193
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,970
Retrieval of the qin
by His Majesty's order.

194
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,210
Open the door!

195
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,280
Supervisor Li, what brings you here?

196
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,240
We have order to retrieve the qin.

197
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,210
Did you get the qin back?

198
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,070
Yes. I got it back.

199
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,280
Now, I am waiting for her to come.

200
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,210
De Sheng said Concubine Shu
has written a new song,

201
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,680
she invited His Majesty to listen to it.

202
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,840
His Majesty is spending
the night with her.

203
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,250
He even asked for the qin he gave you
to be taken back.

204
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,960
It's obviously for her.

205
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,640
How are you not worried at all?

206
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,970
That's it.

207
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,580
I'll help you clean up.

208
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,840
Just go to Yangxin Hall
and win His Majesty back.

209
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,160
I'm not going.

210
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,330
Ying Luo.

211
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,010
I'm tired.

212
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,560
I need sleep.

213
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,440
Your Majesty, Concubine Shu is waiting.

214
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,640
Your Majesty.

215
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,950
It's midnight.

216
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,960
Shouldn't you be sleeping in Yangxin Hall?

217
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,480
Why are you here?

218
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,320
I just learned a new piece,

219
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,940
so I came to play it for you.

220
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,510
Your Majesty is very humorous.

221
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,400
Why play music in the middle of the night?

222
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,730
Does Your Majesty have something
to tell me?

223
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,790
You do realize your own mistake.

224
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,480
Your Majesty suspects I killed
Noble Consort Chun.

225
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,339
You wouldn't even let me
make kites anymore.

226
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,359
I am reflecting my mistake in seclusion.

227
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
I know.

228
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,790
You didn't kill her.

229
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,860
But everyone in the palace says otherwise.

230
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,390
With your temper,

231
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,860
you wouldn't care to
crush a defeated enemy.

232
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,710
Not to mention...

233
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,560
Noble Consort Chun was already
banished to the Cold Palace,

234
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,760
she lost everything.

235
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,610
You would let her live for a few years,

236
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,700
so she can be tormented for a while.

237
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,990
Your Majesty,

238
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,340
you are complimenting me...

239
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,630
or scorning me?

240
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,850
Wei Ying Luo,

241
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,620
to me,

242
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,450
you are just petty.

243
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,440
You knew I didn't do it,

244
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,420
but why were you angry?

245
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,120
Because you didn't explain.

246
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,820
What's wrong with no explanation?

247
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,160
Which means...

248
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,780
you don't care how I think about you.

249
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,160
So I am very unhappy about it.

250
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,420
Iâ€¦

251
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,660
I kept thinking today.

252
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,180
I can't spoil you too much.

253
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,280
It won't end well.

254
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,730
But I still came here nonetheless.

255
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,320
Wei Ying Luo.

256
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,970
I lost count of the rules I broke
just to save you.

257
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,030
I have gone back against my words
so many times for you.

258
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,720
That is not a good sign.

259
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,930
It's very bad.

260
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,650
I...

261
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,120
don't like exceptions.

262
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,440
I like things to be normal.

263
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,120
So you must behave yourself,

264
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,120
and don't always upset me.

265
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,490
Or else one day, if crossed the line,

266
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,050
I'll behead you for real!

267
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,710
Your Majesty.

268
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,740
You coming here,

269
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,660
will make Imperial Concubine Shu
hate me even more.

270
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,670
-Why?
-Imperial Concubine Shu complains...

271
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,200
when Your Majesty
summons her for bed service,

272
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,400
you usually ended up changing your mind
and spend the night with me instead.

273
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,960
After today,

274
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,640
she would want my head for it.

275
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,100
I almost forgot about her.

276
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,000
Li Yu.

277
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,940
Your Majesty.

278
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,000
Go and tell Imperial Concubine Shu
I can't keep her company tonight.

279
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,940
You escort her back yourself,

280
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,310
and gift that epiphyllum to her.

281
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,890
Yes.

282
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,550
Your Majesty.

283
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,260
So you won't give
this qin to her anymore?

284
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,100
Your Majesty.

285
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,240
Youâ€¦

286
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,240
The Ritual for the Silk God?

287
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,970
The Empress makes offering to the Silk God
to have better silk production.

288
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,230
It's an old tradition.

289
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,600
The Imperial Household Department
has the tools...

290
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,520
for mulberry leaf picking
at the Jiaotai Hall.

291
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,050
We will proceed with the ritual after
the Empress Dowager granted us permission.

292
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,140
Eastern Zhejiang has a major drought.
Shandong is plagued by locust swarm.

293
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,480
I don't think the ritual is needed.

294
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,680
Empress Dowager, because of the suffering
from all of the disasters everywhere,

295
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,820
I wish to make some efforts...

296
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,190
to encourage the people
to cultivate more silkworms...

297
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,440
as a mean to pray for
prosperity next year.

298
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,770
Such has been our practice
for many years.

299
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,750
When Empress Rong Yin was alive,

300
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,000
she had prepared the ritual
with grandeur every year.

301
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,640
Since you were promoted as Empress,

302
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,090
we've never carried it out again.

303
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,390
I know you think it's unfair.

304
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,120
But there happens to be
a great drought this year.

305
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,860
The Ritual for the Silk God...

306
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,100
requires a lot of manpower and resources.

307
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,970
It's truly not appropriate.

308
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,970
If you want to do it,
let's wait till next year.

309
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,320
Empress Dowager, the altar to
the Silk God is ready.

310
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,280
The consorts, the mistresses,
and noble ladies were notified.

311
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,720
Cancelling the ritual would invite
rumours against the Imperial Court.

312
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,670
I must ask for Your Majesty...

313
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,810
to carry on this year's ritual as usual.

314
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,820
You came to ask for my opinion.

315
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,200
But you already instructed the Imperial
Household Department to make preparation.

316
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,520
Then what's the point of asking me?

317
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,960
Empress! Don't you think...

318
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,110
you have abused your authority?

319
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,520
Empress Dowager, I prepared
according to old tradition.

320
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,650
I wasn't as attentive as Your Majesty.

321
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,460
If Your Majesty is against it,

322
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,210
I will cancel it immediately.

323
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,870
My apology, Empress Dowager.

324
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,670
I am tired.

325
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,570
You may take your leave now.

326
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,090
Empress Dowager.

327
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,780
Your Majesty.

328
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,240
Your Highness, I asked Zhen.

329
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,040
Empress wanted to carry out
the Ritual for Silk God.

330
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,010
But Empress Dowager
shut her down, and scolded her.

331
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,450
The Empress Dowager said
the Empress is abusing authority.

332
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,040
Are you sure?
She really said that?

333
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,160
Yes. That's a serious accusation,

334
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,730
and I couldn't even believe it.

335
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,200
But all the servants and eunuchs of
Shoukang Palace heard it.

336
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,330
She not only said it,

337
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,540
but she said it in the public.

338
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,910
The ritual has been an old tradition.

339
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,780
If the late Empress could have it,
why can't the new Empress?

340
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,210
It's just an excuse to shun her.

341
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,560
Your Highness, when the
new Empress was crowned,

342
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,090
the Empress Dowager agreed with it.

343
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,710
What changed her mind so suddenly?

344
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,370
The new instrument carries not
the sentiment of the past,

345
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,470
thus the yearning for memory of old.

346
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,930
His Majesty mourns
the late Empress' passing.

347
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,050
It's clear to us all he misses her.

348
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,240
Now because the death of Naerbu,

349
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,150
Empress Dowager found
fault on the new Empress.

350
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,960
Empress Dowager and
his son have gone too far.

351
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,460
Your Highness mustn't say that so lightly.

352
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,130
What? They can do it,
but I can't talk about it?

353
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,460
Notify the Empress,

354
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,770
I will see to Lord Naerbu's funeral.

355
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,950
As for the Ritual for Silk God,

356
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,280
tell her not to worry,

357
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,850
I will request for His Majesty to
have it ready according to old tradition.

358
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,480
I will not let her be shunned.

359
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,780
Your Highness, the Empress Dowager
is against it.

360
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,380
Perhaps this is inadequate.

361
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,750
It's an old tradition.

362
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,980
We're just asking to follow it.

363
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,900
Furthermore,

364
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,440
this regards the Empress' prestige.

365
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,800
People already got word about it.
If it's cancelled now,

366
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,330
people will question
the Empress' position.

367
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,580
The Ritual for Silk God for this year
must be carried out.

368
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,090
Yes.

369
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,620
Empress, all the tools needed...

370
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,600
for mulberry picking
and silkworm farming...

371
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,520
on the day of Ritual for Silk God
are all ready.

372
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,680
Your Majesty may go through them now.

373
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,170
What is this?

374
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,560
It's a silver hook and bark basket
prepared for Consort Ling.

375
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,280
Wu Shu Lai,

376
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,320
Her Majesty uses the golden hook,

377
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,120
the Noble Consort uses silver hooks,

378
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,440
and other concubines use bronze hooks.

379
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,710
Consort Ling is just a consort in rank.

380
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,270
Why is she using silver?

381
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,310
Are you looking for trouble?

382
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,840
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

383
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,840
This is by Empress Dowager's order.

384
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,400
Imperial Household Department
consulted His Majesty.

385
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,320
His Majesty approved.

386
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,720
Since Empress Dowager and
His Majesty have approved,

387
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,560
just carry out accordingly.

388
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:08,920
Yes.

389
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,640
Your Majesty!

390
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,490
Your Majesty!

391
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,260
Consort Ling doesn't deserve
to use silver hook with her rank.

392
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,150
Why would Empress Dowager
and His Majesty agree on that?

393
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,300
Apparently, they value her
and want to promote her.

394
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,920
She is favoured, but she has
no child of her own.

395
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,430
How is she worthy of having
this promotion?

396
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,270
I have no child of my own either.

397
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,350
but I am the Empress.

398
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,760
Empress, you were married to
His Majesty when he was still a prince,

399
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,720
you have known each other for years.

400
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,150
You're just and well-respected
by the entire harem.

401
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,050
And what about her? She was just a servant
who came from Household Department.

402
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,680
Her qualification is no
match for Your Majesty.

403
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,960
His Majesty wants to give
her such honour and affection,

404
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,720
there is nothing you can do.

405
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,400
I know I can't do anything.

406
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,200
But she will become even more ambitious
if Your Majesty indulges her arrogance!

407
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,460
One day, when she has everything needed,

408
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,610
she rise to be the second
Noble Consort Gao!

409
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,070
Concubine Shu, be careful
with what you say.

410
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,260
Have you prepared for all
the mistresses and the noble ladies?

411
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,240
Your Majesty, everything's prepared.

412
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,940
If everything goes according to plan
there should be no issue.

414

Your Majesty.

415
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,850
You must not be provoked
by Concubine Shu.

416
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,840
She never got any attention because
of Consort Ling.

417
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,920
She is using you to stand up for her.

418
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,660
I am very aware of
Concubine Shu's intention.

419
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,790
This is all Empress Dowager's fault.

420
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,180
His Majesty favours Consort Ling,

421
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,880
but why the Empress Dowager too?

422
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,210
Empress Dowager has been angry at me
over my father's death.

423
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,370
And with Prince He's help,

424
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,360
I successfully hold the Ritual
for Silk God, and with grandeur.

425
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,070
That upsets her even more.

426
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,100
She is threatening me with
the possible promotion of Consort Ling.

427
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,140
Your Majesty.
Empress Dowager is high above us.

428
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,300
His Majesty is loyal to his mother.

429
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,330
Why do you insist on
carrying out this ritual?

430
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,430
After my father's death,

431
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,060
Hoifa Nara clan now lives in fear.

432
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,840
I want to hold a grand ceremony...

433
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,920
because I want the whole
Imperial Court to witness...

434
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,060
I am still the Empress of Great Qing.

435
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,850
Only by doing so,
will I not be taken lightly by others.

436
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,730
The ritual will tell us the result.

But I worry Empress Dowager
make things difficult for Your Majesty.

for the time being.

00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,740
As long as you can keep track.

493
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,940
Fine.

494
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,820
Physician Ye.

495
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,830
If you can trust me,

496
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,680
I can deal with the herbs for you.

497
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,880
Really?

498
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,400
The medicinal herbs in the palace
are all premium materials.

499
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,100
It will be a waste if throw them.

500
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,210
You can get someone to sneak them out.

501
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,720
The bugs took some bites
out of the herbs,

502
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,960
those herb merchants can still
pick out some good ones,

503
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,600
you can still sell them at a good price,
even after discounts.

504
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,890
Sneak them out?

505
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,770
That will work?

506
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:31,040
This is an old practice at the palace.

507
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,760
This is how the old medicines
were dealt with.

508
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,560
Even if the higher-ups found out,

509
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
they would ignore it.

510
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,600
The money earned can be used to
cover expanses of Imperial Apothecary,

511
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,600
or to purchase some new medicines.
It all makes sense.

512
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,050
If you trust me,
I will take care of this matter.

513
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,340
Great.

514
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,770
I'll let you take care of this.

515
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,540
Is the medicine ready?

516
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,880
It's done.

517
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,490
Then you can leave. I'll take care of it.

518
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,780
Yes.

519
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,719
Your embroidery is too messy.

520
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,810
Ying Luo, I've been at it for three days.

521
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,560
Look. What's wrong?

522
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,750
Ten days to paint a body of water.
Five days to paint a rock.

523
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,159
Painting and calligraphy
both require inner serenity.

524
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,960
Not to mention embroidery needs
every needlework to be perfection.

525
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,900
Even the slightest mistake...

526
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,270
will alter the original meaning
of the embroidery work.

527
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,650
Ming Yu.

528
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,090
You must calm yourself
and study it carefully,

529
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,020
that is the only way to
make a respectable purse.

530
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,910
How did you know I was making a purse?

531
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,100
Your face says it all already.

532
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,020
However,

533
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,960
Hailan Cha already has a purse you made.

534
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,280
Giving him another one is pointless.

535
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,880
What other idea do you have?

536
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,530
You can make a headwear...

537
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,350
for his mother.

538
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,040
But I don't know what the old madam likes.

539
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,190
Who really cares?

540
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,730
This headwear represents your caring.

541
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,570
You need to let Hailan Cha
know your feeling for him.

542
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,690
Is that clear?

543
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,720
-I think I somewhat got it.
-Somewhat got it?

544
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,390
You are so dumb.

545
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,930
Time for your medicine.

546
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,240
There's poison in the medicine!

547
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,130
Your Highness, I saw it with my own eyes.

548
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,800
Yuan Chun Wang use a sachet
of powder in your daily tonic.

549
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,520
Xiao Quan Zi, that is
a serious accusation.

550
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,800
Your Highness, I swear to heaven,

551
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,810
I will suffer heaven's wrath
as punishment if I lied!

552
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,520
Your Highness!

553
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,450
Xiao Quan Zi, I trust Yuan Chun Wang.

554
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,330
If you ever accuse with evidence again,

555
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,930
I will send you to
the Bureau of Internal Affair

556
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,680
Ming Yu.

557
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,920
Xiao Quan Zi was out of line.
Cut his salary for this month.

558
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,000
Take him away,

559
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,720
make sure he can memorize every
line of the palace's law.

560
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,590
-Your Highness.
-Leave.

561
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,280
You,

562
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,570
that was too light for punishment.

563
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,320
You were too careless.

564
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,000
I wanted him to know
how much you trust me.

565
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,070
I am tired of him
challenging me every day.

566
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,730
Ying Luo,

567
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,390
are you sure...

568
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,540
sure you want to continue
taking this medicine?

569
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,750
I am.

570
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,660
Why not?

571
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,460
This is the tonic that I need the most.

572
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,890
Young Madam, please have some tea.

573
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,660
How dare you look down on me as well!

574
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,400
You serve me with such cold tea?

575
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,840
Please forgive me.

576
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,760
I saw you praying just now.

577
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,470
I didn't want to disturb you.

578
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,210
I will get you a new cup of tea.

579
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,960
Clean up this mess now.

580
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,490
Yes.

581
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,260
Young Madam!

582
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,900
Three thousand handmaidens with rouge,

583
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,740
how many can hold their tears
when the spring comes?

584
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,340
Do you find this painful?

585
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,960
Forgive me, Young Madam!

586
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,770
You have no idea what real pain is.

587
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,720
Young Madam, I apologize!

588
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,090
Get up!

589
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,560
If others hear you,

590
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,780
they might think I've mistreated you.

591
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,590
Wait.

592
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,480
Wipe away the tears.

593
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,560
Why must you do this?

594
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,800
Fu Heng torments me.

595
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,170
I can't be the only one to suffer.

596
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,280
Why do you have this?

597
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,960
Even though your grandfather is
a ranked historian, he is too old.

598
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,080
My third brother is His Majesty's aide,

599
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,540
and he's fighting
battles on the frontline.

600
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,610
Even if this letter is sent out,

601
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,700
Hitara clan won't dare to meddle.

602
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,950
Stop wasting your time.

603
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,170
Hitara won't meddle with it?

604
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,540
But someone else will.

605
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,600
What do you mean?

606
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,250
In five days,

607
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,370
there will be a Ritual for the Silk God.

608
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,870
I am the wife of a first-ranked duke.

609
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,810
I can't be absent.

610
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,510
What are you trying to do?

611
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,200
I won't spend my life
in this little shrine.

612
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,350
Just wait and see!

613
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:21,480
The Imperial Household Department's
assistant dispatched to Kyakhta...

614
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,960
has returned with the purchased leather.

615
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,120
A total of 11,500 taels
of silver was spent.

616
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,000
The balance is 200 taels.

617
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,960
All the leather goods
have arrived in storage.

618
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,450
There are 80 sets fox fur,

619
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,120
30 sets of white leopard fur.

620
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,740
and 50 sets mink furs.

621
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,430
Chamberlain Wu, you can decide
for such trivial matters.

622
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,300
Then, I take my leave.

623
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,360
Wait.

624
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,540
Pick up some of the best furs...

625
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,800
and deliver them to Shoukang Palace
and Chengqian Palace.

626
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,440
-Yes.
-These newly purchased leather goods,

627
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,730
is there any sea otter skin?

628
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,290
Your Majesty, yes, there is.

629
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,830
But it can only be used for adornment.

630
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,680
Then which leather is most exquisite?

631
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,460
If you want it on your court robe,

632
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,000
-then...
-I mean,

633
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,560
for a woman.

634
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,120
Imperial Household Department
brought back a piece of snow fox fur.

635
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,720
The silver quills on the fur are gorgeous.

636
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,740
It'd be perfect for a hat or a scarf.

637
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,210
Send it to Yanxi Palace.

638
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,350
Yes.

639
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,010
Greetings to Imperial Concubine Shu.

640
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,280
Chamberlain Wu,

641
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,020
This must be leather goods from Kyakhta.

642
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,830
That fox fur is so pretty.

643
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,630
Imperial Concubine Shu,

644
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:45,210
this is a gift for Yanxi Palace
from His Majesty.

645
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,000
The fur for other palaces
will be delivered soon.

646
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,920
We are getting the leftovers again.

647
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,120
Forget it. You can go now!

648
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,170
I'll be on my way.

649
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,270
-I am so sorry!
-Watch where you're going!

650
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,590
Clumsy fool.

651
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,030
Kneel here.

652
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,370
Kneel for four full hours.

653
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,450
What?

654
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,960
You regret it now?

655
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,740
Why should I regret it?

656
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,250
He's so obsessed with you.

657
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,200
He seems so proud and mighty
on the outside,

658
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,720
but he sends you all the finest stuffs
just to make you happy.

659
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:07,170
But our sharp-witted Emperor...

660
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,490
is actually blind like a bat.

661
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,560
He doesn't even know
what you've gone through for him.
