[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 68]

3
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,810
I've been cooping myself
inside for too long.

4
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,920
I'm so tired of it.

5
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,930
Consort Ling said that
if I still won't face reality,

6
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,930
she'll tear my quarters down
and leave me with no place to hide.

7
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,900
Father, you know this.

8
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,690
Consort Ling always does what she says.

9
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,940
Ying Luo is being ridiculous.

10
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,710
Consort Ling said that
Physician Ye is in Jiangnan.

11
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,579
I want to go and find him.

12
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,740
Perhaps...

13
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:20,740
Perhaps my leg...

14
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,020
is still savable.

15
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,180
Very well.

16
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,420
Very good!

17
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,010
You should follow us.

18
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,300
I am glad to see
your spirits raised again!

19
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,780
Father.

20
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,700
Please allow Mother to go with us.

21
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,340
Please?

22
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,290
Mother!

23
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,880
Greetings, Your Highness.

24
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,010
Greetings, Mother.

25
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,260
Yong Ji.

26
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,360
Mother.

27
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,010
Father said yes!

28
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,020
You can join the southern tour too!

29
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,010
Father said yes!

30
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,460
He did!

31
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,330
Yong Ji, why do you look so disoriented?

32
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,970
Zhen, go get him some water.

33
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,180
Yes, Your Highness.

34
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,050
Your Majesty.

35
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,370
The Twelfth Prince is a filial son.

36
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,620
He actually persuaded His Majesty!

37
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,690
It wasn't me!

38
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,880
I knelt for six hours outside his palace,

39
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,329
but Father wouldn't see me.

40
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,970
But he changed his mind
when Fifth Brother went in.

41
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,260
Mother, Fifth Brother is great!

42
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,270
It's all thanks to Fifth Brother.

43
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,980
-We really should thank him!
-For what?

44
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,260
What a loser you are!

45
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,930
I can't believe you still look so happy.

46
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,660
Get out!

47
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,100
Mother.

48
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,190
Did I do something wrong?

49
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,420
Get out!

50
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,670
Your Highness, please leave for now.

51
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,250
Mother.

52
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,370
Everyone says you're ill.

53
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,810
At first I didn't believe it,

54
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,620
but now I see that you really are sick!

55
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,320
Your Highness!

56
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,460
-Don't go after him!
-Your Highness!

57
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,980
Your Majesty.

58
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,890
Kneeling for six hours is nothing
compared to a few words from his brother.

59
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,990
And he is actually happy about it!

60
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,700
How ridiculous.

61
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,580
How ridiculous!

62
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,140
He and I mean nothing to His Majesty!

63
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,380
We mean nothing to him!

64
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,580
Your Highness!

65
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,540
[Fifteenth Prince, Yong Yan]

66
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,760
Slow down!

67
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,140
Your Highness!

68
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,090
Forgive me, Your Highness!

69
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,460
Forgive me!

70
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,260
What happened?

71
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,520
Forgive me, Your Highness.

72
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,820
I deserve death.

73
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,880
Enough! Move!

74
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,980
Yes.

75
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,260
Your Highness, it's time to go to class.

76
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,650
Sister Nalan.

77
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,250
It's all my fault.

78
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,060
I sincerely apologize to you.

79
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,250
We've been together for so long.

80
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,060
I've always respected you.

81
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,380
Since you adore Yong Yan,

82
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,060
let us look after him
together in the future...

83
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,409
and stop suspecting each other, shall we?

84
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,450
By the way,

85
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,240
the brush and ink stone
you sent are marvelous.

86
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,930
Yong Yan is so happy with them.

87
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,760
He said Master Liu at the academy
is obsessed with good ink.

88
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,970
He loves to collect good
ink stones and brushes.

89
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,030
That's why he's bringing them
to class to show them off.

90
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,820
Seeing Yong Yan makes me even happier
than seeing His Majesty.

91
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,940
Why would I hurt him?

92
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,500
In the future, don't you
dare suspect me again.

93
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,210
If you do it again,

94
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,970
I won't forgive you!

95
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,890
Yes, it's my fault!

96
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,420
I won't do that anymore.

97
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,420
Let me peel an apple for you.

98
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,300
Do eat it if you forgive me.

99
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,490
Your Highness,
the Fifteenth Prince suddenly fell ill!

100
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,490
He's been sent back to Yanxi Palace.

101
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,340
Let's go!

102
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,570
Don't be anxious.

103
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,700
Let's ask what happened.

104
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,930
Consort Ling.

105
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,220
How is Yong Yan?

106
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,640
He was fine in the morning.

107
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,730
Why did he fall ill so suddenly?
Is he alright now?

108
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,040
Consort Ling, what did the physician say?

109
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,890
The Imperial Doctor said that
Yong Yan was poisoned.

110
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,810
What?

111
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,100
Poisoned?

112
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,300
Show it to Consort Qing.

113
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,490
The Imperial Physician has verified
that the bristles were soaked in poison.

114
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,740
His Highness has a habit.

115
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,159
Before he starts to write,

116
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,370
he likes to lick
the bristles to moisten it.

117
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,090
He was lucky that when he wrote halfway,

118
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,260
Master Liu noticed the brush
and wanted to examine it.

119
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,460
What did you do?

120
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,020
What did I do?

121
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,580
How dare you do such an evil thing?

122
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,720
You knew that Yong Yan is my only hope.

123
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,970
Why did you do this?

124
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,180
Why?

125
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,270
How can you see me in this light?

126
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,020
I didn't do it.

127
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,000
I really didn't do it!

128
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,210
The brush and the ink stone
were both from you!

129
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,500
Who else could it be?

130
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,780
Yes, I did give him
the brush and the ink stone.

131
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,940
But I bought them at a high price!

132
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,930
I can swear to heaven.

133
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,940
I really didn't do anything.

134
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,690
Really!

135
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,780
I...

136
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,500
I see!

137
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,250
You couldn't care for him,

138
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,260
and you are trying to pass the buck!

139
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,100
Lu Wan Wan!

140
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,220
What kind of mother are you?

141
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,170
If I were to look after Yong Yan,

142
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,059
this would've never happened!

143
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,450
I have not looked after him well.

144
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,220
But don't think you can get
away with this, you murderer!

145
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,120
Let's go, we'll settle this
in front of His Majesty.

146
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,900
-I'm not going.
-Move!

147
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,320
I didn't do it, I'm not going!

148
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,900
-Enough!
-Let go!

149
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,270
Yong Yan is still resting.

150
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,140
Are you going to wake him up?

151
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,220
Consort Qing,

152
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,500
that was inappropriate.

153
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,810
I've been in the palace
for so many years...

154
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,700
before I finally got a son.

155
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,580
If someone dares to touch Yong Yan,

156
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,170
I will kill that person!

157
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,540
You should use your head.

158
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,490
I gave him the brush and the inkstone.

159
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,730
If anything happens,

160
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,500
can I escape from this?

161
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,580
Someone framed me, clearly.

162
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,780
Right!

163
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,060
It was a frame-up!

164
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,170
Only we touched the stationery.

165
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,580
Who can frame us?

166
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,050
The Fifth Prince had an accident.

167
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,060
The Fourth Prince is now locked up.

168
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,090
If Yong Yan is gone too,

169
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,690
-then...
-Shut your mouth!

170
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,980
Yong Yan is fine.

171
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,140
It's just an assumption.

172
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,940
If the Fifteenth Prince is gone,

173
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,700
who would benefit?

174
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,090
It's the Twelfth Prince!

175
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,820
The Twelfth Prince...

176
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,260
Very well.

177
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,380
They framed one after another.

178
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,460
Now, they're even framing me!

179
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,570
No!

180
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,710
This time, I must go to His Majesty...

181
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,930
and complain against her!

182
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,130
Lodging a complaint?

183
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,180
Where is your evidence?

184
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,700
The stationery were from you.

185
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,690
How is this related to the empress?

186
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,820
You have no proof.

187
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,350
-How will you confront the empress?
-But...

188
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,820
But I can't stand being framed like this!

189
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,280
Ying Luo, Consort Shu is right.

190
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,800
We can't let this go easily!

191
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,940
Just quiet down!

192
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,020
There are too many loopholes here.

193
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,060
This doesn't seem to be
the empress's doing.

194
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,450
The empress is the one
who's most likely...

195
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,620
...to hurt Yong Yan!

196
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,460
Who else can it be?

197
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,620
Think about it.

198
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,170
First, the Fifth Prince's incident,
then the Fourth Prince's arrest.

199
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,820
And now Yong Yan is poisoned.

200
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,940
Everything happened in quick succession.

201
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,550
The empress is always
prudent and cautious.

202
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,820
Why would she rush everything
and invite suspicion?

203
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,100
Wei Ying Luo.

204
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,900
If anyone offended you in the past,

205
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,860
you'd turn the world upside down.

206
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,580
Now that you're a noble consort,

207
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,580
you've become so hesitant.

208
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,140
I think you're getting useless.

209
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,730
You're not going, are you?

210
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,260
If you don't go, I'll go.

211
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,770
Even if His Majesty doesn't do anything,

212
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,380
I'll let the empress Dowager
know about this!

213
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,780
Consort Shu.

214
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,980
Don't alarm the enemy!

215
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,460
Consort Shu!

216
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,660
Consort Shu!

217
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,820
Do you think...

218
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,300
the empress will try again...

219
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,140
after failing this time?

220
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,700
Greetings, Your Highness.

221
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

222
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,610
Your Highness.

223
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,840
If there's nothing else,

224
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,660
I'll be taking my leave.

225
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,370
You called me here suddenly.

226
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,020
May I ask for what reason?

227
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,380
Back when...

228
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,740
Rong Yin left,

229
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,660
the emperor was so heart-broken.

230
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,860
He kept refusing to name a new empress.

231
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:57,180
It was me who reminded him
that you are dignified and virtuous,

232
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,850
qualified to be a motherly
model of the empire.

233
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,170
Do you still remember?

234
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,820
I can never forget
your assistance, Your Highness.

235
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,980
Kneel.

236
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,540
I told you to kneel!

237
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,150
I don't know what I have done
to incur your wrath.

238
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,250
Please enlighten me.

239
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,420
As long as you behave yourself...

240
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,340
and manage the imperial harem well,

241
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,260
I will let bygones be bygones.

242
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:39,500
But it looks like you're tired
of becoming the empress.

243
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,770
All you think now is
promoting the Twelfth Prince.

244
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,380
Are you planning to go further
and gain more power?

245
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,560
Your Highness.

246
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,240
I dare not even think
of such a treacherous act.

247
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,900
I wonder who has been
instigating behind my back.

248
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,430
This is a groundless
accusation and slander!

249
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,260
I've devoted my entire life...

250
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,810
to manage the harem and attend to you.

251
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,330
My loyalty is undivided.

252
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,780
One tends to be insatiable...

253
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,540
when discontent strikes.

254
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,330
Kneel here until the incense burns out.

255
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,360
Reflect on yourself.

256
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,380
Your Highness.

257
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,530
Even if I've made a mistake,

258
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,530
at least allow me to defend myself.

259
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,860
I just want you to remember one thing.

260
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,410
An empress is responsible for
caring for the royal descendants.

261
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,200
From now on, if anything bad happens...

262
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,780
to any princes or princesses,

263
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,780
no matter who did it,

264
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,900
I will punish you for dereliction of duty!

265
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,650
Your Highness, be careful.

266
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,580
Your Highness.

267
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,930
About the Fifteenth Prince's case,

268
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,530
the empress dowager and
His Majesty all suspect the empress.

269
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,730
Her Highness couldn't defend herself.

270
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,140
She feels so wronged!

271
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,450
Think about it.

272
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,090
Even if the empress is plotting something,

273
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,360
why would she strike
at this chaotic moment...

274
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,620
when the Fifth Prince has just been hurt?

275
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,460
Of course, this is just a thief
framing someone else as the thief.

276
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,780
Consort Ling.

277
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,210
People say that even an evil tiger
won't eat her own children.

278
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,340
But she's more sinister
than an evil tiger!

279
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,670
She actually used the
Fifteenth Prince to set up a trap!

280
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,210
Consort Ling is advancing.

281
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,220
Her Majesty has no more room to retreat.

282
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,460
She doesn't know what else to do.

283
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,740
I will advise my brother again.

284
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,220
Advise?

285
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,380
Has your advice ever worked?

286
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,450
His Majesty is angry at Her Majesty.

287
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,370
He won't name the Twelfth Prince
as Crown Prince, of course.

288
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,020
Once the Fifteenth Prince
ascends the throne,

289
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,500
would he let the empress and her son go?

290
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,620
You mean?

291
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,890
Your Highness, do you still remember
the previous prince regent?

292
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,980
Bastard!

293
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,420
You want me to rebel like Dorgon?

294
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,140
This is treason!

295
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,060
Hush, Your Highness!

296
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,700
Hush?

297
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,940
You disloyal servant!

298
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:16,339
You should be dragged out now
and sliced into pieces!

299
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,280
Your Highness!

300
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,700
Just stand here and shout
that Yuan Chun Wang is scheming to rebel!

301
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,340
You...

302
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,380
Are you crazy?

303
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,900
If our conversation gets out,

304
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,340
my life is worth nothing,

305
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,260
but yours...

306
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,860
I am a servant after all,

307
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,090
even if Her Majesty gains power,

308
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,820
I'm just a useless being.

309
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,260
I will never be able to man
the court and exercise power.

310
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,900
Your Highness.

311
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,770
I'm taking a huge risk
to give you such advice.

312
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,100
It's not for myself,

313
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:18,300
but for Her Majesty and for you!

314
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,100
No.

315
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,860
I can't!

316
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,180
I can't do it!

317
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,690
My words end here.

318
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,660
May you take care of yourself.

319
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,170
Your Highness,

320
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,900
do you want to be a hero
of the Aisin-Gioro clan...

321
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,900
or a dog trampled by all?

322
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,900
You decide.

323
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,780
Lord Fu Heng.

324
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,420
Your Highness,
His Majesty has made it clear...

325
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,210
that high court officials may not
interact with harem eunuchs.

326
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,870
Do I need to remind you of that?

327
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,000
Lord Fu Heng,

328
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,020
you probably misunderstood.

329
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,180
I gifted the Twelfth Prince
a parrot that can talk.

330
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,580
Supervisor Yuan was just...

331
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,380
thanking me on his behalf.

332
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,770
You know very well if
it was a misunderstanding or not.

333
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,650
If I see you do it again,

334
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,730
I will enforce the law accordingly.

335
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,500
I hope you'll understand.

336
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,260
You're not that holy yourself.

337
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:09,080
How are you qualified to lecture me?

338
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,380
What did you say?

339
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,420
Don't think that people don't know...

340
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,050
what's going on between
you and Consort Ling.

341
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,620
Hong Zhou, watch your mouth!

342
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,580
What?

343
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,180
Did I make you angry?

344
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,650
You've been careful around me...

345
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,910
because you are afraid that I'd hurt her!

346
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,940
But what a pity!

347
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,140
She doesn't have you in her heart at all!

348
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,170
She only wants to climb up...

349
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,900
by flattering the emperor.

350
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,060
You sound like you have
a guilty conscience.

351
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,020
Why would I feel guilty?

352
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,270
At first, I didn't suspect anything.

353
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,700
But now that I think of it,

354
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,540
there is indeed a talking parrot
in Chengqian Palace.

355
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,090
But it doesn't seem to be a gift
for the Twelfth Prince.

356
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,900
You lied to hide something from me.

357
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,920
What else can it be if not guilt?

358
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,900
How dare you!

359
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,850
Hong Zhou, are you sure
you want to fight in the palace?

360
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,460
Let's see about that.

361
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,340
Stop!

362
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,170
Your Majesty.

363
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,710
Greetings, Your Majesty.

364
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,100
How is your injury?

365
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,940
Hong Zhou, this is the palace!

366
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,800
You are getting barbaric!

367
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,520
-Your Majesty, I...
-Your Majesty.

368
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,420
Prince He and I just happened
to be in the mood...

369
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,460
to have a friendly spar.

370
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,180
A friendly spar?

371
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:25,700
I was too reckless and
almost hurt Lord Fu Heng.

372
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,780
Instead of the martial arts arena,

373
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,420
why are you fighting at the Grand Council?

374
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,040
Fu Heng.

375
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,920
As the head of the Grand Council,

376
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,220
you fought in public.

377
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,590
I will cut your salary for
the next six months, understood?

378
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,900
I understand.

379
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,300
And you!

380
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,700
Follow me!

381
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,900
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

382
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,090
I didn't punish you in public...

383
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,610
to preserve the dignity
of the Aisin-Gioro family.

384
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,170
Go and punish yourself
at the Imperial Clan Court!

385
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,620
Brother, Fu Heng is just an outsider.

386
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,780
But I grew up and studied with you.

387
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,580
I'm your brother!

388
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,980
You assaulted an official
and insulted our clan.

389
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,210
To think you fought with
the Grand Council's head.

390
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,770
If you weren't my brother,

391
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,650
I would not have tolerated this!

392
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,060
Brother!

393
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,700
Hong Zhou.

394
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,220
You were personally raised
by the empress dowager.

395
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,400
I saw you as my brother and
bestowed upon you an important post.

396
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,810
But what about you?

397
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,730
You conducted a grand funeral
for the living at your mansion.

398
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,300
But that was nothing.

399
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,770
For the past few years, you actually
invited the court officials...

400
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,850
to see you laughing
like a fool on a coffin!

401
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,020
This is absolutely preposterous!

402
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,050
Are you trying to tell people that...

403
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:57,100
you feel hurt, resentful and aggrieved?

404
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,380
Are you trying to let everyone know...

405
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,540
that you have been
treated unfairly, aren't you?

406
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,010
Brother.

407
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,660
The funeral was just for fun.

408
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,290
If this is not to vent your anger,

409
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,350
then you were pretending to be crazy!

410
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,630
You were using that as a guise
to rebel against the dynasty!

411
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,730
Brother.

412
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,600
I can swear to heaven.
I didn't do such a devious deed!

413
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,670
The censures against you
are piling up like a mountain!

414
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,200
If I didn't protect you, you'd...

415
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,460
Hong Zhou, remember this.

416
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,300
This is the last time!

417
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,630
If you dare to challenge my limits again,

418
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,220
don't blame me for
disregarding our brotherhood.

419
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,890
Starting from today,

420
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,730
I will speak and act cautiously.

421
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,380
Brother, please forgive me!

422
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,400
Your Highness, do you still remember
when I hid myself inside a cabinet?

423
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,610
Everyone thought
something happened to me...

424
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,140
and were all panicked.

425
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,140
You were six years old then,

426
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,530
and you were so naughty.

427
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,970
Your mother almost fainted out of worry.

428
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,240
I can't believe that...

429
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,100
you could fit yourself
inside a small cabinet!

430
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,420
It was all for skipping classes.

431
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,700
I remember that Brother
was punished with me...

432
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,900
for covering up for me.

433
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,740
Your Brother was beaten and
punished many times because of you.

434
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,210
But you still refused to mend your ways!

435
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,760
What are you talking about?

436
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,960
You sound delighted.

437
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,460
Greetings, Brother.

438
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,680
Look at you.

439
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,010
Why maintain such formalities
between brothers?

440
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,900
I'm not even used to it!

441
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,570
Why are you so free today...

442
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,300
as to come here and chat
with the empress dowager?

443
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,260
I've heard everything.

444
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,300
Emperor.

445
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:09,210
Hong Zhou has sincerely apologized.

446
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,700
Please forgive him on my account.

447
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,500
Sincerely apologizing?

448
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,500
Brother.

449
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,300
It's all my fault.

450
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,860
if I commit a mistake again,

451
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,980
you may personally sentence me.

452
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,710
You can even have me flogged to death.

453
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,380
I won't ask for clemency.

454
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,740
Emperor.

455
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:49,580
Both of you are brothers.

456
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,860
You share a close bond.

457
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,280
Before the late emperor passed away,

458
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,380
he kept reminding you
to take good care of Hong Zhou.

459
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,220
Remember?

460
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,140
I will let bygones be bygones
no matter what happened.

461
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:30,780
Let's be close brothers again
just like how we were.

462
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,260
Behave yourself.

463
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,300
Brother.

464
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,540
Alright!

465
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,850
Everything is fine now!

466
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,380
No one shall mention this again.

467
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,580
Brother.

468
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,610
There will be thousands
joining the southern tour.

469
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,980
It will be a grand event.

470
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,820
The servants, however, are careless,

471
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,020
ignorant of the empress dowager's needs.

472
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,010
Why don't you let me
handle the preparation?

473
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:06,740
I will guarantee a smooth-sailing
journey for the empress dowager.

474
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,620
I'm glad to see you so thoughtful.

475
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,450
Then, please assist the Imperial Household
Department with the preparations.

476
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,850
I shall prepare now.

477
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,590
Your Highness, Your Majesty.

478
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,130
I'm taking my leave.

479
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,540
Hong Zhou.

480
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,700
Hong Zhou!

481
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,820
See, even at this age,

482
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,140
he's still an excitable character!

483
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,460
Mother, what do you think
about the suggestion...

484
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,570
that I mentioned before?

485
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:53,020
An imperial noble consort
is equal to a substitute for the empress.

486
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,060
The empress is still here.

487
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:01,260
I fear it's inappropriate to appoint
an imperial noble consort now.

488
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,020
I...

489
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,300
hope to let Consort Ling manage the harem.

490
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,850
You don't need to appoint...

491
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,820
an imperial noble consort
to manage the harem.

492
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,060
When the empress was a consort,

493
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,060
she also managed the harem.

494
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,780
Emperor.

495
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,620
What's going on?

496
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,530
Both Yong Qi and Yong Yan
had accidents befall them.

497
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,940
I think that...

498
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,220
the empress is negligent
and is responsible for it.

499
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:44,660
I think it's safer to have another
person manage the harem.

500
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,530
Emperor, about Yong Qi's accident,
are you suspecting...

501
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,780
There is no concrete evidence.

502
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,500
I will not suspect anyone.

503
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,300
The empress is definitely sick.

504
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,500
I can't count on a sick person
to manage the harem.

505
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,620
She should recuperate.

506
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,180
Prince He?

507
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,260
How careless of me.

508
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,540
I forgot the snuff bottle gifted
by the empress dowager.

509
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,140
Why is the atmosphere so heavy?

510
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,780
What happened?

511
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,860
Just go.

512
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,530
I'll be thankful...

513
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,540
as long as you manage the tour well.

514
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,660
I'm really leaving now.

515
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,620
Appointing an imperial noble consort...

516
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,300
will essentially remove
the empress's de facto power.

517
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,190
What would the civil and
military officials think?

518
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,940
How would the regular people think?

519
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,580
Emperor.

520
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,640
Please think about this cautiously.

521
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,580
Mother, you are more considerate.

522
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,460
I will follow your opinion.

523
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,110
We will discuss this again
when we return from the tour.

524
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

525
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,610
Your Majesty, Prince He
has a message for you.

526
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,180
He said that...

527
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,300
His Majesty intends to name
Consort Ling as imperial noble consort.

528
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,620
What did you say?

529
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,610
His Majesty intends to name
Consort Ling as imperial noble consort!

530
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,020
No.

531
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,820
Impossible!

532
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,580
Impossible!

533
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,840
I am still the empress!

534
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,060
Why would he appoint
an imperial noble consort?

535
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,100
Your Majesty.

536
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,930
Since the establishment of the dynasty,

537
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,780
other than Empress Xiao Xian,

538
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:06,530
the title of imperial
noble consort was given...

539
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,410
either to a gravely ill
consort as consolation...

540
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,770
or to a consort when no empress exists...

541
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,620
so she can manage the harem.

542
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,650
There has never been
an imperial noble consort...

543
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:20,780
while the empress is still alive!

544
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,490
-His Majesty also said...
-What did he say?

545
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,580
His Majesty also said
that you are seriously ill...

546
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,860
and needs to recuperate.

547
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,780
His Majesty wants to remove your powers!

548
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,820
If news of this gets out,

549
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,520
what would the officials think?

550
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,580
What would the regular people think?

551
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,100
They must think that...

552
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,090
the empress has committed
an unpardonable sin.

553
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,230
Your Majesty will be deprived
of your glory as empress!

554
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,540
When?

555
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,430
When will he appoint her officially?

556
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,180
After the southern tour.

557
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,510
-Yuan Chun Wang.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

558
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,500
Pass this message to Prince He.

559
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,020
Tell him...

560
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,860
Your Majesty!

561
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,460
Look at the situation now!

562
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:24,930
Consort Ling is going
to take over your position.

563
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,980
Your Majesty, you must
not hesitate any longer!

564
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,810
Tell Hong Zhou that no matter what,

565
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,980
I must see him today.

566
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,670
Yes, Your Majesty!

567
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,940
Why?

568
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,620
Hong Li.

569
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,700
Why are you doing this to me?

570
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,420
Why?

571
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

572
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:19,300
I am just a puppet empress now.

573
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,699
Your Majesty.

574
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,460
Can you help me?

575
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,100
How do you wish me to help you?

576
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:32,090
Over the past ten years,

577
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,100
I have managed the harem earnestly

578
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,300
without committing any grave errors.

579
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,980
While His Majesty still
blames and avoids me,

580
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,210
appointing an imperial noble consort
is too unfair.

581
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,940
You are now a full-fledged prince.

582
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,750
Even if His Majesty wishes
to install an imperial noble consort,

583
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:55,060
if all the officials and clansmen object,

584
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:58,220
His Majesty can't do anything either.

585
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,220
Even now,

586
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,820
you still harbour hope towards him?

587
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,300
Hong Li is harsh.

588
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,420
Our only hope...

589
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,220
is to replace him!

590
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,940
What are you saying?

591
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,700
I said, replace him!

592
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,580
You're crazy.

593
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,830
Take it that I've never come here.

594
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,180
Throughout these years,
how have you treated him?

595
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,580
Why can't we rebel against him?

596
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,140
Why can't we pursue what we deserve?

597
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,780
What do you want to do?

598
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:02,820
Kill him.

599
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,090
You...

600
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,420
You've lost your mind.

601
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,780
He's the emperor!

602
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,020
This is rebellion!

603
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,880
Even if I am crazy,

604
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,980
he made me this way!

605
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,180
After the southern tour,

606
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,050
you...

607
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,380
will become a puppet...

608
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,350
who will be disposed sooner or later.

609
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,740
As for Yong Ji...

610
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,890
Yong Ji is still the emperor's son.

611
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,610
Even if he can't succeed the throne...

612
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,010
My life today...

613
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,740
will be Yong Ji's tomorrow!

614
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:53,180
Yong Ji will suffer
a worse fate than mine!

615
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,740
Shu Shen.

616
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,100
The southern tour...

617
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,340
will be our best time to take action.

618
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,460
This is for you...

619
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,900
and for the Twelfth Prince.

620
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,300
Please consider what I said.

621
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,180
Your Majesty.

622
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,410
Your Majesty.

623
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,900
You've been distracted all day.

624
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,500
What happened?

625
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,500
Nothing.

626
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,300
Nothing?

627
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,050
I've served you for so many years.

628
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:53,500
I've never seen you
so anxious and distracted.

629
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:00,900
Just now, I had a chance
to reclaim my powers.

630
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,660
Your Majesty, you mean...

631
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,940
Long live Her Majesty!

632
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,530
A narrow mind makes not a gentleman,

633
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,690
and a real man lacks not in venom.

634
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:22,020
Desperate times need desperate measures.

635
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,140
Zhen.

636
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,980
I've told you many times,

637
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:39,050
stop doing these chores.

638
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,020
Just let the other servants do it.

639
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,340
I am willing to do them.

640
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,020
Did Her Majesty really say that?

641
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:58,180
Has Her Majesty really made up her mind
to cooperate with Prince He?

642
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:05,450
She needs some motivation from you.

643
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,620
Me?

644
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,330
Zhen.

645
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,460
Search for her jewelry box
and give me an item inside.

646
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,140
Lord Fu Heng.

647
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,500
Is there an urgent matter today?

648
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,300
Usually, when you see me,

649
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,020
you'd just nod and leave.

650
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,090
But today, you saw me from afar...

651
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,270
and approached me.

652
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,540
I can see that there's an urgent matter.

653
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,770
I am about to go to battle.

654
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,290
Aren't you escorting
His Majesty on the tour?

655
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,820
Two days ago, the Burmese soldiers
launched a surprise attack.

656
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,950
They are now approaching Simao City.

657
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,840
They intend to conquer
12 autonomous prefectures.

658
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,790
His Majesty has ordered me
to leave for battle right away...

659
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,920
to help the Yungui governor in battle.

660
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,380
I will leave tomorrow.

661
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,780
That's sudden.

662
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,940
Consort Ling, may I
have a word in private?

663
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,330
Keep your guard up around Prince He.

664
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,620
Prince He?

665
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,900
A few days ago, he and I had a fight.

666
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,590
However, he acted like nothing happened
and recommended me to His Majesty today.

667
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,950
Why did you fight?

668
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,570
I saw with my own eyes
that Yuan Chun Wang...

669
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:54,980
was meeting Prince He.

670
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,050
Prince He was angry when I confronted him,

671
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,580
so he resorted to violence.

672
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,780
I see.

673
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,900
Thank you for your tip.

674
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,460
Lord Fu Heng,

675
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:18,260
I wish you a smooth
and successful journey.

676
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,020
Anything else?

677
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,820
You've joined so many
battles over the years,

678
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,740
and you've never lost once.

679
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,660
Everyone says you're a lucky general.

680
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,220
His Majesty is also very impressed.

681
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:46,380
This won't be an exception.

682
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,780
I will wait for news of your victory.

683
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,260
Thank you for trusting me.

684
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,260
Ying Luo.

685
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,750
Take care of yourself.

686
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:17,810
Xiao Quan.

687
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,020
Yes, Your Highness.

688
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,770
Take my imperial token
and leave the palace.

689
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,250
Please investigate someone for me.

690
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,610
Your Highness, the southern
tour is in three days.

691
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,900
If I leave now,

692
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,020
I'm afraid I won't be back in time.

693
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,620
You can join us after your investigation.

694
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,780
You may say that one of
your family members is ill,

695
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,690
and I allowed you to visit.

696
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:37,900
Yes, Your Highness.

697
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,700
Your Majesty.

698
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,340
It's time to attend the banquet.
