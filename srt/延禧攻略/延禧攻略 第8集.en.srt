[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,770
His Majesty has issued a decree...

4
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,380
to cane you eighty times...

5
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:56,979
and exile you to Ningguta.

6
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,860
You will never be
allowed back into the capital.

7
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,190
[I swear that if I ever have
any evil thoughts again,]

8
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,090
[the heavens will punish me
to die a tragic death.]

9
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,360
I...

10
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,880
No, Ying Luo.

11
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,840
I admit my mistake. I was wrong.

12
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,329
Save me! I beg you to help me!

13
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,600
It's too late.

14
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,680
-Save me.
-It's too late.

15
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,570
-No.
-Ling Long,

16
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,760
the route to Ningguta...

17
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,860
is very far and long.

18
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,480
Take care of yourself.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,790
No.

20
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,850
Ying Luo, if you get transferred
to Changchun Palace,

21
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,570
with your attitude,
you surely will get into trouble.

22
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,760
Madam,

23
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,230
thank you for taking care of me.

24
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,460
As for other matters,

25
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,380
I have my own considerations.

26
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,030
Tell me the truth then.

27
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,520
Why are you going to
Changchun Palace?

28
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,860
To approach Fu Heng...

29
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,220
and ask about the truth.

30
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,370
What if he was indeed the perpetrator?

31
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,600
No matter who harmed my older sister,

32
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,730
I will make him pay.

33
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,990
I really don't understand what
the Empress sees in you.

34
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,640
A little embroidery servant...

35
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,240
could actually be able
to reach the sky in a single bound...

36
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,100
and come to our Changchun Palace?

37
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,210
Don't think that by entering here
you'll become an attendant of the Empress.

38
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,420
You don't know anything yet.

39
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,180
It's still too early for that.

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,810
From now on, you must be careful
with your speech and actions.

41
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,270
Open your eyes wide and
look at how others are doing their jobs.

42
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,589
Don't show off outside
using the name of the Empress.

43
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,180
And most importantly,
don't invite trouble to the Empress too.

44
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,610
If I discover that you have,
I will punish you severely!

45
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,630
Yes.

46
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,310
What do I need to do now?

47
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,690
Sweep the courtyard.

48
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,300
By the way, don't touch the
jasmine flowers in the front courtyard.

49
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,060
They are the favourite of the Empress.

50
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,400
I usually have to care for them carefully.

51
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,430
Don't you go destroying them
with your clumsy hands!

52
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,170
Sister Ming Yu, don't worry.

53
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,300
I won't touch them.

54
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,490
What is she doing?

55
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,850
What are you all doing?

56
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,240
Go back to work!

57
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,030
Here.

58
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,340
Imperial Guard Fuca, you're here.

59
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,580
I will go inform Her Majesty now.

60
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,159
Imperial Guard Fuca!

61
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,310
Her Majesty asks that you go inside.

62
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,470
Imperial Guard Fuca, what is it?

63
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,550
Nothing. Let's go.

64
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,340
Imperial Guard Fuca.

65
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,510
What a coincidence.

66
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,510
It's not a coincidence.
I came to see you on purpose.

67
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,370
Do you need anything?

68
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,860
That jade pendant you dropped earlier...

69
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,860
belongs to me. I lost it previously.

70
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,120
This one?

71
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,800
May I ask...

73
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,640
how did you lose...

74
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,370
a precious jade pendant like this?

75
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,440
Everyone has a moment of carelessness.

76
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,180
I accidentally lost it.

77
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,780
-When?
-I can't remember anymore.

78
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,030
Where did you lose it?

79
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,210
Perhaps the Imperial Garden.

80
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,890
You should give it back to me now.

81
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,350
Now,

82
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,010
I still can't be sure...

83
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,720
that this jade pendant belongs to you.

84
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,410
On that jade pendant,

85
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,820
other than a carving of my surname, Fuca,

86
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,580
there is a small chipped-off portion
in its lower right-hand part.

87
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,200
I accidentally dropped it and caused that.

88
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,370
Look at it clearly.

89
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,000
The item is now back
with its rightful owner, Young Master.

90
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,340
What did you call me?

91
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,190
The Empress is my mistress.

92
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,360
You are her younger brother.

93
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,010
You are naturally my Young Master then.

94
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,990
Don't smile like that to men.
It's very disrespectful.

95
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,390
[Fuca Fu Heng, were you the one
who caused my older sister's death?]

96
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,040
Don't you have any shame?

97
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,520
In broad daylight, how dare you
seduce Imperial Guard Fuca?

98
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,000
You also know that it's broad daylight...

99
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,590
with so many eyes watching.

100
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,860
I only said a few words
with Imperial Guard Fuca.

101
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,840
How could that count as seducing?

102
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,310
How dare you talk back?

103
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,080
Sister Ming Yu,
if I did anything wrong,

104
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,810
you can punish me.

105
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,540
But if it's for no reason at all,
forgive me for not accepting your lecture.

106
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,440
Great, how dare
a low-life palace maid like you...

107
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,950
keep contradicting me!

108
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,450
I have belittled you.

109
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,610
Don't you want to work?
Then stop being idle.

110
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,430
Sweep the whole main hall!

111
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,590
I will check your progress later.

112
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,660
If there's one bit of dirt, I'll skin you!

113
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,640
Clean it again.

114
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,300
Yes.

115
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,840
Do you know about
Imperial Guard Fuca's family?

116
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,030
His ancestor achieved impressive
military feats and was conferred...

117
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,690
the title Duke Cheng En
of the First Rank after his death.

118
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,950
His uncle served three emperors
and is a top-ranked official.

119
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,560
His father is the supervisor of Chahar.

120
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,490
His older sister is the current Empress
who was chosen by the late Emperor.

121
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,450
The Fuca clan has always
been given imperial graces...

122
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,180
and flooded with good fortune.

123
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,100
He is His Majesty's reading partner...

124
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,390
and a future high official of the court.

125
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,200
How could a person like you
even dream of socialising with him?

126
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,780
-No, I didn't.
-Then don't talk to him.

127
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,880
-What are you laughing about?
-Nothing.

128
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,540
What are you laughing about?
Explain yourself!

129
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,870
If chatting with Imperial Guard Fuca is
considered as deliberately seducing him,

130
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,860
what about you then?

131
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,590
My conscience is clear.
Of course I'm different from you.

132
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,640
Yes, you and I are different.

133
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,860
-You...
- Ming Yu.

134
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,080
Er Qing, look at her.

135
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,590
She just arrived not long ago,
but she keeps answering back!

136
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,700
She's driving me mad!

137
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,160
I heard everything.

138
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,590
You should report it to the Empress...

139
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,790
so she can return to where she came from!

140
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,220
Imperial Guard Fuca frequently
comes to visit the Empress.

141
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,600
If he actively approached
Ying Luo to talk with her,

142
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,740
must she pretend to be deaf and mute?

143
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,790
You went overboard.

144
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,120
Er Qing.

145
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,260
Enough.

146
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,850
Ying Luo.

147
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,520
It's okay now, Ying Luo.
You did a great job.

148
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,880
Go back and rest.

149
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you, Sister Er Qing.

150
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,310
Er Qing, why did you defend her?

151
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,090
How am I defending her?

152
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,770
I'm defending you.

153
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,460
What do you mean?

154
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,150
She has a upright temperament
and she's not afraid to speak her mind.

155
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,660
If you two quarelled
and disturbed the Empress,

156
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,190
tell me, what would happen?

157
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,860
But I feel her intentions aren't pure.

158
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,270
She would create trouble sooner or later.

159
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,800
Changchun Palace is
a place of troubles to begin with.

160
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,730
If you want to make a foothold here,

161
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,500
you should at least be capable.

162
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,350
-Zhen Zhu, do you need my help?
-No need...

163
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,130
- Hu Po.
-No need. Hurry and leave.

164
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,520
Fei Cui.

165
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,630
Hu Po, we're really not minding her?

166
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,800
Sister Ming Yu gave instructions
that no one must talk with her.

167
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,160
Whoever disobeys it
will be punished with her.

168
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,780
But if we all don't talk to her,
she surely will get so bored.

169
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,860
Who told her to offend
Sister Ming Yu upon coming here?

170
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,810
Sister,

171
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,990
if that jade pendant happened
to be picked up by you,

172
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,790
based on your personality,

173
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,950
you surely will not claim it as your own.

174
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,750
[There is only one possibility.]

175
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,360
[Fu Heng...]

176
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,280
[was that person who raped my sister.]

177
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,170
Am I right?

178
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,150
Who told you to touch this?

179
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,650
The palace maids
in Changchun Palace have shifts.

180
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,420
I happen to be the one on duty today.

181
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,680
You have just been here for a few days.

182
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,420
It's not yet your turn
to attend to Her Majesty.

183
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,890
Just go and stay over there.

184
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,550
If I see you touching
the personal items of Her Majesty again,

185
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,800
I'll cut off the hand that touched it!

186
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,940
Ming Yu!

187
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,450
Why are you calling me?

188
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,390
Last night, there was a lunar halo.

189
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,830
This morning, there were
dark clouds in the east.

190
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,520
I fear that there might be rain today.
Those flowers in the inner courtyard...

191
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,620
I didn't see any lunar halo last night.

192
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,390
Today, the sky is clear and blue.

193
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,790
How can there be any rain?

194
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,240
You're dreaming.

195
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,630
Ming Yu,

196
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,120
why are you doing things like that now?

197
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,310
Today is Ying Luo's shift, right?
Why did she not come in?

198
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,440
Who knew where she went to idle around?

199
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,450
If not because I went ahead and asked,

200
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,050
Your Majesty wouldn't even
have any water to wash your face with.

201
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,070
Is she really that lazy?

202
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,020
It might be because she's new here
and still not used to the system.

203
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,500
Er Qing, you are being too nice.

204
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,390
You put in good words for everyone,
but they might not appreciate it.

205
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,580
That Wei Ying Luo
isn't good in anything other than talking.

206
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,340
Last time, I just lectured her a little...

207
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,680
and she dared to show me attitude.

208
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,640
Your Majesty, how could we let a person
like that stay in Changchun Palace?

209
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,480
Ming Yu.

210
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,160
Ming Yu, look.

211
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,090
There's now wind blowing.

212
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,740
If it really rains tonight,
what about these flowers?

213
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,990
Wind?

214
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,870
Where's the wind?

215
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,380
Be reasonable. Can't you feel the wind?

216
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,290
Hu Po!

217
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,310
Yes, Sister Ming Yu?

218
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,750
Ying Luo said there's wind blowing.
Do you feel any wind?

219
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,810
It's just a breeze.
What's there to be nervous about?

220
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,060
Hear that?

221
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,440
I think you're too free
and have nothing to do.

222
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,800
Don't even think about it.

223
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,540
Even if you continue to say it,
I won't let you attend to the Empress.

224
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,030
Hu Po, I have something to instruct you.

225
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,180
Yes.

226
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,900
Your Majesty,

227
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,260
that Wei Ying Luo...

228
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,190
did not do any work.
She just keeps loitering around.

229
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,600
I'm at my wits end.

230
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,090
Since I entered the palace,

231
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,180
I've never seen a servant
who's as disobedient as she is.

232
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,290
-Is that true?
-It is indeed.

233
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
Every day,
I waste so much time talking to her,

234
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,420
but she's hopelessly incompetent.

235
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,480
If that's really the case, tomorrow,

236
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,390
let her return to
the embroidery house.

237
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,850
Er Qing...

238
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,340
Your Majesty, I am here.

239
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,630
-Don't be afraid of the thunder.
- My flowers!

240
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,320
-Your Majesty!
-My flowers!

241
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,620
Don't you all have ears?
It's raining so hard!

242
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,530
You all are sleeping
more soundly than pigs!

243
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,130
-Hurry! Get some oilcloth!
-Yes.

244
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,610
Why are you all still standing there?
Hurry and help her!

245
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,370
Yes!

246
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,170
Your Majesty.

247
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,330
Cover that part too.

248
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,360
Hurry, cover it!

249
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,790
The lazy person you spoke of...

250
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,280
is braving the rain
to cover Her Majesty's flowers.

251
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,190
-What were you doing?
-I...

252
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,320
You...

253
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,850
Stop explaining.

254
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,810
Her Majesty understands
and sees everything.

255
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,690
You should stop speaking evil of others.

256
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,520
We should unite and help each other out
in taking care of Her Majesty.

257
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,320
Let me give you a piece of advice,

258
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,960
if you talk too much,
you surely will make a mistake.

259
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,530
-Cover this up.
-Okay.

260
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,240
Hurry.

261
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,530
Okay.

262
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,290
We're done.

263
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,620
Ying Luo, why are you here?

264
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,880
This is ginger soup that I just cooked.

265
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,070
Hurry, drink it while it's hot.

266
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,750
When did you cook it?

267
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,040
Earlier, there weren't enough oilcloths.

268
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,970
I went to the storeroom to get some.

269
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,300
When I returned to the tea room,
I suddenly remembered it.

270
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,510
Drink the ginger soup while it's hot.

271
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,370
Drive the cold away,
so you won't get sick.

272
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,450
I'll go back now.

273
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:51,600
Actually, I feel that
Ying Luo is a nice girl.

274
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,740
Yes. Indeed, we're a bit harsh on her.

275
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,980
She wants to win
people's hearts with a little favour?

276
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,190
You're all fools.

277
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,270
Hu Po,

278
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,710
just drink this ginger soup.

279
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,740
Or else, you'll get sick tomorrow.

280
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,150
Come here.

281
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,090
Are you deaf?

282
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,810
Her Highness is calling you!

283
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,620
Do you need an urging invitation?

284
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,850
Greetings, Your Highness the Noble Consort
and Imperial Concubine Jia.

285
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:20,170
I heard it was you that presented
the deer tail thread to Empress.

286
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,570
You're not dumb at all.

287
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,310
Looks like you deceived me...

288
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,610
on purpose last time.

289
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,090
I wouldn't dare.

290
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,420
The hunter is chasing
the sparrow all day...

291
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,120
but ends up having his eyes pecked out
by the sparrow instead.

292
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,600
Good.

293
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,460
Very good.

294
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,880
Everyone in the palace says
you have a clever mouth.

295
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,330
You can even flatter the Empress.

296
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,010
Attendants, bind her.

297
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,190
Cut her tongue off,
we'll see how she can flatter after this.

298
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,960
Your Highness, please listen to me.

299
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,490
I despise seeing you.

300
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,360
I don't want
to waste words with you. Start.

301
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,960
If you make a move in Changchun Palace,

302
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,290
you are dishonoring the Empress.

303
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,840
Do you all want to die?

304
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,980
-Let go of me.
-I will bear all the responsibility.

305
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,460
Cut her tongue off!

306
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,520
Who dares to do so?

307
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,000
Ying Luo.

308
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,650
Your Majesty.

309
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,150
Noble Consort Gao.

310
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,850
This is Changchun Palace
and not Chuxiu Palace.

311
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,620
When did it become your turn
to bark out orders here?

312
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,620
This servant disobeyed
her superior, so she deserves to die.

313
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,260
Your Majesty.

314
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,360
The Noble Consort came in...

315
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,560
and without a second word,
she wanted to cut my tongue off.

316
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,140
I still don't understand
what I did exactly...

317
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,600
to anger her.

318
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,730
May Your Majesty investigate!

319
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,120
Imperial Concubine Jia, say it.

320
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,270
Your Majesty,

321
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,800
this servant acted like
she was dumb at Chuxiu Palace before.

322
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,320
She deceived Noble Consort on purpose.

323
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,330
Imperial Concubine Jia.

324
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,040
That day, at Chuxiu Palace,

325
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,260
did I actually say I was dumb?

326
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,310
You didn't say that, but your actions did.

327
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,870
Then, I didn't really...

328
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,190
deceive her, Your Majesty.

329
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,560
Your Majesty was the one that found
my appearance to be dumb.

330
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,660
But that's not something I can help.

331
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,960
Maybe I was just born looking dumb.

332
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,040
They are unhappy
and pestered in their sight by me.

333
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,770
But...

334
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,960
even if I look dumb,

335
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,290
it isn't my fault.

336
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,360
Your Majesty,

337
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,450
I was wronged unfairly.

338
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,560
I'm just bothered
by the sight of this servant.

339
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,190
Can't I punish her?

340
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,820
-Er Qing.
-I'm here.

341
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,480
Say it.

342
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,250
Your Majesty,

343
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,870
there are rules installed.

344
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,220
Any palace maid
who commits a wrongdoing...

345
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,460
must be reported to the mistress
of the palace for her to handle it.

346
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,390
Wei Ying Luo belongs to Changchun Palace.

347
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,260
No matter what she did,
you have to report to the Empress first.

348
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,730
No one else can
claim authority on their own.

349
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,260
Naturally, the Empress Dowager
and the Emperor are exceptions.

350
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,250
If Noble Consort Gao
received a royal decree,

351
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,080
even if you wish
to kill Wei Ying Luo today,

352
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,990
Changchun Palace
will not say another word.

353
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,000
Noble Consort Gao.

354
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,750
Did you hear that clearly?

355
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,260
If Your Majesty insists
on sheltering your own servant,

356
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,050
naturally I can't do anything.

357
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,990
But there's a saying
I'd like to remind you of.

358
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,000
When you want to keep a dog,
you have to keep your eyes clear.

359
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:59,440
You must know the difference
between a dog and a wolf.

360
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,390
Don't invite a wolf into your home
and get yourself bitten by the wolf.

361
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,480
You'll lose more than you gain.

362
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,160
Thank you for your thoughtfulness,
Noble Consort Gao.

363
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,820
I have my own arrangements...

364
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,440
for Changchun Palace's matters.

365
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,210
Noble Consort Gao,
did you come here today...

366
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,720
just to punish a palace maid?

367
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,260
I heard Your Majesty's health
wasn't well so I came to check on you.

368
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,190
I am very well.

369
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,690
Very healthy.

370
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,920
You don't have to worry.

371
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,190
If there's nothing else,

372
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,490
please return.

373
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,180
Please excuse me.

374
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,720
Please excuse me.

375
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,160
-Rise.
-Yes.

376
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,260
Ying Luo,

377
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,520
Noble Consort Gao has
a domineering personality.

378
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,770
But I've never seen her
acting that wild in Changchun Palace.

379
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,710
How did you anger her?

380
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,060
Your Majesty,

381
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,760
Noble Consort Gao gifted
a loquat ointment to Noble Lady Yu.

382
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,090
It was me who told Noble Lady Yu
that young leaves of loquat are poisonous.

383
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,960
Noble Consort Gao
became furious upon finding out.

384
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,540
So she dragged me to Chuxiu Palace.

385
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,780
So...

386
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,660
you acted like you were crazy
and dumb to fool her?

387
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,780
Yes.

388
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,490
You even dare to fool her.

389
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,530
No wonder she was so angry today.

390
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,530
That means my transferring you
to Changchun Palace...

391
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,840
actually saved your life.

392
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,820
I am forever grateful...

393
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,460
for Your Majesty's gracious mercy.

394
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,060
Rise.

395
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
Yes.

396
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,240
Ying Luo, you are a clever girl.

397
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,830
But Noble Consort Gao
has a domineering personality.

398
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,660
Today she ran into a wall here.

399
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,000
But she will not stop easily.

400
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,220
You must be extra careful.

401
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,760
Yes.

402
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,460
Your Majesty...

403
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,250
You suffered a chill yesterday.

404
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,360
Let's return to rest now.

405
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,290
How dare she fool me!

406
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,860
Noble Consort,
no need to be angry over a servant.

407
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,680
Don't let it harm your health.

408
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,010
A servant?

409
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,900
I've never met such a pompous servant.

410
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,560
Now she's relying on the Empress.

411
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,950
She has no fear of me.

412
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,120
Your Highness.

413
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:06,050
The way I see it, that Wei Ying Luo
is just a minor character.

414
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,750
Killing her would only
relieve your anger for the moment.

415
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,870
So if Empress likes her, let her keep her.

416
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,710
She's just a servant.

417
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,440
She won't be a major obstacle
to Your Highness.

418
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,560
This is a small matter?

419
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,370
Then what is considered a large matter?

420
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,440
Noble Consort.

421
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,290
Noble Lady Yu
hasn't left her palace in a long time.

422
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,760
She's so scared, just like a mouse.
No need to mention her.

423
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,940
She got so scared...

424
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,280
that she doesn't even dare
to leave Yonghe Palace's gate.

425
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,680
As the wise saying goes, it's best
to remove the root to be rid of weed...

426
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,040
or it will leave future disasters.

427
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,580
She's just a coward.

428
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,360
Why fear her?

429
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,910
You are so right, Your Highness.

430
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,330
Noble Lady Yu needs no mention.

431
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,360
But don't forget, Your Highness.

432
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,420
Noble Lady Yu has
a precious heir in her belly.

433
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,220
It hasn't been born yet.

434
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,710
Nobody knows if it's a girl or boy.

435
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,810
It's always wise to play safe.

436
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,660
Third Prince and
Second Prince left in a row.

437
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,220
Now, His Majesty only has
First Prince and Fourth Prince left.

438
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,660
Empress Dowager
has been looking forward to it.

439
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,610
If Noble Lady Yu gives birth to a prince,

440
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,950
she will have a new life completely.

441
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,410
Imperial Lady Jia.

442
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,750
You are rushing me
to knock off Noble Lady Yu all the time.

443
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,500
Are you really thinking for my sake,

444
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,290
or for your own son?

445
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,350
Noble Consort,
I am the mother of Fourth Prince.

446
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,530
As the mother,
of course I need to think for my child.

447
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,500
But what I said was
more out of concern for Your Highness.

448
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,270
Please regard this.

449
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,470
What was Noble Lady Yu and
Imperial Concubine Yi's relationship?

450
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,210
They were like sisters,
loyal to each other.

451
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,690
How did Imperial Concubine Yi die?

452
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,730
I just fear she will never forget it.

453
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,610
When she's raised to a new height,

454
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,810
wouldn't she come seek you for trouble?

455
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,360
Then, your suggestion is...

456
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,140
This Imperial Concubine Yi is dead.

457
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,060
Noble Lady Yu is so upset.

458
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,730
She might follow suit, and that's natural.

459
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,670
Do you agree, Your Highness?

460
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,170
Your Majesty. Consort Xian
made these shoes for you herself.

461
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,640
Look at how delicate the workmanship is.

462
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,360
We have an embroidery house in the palace.

463
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,420
She's not a seamstress,
so she needn't do this anymore.

464
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,960
Summon Zhang Ting Yu and Ortai.

465
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,330
Yes.

466
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,620
Supervisor Li!

467
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,720
Does His Majesty like those shoes?

468
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,480
His Majesty said there's
an embroidery house in the palace,

469
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,740
so Consort Xian needn't bother anymore,

470
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,620
so she doesn't harm her sight.
I have matters to tend to. I've got to go!

471
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,280
Supervisor Li.

472
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,560
Supervisor Li!

473
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,880
Zhang Ting Yu.

474
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,410
Do you know your offense?

475
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:02,850
Your Majesty.

476
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:06,560
I wasn't involved in
Oshan's acceptance of a bribe.

477
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,190
-That was a false report.
-A false report?

478
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,650
You and Oshan are very close.

479
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,300
Everyone knows that.

480
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,510
If not for that,

481
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,580
why would you...

482
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,699
be the first to be implicated
when Oshan's crime was discovered?

483
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,449
Zhang Ting Yu...

484
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,710
I thought you were righteous and brave.

485
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,510
But now you're colluding
for power garnering.

486
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,010
You forgot all about your prudence before.

487
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,639
How pompous are you!

488
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:52,100
Your Majesty, I don't dare to do so.

489
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,020
I never joined any clique,

490
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,620
and I never would dare to.

491
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,810
You don't dare to?

492
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,740
No, I would never dare!

493
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,670
Ortai, are you not guilty?

494
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,550
Your Majesty, Zhong Yong Tan
wants to impeach Oshan.

495
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,030
The guilty one...

496
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,280
should be Oshan who took a bribe.
He should be punished.

497
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,640
I never had any
acquaintance with him...

498
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,920
and we are in no clique
together whatsoever.

499
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,090
What is my crime?

500
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,860
You aren't acquainted
with the criminal Oshan.

501
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,130
But Zhong Yong Tan
who reported the incident is your student.

502
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,890
You taught Zhang Yong Tan
to impeach Oshan...

503
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,630
and dragged Zhang Ting Yu down alongside.

504
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,040
You are using corruption charges
to strike out a dissident.

505
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,320
And you want to remove yourself...

506
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,800
from this crime I named?

507
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,060
Your Majesty...

508
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,930
I deserve to die.
May Your Majesty forgive me!

509
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,360
Correct.

510
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,740
You are a trusted subject
of the late Emperor.

511
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,540
I could employ you in the past...

512
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,690
and forgive you today,

513
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,580
but does that mean I can't
prosecute your crime in the future?

514
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,470
Oshan received heavy royal favour.

515
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,000
But he polluted the royal laws...

516
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,440
and his shamelessness pains me.

517
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,320
If I show mercy,

518
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,290
how can I guide the court?

519
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,590
Everyone involved in this case will be
brought to the Ministry of Justice.

520
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,780
Order them and the rest of the Yamens
to investigate with the nine ministers.

521
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,100
I shall follow your order...

522
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:49,310
You two were heavily favoured
by the late Emperor.

523
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,800
The late Emperor bequeathed me
the order to...

524
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,980
enshrine you in the
Imperial Ancestral Temple.

525
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,590
How lofty is that trust and honour.

526
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,590
It's due to your lofty positions
and high powers,

527
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,350
that even if you hold no thought
of collusion with a clique,

528
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:11,220
many will try to flatter you
with vain words.

529
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,720
Just a miss in prudence...

530
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,760
and you will become factionists,

531
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,450
forced to do harm to the nation
for the sake of power fight.

532
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,780
I...

533
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,110
don't want to witness such an occurrence.

534
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,420
So I am giving you a reminder.

535
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,730
Cherish my trust.

536
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,720
Cherish your robes.

537
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,570
Thank you, Your Majesty.

538
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,490
You are dismissed.

539
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,770
Yes.

540
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,010
Your Majesty.

541
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,750
I am finished with my words.

542
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,600
I hope they were reminded...

543
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,800
not to slide into an abyss.

544
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,720
I believe the two ministers
are smart and can see the point.

545
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,320
It's because they are smart that they err!

546
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,710
Is Grand Secretary Gao Bin a fool then?

547
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,450
He knew clearly
I hate high ministers factionising.

548
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,830
But he still became Ortai's factionist.

549
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,690
Your Majesty, you really will kill Oshan?

550
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,000
Kill them.

551
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,970
No one from this case...

552
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,540
will be spared.

553
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,990
I want everyone to see clearly...

554
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,270
what imperial fury looks like.

555
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,390
Your Highness.

556
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,830
You've toiled all day.

557
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,870
Let's stop.

558
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,170
It's getting hot now.

559
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,300
His Majesty sweats easily.

560
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,410
I made light sole pads...

561
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,630
for him to put in his shoes.

562
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,380
It will be very cooling.

563
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,740
What's wrong?

564
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,500
Nothing.

565
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,730
Your Highness, stop making them.

566
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,940
No matter how you make them, no one cares.

567
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,870
You were fine before
but what's wrong with you today?

568
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,920
His Majesty didn't
recognise your hard work!

569
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,310
He thought you were like others,
just putting on a show.

570
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,440
Do you think I'm putting on a show too?

571
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,930
Of course not.

572
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:25,060
You made His Majesty's inner clothes
personally for all seasons.

573
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,540
And you often say the work
from the embroidery house lacks detail.

574
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,430
They only care about a showy appearance
but ignore how uncomfortable it may be.

575
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:36,250
So you made them yourself,

576
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,920
toiling along with each stitch.

577
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,770
Not just me,

578
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,910
even your mother said
you are foolish for not fighting.

579
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:48,120
If this is called putting on a show,
then what is sincerity?

580
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,220
Since you already know,
why are you stopping me?

581
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,170
You're too good.

582
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:57,110
So I can't stand His Majesty ignoring you.

583
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:01,080
Such a grand Forbidden City and
no one is as devoted to him as you are!

584
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,200
And he doesn't even care about you.

585
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,120
Enough. Don't say anymore now.

586
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,640
I don't care what others say,

587
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,420
as long as I know what I'm doing.

588
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:18,660
Consort Xian, Madam came into the palace.

589
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,390
Big trouble!

590
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,380
Big trouble, daughter!

591
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,940
-Hurry, save your brother.
-What happened?

592
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,710
You mean my brother
was involved in the Oshan bribery case?

593
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,640
You know your brother is so immature.

594
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,910
He's always idling around.

595
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,830
Your father is only
devoted to his work.

596
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,470
He doesn't think of him.

597
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:51,750
So without any other means,
he went and acquainted with Oshan.

598
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,300
Was that getting acquainted?

599
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,090
He helped Meng Lu Zhan
send 10,000 taels...

600
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,400
to Oshan and received 1000 taels himself.

601
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,030
That was bribery.

602
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,180
What bribery?

603
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,800
It was just two families
fighting for assets.

604
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,070
Someone asked him
to ask Commander O about it.

605
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,930
It's not actually bribery.

606
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,180
Delivering money to officers is bribery.

607
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,510
Mother, you are too confused.

608
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,080
Fine. Your brother knows his mistake.

609
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,140
Now he's locked up in the main prison.

610
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,320
Go plead the case with His Majesty.

611
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,450
Save your brother, please.

612
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:31,530
I vow to you, I will never
let him get involved again.

613
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,900
Mother.

614
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,470
Oshan was promoted from
the Nine Gates Infantry Commander...

615
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,060
to the Minister of War.

616
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,810
His Majesty trusted
him and favoured him so much,

617
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,740
but he's also in the main prison now.

618
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:44,500
This is His Majesty warning everyone
he is bent on tidying up the court.

619
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,300
If I go seek mercy
from His Majesty now,

620
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,880
that is asking too much.

621
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,420
Too much from His Majesty?

622
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:53,170
That's better than your brother dying.

623
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,510
-I won't go.
-What did you say?

624
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,770
I can't go.

625
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,280
Even if you have to kneel and beg,

626
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,360
you must ask
His Majesty to spare your brother!

627
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,910
-Madam.
-No. I won't go.

628
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,790
-Don't do that.
-Go away!

629
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,100
Mother.

630
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,800
What are you doing? Please get up.

631
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,600
You are His Majesty's consort.

632
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,650
As your parents,
we never benefited from that.

633
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,400
But we've instead behaved more prudent...

634
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,020
and careful so we do not
implicate your honour.

635
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,250
You aren't willing
to help your father's promotion,

636
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,920
and I am fine with it.

637
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,750
But you must save your brother.

638
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,180
He's my only son.

639
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:31,580
I can't bury my child.
