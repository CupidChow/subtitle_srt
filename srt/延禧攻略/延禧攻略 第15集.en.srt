1
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
A relative of the Emperor is indeed special.

2
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,360
After committing a mistake, he is allowed to attend the offering ceremony.

3
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,160
Hailancha.

4
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,760
By the way,

5
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,130
you're also a relative of His Majesty,

6
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,360
but you don't have those stinky traits of Hongxiao.

7
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,240
It shows

8
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,560
that the noble title of "Prince Yi”

9
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,960
isn't anything special.

10
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,900
Don’t gossip in chitchat.

11
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,640
What happened?

12
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,360
He’s in such a rush.

13
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,050
Your Majesty...

14
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,250
Investigate it.

15
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,240
Yes.

16
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,170
What's going on?

17
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,480
Your Majesty, we found it.

18
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,280
Hongxiao,

19
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,120
why does the Qing dynasty share the blessings by eating meat?

20
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,240
Do you remember it?

21
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,400
I do.

22
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Emperor Taizu had to be separated from his family at a young age.

23
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,960
He brought his brothers into the mountain to pick ginseng and hunt.

24
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,080
They survived by cooking meat in boiling water.

25
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,720
Afterwards, we maintained this tradition.

26
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,440
After our ancestors crossed Shanhaiguan,

27
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,760
Palace of Earthly Tranquility holds offering ceremonies in the morning and at night,

28
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,000
and one major offering ceremony every three months.

29
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
This is to help the Qing descendants

30
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,920
remember the hardships of our ancestors

31
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,720
in establishing a great undertaking.

32
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,120
Since you know it,

33
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,200
why did you add salt to the meat?

34
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,080
Add salt?

35
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,520
I didn't!

36
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,720
Taste it yourself.

37
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,850
Our ancestors could endure it,

38
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,680
and you can’t.

39
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,040
Adding salt to sacrificial meat

40
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,600
is clearly disrespectful to our ancestors

41
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,800
and the gods.

42
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,720
You are too bold!

43
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,920
Somebody!

44
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,960
Prince Yi disrespected the ancestors and tainted the sacrificial meat.

45
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,620
His position as a Guard of the Gate of Celestial Purity is revoked.

46
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,360
Hand him to the Imperial Clan Court

47
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,160
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, I didn't!

48
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,960
Your Majesty,

49
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,040
I didn't bring any salt into the Palace!

50
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,560
Your Majesty, I'm innocent.

51
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,360
Your Majesty,

52
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,680
Your Majesty,

53
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,520
I’m innocent.

54
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,780
Doing offering ceremonies day and night, sharing the sacrificial meat,

55
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,640
these are blessings from our ancestors,

56
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,300
and protection from the gods.

57
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,420
But those descendants of the eight banners,

58
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,080
headed by Prince Yi,

59
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,680
who were previously valiant and skillful in warfare,

60
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,800
are now insects that rely on their ancestors' merits.

61
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,930
They just play with birds or walk dogs.

62
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Not to say fighting enemies,

63
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,880
eating sacrificial meat

64
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,420
is already a hard task to them.

65
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,960
I have to warn all of you.

66
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,000
The establishment of the Qing Dynasty wasn’t easy.

67
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,640
I will never allow

68
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,040
this great empire

69
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,960
to get destroyed in the hands of a group of prodigal sons

70
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,090
who only know how to seek pleasure and are disrespectful to our ancestors!

71
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,960
Investigate!

72
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,140
Investigate the guards outside too!

73
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,880
I want to look clearly who else

74
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,010
dares to do such a thing!

75
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,920
Yes.

76
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,080
Start.

77
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,360
Isn’t it ridiculous?

78
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,960
When are you servants

79
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,800
allowed to investigate us?

80
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,480
Hailancha.

81
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,570
Lords, sorry to offend you.

82
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,160
Start.

83
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,040
Master Fuheng, please.

84
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,440
Your Majesty.

85
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Did you catch any?

86
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,800
The imperial bodyguards and guards of the Gate of Celestial Purity

87
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,480
have all been checked.

88
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,890
No one else is found to have played a trick.

89
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,820
Fortunately there are sensible people.

90
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,000
Continue to eat the meat.

91
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,680
Yes.

92
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,320
May all lords continue to eat the meat.

93
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,480
Why wasn’t Fuheng caught?

94
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,120
Young Master,

95
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,210
are you alright?

96
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,360
I was so scared.

97
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,520
Prince Yi got demoted and sent for investigation

98
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,980
just for hiding some salt.

99
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,480
He was even sent to the Imperial Clan Court.

100
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,840
If I've known it earlier,

101
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,700
I shouldn't have told you to bring that spiced salt.

102
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,480
Good thing you didn't bring it today.

103
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,640
So

104
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,490
you noticed it beforehand.

105
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,160
You told on Prince Yi?

106
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,800
Yes.

107
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,480
You...

108
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,880
I what?

109
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,120
Are you going to tell me that I shouldn't have told on him

110
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,450
because he's a prince of the Qing Dynasty,

111
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,480
a descendant of the royal family, and has a noble status?

112
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,680
So when he told me to kneel, I must kneel.

113
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,680
When he called me bitch, I just have to accept all that.

114
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,480
Is that so?

115
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,320
Listen now.

116
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,840
I indeed came from a lowly family,

117
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,570
but I won't let anyone bully me.

118
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,840
He is a prince, after all.

119
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,640
Things in this world change.

120
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,680
Peaking mountain ridges

121
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,400
might become a boundless plain in the future.

122
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,060
Change is the only constant thing in this world.

123
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,820
You seek vengeance for the smallest grudge,

124
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,900
and are extremely audacious.

125
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,840
I just wanted to give him a lesson.

126
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,700
I'm telling him

127
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,400
that an ant can shake an elephant.

128
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,360
Any bully

129
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,600
will eventually get bullied.

130
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,880
What about me?

131
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,440
You escaped

132
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,000
because you were doubtful of me?

133
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,680
No.

134
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,370
I just didn’t want to disobey the teachings of my ancestors.

135
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,770
So I threw away the spiced salt.

136
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
On the outside,

137
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,400
you are indeed a gentleman.

138
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,970
But how could a gentleman ruin the chastity of a girl?

139
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,010
You repeatedly schemed against me

140
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
because of Ah-Man, right?

141
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,160
Yes.

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,080
If I tell you

143
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,620
that I didn't do it,

144
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,120
will you believe me?

145
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,240
You think I will?

146
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,650
I can swear by the heaven

147
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
that this matter had nothing to do with me.

148
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,770
If you don't believe me,

149
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,920
you can kill me now.

150
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,800
You think I wouldn't dare!

151
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,520
You would.

152
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,440
Is there anything in this world that you won't dare do?

153
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,880
But no is no.

154
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,300
I didn't hurt your sister.

155
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,640
I didn't hurt Ah-Man.

156
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,490
If you don't believe me,

157
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,640
you can use this dagger

158
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,680
to stab my chest.

159
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,360
Yingluo,

160
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,130
I'm saying it again.

161
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,160
I would never do anything offensive to god or conscience.

162
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,120
I never have.

163
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,520
Sister,

164
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,160
sorry.

165
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,000
I wasn't able to kill him.

166
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,360
But this is the Imperial Palace.

167
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,400
If I really kill someone,

168
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,040
what about father?

169
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Even so,

170
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,500
I've already committed a grave mistake.

171
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,860
I can't continue staying here in Palace of Eternal Spring.

172
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,040
Her Majesty wants to see you.

173
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,760
I knew it.

174
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,240
You will eventually fall and get smashed into pieces.

175
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,040
Wei Yingluo,

176
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,850
do you admit your fault?

177
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,320
Yingluo,

178
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,810
Her Majesty rarely gets angry.

179
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,320
Tell her the truth.

180
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,440
It's already too late to admit it.

181
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,760
After committing such a grave mistake,

182
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,220
just wait to get beheaded!

183
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,680
It was my own doing

184
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,680
and didn't involve anyone else.

185
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,920
I earnestly ask Your Majesty to just punish me.

186
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,920
You, oh, you!

187
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,960
Did you eat something bold, maybe a bear?

188
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,620
How come you are not fat at all?

189
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,260
Stop laughing.

190
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,640
You can't see Yingluo suffer.

191
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,160
She exposed the wrongdoings of Prince Yi,

192
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,960
but you can't bear to punish her.

193
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,100
When Prince Yi framed Yingluo last time,

194
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,240
he was slapping our Palace of Eternal Spring.

195
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,000
Of course, I'm unhappy with him.

196
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,130
I also hoped that he could be punished.

197
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,360
But he's after all a cousin of His Majesty.

198
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,760
If His Majesty doesn't allow it, I can't castigate him.

199
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,320
But this person is so bold!

200
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,840
You even dared touch a prince!

201
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,160
Your Majesty is scolding me

202
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,480
just for this?

203
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,400
Is there anything else?

204
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,520
Did Fuheng not tell Her Majesty?

205
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,000
How is this possible?

206
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,400
You're really something, Wei Yingluo.

207
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,460
What else did you do? Quickly tell me,

208
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,500
so that I won't get shocked again!

209
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,930
How did you know about this?

210
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,440
How did I know?

211
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,330
Fuheng wrote me a letter

212
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,280
saying that you were extremely audacious

213
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,010
and asked me to discipline you.

214
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,140
Isn't he doing this for your good?

215
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,480
Or else, don't know what other troubles you would start.

216
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,540
Guard Fuca didn't say anything else?

217
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,680
Who is Imperial Guard Fuca?

218
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,960
You think he has the time to care about you?

219
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,200
His Majesty might be happy to see it.

220
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,280
What do you mean?

221
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,880
High officials have disliked the sacrificial meat

222
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,240
and employed tricks to eat it

223
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,360
for a long time.

224
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,400
His Majesty used the incident of punishing Prince Yi

225
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
to warn others from following suit.

226
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,930
Or else, he could have just denounced him.

227
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,720
Why must he send him to the Imperial Clan Court?

228
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,320
Wei Yingluo!

229
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,960
Even if what you said is true,

230
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,960
if you are too particular about every detail in everything,

231
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,820
you won't be able to live happily.

232
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,120
Take a step back and you'll be able to appreciate how vast the world is.

233
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,320
I'm punishing you to write the word "forgiveness"

234
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,240
100 times!

235
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,360
Your Majesty,

236
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,860
she is this audacious,

237
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,810
and you're going to let her off?

238
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
I just taught her to take a step back.

239
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,000
Now, if I punish her harshly,

240
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,160
isn't that going against what I said?

241
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,320
You keep being biased to her, and harboring her!

242
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,000
Mingyu.

243
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,680
What happened here today

244
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,880
is known to only the four of us.

245
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,960
No one can leak it.

246
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,040
Remember.

247
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,480
It must not be disclosed.

248
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,040
Or else,

249
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,460
I will not easily forgive you.

250
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,560
Yes.

251
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,480
Yes.

252
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,440
Go now.

253
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,560
Yes.

254
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,640
Wait.

255
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,740
May Your Majesty give your order.

256
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,640
Fuheng was injured when he was practicing martial-arts.

257
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
I'm very worried.

258
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,580
Help me deliver some ginseng soup to him.

259
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,760
Your Majesty, let me do it.

260
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,640
You?

261
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,240
If you go, you won't be back in two hours.

262
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,170
You'll be embarrassing yourself.

263
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,570
Yingluo, you go.

264
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,000
Come back quickly.

265
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,360
Yes.

266
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,610
You said that you got hurt on the martial-arts arena?

267
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,000
How come I didn't know that?

268
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,760
I was accidentally hurt during a dueling practice.

269
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,120
You've been nagging for so long. Aren't you tired?

270
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,980
Can't be right.

271
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,490
You are an imperial bodyguard.

272
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,720
Could any guard of the Gate of Celestial Purity

273
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,960
hurt you?

274
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,530
Unless he used a sinister move.

275
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,880
Tell me who it was.

276
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,290
I'll handle him for you.

277
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,680
I must admit defeat for bet.

278
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,610
This is my business. Stay out of it.

279
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,880
Ungrateful!

280
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,600
Miss Yingluo.

281
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,220
What brought you here?

282
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,010
Her Majesty ordered me to deliver you some ginseng soup.

283
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,060
Now I've delivered it,

284
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,420
I'll take my leave.

285
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,160
Miss Yingluo,

286
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,520
didn't Her Majesty instruct you

287
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,580
to do other things?

288
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,920
What?

289
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,800
Of course it's to express sympathy

290
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,440
to the injured guard Fuca.

291
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,680
I'll leave you alone. Alone.

292
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,850
Why didn't you tell Her Majesty

293
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,000
that I hurt you?

294
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,800
I didn't hurt Ah-Man.

295
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,840
Since my conscience is clear,

296
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,520
the truth will come out sooner or later.

297
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,050
You think that small favors

298
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,520
can win my belief?

299
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,080
Listen,

300
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,400
I'm a stone-hearted person.

301
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,440
I will never believe just because of a few words.

302
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,680
Yingluo, let me say it again.

303
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,720
I never hurt your sister.

304
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,120
And I don't want to...

305
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,050
I don't want to hurt you.

306
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,200
When I asked you the first time

307
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,250
that if you knew Ah-Man,

308
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,170
why did you pretend not to know her?

309
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Ah-Man's case

310
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,000
caused quite a stir in the Forbidden City.

311
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,730
Even after she left the palace,

312
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,850
the rumors didn't easily die down.

313
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,460
I heard about this matter,

314
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,400
but I have never seen her.

315
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,800
Of course, I would say that I didn't know her.

316
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,400
Why did she have your jade pendant?

317
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,600
I lost that jade pendant.

318
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,400
But as to why it ended up with her,

319
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,480
I don't know.

320
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,440
Does every word

321
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,940
come from your sincere heart,

322
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,760
and none is false?

323
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,810
There's no need to deceive you.

324
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,680
If I was the murderer,

325
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,810
I can tell it to Her Majesty.

326
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,200
You think you'd have the chance to seek vengeance?

327
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,080
Ok.

328
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,250
I'll temporarily believe you.

329
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,640
If one day,

330
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,820
I learn that you're lying,

331
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,000
you’ll pay with your life even if I have turned into an evil ghost.

332
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,720
Wait!

333
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,640
What else do you need?

334
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,760
When you were seeking vengeance on me,

335
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,960
you were always courteous and smiling.

336
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,120
Now you think I'm useless,

337
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,840
you immediately disdain to care about me.

338
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,120
Yingluo, are you a face changer?

339
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,200
I suspected you

340
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,540
after your first move.

341
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,760
After that,

342
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,930
I saw your kindness towards Snowball.

343
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,530
I then fooled myself again.

344
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,400
Yingluo,

345
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,840
it has never been you who has deceived me.

346
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,040
It was I who have been deceiving myself.

347
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,560
Young Master,

348
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,880
sorry

349
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,060
that I hurt you.

350
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,700
I don't accept apologies.

351
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,560
I only accept

352
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,360
action.

353
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,260
Didn't Her Majesty order you to deliver me soup?

354
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,280
I'm injured.

355
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,600
So?

356
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,120
My chest is injured.

357
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,720
The imperial doctor said that I must lie in bed for recuperation.

358
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,050
I can't even lift my arm.

359
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,280
May I ask Miss Yingluo to condescend and take care of me?

360
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,020
You want me to feed you?

361
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,060
That is the right attitude to take care of a patient.

362
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,780
And the right attitude to apologize for one's mistake.

363
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,720
It's hot.

364
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,560
Yingluo,

365
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,890
I've been recalling in my mind.

366
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,780
every word that you said to me,

367
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,840
and every smile you showed me.

368
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,960
Even though I knew that you were lying,

369
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,290
I refused to believe it.

370
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,960
Tell me,

371
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,360
you stabbed only a tenth of the dagger into my chest

372
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,760
because you were worried of getting in trouble if you kill me,

373
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,700
or because you also have a bit of sincere feeling for me?

374
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,720
Young Master,

375
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,160
your current action

376
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,450
is a bit inappropriate.

377
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,160
Intimate lovers being sweet with each other.

378
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,040
You two got caught by me.

379
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,040
Palace of Eternal Spring is busy.

380
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,100
I'll get going now.

381
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,920
Don't go!

382
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,200
I'm just joking!

383
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,720
Sorry, buddy.

384
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,600
Who’d know that she couldn’t be teased?

385
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,160
I’ll feed you.

386
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,440
It's fine. You have me.

387
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,480
Open your mouth.

388
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,540
I'll do it on my own.

389
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,720
It's hot.

390
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,680
It hurts!

391
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,970
Enough, enough.

392
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,320
Let go!

393
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,400
Fuca Fuheng,

394
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,280
can I trust you?

395
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,440
- Fourth Prince, stop messing around. - Here.

396
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,800
- Fourth Prince. - Be good and take your medicine.

397
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,660
Fourth Prince.

398
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,740
Fourth Prince.

399
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,620
What's wrong with Yongcheng?

400
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,690
Imperial Consort Xian.

401
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,170
Imperial Consort Xian, Fourth Prince caught a cold,

402
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,920
but he refused to take in any of the medicine

403
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
prescribed by the imperial doctor.

404
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,440
A small child won't like taking medicines.

405
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,720
Ask the imperial doctor

406
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,920
if he can increase the dose of licorice,

407
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,280
so that Fourth Prince will take it in.

408
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,080
Quickly go.

409
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,040
Yes.

410
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,560
Yongcheng, what's wrong?

411
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,810
I don't want you, bad woman!

412
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,560
I want mother! I want mother!

413
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,840
Imperial Consort Xian, please forgive him.

414
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,080
Fourth Prince is young and insensible.

415
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,560
If he offended you,

416
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,640
I'm apologizing on his behalf.

417
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,680
Prince is young, but you are not.

418
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
What "bad woman"?

419
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,690
Who taught him those words?

420
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,370
Forget it, Zhen'er.

421
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,280
It's just normal for a child this young

422
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,160
to miss his mother.

423
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,180
Don't make a fuss with a child.

424
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,960
Empress!

425
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,640
Yongcheng, Yongcheng!

426
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,320
Yongcheng, Yongcheng!

427
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,520
Mother’s here!

428
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,120
Come, Yongcheng.

429
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,720
Yongcheng,

430
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,740
Yongcheng, look at me.

431
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,880
My god,

432
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,300
it's just a couple of days.

433
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,440
How come you've gotten thinner?

434
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,050
How did you take care of him?

435
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,720
A prince is precious.

436
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,410
How could you mistreat him?

437
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,680
Consort, I dare not.

438
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,160
I've been meticulously taking care of Fourth Prince

439
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,480
and never slacked off.

440
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,010
Meticulously taking care?

441
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,090
Tell me then,

442
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,300
how come the Prince has become like this?

443
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,200
You can’t have taken care of him properly.

444
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,400
Consort Jia, what are you saying?

445
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,000
Empress has been anxious and worried for Fourth Prince.

446
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,520
We've successively invited imperial doctors to check him.

447
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,720
What do you mean by not taking care of him properly?

448
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,120
Yongcheng, don't worry.

449
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,140
Mother’s here.

450
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,520
Mother’s here,

451
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,240
and no one would dare bully you anymore.

452
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,840
I missed you so much.

453
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,760
- Here. - Consort Jia is here to see Fourth Prince.

454
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,800
Let’s go out.

455
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,560
Let me look at you.

456
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,960
Empress, Consort Jia has left.

457
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,200
Obviously she was crying on purpose in front of you.

458
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,960
Zhen'er.

459
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,160
I didn't say anything wrong.

460
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,280
Fourth Prince has just been here for half a month.

461
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,480
She comes to cry here every two or three days

462
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,080
and always makes such huge movements.

463
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,740
People outside are gossiping

464
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,020
that you're mistreating Fourth Prince.

465
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,560
Consort Jia loves her son dearly and is just showing excessive concern.

466
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,160
Nothing strange about that.

467
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,480
It was His Majesty’s order

468
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,520
that Fourth Prince stay in Palace of Receiving Celestial Favor.

469
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
If she's so capable, she should go to His Majesty.

470
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,160
Why must she keep making things hard on you?

471
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,690
Because she knows you're kind and venerable!

472
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,860
I don't care what Consort Jia thinks.

473
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,050
Anyway, the child is innocent.

474
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,610
Now that he's staying here,

475
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,600
we must take good care of him.

476
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,440
Yes, yes...

477
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,140
you are always this kindhearted.

478
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,760
I am the one who is petty.

479
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,060
Yongcheng,

480
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,760
come.

481
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,080
Okay, we're not eating this.

482
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,440
Where's the light porridge that I asked them to send here?

483
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,080
Fourth Prince doesn't like to eat porridge.

484
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,400
I ordered the kitchen to make some soup.

485
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,610
Don't worry.

486
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,160
The soup is made from rice and a little meat.

487
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,760
Fourth Prince wouldn't take in even one mouthful of porridge.

488
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,960
I am just afraid that he'll lack energy.

489
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,800
I’ll do it.

490
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,040
Yongcheng, be good and eat your soup.

491
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,240
Yongcheng,

492
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,880
if you eat your food,

493
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,320
I'll let your mother visit you every day.

494
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,040
Okay?

495
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,010
Fourth Prince, don’t be like that.

496
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,080
Not only your mother, but also your Royal Father.

497
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,810
As long as you behave yourself,

498
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,800
I'll ask him to come visit you.

499
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,280
Empress, how about this hairpin?

500
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,560
Fourth Prince is sick.

501
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,560
I'm not in the mood to doll up.

502
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,080
You decide it.

503
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,440
Empress,

504
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
you are being too kind.

505
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,840
You are treating Fourth Prince so well,

506
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,000
but others are misunderstanding it.

507
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,480
I feel you’re wronged.

508
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,360
Enough.

509
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
Later, go to the Imperial Hospital.

510
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,080
Ask Director Zhang of Imperial Hospital to come over and check his pulse.

511
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,560
He is specialized in pediatrics.

512
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,760
Yes.

513
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,080
Empress, Empress, Empress!

514
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,680
Fourth Prince, he... Please go have a look.

515
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,720
Consort Xian,

516
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,480
Consort Xian,

517
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,320
my child is this sick.

518
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,000
You treat it as if nothing is wrong.

519
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,560
Return me my healthy son!

520
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,360
Return me!

521
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,760
Consort!

522
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,560
Consort Jia, what are you doing?

523
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,760
Everyone here in the Palace says

524
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,000
that you are kind, virtuous, noble and unsullied.

525
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,560
But how were you taking care of him?

526
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,760
Look at him yourself!

527
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,320
Imperial Consort Xian, Fourth Prince is having a fever.

528
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,440
It's so scary.

529
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,080
Yongcheng is having a fever again?

530
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,960
Let me see.

531
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,080
Don't touch my son!

532
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,520
What are you shouting about?

533
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,320
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

534
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,020
Your Majesty, look at him.

535
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,080
Go and invite Director Zhang of Imperial Hospital.

536
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,880
Yes.

537
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,680
Your Majesty, I wasn't able to take care of him properly,

538
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,000
so Fourth Prince got sick.

539
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,260
I'm guilty. May Your Majesty forgive me.

540
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,280
Empress,

541
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,240
you guarded by Fourth Prince's side till midnight.

542
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,840
Fourth Prince was well then.

543
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,040
No one could have predicted the fever.

544
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,400
How come it became your mistake?

545
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,520
Zhen'er, shut up.

546
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,360
Your Majesty,

547
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,960
I made a mistake,

548
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,080
and I shouldn't beg for your forgiveness.

549
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,520
Even if you ask me to leave Yongcheng,

550
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,530
I could only accept your order.

551
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
But Imperial Consort Xian

552
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,560
isn't the birth mother of Yongcheng.

553
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,760
She doesn't have any experience in taking care of a child.

554
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,640
Yongcheng has just been here for half a month

555
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,170
and already got sick twice.

556
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,000
I visited him early today

557
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,440
and discovered that he had been having persistent fever.

558
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,320
He kept mumbling "mother",

559
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,440
“Mother”.

560
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,400
Your Majesty, it breaks my heart.

561
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,560
I've made so many mistakes.

562
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,560
Your Majesty, you can scold or punish me.

563
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,560
But the child is innocent.

564
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,760
How old is he now?

565
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,680
How could he be away from his birth mother?

566
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,960
Imperial Consort Xian, Empress,

567
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,120
I saw that Yongcheng was having a fever.

568
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,560
I lost my mind and disrespected you.

569
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,400
Please understand the heart o f a mother.

570
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,160
Seeing her child suffering,

571
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,920
a mother would want to suffer for him.

572
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,320
Consort Xian, I’m begging you.

573
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,080
Help me beg for leniency from His Majesty.

574
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,720
Let me take Yongcheng back.

575
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,760
- I beg you. - Consort Jia. – Empress.

576
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,800
- Get up first. – Empress.

577
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,530
I can't accept your bow. Get up.

578
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,320
Consort Xian, everyone knows that you're kind.

579
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,960
How could you

580
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,080
watch her get separated from her son?

581
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,080
I…

582
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,480
Your Majesty,

583
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,680
Consort Jia indeed committed a mistake.

584
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,320
I won’t beg for leniency for her sake.

585
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,040
But people are not sages. Who doesn't make a mistake?

586
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,560
You are blessed with the nation and are broad-minded.

587
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,960
But for the sake of Yongcheng,

588
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,800
is it ok to give Consort Jia one more chance?

589
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,720
Even if you don't want Consort Jia to raise Yongcheng,

590
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,360
you have me.

591
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,400
I promise

592
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,920
that after I take Yongcheng back to Palace of Gathered Elegance,

593
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,800
I will educate him well.

594
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,080
This way, his birth mother Consort Jia

595
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,840
can assist in his upbringing.

596
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,800
It won't lead to mother and child getting separated,

597
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
and avoid psychological problems.

598
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,460
Your Majesty, have mercy.

599
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,880
Let me take Fourth Prince back.

600
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,520
Why is Consort Jia

601
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
rushing to take Fourth Prince away?

602
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,560
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

603
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

604
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
No need for formalities.

605
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,080
Director Zhang, check Fourth Prince.

606
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,880
Your Majesty.

607
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,400
Yes.

608
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,960
Fourth Prince will feel uncomfortable

609
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,080
in the unfamiliar Palace of Receiving Celestial Favor.

610
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,710
Let me take Fourth Prince back to Palace of Gathered Elegance

611
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,280
before Director Zhang checks him.

612
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,080
You think it will take long

613
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,320
for Director Zhang to check him?

614
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,239
Consort Jia, aren't you being too impatient?

615
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,190
Except fever, does Fourth Prince

616
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,670
show any other symptoms?

617
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,600
He...

618
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,480
Fourth Prince keeps saying he feels pain everywhere,

619
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,320
but couldn't properly point out

620
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
where the pain is.

621
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,630
So I’m not sure.

622
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,230
Fourth Prince's tongue-coating is pale

623
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,800
and his forehead extremely hot.

624
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,760
The pulse is

625
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,600
restless and mitigated on the left,

626
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,929
and smooth on the right.

627
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,240
He should have been afflicted with cold air.

628
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,720
After having the medicine that I'll prescribe,

629
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,480
I believe he'll soon get better.

630
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,010
Thank you, Director Zhang.

631
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,880
Your Majesty,

632
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,120
please let me take Fourth Prince

633
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,440
back to Palace of Gathered Elegance.

634
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,570
Your Majesty, look.

635
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Fourth Prince is suffering so much.

636
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,320
My heart...

637
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,640
I can't endure it.

638
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
Consort Xian,

639
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
what do you think?

640
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,360
I wasn't able to take good care of Fourth Prince.

641
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,520
I feel so guilty.

642
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,000
As long as Fourth Prince can recover,

643
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,860
I won't have anything else to say.

644
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,440
Sister Consort Xian,

645
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,040
you're too easy to convince.

646
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,280
Do you know

647
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,560
that Consort Jia has been crying

648
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,490
all the way here?

649
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,920
Now the whole palace is gossiping

650
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,080
that you've been harsh on Fourth Prince.

651
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,680
If

652
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,500
you allow her to take him away,

653
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,560
won't that prove the gossip?

654
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,280
Consort Chun,

655
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,160
I know that you're worried about me.

656
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,020
But gossip won't work on the wise.

657
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,440
It's enough that my conscience is clear.

658
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,300
Your conscience is indeed clear,

659
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,490
but you're pushing Fourth Prince into the fiery pit.

660
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,850
Imperial Consort Chun,

661
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,090
what do you mean by that?

662
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,880
Will I, the birth mother,

663
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,200
hurt my own son?

664
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,960
Consort Chun,

665
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,440
watch your language.

666
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,760
Fourth Prince is sick.

667
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,040
What is your purpose

668
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,300
of speaking such harsh words?

669
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,520
Director Zhang said earlier

670
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,340
that Fourth Prince got sick because of cold air.

671
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,800
But look,

672
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,240
what season is it?

673
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,280
This room has all its windows tightly shut.

674
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,220
He also has a blanket over him.

675
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,280
May I ask,

676
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,560
where did the cold air come from?

677
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,650
Imperial Consort Chun,

678
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,160
there's a saying among the commoners

679
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,600
that if you want a child to be free from illness,

680
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,330
let it starve and get cold a bit.

681
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,880
If the child wears too much clothing

682
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,960
or gets covered with too thick blankets,

683
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,320
it will perspire

684
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,800
and get sick.

685
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,610
Then it means

686
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,180
that the more we cover him, the more easily he gets sick?

687
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,120
I've always been

688
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,480
taking care of Fourth Prince like that,

689
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,880
but he has never got sick.

690
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,460
What about the food he had?

691
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,320
Last night,

692
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,840
I saw his wet nurse maid feed him chicken soup.

693
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,960
Fourth Prince is weak

694
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,160
and unable to sleep soundly at night.

695
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,760
He should drink lightly-flavored porridge.

696
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,320
Chicken meat is a stimulating

697
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,440
and very nutritious.

698
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,000
The child would surely feel more unwell if he eats it.

699
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I've instructed the kitchen to deliver some light porridge,

700
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,930
but Fourth Prince wouldn't eat it.

701
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,880
The light porridge that the kitchen delivered these days,

702
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,740
was all refused by Fourth Prince.

703
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,170
Wet nurse also cooked fish soup

704
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,890
and fed him when Imperial Consort Xian

705
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,080
was not watching.

706
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,650
That was so recklessly.

707
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,720
The child is sick.

708
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,880
He is weak, and his stomach and intestines are not in harmony.

709
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,160
You even fed him fish soup?

710
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,820
He surely will have diarrhea.

711
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,880
That's right.

712
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,960
Fourth Prince earlier kept having diarrhea.

713
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,220
He also kept saying that he had a stomach.

714
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,080
Now you’re talking

715
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,760
about Fourth Prince’s stomach.

716
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,420
Why didn't you say it earlier?

717
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,320
Take her away

718
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,800
and interrogate her.

719
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,600
I want to know

720
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,160
why the Prince got sick.

721
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,120
Take her away!

722
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,440
Your Majesty, spare me!

723
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,260
It was Consort Jia!

724
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,800
Consort Jia ordered me

725
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,960
to cover him like that.

726
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,080
Cover him

727
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,280
until he's perspiring,

728
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,080
gets cold, and develops a fever.

729
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,400
I had no choice,

730
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,440
so I obeyed her order.

731
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,570
You're full of lies!

732
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,920
Tell us,

733
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,540
was it Consort Xian...

734
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,640
Consort Xian who ordered you to do this!

735
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,440
Consort Jia,

736
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,000
how could you deny it?

737
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,920
You said

738
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,480
that this was the only way

739
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,360
to take Fourth Prince

740
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,420
back to Palace of Gathered Elegance.

741
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,600
No,

742
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,640
Your Majesty,

743
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,580
it's not like that, Your Majesty!

744
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,400
I'm the birth mother of Fourth Prince.

745
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,040
How could I

746
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,760
hurt my own son, Your Majesty?

747
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,920
Consort Jia,

748
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
Fourth Prince is just two years old.

749
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,400
How could you do this!

750
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,160
He was so reliant on you.

751
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,520
You could even

752
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,200
hurt your own son?

753
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,200
Of course Consort Jia didn't intend

754
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,460
to hurt Fourth Prince.

755
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,800
She just wanted to take back her son

756
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,860
from Consort Xian.

757
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,200
Too bad,

758
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,520
in her eyes,

759
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,040
Fourth Prince doesn't count

760
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,360
as a real son.

761
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,520
He's more like a chip,

762
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,640
used to exchange for power, wealth…

763
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,320
No!

764
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,320
It's not like that.

765
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,120
Your Majesty, Your Majesty,

766
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,080
I didn't.

767
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,280
I didn’t do it.

768
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,080
Your Majesty,

769
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,370
Consort Xian schemed all this.

770
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,600
No.

771
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,080
Consort Chun helped!

772
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,880
You...

773
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,520
you are also involved in this!

774
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,960
I've been living in Palace of Gathered Elegance.

775
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,520
How could I

776
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,850
extend my hand that far?

777
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,290
It must be...

778
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,640
It must be Consort Xian.

779
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,760
Yongcheng always shuns Consort Xian.

780
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,600
By doing this,

781
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,520
it will make Yongcheng

782
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,520
hate me, his birth mother, forever.

783
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,640
By doing this,

784
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,120
she can completely have Yongcheng to herself,

785
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,920
Your Majesty.

786
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,800
Imperial Consort Xian has no children.

787
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,640
Of course she doesn't know

788
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,100
how to prepare child food.

789
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,840
His wet nurse knows Fourth Prince very well.

790
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,040
You're using this point

791
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,240
to accuse Consort Xian.

792
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,520
You are so shameless.

793
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,520
No...

794
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,770
Your Majesty...

795
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,440
At this point,

796
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,050
you still don't mend your ways.

797
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,440
I think the greatest misfortune of Yongcheng

798
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,040
is having a mother like you.

799
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,000
Somebody,

800
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,360
Consort Jia is not virtuous or benevolent.

801
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,680
She's not worthy to be anyone's mother.

802
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,610
From today, her titled is revoked,

803
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,800
and she’s demoted by one grade to a Lady,

804
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,400
She’ll live in the Three North Yards.

805
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,200
Your Majesty,

806
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,000
I didn't.

807
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,520
I really didn't, Your Majesty!

808
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,080
Somebody, take them away.

809
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,880
Your Majesty, I don't want to go.

810
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,290
Your Majesty, spare me!

811
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,240
Your Majesty!

812
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,280
Your Majesty!

813
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,450
Noble Consort Empress,

814
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,200
Noble Consort Empress,

815
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,400
save me.

816
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,880
Save me.

817
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,650
Very good, Consort Jia!

818
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,400
You are ruthless enough

819
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,080
to hurt your own son.

820
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,440
I’m so disappointed.

821
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,640
Now,

822
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,010
you want me to beg for leniency for you?

823
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,920
I can’t do that.

824
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,690
Noble Consort Empress,

825
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,120
you…

826
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,720
you…

827
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,520
But in consideration

828
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,560
of our past affection,

829
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,410
I will take good care of Fourth Prince for you.

830
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,040
Just go.

831
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,440
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

832
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,360
Yongcheng! Yongcheng, my son!

833
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Yongcheng!

834
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,360
Your Majesty,

835
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,800
things are unpredictable, and human hearts are so vicious.

836
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,880
I never expected

837
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,080
that Consort Jia

838
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,160
would use my kindness

839
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,040
to frame Consort Xian.

840
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,280
A woman like that

841
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,040
is indeed unworthy

842
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,880
to be Yongcheng’s mother.

843
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,880
But

844
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,280
Yongcheng had been living in Palace of Gathered Elegance.

845
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,010
After suddenly leaving there,

846
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,300
he surely will feel very uncomfortable.

847
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,160
In my opinion,

848
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,880
maybe,

849
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,760
you can let me

850
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,300
take Yongcheng back to Palace of Gathered Elegance

851
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,980
and I'll take good care of him.

852
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,360
Or else,

853
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,320
Consort Xian doesn't know how to raise a child.

854
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,560
It almost led to trouble.

855
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,920
Your Majesty,

856
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,840
what do you think?

857
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,650
Noble Consort Empress,

858
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,120
Consort Xian indeed doesn't know how to take care of a child,

859
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,720
but practice makes perfect.

860
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,640
Her absolute sincerity towards the child

861
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,970
can even compete that of his birth mother.

862
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,800
Yongcheng

863
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
will stay in Palace of Receiving Celestial Favor.

864
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,480
I believe

865
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,420
that Consort Xian will take good care of him.

866
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

867
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,320
I've heard that Consort Chun is very knowledgeable

868
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,060
and well-versed in medicine.

869
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,640
Today,

870
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,120
I've learned a lot.

871
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,560
Thank you, Noble Consort Empress.

872
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,080
I'm flattered.
