[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,280
No grudge lasts forever.

4
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,479
As long as you're willing to invest...

5
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,600
No,

6
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,450
as long as you are
willing to ask for forgiveness,

7
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,260
everything can be resolved.

8
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,920
Right, Master Wei?

9
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,780
Yes, Prince He is right.

10
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,100
Come with me to the Imperial
Household Department.

11
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,330
From now on,

12
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,790
no one would dare to
disrespect your family.

13
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,250
Thank you, Your Highness.

14
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,890
I will take my leave.

15
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,860
Ying Luo.

16
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,890
-Ying Luo.
-Fu Heng!

17
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,079
Stop.

18
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,390
Who gave you the permission?

19
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,170
Sister,

20
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,040
you too know how much
His Majesty loves...

21
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,520
and trusts Hong Zhou.

22
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,120
If Ying Luo insists on seeking vengeance,

23
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,610
it won't end well for her.

24
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,090
She is now willing to lay down her grudge.

25
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,800
Isn't that better for everyone?

26
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,340
You used force and threat,

27
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,170
those are not the acts of a gentleman.

28
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,570
I only want her to be safe!

29
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,780
Even if she hates or blames me,

30
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,670
I must make sure she's safe.

31
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,980
Ming Yu, I have something to tell you.

32
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,750
Just because we worked as a team once,

33
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,090
doesn't mean you are as capable as I am.

34
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,520
Listen closely, I still hate you.

35
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,090
Yes.

36
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,170
Today, it's my shift to
watch over the plant nursery.

37
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,310
But since last night,

38
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,800
I've been having headache.

39
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,760
I'm going to the Imperial Apothecary
for some medicine.

40
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,620
Please cover my shift for a while.

41
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,920
I'll take your shift tomorrow,
how does that sound?

42
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,000
Even you would ask for help now?

43
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,890
If you don't agree,

44
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,720
I'll ask for Zhen Zhu's help.

45
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,480
I didn't say that I wouldn't.

46
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,100
What is wrong with you?

47
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,020
Can't you at least ask nicely
if you want my help?

48
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,140
Ming Yu, Ming Yu, I beg of you.

49
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,840
I need this favour from you, please?

50
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,530
Fine, I shall be so kind as to...

51
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,070
cover your shift.

52
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,670
Thanks.

53
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,510
Ming Yu.

54
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,660
Have you seen Ying Luo?

55
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,340
She went out to do something.
I'm watering the plants for her.

56
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,620
What should I do?

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,650
Her Majesty ordered me to find her.

58
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,800
If Her Majesty needs something,
she could let me handle it.

59
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,330
You are not as cautious as Ying Luo.

60
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,650
Why not?

61
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,140
I might be just as great as she is.

62
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,280
Not to mention I've served
Her Majesty for so many years.

63
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,800
I'm more experienced.

64
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,420
Ying Luo is shrewd, agile and attentive.

65
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,080
She managed to make her work perfection,
which earns her the trust of Her Majesty.

66
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,420
Not only you,

67
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,280
even I am no match for her wits.

68
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,210
This is so vexing.

69
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,880
What's got into you?

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,730
You said I wasn't as good as her,

71
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,040
I might as well do nothing.

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,390
Look at your temper.

73
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,390
Now Her Majesty would think
you are not as patient as Ying Luo.

74
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,000
Ying Luo, Ying Luo, Ying Luo!

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,890
You never stop saying her name!

76
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,640
I don't want to hear it again!

77
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,890
Miss Ying Luo.

78
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,880
Does Her Majesty have any instructions?

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,060
No.

80
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,540
I came for Physician Ye.

81
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,870
Every imperial physician in
the Imperial Apothecary...

82
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,100
has served in Imperial Academy of Medicine
for at least six years.

83
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,480
They need to pass three tests
while serving there...

84
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,010
before they can enter the palace
as official physicians.

85
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,540
Even the worst physician in the Imperial
Apothecary is better than Physician Ye.

86
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,520
He was merely a wandering healer
who got lucky with His Majesty's illness.

87
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,170
Miss Ying Luo, why do you even trust him?

88
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,440
You misunderstood.

89
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,520
I lent him some money while I was
serving in Yangxin Hall.

90
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,550
I am here to collect the debt.

91
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,340
You came to collect money?

92
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,600
I knew that man was nothing more
than a mere peasant.

93
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,070
Where is he now?

94
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,280
Physician Wang,
they need you at Shou'an Palace.

95
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,680
Consort Dowager Guo has trouble
breathing, she might not last long.

96
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,640
If Physician Zhang couldn't
help with her condition,

97
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,080
what else can I do?

98
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,130
You should at check on her.

99
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,760
-Let's go.
-You...

100
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,500
Consort Dowager Guo?

101
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,080
She was one of the late Emperor's consort.

102
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,370
She has been ill since last winter.

103
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,480
She's been clinging onto her last breath,
she even has the coffin ready.

104
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,200
Aren't you looking for someone?

105
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,000
Physician Ye is in the backyard.

106
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,320
Eat the sunlight! Eat the sunlight!

107
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,510
Physician Ye.

108
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,990
Miss Ying Luo.

109
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,270
You seem to be upset.

110
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,740
How can I not be upset?

111
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,120
I have talent yet the world
has no use of me!

112
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,840
I am a healer! But look at this.

113
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,740
I haven't seen any patient!

114
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,200
All the Imperial Physicians are
banding together to pick on me.

115
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,370
They think I lack experience.

116
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,810
They only order me to bask
the herbs under this scorching sun!

117
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,070
If I had know better,

118
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,560
I shouldn't have accepted the decree
and come here.

119
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,360
Sir, there is no need to be upset.

120
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,610
His Majesty has just
recovered not long ago.

121
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,470
Surely he'll need you at Yangxin Palace
to read his pulse soon enough.

122
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,520
What you mean is...

123
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,289
I should file a complaint?

124
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,390
No, I wouldn't dare.

125
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,970
What if His Majesty gets angry?

126
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,290
I could lose my head.

127
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,690
Why complain?

128
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Just ask for permission to leave
when the work is done,

129
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,830
and make sure you cry very hard.

130
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,640
-Cry?
-Let His Majesty know...

131
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,580
you can't bear to leave him.

132
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,080
Yet the co-workers are
looking down on you.

133
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,180
As for what you have suffered while
you are here, do not say a word about it.

134
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,620
If His Majesty wishes to know,
he will have his way of knowing.

135
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,090
Right!

136
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,660
Miss Ying Luo, you are so brilliant.

137
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,220
I bet you snitched on others
plenty of times.

138
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,830
Back to the main topic.

139
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,040
Physician Ye,

140
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,520
I've been having headache,

141
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,740
I have trouble sleeping at night.

142
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,800
Is there any medication to treat insomnia?

143
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,040
-Let me check your pulse.
-Never mind!

144
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,330
The headache has been bothering me
for quite a while.

145
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,100
I am here to see
if there is any medicine...

146
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,480
that can make one fall asleep...

147
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,550
in a blink of an eye.

148
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,910
If you have trouble falling asleep...

149
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
I know what to do. Come with me.

150
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,140
This is the medicine you need.

151
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,210
What is this?

152
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
These are the leaves of datura stramonium.

153
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,400
I usually use them for anaesthetics.

154
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,970
I can guarantee you a good night's sleep
after you used this herb.

155
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,900
But keep the dose to a small amount.

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,460
Make sure not to overdose.

157
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,020
This herb is only useful
to get rid of the symptoms.

158
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,720
I'll prescribe you a nourishing medicine.

159
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,600
Take it once every day for one month.

160
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
That should get rid of the headache.

161
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,160
Thank you, Physician Ye.

162
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,120
Don't mention it,
I wish everyone can be my patient.

163
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,760
Hong Zhou is no longer a boy.

164
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,380
Why is he still acting like a child?

165
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,140
I heard that,

166
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,110
a few days ago, in the Imperial Garden,

167
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,040
he made the fools out of
his uncles and his brother.

168
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,340
That's right.

169
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,050
He never stopped causing trouble
ever since he was a kid.

170
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,800
If His Majesty and Empress Dowager
haven't taken care of him,

171
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,920
he would have been beaten
even if he walks on the street.

172
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,650
Your are too gentle and quiet.

173
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,180
You are a vegetarian
and an devout Buddhist.

174
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,170
You rarely step out of Shoukang Palace.

175
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,680
How did you manage to give birth
to such an audacious child?

176
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,070
He never ceases to torment
those around him.

177
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,560
His Majesty had intended to teach
him a hard lesson.

178
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,560
He was grounded inside Yangxin Hall.

179
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,800
As his mother,

180
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,240
I really hope His Majesty doesn't
go soft on him.

181
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,700
It would be best to just
beat him up real good.

182
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,490
He should know the consequences
of his action.

183
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,520
Are you sure you can handle it?

184
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,370
Of course, why not?

185
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,940
A good lesson for him
by any means necessary.

186
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,640
One's attitude must be honed before
he can amount to greatness.

187
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,800
I'll send my men to Yangxin Hall,

188
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,230
I'll inform His Majesty to whip him
so hard he can't even walk.

189
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,560
Maybe some pain might actually
make him behave for good.

190
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,000
-My servant.
-Yes.

191
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,220
Empress Dowager.

192
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,480
What's wrong?

193
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,870
I knew that is too much for you.

194
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,230
Empress Dowager,
please don't make fun of me.

195
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,600
Brother,

196
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,760
I've lost eight games in a row,

197
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,620
when are you going to let me leave?

198
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,790
Once you are out of here,

199
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,970
there will be trouble for sure.

200
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,380
No, you can trust me on this.

201
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,490
You either asked me to listen
to the reports of military executives...

202
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,440
to keep me here for calligraphy,

203
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,920
or to play chess with you.

204
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,950
You're making me go crazy.

205
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,760
I'm honing your patience.

206
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,650
Brother,

207
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,970
this kind of things doesn't
suit my personality.

208
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,730
Hey! Hey! I made the wrong move!

209
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,860
In the past, our grandfather told me...

210
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,120
that I had neither knowledge or skills,

211
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,810
that I was too playful.

212
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,400
Is this how you plan to spend
the rest of your life?

213
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,670
You are my only brother
who grew up to be an adult.

214
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,540
I'm still hoping that...

215
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,560
you could share my burden
of the state affairs.

216
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,240
Well, our grandfather
meant what he said about me.

217
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,780
My lifestyle is based on his decree.

218
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,160
Brother, you can't
possibly make everyone...

219
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,440
to be like you, to have
the composure of a wise ruler.

220
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,660
Get out.

221
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,420
I am grateful for the pardon,
I shall be leaving now.

222
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,440
Don't forget to submit your report
on the flood prevention plan.

223
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,960
I still have to come tomorrow?

224
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,200
Yes, you must come here every day.

225
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,710
As you wish.

226
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,150
Fifth Prince.

227
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,930
Hailan Cha,

228
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,060
I just got rid of my brother
and barely got to relax,

229
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,520
why are you bothering me now?

230
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,250
The female ghost that night...

231
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,930
It's been solved.

232
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,790
You caught the ghost?

233
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,790
Let me tell you,

234
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,350
not only is she not a ghost,

235
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,660
she's even quite a beauty.

236
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,420
Sister-in-law!

237
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,720
Prince He,

238
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,370
stop making fun of me.

239
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,070
Why would I do that?

240
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,520
You are indeed my sister-in-law.

241
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:17,770
So Your Highness has
acknowledged this marriage?

242
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,080
Yes. Of course.

243
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,920
His Majesty is not going to stop
honing my patience.

244
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,130
Both of us...

245
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,540
I am not finished here, don't walk away.

246
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,720
Your Highness,

247
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,130
I thought you need to be here every day.

248
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,110
If you want to talk,

249
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,360
there will be plenty of chances.

250
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,930
Fifth Prince.

251
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,330
Fifth Prince.

252
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,260
Gorgeous.

253
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,270
She's prettier than her older sister.

254
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,950
What are you saying?

255
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,940
I must warn you, she is not one
you should mess with.

256
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,250
She's just a palace maid.

257
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,380
What could go wrong with her?

258
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,900
If I asked His Majesty for permission,

259
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,640
he would just send her right to me.

260
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,840
Fu Heng loves her more than his own life.

261
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,800
Let me see if she'll like Fu Heng
or me, Prince He.

262
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,120
You...

263
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,370
Fifth Prince, that is
very inconsiderate of you.

264
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,280
Don't worry.

265
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,520
Fu Heng and I have been
friends for years.

266
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,080
I won't have any ill intent against him.

267
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,720
I simply appreciate beauty.

268
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,840
I am just admiring her look.

269
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,290
You've been pacing for over two hours.

270
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,930
What do you want?

271
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,510
Fu Heng, I must tell you something.

272
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,170
Tell me what?

273
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,190
Forget it.

274
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,670
Ignore what I just said.

275
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,940
Fine, I'll tell you.

276
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,640
Fifth Prince wants to
take over your lover.

277
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,600
My lover?

278
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,510
The girl!

279
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,280
The girl you like the most, is that clear?

280
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,010
What do you mean?

281
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,800
It's exactly as I said.

282
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,850
I think Hong Zhou...

283
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,180
is planning something ill.

284
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,280
You'd better keep an eye on her.

285
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,810
Ying Luo, what are you doing?

286
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,310
I can't sleep.

287
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,660
So I'm making a medicinal pillow.

288
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,260
Guard Fuca wishes to
speak with you outside.

289
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,280
Tell him...

290
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,830
I'm busy.

291
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,040
Guard Fuca, Ying Luo said she was busy.

292
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,190
Didn't Her Majesty teach her the Analects?

293
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,360
One should never judge a person with
his word or his words with his status.

294
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,520
She can hate me all she wants,
but she must hear me out.

295
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,930
Ying Luo, Guard Fuca said,

296
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,800
one should never judge a person with
his word or his words...

297
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,540
You can hear it.

298
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,440
Tell him,

299
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,480
I know that sweetened words are often
full of deceptions.

300
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,920
A person who uses flowery speech
as a mean for betrayal...

301
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,930
will never have my trust again!

302
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,270
Guard Fuca, did you hear it?

303
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,790
Tell her…

304
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,760
You two can hear each other's words.

305
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,010
You don't need me to be your messenger.

306
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,050
I am done with you two.

307
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,160
Ying Luo.

308
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,070
Ying Luo.

309
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,760
I hope that before you do anything,

310
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,480
never forget to think twice.

311
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,730
Hong Zhou isn't a simpleton.

312
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,060
You must be careful.

313
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,230
Consort Dowager Guo is unyielding.

314
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,680
She never sits well with the other
consort dowagers in the palace.

315
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,680
And now she has left the living,

316
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,620
there wasn't anyone to bid her farewell.

317
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,950
I pity her.

318
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,040
-Er Qing.
-Yes.

319
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,920
Get a funeral gift ready for her.

320
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,200
I wish to express my condolences.

321
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,060
I'll get it done.

322
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,350
Your Majesty,

323
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,570
Er Qing has other works at hand.

324
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,360
Perhaps I should go instead.

325
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,080
Have you ever been to Shouan Palace?

326
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,030
I used to deliver spring clothes there.

327
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,230
I know my way there.

328
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,900
Very well, I'll leave it to you.

329
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,400
Yes.

330
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,040
Your Highness, where are you going?

331
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,360
We must leave the palace
before the curfew.

332
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,620
None of your business.

333
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,640
-Remove your clothes.
-Well…

334
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,980
Take my badge and leave as usual.

335
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,830
Your Highness, you mustn't.

336
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,250
Tell another soul and I'll have yours!

337
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
Hurry. Remove your clothes.

338
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,620
What are you doing here?

339
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,950
Prince He.

340
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,290
I...

341
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,640
I came to deliver some tributes
for the late Consort Dowager Guo.

342
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,470
Shouan Palace is outside the forest.

343
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,090
Why are you here instead?

344
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,680
I see.

345
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
You are making an offering to your sister?

346
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,690
Your Highness!

347
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,520
I know it's forbidden
to make offerings in the palace.

348
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,100
But Your Highness plans to take
my sister in as your concubine.

349
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,900
It was a matter of concern.

350
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,000
I should at least tell my sister.

351
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,360
You know making offering is forbidden.

352
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,400
Yet here you are.

353
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,410
You are knowingly breaking the rules.

354
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,840
-I...
-Come with me!

355
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,900
I am taking you to Her Majesty.

356
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,540
-Let's see if she will defend you now.
-Please, Your Highness!

357
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,080
As you said,

358
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,760
I'm your sister-in-law.

359
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,040
Since we're one family,

360
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,900
why do you do this?

361
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,760
Since you know we're one family,

362
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,020
shouldn't you attend to me...

363
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,240
in place of your sister?

364
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,700
Your Highness,

365
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,910
you should not joke about this.

366
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,220
But I am serious.

367
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,650
If you won't agree,

368
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,660
I have no choice but to expose your crime.

369
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,290
Let me think about it carefully.

370
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,860
At least...

371
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,410
let me ask for my sister's permission.

372
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,190
Fine, I'll be waiting here.

373
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,420
Make sure to think it through.

374
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,730
Sister, I came here today,

375
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,690
because I want to tell you
something very important.

376
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,930
Prince He...

377
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,240
has felt extreme remorse...

378
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,020
for what he has done.

379
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,640
He promised to marry you.

380
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,070
You will be moved to his family crypt.

381
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,500
Don't you need some offering money
for your sister's soul?

382
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,440
Sister.

383
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,470
I miss you so much.

384
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,860
What scent is that?

385
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,250
Sister.

386
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,150
Sister.

387
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,120
I know you will never forgive this man.

388
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Today, it's your chance to witness...

389
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,830
how I exact vengeance on this murderer.

390
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,700
You lured me here.

391
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,580
And the candles...

392
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,660
You planned for this!

393
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,700
Wei Yingning,

394
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,250
to you,

395
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,620
she might be a mere handmaiden
you violated while being drunk,

396
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,150
but she was...

397
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,210
the person I cherished
the most in this world!

398
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,400
My mother died from giving birth to me.

399
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,410
It was my sister...

400
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,410
who took care of me like a mother.

401
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,190
She was my everything!

402
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,480
My sister...

403
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,210
She came into the palace at
the age of 15 years old.

404
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,760
I waited for her return
at Shenwu Gate every day!

405
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,860
Nine years.

406
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,530
I waited for nine years!

407
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,390
Finally,

408
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,980
my sister could come home.

409
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,080
But because of you...

410
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,080
Because of your despicable action,

411
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,830
my sister died.

412
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,610
My sister died!

413
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,330
She died!

414
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,390
The most ridiculous thing is...

415
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,510
a murderer like you...

416
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,580
should have been torn into pieces.

417
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,870
But because you're
a member of the royal family,

418
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,120
you were never punished for your crime!

419
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,140
How dare you be so proud of yourself...

420
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,480
by saying you're going
to marry my dead sister.

421
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,840
How dare you!

422
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,620
You don't deserve her!

423
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,200
Hong Zhou!

424
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,010
Help!

425
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,860
Help!

426
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,930
Help!

427
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,370
Help!

428
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,400
Help!

429
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,400
Help!

430
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,460
-Help!
-What is that?

431
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,160
Go check it out.

432
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,770
Help!

433
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,120
Help!

434
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,340
Help!

435
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,870
Help!

436
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,540
Help!

437
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,250
Someone wants to kill me.

438
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
-What's going on?
-Save me! Save me!

439
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,960
-Your Highness.
-Someone wants to kill me!

440
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,510
Save me!

441
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,800
Help! Someone wants to kill me!

442
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,680
-Let's go!
-Help!

443
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,080
Help!

444
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,680
Your Majesty!

445
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,230
Please save me!

446
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,920
-Prince He has gone crazy!
-Brother!

447
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,160
-He's gone crazy.
-Brother!

448
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,310
She wants to kill me!

449
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,600
He...

450
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,520
He disguised himself as eunuch
and sneaked into the Inner Palace.

451
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,570
He was stalking me!

452
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,210
I noticed him following me,

453
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,790
so he wanted me dead!

454
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,640
Don't listen to her lies, Your Majesty!

455
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,480
She lured me here!

456
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,330
She wants to kill me!

457
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,000
She even drugged me.
She wants to kill me!

458
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,920
The palace gates are now locked.

459
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,140
As a respectable prince,

460
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,420
why are you wearing eunuch's uniform
and lingering in the palace?

461
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,980
Your Majesty.

462
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,120
She is a liar!
She is trying to set me up!

463
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,560
You were harbouring
evil intentions to begin with.

464
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,240
Once I discovered you sneaking around,

465
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,300
you made up lies to save your own skin!

466
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,320
Think about it.

467
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,100
How could a weak woman like me...

468
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,920
have the power to lure
a prince like him here?

469
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,280
This is beyond ridiculous!

470
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,200
-You cursed peasant!
-Silence!

471
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,650
Brother, you must not believe her!

472
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,230
She is playing innocent,
but she is cunning and she lies!

473
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,590
You can't believe her!

474
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,070
Your Majesty,

475
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,670
save me!

476
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,080
Your Majesty, save me!

477
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,020
Save me!

478
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,540
You scoundrel!

479
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,750
How can you believe her?

480
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,200
I'm your brother!

481
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,930
How can you believe her and not me?

482
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,140
Guards.

483
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
Lock him up inside the Yangxin Hall!

484
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,040
How can you not believe me?

485
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,510
Why don't you believe me? Why?

486
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,300
Follow me.

487
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,690
Miss Ying Luo, please cover yourself.

488
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,740
Consort Dowager Yu,
Prince He is in trouble.

489
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,540
Tell me.

490
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,260
At this hour,

491
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,680
shouldn't you be inside Changchun Palace?

492
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,820
Consort Dowager Guo has passed away.

493
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,780
Her Majesty pitied her,

494
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,700
so she ordered me to
deliver her a funeral gift.

495
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,850
I ran into Prince He on the way.
He attempted to violate me.

496
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,670
Are you telling the truth?

497
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,710
The Qing Empire has a rule that...

498
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,600
all royalty who committed a crime...

499
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,260
must be judged by the Emperor.

500
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,470
During the reign of Emperor Yongzheng,

501
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,200
a member of the royal family...

502
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,640
kidnapped and defiled a beautiful lady.

503
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,770
Even after he was caught,
he received nothing but a fine.

504
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,120
In this case,

505
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,680
if Prince He has his eyes on a handmaiden,

506
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,700
even if he disguises himself and
trespasses into the inner palace at night,

507
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,290
which will bring shame
to the royal family,

508
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,840
as long as Your Majesty
was lenient enough,

509
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,760
Prince He will never be punished.

510
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,370
-Silence!
-Your Majesty,

511
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,170
you can't barge in...

512
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,520
Your Majesty.

513
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,800
Ying Luo is not educated well
to understand the rules.

514
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,110
I am sure she doesn't mean to
provoke Your Majesty.

515
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,710
It's just that she misunderstood
the wordings of the law.

516
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,600
Empress,

517
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,420
are you here to defend her?

518
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,140
Your Majesty,

519
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,590
I believe in what Ying Luo said.

520
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,880
Do you really trust her so much?

521
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,670
I...

522
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,670
can swear on my life,

523
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,320
Ying Luo did not lie.

524
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,750
It must be Hong Zhou...

525
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,310
who has done unspeakable crime.

526
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,490
-Your Majesty…
-It's not your place to speak!

527
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,640
Your Majesty,

528
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,350
I have no right to ask of Your Majesty...

529
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
to execute punishment on Prince He.

530
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,800
But Wei Ying Luo is my servant.

531
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,330
She's my trusted aide.

532
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,630
If she did something wrong,

533
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,370
I surely will punish her.

534
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,920
But if...

535
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,000
anyone seeks to harm her,

536
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,000
I will also not sit by and watch.

537
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,320
She's involved in this case.

538
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,360
No, Your Majesty.

539
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,760
She's a witness.

540
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,410
I must take her away...

541
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,840
unscathed.

542
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,920
Take her away with you.

543
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,989
Thank you,

544
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,620
Your Majesty, for your kindness.

545
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,480
Your Majesty,
Consort Dowager Yu is here.

546
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,170
Tell me, what have you done this time?

547
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,900
Mother! I have done nothing!
I am being set up!

548
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,989
You...

549
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,989
Your Majesty.

550
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,070
Li Yu.

551
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,460
I'm here.

552
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,090
Inform Consort Dowager Yu.

553
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,710
Yes.

554
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,840
Consort Dowager Yu,

555
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,670
Prince He was drunk tonight,

556
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,960
he took a wrong turn and
trespassed into the inner palace.

557
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,560
He committed an unspeakable crime.

558
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,640
Your Majesty.

559
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,090
Did Hong Zhou...

560
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,120
really do that?

561
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,590
Mother,

562
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,040
I didn't.

563
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,920
It was her.

564
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,420
That cursed woman! She framed me!

565
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,600
Shut up!

566
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,620
Bai Ling.

567
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,360
Mother.

568
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,800
You worthless child!
You've leant nothing from your mistakes!

569
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,050
You deserve this!

570
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,480
You are a disappointment to His Majesty
and the Empress Dowager!

571
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,090
You betrayed my trust!

572
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,750
This should teach you a lesson!

573
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,460
Mother.

574
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,290
This should teach you a lesson!

575
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,100
I'm didn't do it. I was framed!

576
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,360
Framed?

577
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,360
So why would she want to frame you
and not the other men?

578
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,620
This is the consequences of
your arrogance and insolence!

579
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,560
His Majesty is showing mercy
because you are his brother,

580
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,820
but as your mother, I must punish you,

581
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,360
or you will never learn anything!

582
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,630
Who knows what other horrible things
you would have done in the future?

583
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,960
Here is a lesson for you!

584
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,530
Please, stop!

585
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,970
Please stop!

586
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,000
You should have listened to me!

587
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,310
Enough.

588
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,260
Your Majesty, Hong Zhou's action
was unspeakable.

589
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,090
I have failed as his mother.

590
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,120
I have let Your Majesty down,

591
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,520
and the Empress Dowager.

592
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,050
Your Majesty, Hong Zhou needs to be
punished, so am I.

593
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,880
As his mother, I shall
pay for his mistake as well.

594
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,560
Let me make up for his sin.

595
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,610
I'm begging you, Your Majesty.

596
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,720
Consort Dowager Yu,

597
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,200
Hong Zhou committed a crime.

598
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,320
It has nothing to do with you.

599
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,360
Li Yu.

600
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,640
I'm here.

601
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,160
Escort Consort Dowager Yu back
to Shoukang Palace.

602
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,240
Yes.

603
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,130
Your Majesty!

604
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,260
Go back.

605
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,100
Yes.

606
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,100
Hong Zhou!

607
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,630
Your Majesty, I'm guilty.

608
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,620
Even if you don't tell me about...

609
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,850
what happened today,

610
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,580
I am well aware of it nonetheless.

611
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,080
Prince He harmed a life.

612
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,380
Yet because of his status as a prince,

613
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,320
he escaped punishment.

614
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,610
He never learnt to repent,

615
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,180
he used bribery and threats
to coerced you into forgiving him.

616
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,380
But what's forced is meaningless.

617
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,520
With your personality,

618
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,920
you would never let him
get away with it.

619
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,820
But Ying Luo,

620
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,840
how could have done such a thing?

621
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,970
Your Majesty is well aware
that I was guilty.

622
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,580
yet you chose to defend me.

623
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,040
I will never forget your kindness.

624
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,410
But this is not my first mistake,

625
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,440
and you are at risk because of me.

626
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,360
-Should this happens again...
-What do you mean 'again'?

627
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,020
Are you not going to give up?

628
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,280
Do you have any idea how far
His Majesty would tolerate Hong Zhou?

629
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,200
Hong Zhou beat up a military executive,

630
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,680
and publicly made fun of his kins!

631
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,740
Even so, His Majesty would still
turn an blind eye to it.

632
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,490
If I didn't arrive in time just now,

633
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,520
His Majesty could have beheaded you...

634
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,050
just to defend Hong Zhou
and let off his anger!

635
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,340
Your Majesty.

636
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,670
Ying Luo, I'm warning you.

637
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,300
Do not take actions
against Hong Zhou again.

638
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,850
Is that clear?

639
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,130
Wei Ying Luo, this is an order!

640
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,910
Your recklessness needs to stop now!

641
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,730
Do not harm Prince He again!

642
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,030
Is that clear?

643
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,640
As Your Majesty wishes.

644
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,160
What medicine is this?

645
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,240
-Are you trying to poison me?
-Your Highness, my apology.

646
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,920
The physician said you have suffered
from a cold and pain from the whip lashes,

647
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,440
which is why you've been sick.

648
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,360
You need to be cleansed of the bodily heat
you got from all the drinking.

649
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,170
I told you I wasn't drunk!

650
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,800
I wasn't drunk, I was sober!

651
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,210
I wasn't drunk!

652
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,180
You may leave.

653
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,480
-Leave.
-Yes.

654
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,230
I will kill her once I regained my health!

655
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,610
Are you crazy?

656
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,850
Don't you even know what you have done?

657
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,680
She wouldn't have wanted you dead
had you not hurt her sister.

658
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,730
Fu Heng,

659
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,400
we have known each other for years.

660
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,160
You are betraying me for that peasant?

661
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,760
Who is the real peasant here?

662
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,620
Fine, it's me!

663
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,940
Let go of me. I can't breathe.

664
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,700
I know you didn't kill anyone,

665
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,600
but this doesn't mean you are absolved.

666
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,440
I'm warning you.

667
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,650
Stop harassing Ying Luo.

668
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,380
Are you serious?

669
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,330
She is a vicious and crazy woman.

670
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,550
Of all the women in here, you like her?

671
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,090
I won't say it again!

672
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,590
Keep that in mind.

673
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,520
You should turn the other way
the moment you see Wei Ying Luo.

674
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,170
Or else, every time I see you,
I will beat you.

675
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,970
You managed to stay alive,

676
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,480
make sure not to waste it.

677
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,760
Guard. I'm hurting all over.

678
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,270
-Guard!
-Your Highness.

679
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,830
Your Highness.

680
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,650
Someone, summon the Imperial Physicians!

681
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,440
Empress Dowager.

682
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,800
Hong Zhou caught a cold, he is ill.

683
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,400
His Majesty sent two imperial physicians
to tend to him.

684
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,660
So why are you spending time
chanting scriptures instead?

685
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,800
Hong Zhou committed too many mistakes.

686
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,560
I fear it would take a toll
on his lifespan.

687
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,870
So I'm chanting scriptures
to repent for his sins.

688
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,110
You...

689
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,850
You never even step
into the Imperial Garden...

690
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,910
for the fear of stepping on an ant.

691
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,360
You are such a kind person.

692
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,740
How would someone like you
have a son as unruly as Hong Zhou?

693
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,610
If His Majesty hadn't defended him,

694
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,570
who knows how much worse
it could have been?
