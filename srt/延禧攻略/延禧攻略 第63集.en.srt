[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 63]

3
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,570
Greetings, Your Majesty.

4
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,350
Your Majesty, please punish me severely.

5
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,389
I've said nothing...

6
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,870
and you already know what you did wrong.

7
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,190
I punished Concubine Ling
without your permission.

8
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,360
Mistress,

9
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,600
I was trying to share your worries.

10
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,530
How dare you!

11
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,880
Who do you think you are
to read Her Majesty's intentions?

12
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,200
You bribed the imperial physician
and faked a medical record...

13
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,930
to make Concubine Ling's death
seem reasonable,

14
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,940
But you're too rushed...

15
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,200
to cover it up nicely.

16
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,840
Mistress, you mean...

17
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,970
Even if Concubine Ling is to die,
she can't die at my hands.

18
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,770
Get two things ready right away.

19
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,630
Send one to the Yangxin Hall.

20
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,960
And send the other...

21
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,480
to the Yangxin Hall as well.

22
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,040
-What are you doing?
-I just don't like simple orchid painting.

23
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,340
The gaudier, the better.

24
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,420
Your Majesty.

25
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,640
Look, doesn't it work?

26
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,100
You're being unreasonable.

27
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,700
Your Majesty.

28
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,560
Your Majesty.

29
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,690
Yanxi Palace called for
the imperial physician.

30
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,410
Why did you enquire about
the Yanxi Palace...

31
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,850
without my permission?

32
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,260
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

33
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,280
Go out.

34
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,480
Yes.

35
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,510
Come back.

36
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,360
Your Majesty.

37
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,050
What's the problem?

38
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,190
Your Majesty,

39
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,790
Concubine Ling has been
a vegetarian for years.

40
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,230
Her irregular diet...

41
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,000
has led to her stomach disease.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,560
Imperial Academy of Medicine
has made a prescription...

43
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,050
and asked her to eat congee every day...

44
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,440
to nurse her stomach back to health.

45
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,750
A disaster lasts a millennium.

46
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,140
I knew she won't die.

47
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,360
You may leave.

48
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,180
Yes.

49
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,690
Your Majesty.

50
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,870
What now?

51
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,800
When Concubine Ling left
the Yuanming Garden,

52
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,790
she left behind the Sound of Moon Dew.

53
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,960
Your Majesty,

54
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,790
should I deliver it to her palace now?

55
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,280
Where is the qin?

56
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,300
Your Majesty.

57
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,430
Here's the qin.

58
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,390
Burn it.

59
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,920
Burn it?

60
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,080
His Majesty's imperial gift
was abandoned like this.

61
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,330
It means Concubine Ling
doesn't care about His Majesty at all.

62
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,830
She deserves it!

63
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,600
Burn it! Now!

64
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,200
Seriously?

65
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,360
Yes!

66
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,810
What is this?

67
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,210
Yanxi Palace tried to
send this to the Yangxin Hall.

68
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,760
I intercepted it.

69
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,110
That wretch is expecting His Majesty
to come back to her...

70
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,890
so you must be cautious.

71
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,380
If you don't get rid of her now,

72
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,740
you'll get into trouble in future.

73
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,000
Mistress, you've got to
make up your mind soon.

74
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,790
Everyone thinks that...

75
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,260
it's me who wants to kill Wei Ying Luo,

76
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,850
including you.

77
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,720
You must hate me very much.

78
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,750
I'm doing all this...

79
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,920
to help you.

80
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,540
I've ended up like this.

81
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,880
Is this how you help me?

82
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,890
Like a phoenix rising from the ashes,

83
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,830
you wouldn't give up your life here...

84
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,050
if I didn't drive you to the edge.

85
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

86
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,370
Ying Luo.

87
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,310
Listen to me carefully.

88
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,340
Forbidden City gives one
fame, honour, and wealth.

89
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,840
But those things won't last.

90
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,900
As proud as you are,

91
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,190
how long can you live...

92
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,570
without His Majesty's favour?

93
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,580
Chen Bi.

94
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,990
How many faces do you really have?

95
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,520
I said,

96
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,390
I'm trying to help you.

97
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,880
A good woman like you...

98
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,450
should be cherished wholeheartedly.

99
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,630
What do you want?

100
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,580
Why don't you get it?

101
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,240
I'm trying to help you.

102
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,870
No.

103
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,560
To be precise,

104
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,160
I'm repaying your kindness.

105
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,090
Whose kindness?

106
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,970
Lord Fu Heng's.

107
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,760
If not for him,

108
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,870
I would've fallen into the deep abyss.

109
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,000
He's young,

110
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,330
handsome,

111
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,010
gentle, and attentive.

112
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,730
He's a dream husband.

113
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,740
I've been...

114
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,370
meaning to repay his kindness.

115
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,800
But I didn't know what to do.

116
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,060
Until I found out...

117
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,950
that he loves you.

118
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,920
That's all in the past.

119
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,680
But he still loves you.

120
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,400
It has never changed.

121
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,640
You drove Ming Yu to death.

122
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,970
That's for repaying kindness as well?

123
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,190
What a joke!

124
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,770
I've said it many times.

125
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,690
She chose to kill herself.

126
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,090
You can't let yourself
be fettered by affection.

127
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,990
You should think more about yourself.

128
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,550
Think about myself?

129
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,790
Someone was trying to send...

130
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,120
a dried gardenia to Yangxin Hall
in your name.

131
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,880
And I got it.

132
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,760
Do you want to know who sent it?

133
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,920
Empress.

134
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,380
Yes.

135
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,300
It's Empress.

136
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,220
If you don't go now,

137
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,360
you'll die here
in the Forbidden City for sure.

138
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,640
This is Forbidden City.

139
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,640
How can I leave here?

140
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,830
I'll help you.

141
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,400
From now on,

142
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,000
you'll be a free bird.

143
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,990
You and Fu Heng can be together forever.

144
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,050
I was presented to
His Majesty like a gift.

145
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,160
I lost my family...

146
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,590
and my freedom.

147
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,650
I can't leave.

148
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,440
I can never leave.

149
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,730
But you're different.

150
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,910
You still have a chance.

151
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,070
Ying Luo.

152
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,840
Leave before this frightening palace...

153
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,980
swallows you.

154
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,960
Go far away...

155
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,400
and never come back.

156
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,780
Day after day. Year after year.

157
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,800
You live your life
carrying a heavy burden.

158
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,210
Why can't you just remove it...

159
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,530
and bravely chase for what you want?

160
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,680
Start living for yourself once,

161
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,550
even if it's just for a day.

162
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,640
Who did that?

163
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,240
-Who?
-My hand...

164
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,250
You're awake?

165
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,700
Your Majesty.

166
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,220
Your Majesty.

167
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

168
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,540
You're drowning her sorrows.

169
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,760
Hailan Cha, good for you.

170
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,910
I don't mean to do that.

171
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,440
But when I get home...

172
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,370
and see the house decorated in red,

173
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,170
it literally kills me.

174
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,650
I'm an unsophisticated person.
I only know how to fight.

175
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,760
This is my first heartbreak.

176
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,650
Hailan Cha,

177
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,040
you are a man.

178
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,400
No matter how sad you are,

179
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,000
you mustn't forget that.

180
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,520
An imperial bodyguard
has the duty to protect.

181
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,910
If everyone is like you,

182
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,960
being so drunk while on duty,

183
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,580
no one would find out...

184
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,280
if I were ever murdered.

185
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,640
I am guilty!

186
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,640
Your Majesty, please punish me!

187
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,860
I...

188
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,250
can't let you stay here anymore.

189
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,480
Your Majesty.

190
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,410
Your Majesty, it's my fault!

191
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,500
I was wrong!

192
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,850
You can hit or scold me!

193
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,560
But please don't kick me out,
Your Majesty!

194
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,430
Your Majesty, please don't kick me out!

195
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,410
Your Majesty...

196
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,400
I'm sorry, Your Majesty!

197
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,620
Do you still remember your promise?

198
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,840
You said...

199
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,090
you'll go to the battlefield
and fight for Great Qing.

200
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,580
I've received a military report.

201
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,360
A small army has appeared
in the northern region of Huolan tribe.

202
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,550
I suspect...

203
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,580
they're the remnant
from the rebel army.

204
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,800
Do you dare to go?

205
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,990
I'm willing to...

206
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,210
fight for you with my life, Your Majesty!

207
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,380
No woman...

208
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,890
is worthy enough for you...

209
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,300
to lose your heroic spirit.

210
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,840
Yes.

211
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
If Ming Yu knew you become like this,

212
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,830
she too would look down on you.

213
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,560
Lord Fu Heng.

214
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,870
De Sheng, please inform
His Majesty that I need to see him.

215
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,150
I have something important
to discuss with him.

216
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,500
And I must see him now.

217
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,080
His Majesty is having
a meeting with Guard Solon.

218
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,550
Please wait for a while.

219
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,910
Lord Fu Heng!

220
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,870
What's the rush?

221
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
De Sheng,

222
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,840
please inform His Majesty that I'd like
to see him for an important matter.

223
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,720
Yes.

224
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,010
Lord Fu Heng,

225
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,339
your rationality seems to have won.

226
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,880
You'd rather stay loyal to His Majesty...

227
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
and watch her die.

228
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,390
That is...

229
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,200
She agreed.

230
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,370
Fu Heng,

231
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,390
you've let her down once.

232
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,800
Are you going to do it again?

233
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,110
Your Highness, His Majesty said
he still has something to attend to.

234
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,640
Please return to your palace first.

235
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,440
His Majesty will surely
visit you this afternoon.

236
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,290
Lord Fu Heng, you may go in.

237
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,650
Mistress, will he say it?

238
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,290
Fame, wealth,

239
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,510
power, and position. He has them all.

240
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,240
But he's still melancholic.

241
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,360
Obtaining the woman he loves...

242
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,700
is a great temptation for him.

243
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,250
No matter how hard he fights it,

244
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,670
he won't be able to suppress
the desire of his heart.

245
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,960
What is it?

246
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,370
[You've let her down once.]

247
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,880
[Are you going to do it again?]

248
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,770
Your Majesty, I'm here for
the military report on Huolan tribe.

249
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,640
I already...

250
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,340
know about that.

251
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,240
Fu Heng,

252
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,400
His Majesty has instructed me
to lead an army...

253
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,530
and assist General Zhao Hui
in pacifying the rebellion.

254
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,040
It's good that you're able to
pull yourself together.

255
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,500
Is that all?

256
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,170
Since you've made the arrangements,

257
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,170
it's all settled.

258
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,310
You may leave then.

259
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,170
I'm taking my leave.

260
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,520
Hailan Cha.

261
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,520
Yes.

262
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,540
How is Fu Heng's memory?

263
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,660
He has a photographic memory.

264
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,850
A person with a photographic memory...

265
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,160
would forget that he's submitted
the report last night?

266
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,560
Your Majesty,

267
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,140
he's serious with his job.

268
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,210
He's probably just asking
for your decision.

269
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,680
Hailan Cha,

270
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,740
there's one more thing...

271
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,280
I want you to do for me.

272
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,150
Concubine Shun has instructed that
you mustn't be neglected.

273
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,160
If I were you,

274
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,960
I would just starve myself to death!

275
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,920
You live like a dog.

276
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,700
I have no idea why
you want to keep living!

277
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,200
Your Majesty, Concubine Shun
went to the Yanxi Palace today.

278
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,120
But Concubine Ling
was still alive after she left.

279
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,440
What are you laughing about?

280
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,340
I can use others to kill whoever I want.

281
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,320
Of course Concubine Shun can do the same.

282
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,230
Greetings, Mistress.

283
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,530
Your...

284
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,540
Mistress.

285
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,550
See,

286
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,460
it has come.

287
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,840
You know what to do, right?

288
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,690
Zhen.

289
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,970
Supervisor Yuan.

290
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,520
Here's the thing.

291
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,840
I haven't thanked you
for helping me last time.

292
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,840
We are both working for Her Majesty.

293
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,370
Of course we should have
each other's back.

294
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,810
Moreover,

295
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,940
I didn't help you for no reason.

296
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,800
Tell me, what can I do for you?

297
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,560
Yuan Chun Wang.

298
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,710
I'm...

299
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,790
29 years old.

300
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,890
You're saying that...

301
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,650
Her Majesty doesn't
let you leave the palace yet?

302
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,000
Of course not.

303
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,600
If Her Majesty were that kind of person,

304
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,050
would I still serve her loyally?

305
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,030
Why then?

306
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,200
Her Majesty offered a large sum of money
and chose a husband for me...

307
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,720
but I rejected them all.

308
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,580
A palace maid usually
leaves the palace at the age of 25.

309
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,680
But I've been serving
Her Majesty all this time.

310
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,720
I don't want to leave her.

311
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,260
Moreover,

312
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,420
who will keep her company if I leave?

313
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,320
Then...

314
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,120
Hence, I told Her Majesty...

315
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,280
that I chose you.

316
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,630
Zhen.

317
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,270
Did you say so just to
put Her Majesty at ease?

318
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,640
Of course not.

319
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,950
Li Yu, call for the imperial physician.

320
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,870
Yes.

321
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,040
You're not focused on dancing.

322
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,560
You'll accompany Empress Dowager
to the Yaowang Temple tomorrow.

323
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,960
But you haven't recovered from the injury.

324
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,440
Your Majesty,

325
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,220
the imperial physician has said that...

326
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,020
it's not a deep wound.

327
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,310
I'll be alright.

328
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,330
Even a superficial injury
has to be taken seriously.

329
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,140
What if it leads to sequelae?

330
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,740
What are you going to do then?

331
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,000
Your Majesty,

332
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,600
you're so good to me.

333
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,560
You're my most beloved Concubine Shun.

334
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,260
If I don't treat you well,

335
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,100
who should I be good to?

336
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,490
But I'm not good to you.

337
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,170
It sounds like...

338
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,580
you're hiding something from me.

339
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,010
I've been hiding a secret from you.

340
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
I don't know how to tell you about it.

341
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,090
You treat me so well.

342
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,710
I can't bring myself...

343
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,520
to keep it from you anymore!

344
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,110
What happened?

345
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

346
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,640
Your Majesty!

347
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,780
On the tenth of next month,

348
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,160
Empress Dowager will go to
the Yaowang Temple and pray.

349
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,000
She'll be taking
many bodyguards along with her.

350
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,400
There'll be only half of the guards
left in the palace.

351
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,270
That'll be your best chance.

352
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,240
She agreed.

353
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,790
You've let her down once.

354
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,910
Are you going to do it again?

355
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,120
She offended too many people.

356
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,280
Now that she's ended up like this,

357
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
people will settle scores with her.

358
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,000
She's isolated...

359
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,360
and only served water every day.

360
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,670
How long can she live?

361
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Both of you promised to get married.

362
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,240
You abandoned her without hesitation.

363
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,730
It's because of you...

364
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,340
that she ended up like this.

365
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,560
Ying Luo should have had a happy life.

366
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,320
But because of you,

367
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,760
her life is completely ruined.

368
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,640
[The seventh of eighth month]

369
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,340
[Issued by Imperial Household Department]

370
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,060
Hurry up!

371
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,360
Hurry up!

372
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,890
It's almost dawn!

373
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,960
Empress Dowager is going out
of the palace today.

374
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,240
Her breakfast must be served
an hour earlier.

375
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,990
Hurry up...

376
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,440
Hurry!

377
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,050
We need to go to Yuquan Hill
and fetch spring water every midnight.

378
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,400
The journey from there to
the Forbidden City is an exhausting one.

379
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,270
I know, right?

380
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,000
What's the difference
between the well water here...

381
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,640
and the spring water at Yuquan Hill?

382
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,340
Aren't they all water?

383
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,080
-Eunuch.
-Eunuch.

384
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,730
Of course Empress Dowager
and His Majesty...

385
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,740
are served the best water in the world.

386
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,720
The water from Yuquan Hill
is refreshing and sweet.

387
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,560
The well water can't compare to it.

388
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,720
You are right, Eunuch.

389
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,280
If you dare talk nonsense again,
I will pull your tongue out!

390
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,490
Hurry up, all of you!
The meal must be served on the dot.

391
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,180
The Cangzhen Gate nearby your palace...

392
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,940
is where the water carts
pass through every day.

393
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,210
And it's your only chance.

394
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,690
Hurry.

395
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,680
Your Majesty, it's time to eat.

396
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,240
Here's a decree.

397
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,170
Lock the Shenwu Gate up.

398
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,390
Your Majesty,

399
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,760
Empress Dowager is going to
the Yaowang Temple today.

400
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,300
-If we...
-Lock it up!

401
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,480
Your Highness, you can't go in there.

402
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,600
Your Highness!

403
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,500
Your Majesty.

404
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,820
Your Majesty.

405
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,940
Please let Ying Luo go.

406
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,140
Your Majesty.

407
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,840
I'm begging you.

408
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,240
Please let her go!

409
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,750
I really regret telling you that.

410
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,280
I deserve to be executed
for having done so.

411
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,570
I cannot redeem myself for this crime.

412
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,110
The water carts for Yuquan Hill
should be out of the palace by now, right?

413
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,110
Yes, they've probably
left the Shenwu Gate.

414
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,090
What a pity that I won't get to
catch this great show.

415
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,200
You already know
what's going to happen in the show.

416
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,020
There's no point watching it.

417
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,560
Well said.

418
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:50,400
I just feel a bit empty...

419
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,150
because I've just gotten rid of an enemy.

420
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,480
Here's His Majesty's order!
Lock the Shenwu Gate up!

421
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,920
Lock the gate up!

422
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,670
Hurry and stop the water carts!

423
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,740
What happened?

424
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,240
Yes. What happened?

425
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
We need to head to the Xizhi Gate now.

426
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
Nothing.

427
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,170
Something is missing from the palace.

428
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,840
We're afraid it's smuggled
in these water carts.

429
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,190
We're asked to...

430
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,130
take it back and have a look.

431
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,710
Empress Dowager.

432
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,680
Shenwu Gate has been locked.

433
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,110
What happened?

434
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,270
Something's stolen?

435
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,160
Yes.

436
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,830
Something is going wrong here.

437
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,560
Unless a precious thing is stolen,

438
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,840
His Majesty won't involve himself in it.

439
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,460
The greater the scene is,
the bigger the cover-up.

440
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,260
Your Majesty,

441
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,930
the water carts have all been reclaimed.

442
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,410
Your Majesty,

443
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,340
Ying Luo has always been
proud and arrogant.

444
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,880
She couldn't stand
living in that cold palace.

445
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,620
She kept begging me...

446
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,670
to help her.

447
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,800
I really couldn't turn her down.

448
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,910
And I owed Lord Fu Heng my life.

449
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,050
That's why I agreed to help them elope.

450
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,000
But since then,

451
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,210
I've been suffering from guilt.

452
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,760
I felt so sorry for you, Your Majesty.

453
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,470
That's why I told you the truth.

454
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,150
Your Majesty.

455
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,920
For old times' sake,

456
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,280
please spare their lives!

457
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,520
Your Majesty.

458
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,630
Go ahead.

459
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Yes.

460
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

461
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,890
How come it's you?

462
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,240
Your Majesty, don't be angry.

463
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,770
Mistress instructed me...

464
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,290
to hide in there.

465
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,440
Mistress?

466
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,030
Yes, it's Concubine Ling.

467
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,860
What is she...

468
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,250
up to?

469
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,470
Your Majesty,

470
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,880
Her Highness said...

471
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,840
someone in the Forbidden City
is trying to harm her.

472
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,680
In order to lure this person out,
she had me hide in the water cart.

473
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,480
-Summon Concubine Ling.
-Yes.

474
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,740
No need, Your Majesty!

475
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,870
I'm here.

476
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,090
Greetings, Your Majesty.

477
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,230
What's exactly going on here?

478
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,880
Concubine Shun first incited me to elope.

479
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,560
She then plotted to catch me in the act.

480
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,910
It's a simple trick.

481
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,940
His Majesty won't buy into it.

482
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,400
Ying Luo.

483
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,570
Did you figure out that
it wouldn't go well...

484
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,160
so you prepared this in advance?

485
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,100
Even if that's the case,

486
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,950
you shouldn't frame me.

487
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Your Majesty,

488
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,150
it happened so suddenly.

489
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,120
Even if Concubine Ling...

490
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,760
figured it out that something's wrong,

491
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,640
she relied on me
to make contact with outside world.

492
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,150
If you want to know who's lying here,

493
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,520
just go see if Lord Fu Heng
is still waiting...

494
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,390
outside the Xizhi Gate.

495
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,910
Concubine Shun,

496
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,890
you're quite eloquent.

497
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,080
I'm very impressed.

498
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,510
Ying Luo.

499
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,030
We used to be close sisters.

500
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,400
I never thought...

501
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,570
we'd end up like this.

502
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,580
I feel...

503
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,180
so upset.

504
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,270
Greetings, Your Majesty.

505
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,720
See.

506
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,340
He's caught outside the Xizhi Gate.

507
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,940
It proves that I've been
telling you the truth.

508
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,840
Tell His Majesty.

509
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,340
Your Majesty.

510
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,520
There was only one empty cart
outside the Xizhi Gate.

511
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,720
I ran into Lord Fu Heng at the Shenwu Gate
on my way back to the Forbidden City.

512
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,820
Your Majesty, Concubine Shun
showed herself the other day...

513
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,420
and incited me to run away
with Concubine Ling.

514
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,720
I couldn't stand it and
wanted to report it to you.

515
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,980
But on second thought,
I had no evidence...

516
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,440
so it wouldn't be convincing
if I were to accuse her then.

517
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,910
Therefore, I had to cast my net wide.

518
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I pretended to agree to it.

519
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,890
Your Majesty,

520
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,920
don't listen to Lord Fu Heng's nonsense!

521
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,590
He's lying!

522
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,170
Didn't you say that...

523
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,850
I had no access to outside world?

524
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,280
Lord Fu Heng would surely be
waiting at the Xizhi Gate.

525
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,040
How come you changed your story?

526
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,990
Ying Luo.

527
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,320
I finally got it.

528
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,210
What?

529
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,160
Since the day
you got punished by His Majesty...

530
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,020
for having hurt me accidentally,

531
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,400
you must have been resenting me.

532
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,240
-So?
-You colluded with this lowly servant...

533
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,040
to put on a show and trap me!

534
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,720
You used your tears...

535
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,440
and our friendship...

536
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,680
to force me into helping you
with the elopement!

537
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,970
In fact...

538
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,870
In fact, it's just a scheme...

539
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,710
designed by you and Fu Heng!

540
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,940
If His Majesty couldn't find you,

541
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,750
he'd of course suspect me!

542
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,880
You...

543
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,850
You worked together...

544
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,190
You worked together to frame me!

545
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,340
You've come up with your excuse?

546
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,090
That's impressive.

547
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,990
Your Majesty,

548
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,210
you've got to believe me.

549
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,620
Even if I were to frame Concubine Ling,

550
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,250
why would I drag Lord Fu Heng into it?

551
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,990
He saved my life!

552
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,360
What Concubine Ling said...

553
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,750
doesn't make any sense.

554
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,380
I also want to know...

555
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,040
why you tried to frame me.

556
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,430
Even though others don't believe me,

557
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,750
I'm not afraid at all.

558
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,770
But, Your Majesty,

559
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,530
you've got to believe me.

560
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:21,780
Li Yu.

561
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:26,690
Present the box sent by Hailan Cha
from eight hundred miles away.

562
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,580
Fu Heng.

563
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,060
These are the reasons why
Concubine Shun framed you.

564
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,860
Your Majesty, what are these?

565
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,620
The remnant of Huolan tribe
have been pacified.

566
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,300
I instructed Hailan Cha...

567
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,270
to look into Concubine Shun's background.

568
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,990
Aibida claimed that
his young daughter went missing.

569
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,550
He'd been searching for years...

570
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,040
before he finally found her.

571
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,750
Then he presented her to me.

572
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,290
But that's a lie.

573
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,460
It's true that he found the daughter.

574
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,310
But this daughter of his...

575
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,110
didn't want to enter the palace at all.

576
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,830
Back when she reached
the marriageable age,

577
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:25,700
her foster father
presided over her wedding.

578
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,300
Aibida noticed her unusual beauty...

579
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,150
and couldn't let
her stunning look go to waste.

580
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,830
I see, you've suspected me all along.

581
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,440
Wei Ying Luo would never
work herself up...

582
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,890
and hurt people.

583
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,380
Chen Bi.

584
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,090
You were married.

585
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,300
She was married...

586
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,200
and gave birth to a child.

587
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,320
That's right.

588
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,360
I was married...

589
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,250
and gave birth to a child,

590
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,640
even so I had to enter the palace.

591
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,270
No matter how unwilling I was,
I had to enter the palace.

592
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,240
How did you pass the inspection?

593
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,110
I had my way for that.

594
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,280
You want to know?

595
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,690
Why didn't you tell me?

596
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,160
If you had told me...

597
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,600
So what if I'd told you?

598
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,970
You're the superior emperor.

599
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,020
And you.

600
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Fu Heng.

601
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,830
I wanted to kill myself.

602
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,790
Why did you have to save me?

603
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,350
-You fell off the horse on purpose?
-Yes.

604
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,370
What you did...

605
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,880
has pushed me into an endless abyss!

606
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,340
Thus, when I discovered
that perfume pouch,

607
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,900
I intentionally approached Wei Ying Luo...

608
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,690
to earn her trust...

609
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,690
and plot your reunion.

610
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,390
Then,

611
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,240
I misled His Majesty.

612
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,010
I wanted to use your elopement...

613
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,060
to trap you all.

614
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,320
But what a pity.

615
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,680
What a pity.

616
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,660
I have nothing to do...

617
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,870
with all this?

618
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,430
That's right.

619
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,920
You have nothing to do with it.

620
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,180
But...

621
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,860
Fu Heng loves you.

622
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,250
And you're His Majesty's
favourite consort.

623
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,450
But I never thought that...

624
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,980
Fu Heng is such a fool!

625
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,970
He was so tempted by my suggestion...

626
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,010
but he gave it up in the end.

627
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,170
He gave up on himself...

628
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,120
so as to help you.

629
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,410
Why are you always so lucky?
