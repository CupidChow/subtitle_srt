1
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,210
It hurts, right?

2
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,479
Furious, right?

3
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,080
Yes, it should be that way.

4
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,160
I do feel for you.

5
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,240
It's the same feeling as when you wanted to

6
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,840
leave the Summer Palace to enter the Forbidden City as a consort.

7
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,919
Wei Yingluo,

8
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,080
you must get it straight.

9
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,280
It was you who betrayed me,

10
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,560
not me who betrayed you.

11
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,160
You promised to be with me

12
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,360
for the rest of our lives the Summer Palace.

13
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
Did you know how much I valued that promise?

14
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,120
Hence,

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,160
this is a betrayal.

16
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,240
I will never forgive you!

17
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,520
When did you start serving the Empress?

18
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,200
From the first day when I decided to enter the Forbidden City,

19
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,720
I paid my respects to the Empress.

20
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,940
I have always regarded you as my real older brother,

21
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,320
yet you stabbed me in the back.

22
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,880
It proves that this is who you are!

23
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,140
We are no better or worse than each other.

24
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,480
Your Majesty.

25
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,250
What benefits did you give him?

26
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,120
I admire your chamberlain very much.

27
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,840
Starting from today,

28
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,840
he will replace Wu Shulai in his duties.

29
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,680
It took Chamberlain Wu thirty years

30
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,000
before he climbed up to his current position.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
As for Yuan Chunwang,

32
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,040
he doesn't have enough qualifications and experience.

33
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,800
He did a great job completing errands

34
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,000
at the Workhouse and the Summer Palace.

35
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Moreover,

36
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,450
Consort Ling, don’t you remember that

37
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,600
Wu Shulai exposed the secret

38
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,840
of you eating the contraception soup.

39
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,640
When His Majesty sees him,

40
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
he will always be reminded of this.

41
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,180
Do you think I’d keep Wu Shulai by my side?

42
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
It's a lost cause for him.

43
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,260
Naturally, I need someone

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,920
to replace him and assist me.

45
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,320
Yuan Chunwang is the best choice.

46
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,180
It's a pity that I racked my brains and tried my best,

47
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,650
but it was only to clear obstacles for you.

48
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,920
Consort Ling,

49
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
you must be tired.

50
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,680
You need some rest.

51
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,600
No matter what you plan to do next,

52
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,480
I have taken my revenge today.

53
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,810
There are no regrets

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,899
for seeking virtue and acquiring it.

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,200
From now on,

56
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,000
Empress, I wish you a great peace, good health and good fortune.

57
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,840
Her Highness.

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,460
I believe that in the near future,

59
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,970
a prince from the legitimate line will be born in the Forbidden City again.

60
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,200
Wei Yingluo,

61
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,680
you are the most graceful loser

62
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,640
I have ever seen in my life.

63
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,200
You are also the most patient hunter I have ever seen.

64
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,930
Full of regrets now?

65
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,200
Servant Yuan Chunwang

66
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,440
pledges his life to Her Highness.

67
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,060
If I betray you, may heaven and earth combine to destroy me!

68
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,920
Your Majesty,

69
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,159
Her Highness went to Princes' Residence to visit the Fourth Prince

70
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,220
and is not back yet.

71
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,360
It has been a long time since I received

72
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,480
an embroidery piece personally embroidered by the Empress.

73
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,280
Your Majesty,

74
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,800
Her Highness still embroiders every day.

75
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,880
It's just that

76
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,260
she won't be giving them out anymore.

77
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,200
Now that the palace gate has softly closed on its flowers,

78
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,130
Beautiful women file out to their pavilions of jade,

79
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,090
Full to the brim of the lips with Imperial gossip,

80
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:00,200
But not daring to reveal them with a parrot among them...

81
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,800
Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

82
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,160
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

83
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,220
How did you know that I'm the Emperor?

84
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,640
What does your owner want to say to me?

85
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,520
Your Majesty, what brings you here?

86
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,240
How's the Fourth Prince?

87
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,240
Yongcheng had a fever in the afternoon.

88
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,760
The Imperial Physician has given him a treatment. He’s fine now.

89
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Your Majesty, there's no need to worry.

90
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,920
With your care I don't have to worry.

91
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,200
But,

92
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,880
what is it trying to tell me?

93
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,000
Your Majesty, may you have an abundance of good fortunes.

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,860
I taught it for a long time. It finally can say it now.

95
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,480
How long did you teach it?

96
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,010
It wasn't that long.

97
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,400
Empress,

98
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,600
what you said to me last time

99
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,520
made me think that

100
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,500
you were only sensible and responsible.

101
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,480
I realize now that

102
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,540
even the calm water in the lake

103
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,440
has deep hidden feelings.

104
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,620
You are the only one

105
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,210
who treats me well in the harem.

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,920
Your Majesty,

107
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,520
I'm neither the most beautiful woman in the harem,

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,480
nor the smartest one,

109
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,240
but I will manage the harem well

110
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,840
to free you from any worries.

111
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,169
If you don’t want to talk about affection,

112
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,880
I will never mention it again.

113
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,720
As long as you know in your heart

114
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,640
that no matter what I do, it’s all for your benefit.

115
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,650
Being a good Empress for Great Qing

116
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,600
is the way I show my love for you!

117
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,760
Shushen,

118
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,120
thank you!

119
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,840
Thank you!

120
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,800
Hey, isn't this Mingyu from Palace of Everlasting Joy?

121
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,730
Greetings to Imperial Concubine Shu, Consort Qing.

122
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,130
What are you holding in your hands?

123
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,280
The curtains that I just received from the Imperial Household Department.

124
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
Every palace is using brocade.

125
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,800
What's wrong?

126
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,880
Why is the Mistress of Palace of Everlasting Joy is using vines instead?

127
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,130
There's not enough brocade. We will use this for now.

128
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,280
My Mistress is still waiting for me to go back.

129
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,040
I'm taking my leave first.

130
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,180
What are you doing?

131
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,840
Sister Nalan,

132
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,970
what are you doing this for?

133
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,320
Just let her go.

134
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,080
Keep out of this.

135
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,530
Go back and tell your Mistress.

136
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,920
I’ve suffered a lot in the past.

137
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,760
Today,

138
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,520
I

139
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,480
will let her pay back!

140
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,900
Tell her to clean her neck well

141
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,240
and wait.

142
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,640
Mingyu.

143
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,480
Her Highness, the Imperial Concubine Shu.

144
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,080
Imperial Bodyguard Suolun.

145
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,180
You are highly valued by His Majesty now.

146
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,800
You have a promising future.

147
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,560
Don't mess with

148
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,760
such unlucky people.

149
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,600
Don’t you see that everyone in the six palaces

150
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,480
avoiding Palace of Everlasting Joy now?

151
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,680
Her Highness, don't trouble yourself with such worries.

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,920
Sister Nalan,

153
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,240
he's an Imperial Bodyguard and His Majesty's trusted aide.

154
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,770
It’s not worth it for you to get angry with him.

155
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,700
Sister, you are right.

156
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,520
I'm busy.

157
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,620
I don't have time to be angry with you nobody!

158
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,880
Miss Mingyu,

159
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,800
His Majesty favors Sister Nalan.

160
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,560
She still holds a grudge.

161
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,680
Consort Ling and you should be extra careful.

162
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,010
Don’t come out so often.

163
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,560
Mingyu,

164
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
is your hand okay?

165
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Let me take a look.

166
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,040
I'm fine.

167
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,860
Do you feel better?

168
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,840
I'm much better.

169
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,000
Your face...

170
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,480
Is the cut on my face obvious?

171
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,840
I can’t let Yingluo see this.

172
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,040
Tell me!

173
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,040
Is it obvious?

174
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,640
Is it concealable?

175
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,360
Mingyu.

176
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,330
Has it been very difficult for your Palace

177
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,360
recently?

178
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Tell me the truth.

179
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,850
Frankly, it’s not very difficult.

180
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,570
Now that the gate is closed,

181
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,280
Yingluo has been teaching me embroidery.

182
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,720
She taught Zhenzhu and Xiaoquan how to read and write.

183
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,780
We actually are enjoying ourselves.

184
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,880
Those people from the Imperial Household Department

185
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,920
are so discriminatory.

186
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,640
Consort Ling's just lost favor,

187
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,700
and they dare to slight you like this.

188
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,640
Nothing was different at the beginning.

189
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
But after a while,

190
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,410
Consort Ling has no desire to return to favor,

191
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,210
so we don’t specially require anything anymore.

192
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,560
Alright. I have to go now.

193
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,480
This stroke must be steady.

194
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,080
Xiaoquan,

195
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,720
you must hold the brush in the middle.

196
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,560
Zhenzhu,

197
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,560
you are holding it wrong!

198
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,120
Learn from Xiaoquan.

199
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,410
It's time to eat.

200
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,760
Mingyu,

201
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,570
your face...

202
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,080
We don’t cook in our small kitchen anymore,

203
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,340
so I got these from the Royal Restaurant.

204
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,120
You can go eat now.

205
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,120
The two of you, go eat.

206
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,400
The Royal Restaurant prepared these

207
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,480
according to the rules and regulations.

208
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,880
But they were not the dishes you like,

209
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,920
I randomly chose a few.

210
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,640
The lotus roots are the freshest during this season.

211
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,770
There's also "Longevity vegetable."

212
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,280
This millet cake is the most delicious.

213
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,560
Try it later.

214
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,240
Sit down and eat with me.

215
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,360
Even though there aren’t many servants left today,

216
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,020
I still can't break the rules.

217
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,320
I'll go eat with them.

218
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,560
She probably didn't see it just now.

219
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,920
Her Highness,

220
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,450
I have already checked.

221
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,330
When Mingyu went out today,

222
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,860
she was given a hard time by Imperial Concubine Shu.

223
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,940
She struck her hand

224
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,360
and also scratched her face viciously.

225
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,760
If Suolun wasn't there,

226
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
I’m afraid it would have been even worse.

227
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,800
Her Highness,

228
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,810
for the past two months,

229
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,920
other than the Empress from Hall of Receiving Celestial Favor,

230
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,580
Imperial Concubine Shu is the most favored one.

231
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,760
Let's avoid them in the future.

232
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,560
I understand.

233
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,840
Master Fuheng and General Zhaohui burned

234
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
the two military camps of the enemy.

235
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,970
Huolan Camp sent an envoy to negotiate for peace.

236
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,340
What do they think?

237
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,640
Master Fuheng advised that unless Huolan Camp's commander

238
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,720
comes into the capital first to pay respects to His Majesty,

239
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,920
it shouldn't otherwise be considered.

240
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,760
It's just a stalling tactic.

241
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,560
The situation can change anytime in a battlefield.

242
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,820
Follow Zhaohui and Fuheng's decisions.

243
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,040
Yes.

244
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,880
Your Majesty.

245
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,080
What else?

246
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,880
Your Majesty.

247
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,160
I witnessed the people from Palace of Everlasting Joy being insulted today.

248
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,960
I fear that...

249
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,280
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

250
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,080
Hailancha...

251
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,040
Are you looking for death?

252
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,240
I committed an offense. Your Majesty, please forgive me!

253
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,920
Hailancha, you made a presumptuous comment regarding the harem.

254
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,520
You’ll be punished by forfeit of one year's salary,

255
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,160
retained for the time being as an Imperial Bodyguard,

256
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,820
pending future observation!

257
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,720
If you mention the words "Palace of Everlasting Joy" again,

258
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,980
you shall be punished severely and not be forgiven easily!

259
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,640
Imperial Bodyguard Suolun,

260
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,840
you saw that too.

261
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,720
His Majesty doesn't allow anyone to mention Palace of Everlasting Joy now.

262
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,640
Stop talking about this in the future,

263
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,240
or you will get into trouble.

264
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,200
I slaved for the master for thirty years

265
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,480
before I became the Chamberlain of Imperial Household Department.

266
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,720
On normal days,

267
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,040
I am always bullied by that stupid Li Yu!

268
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,600
And now,

269
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,040
a new man who's not even fully-trained

270
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,960
climbed on top of my head and abuses his power in a tyrannical manner!

271
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,040
I can’t accept this!

272
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,360
-Master, stop drinking. -I feel sorry for myself!

273
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,400
Don't get drunk.

274
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,560
I can’t accept this!

275
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
Master!

276
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,080
Now I'm just holding up my head with two shoulders.

277
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,160
I'm carefree now that I'm relieved of official duties.

278
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,760
I don’t give a shit now!

279
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,080
Master, lower your voice!

280
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,160
Master!

281
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,400
Don't you still have the Empress Dowager?

282
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,840
You can go to Palace of Longevity and Peace to seek help.

283
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Empress Dowager?

284
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,800
That's right.

285
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,960
I still have Empress Dowager to count on.

286
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Let me tell you,

287
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,810
I still have an ultimate leverage.

288
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,770
Empress Dowager will definitely help me.

289
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,910
Yuan Chunwang,

290
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,800
just wait and see.

291
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,390
I'm going to skin you sooner or later,

292
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,200
and turn your skin into my knee pads!

293
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,800
When that time comes, I will reward you with a pair too.

294
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,920
Who is it?

295
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,000
Son of a bitch! Dare to tie me up?!

296
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,540
Release me now!

297
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,200
Release me!

298
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,320
It’s me.

299
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,680
Chamberlain Wu.

300
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,040
Chunwang,

301
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,440
let me go, okay?

302
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,440
Let me go!

303
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,000
Chunwang!

304
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,680
Chunwang!

305
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,560
I’ll tell you a top secret

306
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,290
in exchange for my life!

307
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,600
Shush!

308
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,920
I'm not interested

309
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,800
in your secret.

310
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,440
Don't!

311
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,520
Please don’t!

312
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,520
I have a written letter from Madam Wenshu!

313
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,440
Madam Wenshu?

314
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,080
Madam Wenshu was His Majesty's wet-nurse!

315
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,880
You are lying to me!

316
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,320
I am not!

317
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,360
I wouldn't dare!

318
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,200
It's true. I'm not lying to you!

319
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,460
Chunwang, I’ve told you this top secret.

320
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,360
Let me go, okay?

321
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,360
Let me go!

322
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,080
Let me go. I'm begging you!

323
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Empress Dowager,

324
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,480
I personally copied this for you.

325
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,840
It's the "Guanyin Bodhisattva."

326
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,480
I did this to pray for a good health and fortune

327
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,520
for you.

328
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,280
Thank you for doing this!

329
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,680
Imperial Concubine Shu,

330
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,260
you are very considerate.

331
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,000
I also heard that you lack the "Avatamsaka Sutra."

332
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,840
If you want,

333
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,560
I'm willing to copy it for you too.

334
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,360
It's not necessary.

335
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,970
Consort Ling is copying the "Avatamsaka Sutra" now.

336
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,800
Consort Ling?

337
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
Yingluo.

338
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Empress Dowager,

339
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,680
I copied the "Avatamsaka Sutra" today.

340
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,360
My comprehension is not good.

341
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,720
The calligraphy is uneven and dull.

342
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,520
Looks like I should study more of

343
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
Master Cheng Guan's calligraphic script.

344
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,690
This sutra is written in blood!

345
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,770
You used fresh blood to copy the sutra?

346
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,120
The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment states

347
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,920
that if you love Buddhist teaching,

348
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,650
you must use your skin as paper,

349
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,120
your bone as brush,

350
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,280
and your blood as ink,

351
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
in order to show your sincerity.

352
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,480
I have seen a sutra written in blood in the past.

353
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,800
It's a pity that the blood turned black.

354
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,360
But yours

355
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,680
is a light color.

356
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,040
How did you do that?

357
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,040
Only the handwritten blood of an eminent monk can be pure.

358
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,520
Consort Ling thinks that it's related to many years of being a vegetarian.

359
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,040
Hence, she fasted for quite a few days.

360
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,680
This child

361
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,680
is very sincere.

362
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,240
But there are eighty volumes of the "Avatamsaka Sutra."

363
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,570
Are you going to use blood to copy them all?

364
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,840
Eighty volumes

365
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,640
may require decades to copy,

366
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,500
but belief in Buddha's sincerity

367
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,260
can be sustained for life.

368
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,000
If we think of it this way,

369
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,730
it won’t seem too long anymore.

370
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,800
But

371
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
this paper is so ordinary.

372
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,520
This is a copy for the Empress Dowager.

373
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,050
Using such paper

374
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,000
is too half-hearted, isn’t it?

375
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,240
Imperial Concubine Shu used porcelain blue paper.

376
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,400
It's dark blue and vibrant.

377
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,800
Ordinary paper certainly can't be compared to that.

378
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,480
Especially when a piece of that paper costs a few silver ingots.

379
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,080
That’s enough for an ordinary family to buy eighty litres of rice

380
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,320
or five catties of fresh fish.

381
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,280
Imperial Concubine Shu.

382
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,120
Copying a sutra is a matter of self-cultivation.

383
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,240
This kind of wasteful extravagance should not be encouraged.

384
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,760
Starting from today,

385
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,680
don't touch it again.

386
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,200
Yes.

387
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,320
You are very pious.

388
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,840
Go with me to Huayan Temple tomorrow.

389
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,340
Thank you, Empress Dowager, for your grace!

390
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,200
Sister Nalan!

391
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,600
Don’t be so upset!

392
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,840
That Wei Yingluo!

393
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,240
She can't count on His Majesty anymore,

394
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,640
so she turns around and fawns her way in with the Empress Dowager!

395
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,880
Didn’t you hear that?

396
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,610
Empress Dowager wants to take her to pay respect for Buddha.

397
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,250
I put in so much effort to

398
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,680
prepare porcelain blue paper. Turns out it became a mistake!

399
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,120
Sister Nalan,

400
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,440
Empress Dowager is a devout Buddhist.

401
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,160
The consorts therefore try to earn her favor by copying the sutra.

402
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,560
But have you seen anyone dare to transcribe the sutra with blood?

403
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,090
That's not just a day or two,

404
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,440
but eighty scrolls!

405
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
That's going to take over a decade of transcribing.

406
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,840
That’s so resolute!

407
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
Even ordinary monks can't compare.

408
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,050
She revealed it to the Empress Dowager

409
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,520
so she can never stop.

410
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,500
She's not afraid she will die from bleeding out?

411
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,280
"Die from bleeding out?"

412
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,290
Her Highness Consort Ling.

413
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,000
Imperial Concubine Shu.

414
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,560
I seem to have heard you,

415
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,480
curse me just now.

416
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,810
Her Highness Consort Ling.

417
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,180
This transcribing of a sutra with blood isn't easy!

418
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,560
It’ll take years!

419
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,040
I was just worried you

420
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,000
would harm your health.

421
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,720
Everyone says when the tiger falls, the dog takes advantage.

422
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,120
However, I think

423
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,200
if it's a truly fierce tiger,

424
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,560
it won't be bullied by a crawling dog.

425
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,520
Imperial Concubine Shu.

426
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,160
The Forbidden City has its own rules.

427
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,850
No matter how big a comedown I face,

428
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,200
my status is much higher than yours still.

429
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,050
Next time if you dare to disrespect me,

430
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,650
you won’t get away with just a simple slap!

431
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,650
Hurry and help me up!

432
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,080
Sister Nalan.

433
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,890
Are you alright?

434
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,720
Get lost.

435
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,490
All of you, get lost!

436
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,080
Arrogant and rampant!

437
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,800
Unforgivable!

438
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,240
Even if she's lost favor,

439
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,040
she's still one of the top four Consorts,

440
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,280
and has earned Empress Dowager's delight.

441
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,120
Sister Nalan,

442
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,800
don't cause trouble now.

443
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,640
I cannot control her,

444
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,120
but someone else can!

445
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,840
Empress Dowager,

446
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,040
why do you want to support Consort Ling?

447
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,880
I promoted Wu Shulai.

448
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,520
The Empress couldn’t wait to switch him out.

449
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,080
It's a sign of her greed.

450
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,320
Without Consort Ling,

451
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,440
no one can compete with the Empress

452
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,920
in the Forbidden City.

453
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,160
Her Highness,

454
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,800
although my status isn't as high as hers.

455
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,800
I shouldn't be trashed by her like that.

456
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,360
Her Highness,

457
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,680
please help me this time!

458
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,040
How could Consort Ling offend you since she doesn't even step out of her palace?

459
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,300
It must be because you insulted her and ask for it yourself!

460
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,240
Her Highness,

461
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,760
how can you side with her?

462
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,560
Consort Ling has lost power,

463
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,220
but she knows how to please Empress Dowager.

464
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,650
You’d better stop messing with her

465
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,360
and spend more time on cultivating yourself.

466
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,020
Don’t cause any more trouble.

467
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,740
If His Majesty finds out about today,

468
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,920
he probably will think you are unruly and willful.

469
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,480
At that time, will you still be able to remain your advantage?

470
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,960
Her Highness has taught me well.

471
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,280
I got too arrogant.

472
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,240
I will go back and think about my mistake.

473
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
I won't dare to cause trouble again.

474
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,040
Her Highness, please forgive me!

475
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You can leave now.

476
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,360
Her Highness.

477
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,040
Consort Ling was just

478
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,760
flaunting her powerful connections.

479
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,280
She borrowed Empress Dowager's prestige to attack Imperial Concubine Shu.

480
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,240
This is to intimidate the harem.

481
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,520
She's letting everyone know

482
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,080
that even though she has lost royal favor,

483
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,840
she can't be challenged.

484
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,360
Because she has got the Empress Dowager on her side.

485
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,560
It seems

486
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,840
the Empress Dowager is determined to oppose me!

487
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,200
Yuan Chunwang.

488
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,520
How's the investigation brought on by Wu Shulai?

489
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,680
Well done!

490
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,760
With the skin and bones gone, what would the fur adhere to?

491
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,840
So fantastic!

492
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,880
Her Highness.

493
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,320
Should I…

494
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,520
No.

495
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,210
This letter can't be delivered by you.

496
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,800
I have a better choice.

497
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,760
Yingluo.

498
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,520
You…

499
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,560
Don't let your tears drop into the blood.

500
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,720
It will taint the blood

501
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,320
and I'll have to bleed again.

502
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,440
They all say that you are trying to intimidate people.

503
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,080
But I know

504
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,900
you are only trying to vent for me.

505
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,960
From now on if you're bullied, don't endure it.

506
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,080
Remember?

507
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,560
Use my blood!

508
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,180
let me take your place.

509
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,720
Please?

510
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,570
It's not respectful to Buddha.

511
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,400
Then I will go to the Medicine Bureau to get some cinnabar

512
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,840
so the blood won’t congeal too fast.

513
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,800
Imperial Doctor Ye is deposed and in custody.

514
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,440
I've already implicated him.

515
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,100
Don’t bother others anymore.

516
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,700
Then you focus on writing.

517
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,800
I'm here.

518
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,180
I won't let the blood congeal.

519
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,760
Empress.

520
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,080
Empress Dowager is praying to Buddha. It is inconvenient for her to meet you.

521
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,080
Her Highness, please go back first.

522
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Consort Ling can get in there,

523
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,130
why not the Empress?

524
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,460
Zhen'er, watch your manners!

525
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,840
Consort Ling is accompanying Empress Dowager to pray to Buddha.

526
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,280
If others can familiarize themselves with Buddhist teachings

527
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,960
and discuss sutras and merits with the Empress Dowager,

528
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,620
they can certainly enter too.

529
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,160
Pardon me.

530
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,080
Empress, that's too much!

531
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,540
Empress, are you here to pay a visit to the Empress Dowager?

532
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,880
Empress Dowager is praying to Buddha together with Consort Ling so she has no time to meet with me.

533
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,810
I am afraid you won’t be able to see her too, Prince He.

534
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,080
I wanted to pay my respects with a visit to the Empress Dowager

535
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,410
since I’m already here.

536
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,200
Since she's got company,

537
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,170
I won't disturb her.

538
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,690
Prince He must be here to pay homage to Elderly Concubine Yu.

539
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,400
You are so filial.

540
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,960
Elderly Concubine Yu's spirit in heaven must be so appeased.

541
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,640
Then I’m leaving now.

542
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,780
What are you doing?

543
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,240
Replying to Your Highness.

544
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,880
These are Elderly Concubine Yu's old items.

545
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,940
Imperial Household Department assigned the Hall of Peace to store them.

546
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,480
Since they're old items,

547
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,370
I will inform to His Majesty

548
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,020
that I am taking them all to my mansion

549
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,200
for remembrance.

550
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,360
Well…

551
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,800
Are you deaf?

552
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,440
His Highness has made his words known. Just put the things down!

553
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:45,960
Yes.

554
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,100
Your Highness.

555
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,080
Should we take all the items back?

556
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,480
In the past, I had no responsibilities,

557
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,450
so I could come often to pay homage.

558
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,800
But now, I am out of the capital to manage affairs often.

559
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,170
Each trip takes months.

560
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,480
I don’t have any my mother's items by me.

561
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,730
So, let's take them all.

562
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,840
Your Highness. What is this?

563
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,840
I never thought,

564
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,060
being bullied by the Empress Dowager for years,

565
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,520
that my mother actually kept a life-saving talisman to protect herself.

566
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,850
Life-saving talisman?

567
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,840
No.

568
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,080
It’s the reason why the Empress Dowager wanted her to die.

569
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,880
Your Majesty,

570
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,159
Qian Zhengyuan, Assistant Minister of Rites,

571
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,719
presents a "Spring Sunshine" painting

572
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,719
for your viewing.

573
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,020
I don't need to see the report.

574
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,159
I already know what he wants.

575
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,690
I heard Assistant Minister Qian's mother has been a widow for forty years,

576
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,600
caring for her parents-in-law and

577
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,480
raising the Qian brothers.

578
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,199
Due to the family's poverty, she spun cotton every day.

579
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,560
Now, she has lost her sight.

580
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,040
Your Majesty is sage.

581
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,800
Madam Qian will celebrate her eightieth birthday this year.

582
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,520
Assistant Minister Qian asked a famous painter to

583
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,199
paint this "Spring Sunshine", hoping to present it to his mother.

584
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,560
And he hopes that Your Majesty can

585
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,480
inscribe on the painting.

586
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,960
"Who can speak of the heart of the spring's planting?

587
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,720
It shall be compensated with the love of three springs' sunshine."

588
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,840
This mother toiled through bitterness

589
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,080
to raise her sons.

590
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,680
She truly is admirable!

591
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,080
My inscription can be considered

592
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,410
a token of felicitations to her birthday.

593
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,520
Your Majesty,

594
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,520
Prince He is here.

595
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,010
Have him come in.

596
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,720
Your Majesty,

597
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,000
I take my leave now.

598
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,080
Greetings to you, Your Majesty!

599
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,810
Please rise.

600
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,440
What’s with the silence?

601
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,840
I have a lot to do.

602
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,100
I don't have time to guess your thoughts.

603
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,560
Your Majesty,

604
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,240
when I tidied up Elderly Concubine Yu's old items,

605
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,340
I discovered a letter.

606
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,450
What letter?

607
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,270
A letter

608
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,680
written by Madam Wenshu

609
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,810
before she passed away.

610
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,210
My wet nurse?

611
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,710
Yes.

612
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,410
Present it to me.

613
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,590
Your Majesty.

614
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,650
If this letter might affect

615
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,600
you and Royal Mother's relationship,

616
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,810
would you still read it?

617
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,360
Nothing is enough to repay the love given by Royal Mother.

618
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,600
Nothing in this world

619
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,070
can affect the bond between my Royal Mother and me.

620
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,640
The Fourth Prince's birth mother is the Qian clanswoman of Jiaxing.

621
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,880
Niohuru clanswoman killed the mother to snatch the son.

622
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,410
May you be careful, Prince.

623
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
Nonsense!

624
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,160
Your Majesty,

625
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,920
per your order,

626
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,440
I consulted the Imperial Jade Records.

627
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,000
Speak.

628
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,020
The Imperial Jade Record clearly states

629
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,520
that Your Majesty was born in Emperor Kangxi's fiftieth year in reign, the year of Metal Rabbit.

630
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,720
On the 13th of August.

631
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,210
Born to the current Empress Dowager of the Niohuru clan,

632
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,170
who’s daughter of Lingzhu. Your Majesty was born at Yonghe Temple.

633
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,080
Births of Imperial heirs are reported

634
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,480
once every three months,

635
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,680
with birth hour and birth mother recorded.

636
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,920
Every ten years,

637
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,120
a jade document is added to the manuscript.

638
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,560
Your Majesty,

639
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,960
even if it's edited every ten years,

640
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,480
there is the original document.

641
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,680
It can't prove if the jade document was edited by someone.

642
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,440
What did you find out from

643
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,360
the late Emperor's diary records?

644
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,440
Diary records and jade documents are in complete accordance.

645
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,800
Ministry of Rites received a decree

646
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
from the Empress Dowager at that time,

647
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,120
to promote the Nian clanswoman to Noble Consort,

648
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,180
promote Li clanswoman as Consort Qi,

649
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,530
promote princess Consort, the Niohuru clanswoman, as Consort Xi.

650
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,010
Even the records cannot reveal the truth.

651
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,520
Seems like only one person

652
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,680
can tell me

653
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,860
if Madam Wenshu’s words were true or not.

654
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,240
Your Majesty! Don’t!

655
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,440
Please don’t!

656
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:58,800
It’s bad!

657
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,480
If His Majesty go ask now,

658
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,160
it’ll be a disaster for everybody!

659
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,450
Greetings to Your Majesty.

660
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,240
What happened, Emperor?

661
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,680
You look so pale.

662
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,520
I have urgent matter to discuss with Empress Dowager.

663
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,650
All of you, leave us.

664
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:24,960
Go out.

665
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,760
Yes.

666
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,160
Alright.

667
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,960
They're all gone.

668
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,210
What's the matter? You can tell me, Your Majesty.

669
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,500
Before Madam Wenshu passed away,

670
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,640
she wrote me a letter.

671
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,480
Royal Mother.

672
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,530
I just want to ask you one thing.

673
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,080
Is my birth mother

674
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,480
you

675
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,280
or that Qian clanswoman?

676
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,000
Emperor!

677
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,880
If my birth mother truly was a Han woman,

678
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,360
then why have you

679
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,700
been posing yourself as my birth mother?

680
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,640
Emperor,

681
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,000
do not trust those rumors.

682
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,000
Imperial Jade Records can be faked!

683
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,490
Imperial Jade Records and decrees

684
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,520
can all be edited later.

685
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,690
No one knows what really happened.

686
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:42,760
So,

687
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
I came personally to seek an answer.

688
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,980
Please be honest to me, Empress Dowager.

689
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,080
Emperor!

690
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Empress Dowager.

691
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,760
Madam Wenshu was my wet nurse.

692
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,410
I know how honest she was

693
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,280
more than anybody else!

694
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,560
If you won't tell me,

695
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,580
I can go interrogate the old servants from Prince Yong's mansion.

696
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,940
I will find each and every one of them.

697
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,880
At that point,

698
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,640
it won’t be up to you anymore.

699
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,640
Alright!

700
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,720
Emperor.

701
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,360
Your real mother was truly

702
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,760
that Qian clanswoman from Jiaxing.

703
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,420
Then why has no one ever told me

704
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,320
for all these years?

705
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,680
At the time, Prince Yong was the late Emperor.

706
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,120
The Qian clanswoman was just a maidservant of the Prince Yong Mansion.

707
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,840
Once Prince Yong was sick.

708
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,680
She took care of him with diligence throughout the day and night.

709
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,080
Prince Yong was greatly touched and

710
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,280
made an exception to promote her as a prince's concubine.

711
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,840
But what a pity!

712
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,730
What do you mean?

713
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,480
It was a pity that

714
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,680
your fortune was too good.

715
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,290
I don't understand.

716
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,360
Yin Metal Rabbit.

717
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,160
Yang Fire Chicken.

718
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Yang Metal Horse.

719
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,920
Yang Fire Rat.

720
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,080
Embracing the five fortunes,

721
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,340
you were born to wealth and honor,

722
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,520
with the ability to help His Highness ascend to the top.

723
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,320
Such a golden fate

724
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,050
was destined to be extraordinary!

725
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,600
How could such a person

726
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,200
be raised by a common Han woman?

727
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,240
The fortune master said

728
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,740
if you were to be raised by the Qian woman,

729
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,920
she would disturb your destiny.

730
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,960
So as soon as you were born,

731
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,280
you were brought to me.

732
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,080
You became my son.

733
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,170
Then what about that Qian clanswoman?

734
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,370
In giving birth to you, her energy was harmed.

735
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,160
Only a couple of years later,

736
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,040
she ran out of gas and left the world.

737
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,600
Before she passed away, she held my hand so tight

738
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,840
and would not close her eyes.
