[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 1]

3
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,290
Stop looking at everything!

4
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,170
-This is the Forbidden City.
-So big!

5
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,920
It's the most honorable and
respected place in the world.

6
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,490
How dare you randomly view it!

7
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,860
Sister Uya, you look very pretty today!

8
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,550
Sister Uya, your hairpin is really nice.

9
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,930
This hairpin is also very nice.

10
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,640
Everyone, look over there!

11
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,980
Who are they?

12
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,540
They are those who have passed through...

13
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,410
to the final round of the
selection in the palace hall.

14
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,870
They are wearing such beautiful clothings!

15
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,770
I would be very pretty if I could
put on beautiful clothing like that!

16
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,680
They are from prestigious families,
entering the palace as masters.

17
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,450
We will only...

18
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,880
end up be maids even after training.

19
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,090
It's just wishful thinking.

20
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,790
Despicable and low-class maid!

21
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,680
My gambiered silk was
especially purchased from Jiangnan...

22
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,990
so as to prepare for today's
selection at the palace hall!

23
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,820
You got it dirty, what am I supposed
to wear in His Majesty's attendance?

24
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,060
It's all my fault.

25
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,560
Let me clean up for you.

26
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,280
Go away!

27
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,280
Young Mistress, please spare my life!

28
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,100
Tell me, should I spare her?

29
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,350
Sister Uya, she didn't mean it.

30
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,940
You should just forgive her.

31
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,340
I didn't ask you.

32
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,100
Young Mistress Uya, they are
maids who just entered the palace.

33
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,820
They are dumb like pigs.

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,160
You can beat or scold them.

35
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,420
But please don't allow your anger
to harm your health.

36
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,980
Since you got my clothes dirty,

37
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,899
then we'll have you repay with your hand.

38
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,760
It hurts.

39
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,340
No.

40
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,370
No.

41
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,400
Young Mistress Uya,
please lift your precious foot.

42
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,600
How dare a petty maid
delude yourself for my mercy?

43
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,100
Humble words from me
surely hold no qualification.

44
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,640
But today you will attend the selection
and it's a grand honour of yours.

45
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,530
It's best not to let blood taint your
auspicious mood and fortune.

46
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,990
You sure talk well.

47
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,400
But now my shoes are dirty too.

48
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,880
And I'm not happy.

49
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,800
You are ingenious, Young Mistress.

50
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,770
You have a lotus flower
carved on your sole.

51
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,540
But something is still lacking,
I dare to offer my assistance.

52
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,650
How will you assist me?

53
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,390
Ling Long, give me your scented sachet.

54
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,850
I...

55
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,790
Hurry and give it to me.

56
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,380
May Young Mistress
lift your precious foot.

57
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,780
This palace maid looks beautiful.

58
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,720
So what? She's still born to be a servant.

59
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,510
She's destined to hold up
Sister Uya's shoes.

60
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,210
May Young Mistress take a couple of steps.

61
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,000
Sister Uya, you're stamping lotus
on the ground, it's so beautiful.

62
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,370
So special.

63
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,420
I have not read much,

64
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,820
but the teacher told me this.

65
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,250
Noble Consort Pan of Southern Qi Dynasty
would imprint golden lotus on ground.

66
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,460
Lotus would bloom between her steps.

67
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,680
It's so exquisite, thus she
won the emperor's favour.

68
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,920
Today, I have offered a simple trick
to embed rose powder into your sole.

69
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,920
I wish Young Mistress to rise with
each step and reach your goal.

70
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,560
Alright.

71
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,610
On your plight of looking like a pug,
I will spare her life then.

72
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,290
Ji Xiang, how are you so foolish?

73
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,980
You almost got us in huge peril.

74
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,950
Aren't you ashamed to say it?

75
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,630
If it weren't for you earlier,
I wouldn't have made a mistake.

76
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,420
Look.

77
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,840
Alright, palace maids must pass
the sweeping and embroidery tests.

78
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,190
Blabbering skills alone won't work,
you need real skills.

79
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,630
You all shall go.

80
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,990
Hurry.

81
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,950
Ying Luo, that Uya Clan girl is so mean.

82
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,840
Why did you help her to win the selection?

83
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,930
I often heard that matters of the palace
come in pairs of blessing and misfortune.

84
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,210
Whether it's a blessing or a misfortune,

85
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,980
that is not yet set.

86
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,370
Your Majesty, the hall selection
is about to commence.

87
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,120
You should hurry and get ready.

88
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,539
Your Majesty?

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,640
Today is the selection of candidates,
what is there for me to prepare?

90
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,610
I better stay here and mend the flowers.

91
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,620
If you don't go, you will be giving
the one in Chuxiu Palace an opportunity.

92
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,270
Ming Yu.

93
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,690
Your Majesty,
hall selection is a grand event.

94
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,730
You should at least
go have a look, or else...

95
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,550
Empress Dowager will blame you again
for ignoring your palace duty.

96
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,910
You're so young but you all nag so much.

97
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,740
Alright, let's go then.

98
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,460
Good then, I will dress and
accessories you right away.

99
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,520
Greetings to Your Majesty the Empress.

100
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,820
You're spared further formality.

101
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,920
Empress,

102
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,390
the girls are extraordinary this session,
a few are just so beautiful.

103
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,680
Our Great Qing's selection of maidens
differs from the previous dynasty.

104
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,250
We ought to pick girls
from houses of honour...

105
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,960
with excellent character and
conduct to serve by His Majesty.

106
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,130
This is unrelated to their appearance.

107
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,560
But we still can't choose some
crooked melons or broken jujubes.

108
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,280
It would stifle His Majesty on sight...

109
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,330
and it would affect the
appearance of the royal heirs too.

110
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:04,160
The candidates can't compare to the
Noble Consort's glamour after all.

111
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,760
I dare not accept your
gracious compliment.

112
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:15,380
However peony is the most beautiful
and fragrant, king of all flowers.

113
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,950
Surely it's not something
anyone can serve as.

114
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,050
The Emperor has arrived!

115
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,750
I respectfully greet Your Majesty
and wish you good health.

116
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,180
No need for formality.

117
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,530
The selection begins!

118
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,330
[List of candidates]

119
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,760
Minister of Justice,
Socoro Dao Jin's daughter named...

120
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,580
Socoro Yu Li, fifteen years old.

121
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,300
The wind is very strong today.

122
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,960
It must be strenuous
for her to stand there.

123
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,860
Your Majesty.

124
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,010
Your Majesty, she is too skinny.

125
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,780
It seems like she will be blown away
by a gust of the wind.

126
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,350
Take down her tag,
then grant her a flower.

127
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,720
Minister of Imperial Stables,
Gan Tang Lin's daughter named Gan Ru Yu.

128
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,070
Sixteen years old.

129
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,590
Does she need to have five meals in a day?

130
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,620
Take down her tag,
then grant her a flower.

131
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,600
Magistrate of Shuntian Prefecture,
Janggiya Si Xian's daughter named...

132
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,730
Janggiya Ru Hong, sixteen years old.

133
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,100
Does she apply soy sauce and
bask in the sun every day?

134
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,070
His Majesty is saying
that you are too tanned.

135
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Why does she have so
many spots on her face?

136
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,590
Take down her tag,
then grant her a flower.

137
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,240
Minister of Imperial Sacrifices,
Uya Xiong Shan's daughter named...

138
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,930
Uya Qing Dai.

139
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,970
Seventeen years old.

140
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,600
What is that on the ground?

141
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,160
What's wrong with your feet?

142
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,270
Your Majesty, it's known as "lotus steps".

143
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,190
Remove her shoes and let me take a look.

144
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,860
Yes.

145
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,760
So the shoes have carvings
of lotus flowers on the soles.

146
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,560
The soles of the shoes are
even stained with powder.

147
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,740
She put a lot of thought into it.

148
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,200
Drag her out.

149
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,650
Your Majesty, I was just...

150
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,100
forging the lotus step to stand out.

151
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,570
Please pardon my offense.

152
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:03,190
Your Majesty, please save me!

153
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:11,350
Your Majesty, there's nothing wrong
with a girl trying to stand out.

154
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,050
If you dislike it,
just grant her a flower.

155
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,150
If you expel her in this manner,

156
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,580
how will she face others in the future?

157
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,120
I entered the palace for selection.

158
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,150
If I'm expelled in this manner,

159
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,270
not only will I bring shame to my family,
how would I live in the future?

160
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,330
I have already given the decree...

161
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,410
to ban foot-binding among the candidates.

162
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,160
But in today's selection,
there are a few with bound feet.

163
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,860
Not just the Han banners,

164
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,800
even the Uya Clan is learning such
an abolished and decaying practice?

165
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,110
Pan Yu Nu was a bewitching Noble Consort.

166
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,370
Xiao Bao Juan was an incompetent king.

167
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,660
Are you learning this from
her to create disorder?

168
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,690
If such a woman is chosen
to enter the palace,

169
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,410
she will definitely cause troubles.

170
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,280
Not only will I expel her from the palace,
I will also get her father...

171
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,350
punishment to set an
example for the others!

172
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,020
-Let's go!
-Your Majesty, I know my mistake!

173
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,360
It was that lousy servant who tricked me!

174
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,900
Your Majesty, it was that lousy
servant who tricked me!

175
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,210
Your Majesty, spare my life!

176
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,030
Your Majesty! Please spare my life!

177
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,660
It's so scary.

178
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,390
I know my mistake.

179
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,980
Your Majesty, it was that lousy servant!

180
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,510
What did she do wrong?

181
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,020
Your Majesty, please spare my life!

182
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,370
Chief Wu, you are here.

183
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,490
I'm here to take a look at
the new palace maids.

184
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,160
Chief Wu, there's still another half
of the lit incense stick before time's up.

185
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,020
Why don't you have some tea first?

186
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,580
Take me to the storehouse to have a look.

187
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,140
Sure, please come this way.

188
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,620
A palace maid...

189
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,140
needs to be clever and quick-witted.
Look at how silly you are.

190
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,190
Even if you enter the palace,
you will be kicked out soon.

191
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,580
I would advise you not
to waste your energy.

192
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,270
What a pity.

193
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,640
Ling Long, we grew up together.

194
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,350
Help me to think of a solution, okay?

195
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,250
What solution would I have?

196
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,930
I haven't finished my embroidery either.

197
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,180
Wipe off your tears,
don't let Madam Zhang see it.

198
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,280
Are you crazy?

199
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,910
The request is for a golden carp.
This part is stained with blood.

200
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,970
No matter what you do,
it's too late for you to retrieve.

201
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,220
We only have half the incense stick left.

202
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,200
You don't have enough time
to redo the embroidery.

203
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,170
There are two stitches left for the peony,
help me to finish it.

204
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,980
She's just flaunting her superiority.

205
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,910
No, I can't implicate you.
Let's switch it back.

206
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,230
Okay, time's up.

207
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,540
Put down your needles.

208
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,160
Chief Wu.

209
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,740
The embroidery skill is delicate, not bad.

210
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,720
This is...

211
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,920
Chief Wu, this is double-sided embroidery.

212
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,870
Great. Excellent.

213
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,360
Not bad.

214
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,230
What a mess. What did you embroider?

215
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,150
This peony flower is vivid, life-like,
has good form and charming.

216
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,390
The embroidery skill is uncommon.
It's the best.

217
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,330
That's right.

218
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,750
Chief Wu, why don't you take a look
at Wei Ying Luo's embroidery piece?

219
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,550
She took the longest time to complete it.
It should be the best.

220
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,440
Let me take a look.

221
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,050
Madam Zhang.

222
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,360
It's very skillfully thought out.

223
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,230
The needlework is not bad too.

224
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,410
Chief Wu, this batch of
palace maids is very talented.

225
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,050
Chief Wu, Ying Luo cheated for someone.

226
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,990
What?

227
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:34,240
Deputy minister, Nalan Yong Shou's
daughter named Nalan Chun Xue.

228
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,640
Sixteen years old.

229
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,010
What happened to your ears?

230
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,920
Your Majesty, my father told me that...

231
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,090
women wearing three earrings
and elevated shoes...

232
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,740
are traditions passed down
from our ancestors.

233
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,700
If we were to abandon our traditions
and mimic the Han women,

234
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,440
then it would mean that
we have forgotten about our ancestry.

235
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,260
Well said.

236
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,550
The Qing Dynasty has entered
the mainland for years,

237
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,080
the Manchurian traditions
are slowly being forgotten.

238
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,890
I ordered them to study the Han
language and learn their etiquette.

239
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,730
I didn't order them
to forget who they are.

240
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,790
Keep the name tag.

241
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

242
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,200
Guanglu Temple's Deputy Head,

243
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,880
Lu Shi Long's daughter named Lu Wan Wan.

244
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,340
Sixteen years old.

245
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,830
I still have reports to review,
I have to leave.

246
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,310
Your Majesty, what about this?

247
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:54,520
Empress, please handle this accordingly,
I trust your decisions.

248
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,280
If His Majesty left, it means that
there is not much left to see.

249
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,200
I'm leaving as well.

250
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:26,120
I saw with my own eyes that Ji Xiang's
piece has been stained with blood.

251
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,980
Wei Ying Luo exchanged hers
with Ji Xiang and completed it instead.

252
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,120
Rules are very clear within the palace,
if one person is cheating,

253
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,780
both of them should be
expelled from the palace.

254
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,940
Is that true?

255
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,340
I...

256
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,100
I...

257
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,080
What do you mean?
Chief Wu is asking you a question!

258
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,020
Hurry up and answer it.

259
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,770
Madam Zhang, it's all my fault.

260
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,400
Who said that we cheated?

261
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,060
If you don't believe me, just take a look.

262
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,690
Look.

263
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,640
They are intended as one piece
of peony and pheasant embroidery.

264
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,520
Because it takes a long time,
so we collaborated to complete it.

265
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,540
-But!
-Let me ask you,

266
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,100
when I handed this to Ji Xiang,

267
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,310
was the peony not
a work in progress still?

268
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:30,510
When Ji Xiang handed the pheasant
to me, it was only partly-embroidered.

269
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,740
Was it not so?

270
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:39,440
If they were both unfinished pieces,
how is this cheating?

271
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,130
This is an unprecedented
case in the palace.

272
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,700
Chief Wu, what do you think?

273
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,320
Well done.

274
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,930
Well considered.

275
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,800
You all remember this,

276
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:16,150
when serving inside the palace,
you have to talk less and work more.

277
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,400
Your masters dislike scandals the most.

278
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,280
Take her out.

279
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,240
Remove her name!

280
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,900
Chief Wu, I was wrong,
I won't do it anymore!

281
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,930
Chief Wu, please spare me!

282
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,020
Please spare me, Chief Wu!

283
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,030
Please spare me, I was wrong!

284
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,820
Ji Xiang, hurry and stand up.

285
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,840
There girls all have
extraordinary embroidery skills.

286
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,380
From now on, they will remain
in the embroidery workshop.

287
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,010
Yes.

288
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,100
[Changchun Palace]

289
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,420
Your Majesty, you are too kind.

290
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,730
Look at that Noble Consort Gao
talking about peonies.

291
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,400
She mentioned its extraordinary
beauty and heavenly scented.

292
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,760
She's speaking out of her rank,
why aren't you upset?

293
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,130
How many years have
you spent inside the palace?

294
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:29,680
Don't you already know
what kind of person she is?

295
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,820
Today is the selection day,

296
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,700
we can't let something
small upset us both.

297
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,310
Something small?

298
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,780
I just can't stand her arrogance!

299
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,840
You are the Empress, you have
a mother's love to care for all people.

300
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,420
Who does she think she is?

301
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,610
She's treading on Changchun Palace
every step along the way.

302
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,400
Ming Yu.

303
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,730
Your Majesty, I'm only stating
the injustice done to you.

304
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,140
Take a step backwards
and see the broader horizon.

305
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,900
With a little forbearance,
you will find calm and peace.

306
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,910
If you mind every little thing
in this palace, will your life be easier?

307
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,640
But the most important person
in His Majesty's heart is clearly you.

308
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,270
The grace bestowed upon you
is the foremost in comparison.

309
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,570
-Why the forbearance?
-Ming Yu!

310
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,510
Your Majesty is tired.

311
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,000
Your Majesty.

312
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,840
His Majesty had someone bring this
plaque which states "Meditate Within"...

313
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,150
and the drawing of
"Tai Si teaching her son".

314
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,890
Does Your Majesty wish to look at it now?

315
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,090
Okay, take it with you
and store it for now.

316
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,380
What about the plaque and the drawing?

317
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,090
Hang up the plaque.

318
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,080
As for...

319
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,500
the drawing,

320
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,650
pick a fitting date
and hang it up as well.

321
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,210
Go and arrange it.

322
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,770
Yes.

323
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,040
You can all leave now.

324
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,500
I want to rest a little by myself.

325
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,710
-What are you doing?
-Shush.

326
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,740
Can't you see that Your Majesty is in
a bad mood, you mustn't stick around.

327
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,160
It's only a drawing from His Majesty,
why is Your Majesty in a bad mood?

328
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,150
Do you know what is the meaning of
"Tai Si teaching her son"?

329
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,270
Tai Si was official wife
to Emperor Wen of Zhou,

330
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,220
Emperor Wu's biological mother.

331
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,920
She was smart and virtuous,
benevolent yet fair-minded.

332
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,320
She was loved by the
emperor and the people.

333
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,740
Isn't it a good thing?

334
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,170
It means His Majesty hopes Her Majesty
will follow Tai Si to be a great Empress.

335
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,220
You...

336
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,610
The Second Prince passed
away three years ago.

337
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,610
Her Majesty has been
melancholic since then.

338
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,050
She can't focus on anything.

339
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,890
His Majesty wants to remind
Her Majesty through today's act...

340
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,380
to not forget the duties of an Empress.

341
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,600
That's not it!

342
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,180
His Majesty wanted to
let Her Majesty know...

343
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,970
that whatever happens,
she is the master of the inner palace.

344
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,060
Don't forget the fact that His Majesty is
always concerned about Changchun Palace.

345
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,160
Her Majesty distanced herself from
His Majesty because of the Second Prince.

346
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,780
What's the meaning of the drawing
"Xi Ling Shi breeding silkworms"?

347
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,300
Why is Your Highness
so angry all of the sudden?

348
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,440
His Majesty wants to remind me that...

349
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,740
I have to be a diligent concubine!

350
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,490
Your Highness.

351
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:55,270
Ever since we entered the palace,
she became the Empress of Qing dynasty.

352
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,730
Her yearly allowance is
one thousand taels.

353
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,510
I have to settle for
four hundred taels less.

354
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,320
Changchun Palace uses gold.

355
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,770
Chuxiu Palace can only use silver.

356
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:12,210
Her honour guard surpasses mine.

357
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,670
During festivities or celebrations,
I receive a lot fewer rewards than she.

358
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,300
I can tolerate all this.

359
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,300
What about His Majesty?

360
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,400
I am a living person standing there.

361
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,260
His Majesty didn't even look at me.

362
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,660
His Majesty had only eyes for her!

363
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,290
How can one tolerate this?

364
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,050
The stupid drawing he granted me...

365
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,080
is to let me know that I overstepped...

366
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,380
and I bullied his beloved Empress.

367
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,810
Your Highness, you are rambling.

368
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,190
You misunderstood.

369
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,870
Misunderstood?

370
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,490
What have I misunderstood?

371
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,810
Your Highness, His Majesty
gave all six palaces plaques.

372
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,790
His Majesty ordered 12 instructional
drawings based on ancient stories.

373
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,820
For Zhongcui Palace, it's a painting of
"Empress Xu serving rice cake".

374
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,800
For Qixiang Palace, it's painting of
"Empress Jiang taking off hairpin".

375
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,470
Allow me to speak over my place,

376
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:23,270
does His Majesty intend to
raise both consorts to empresses?

377
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,780
What I mean is, His Majesty
was just caught up in the mood...

378
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,300
and wants everyone to model the sage
empresses and consorts of the old days.

379
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:37,790
Your Highness needn't stay angry then.

380
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,010
You sure were born with a skillful mouth.

381
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,450
Take a seat.

382
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,200
I am not talented,
but I wish to assist you.

383
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,380
Then tell me, what does His Majesty mean?

384
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,530
I am speculating that the
12 paintings combined...

385
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,030
represent the ideal empress
His Majesty pictures in his mind.

386
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,970
"Consort Xu's direct admonishment"
for instance.

387
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,650
He wants everyone to
be like Consort Xu Hui.

388
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,570
When Emperor Taizong committed mistake,
she spoke up bravely directly against him.

389
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:24,470
Then does drawing "Empress Cao farming"
mean for the harem to work the fields?

390
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,270
Your Highness.

391
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,880
His Majesty wishes for the harem to be
like Empress Cao of Emperor Renzong...

392
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,240
who is frugal and simple,
also valuing agriculture.

393
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,900
Drawing "Jie Yu blocking the bear" shows
his hope that when he's in danger,

394
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,380
someone can be as brave as Feng Jie Yu
to risk her life protecting Emperor Yuan.

395
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:48,140
As for "Empress Xu serving the cake,"
this needs no explanation.

396
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,820
It's for us to be filial to the elder,
Empress Dowager.

397
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:59,400
You mean His Majesty wants
us to be virtuous and kind,

398
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,520
but also beautiful above the crowd,
as well as frugal and family-minded,

399
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:08,360
with the courage to move forward too?

400
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,580
Your Highness, you are correct.

401
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,830
You are very smart and only needed
to be pointed in the right direction.

402
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,949
Does he want women or divinities?

403
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,460
When the Emperor was still Prince Bao,

404
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,699
you, Fuca Clan and Gao Clan women
all entered the prince's manor together.

405
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,100
Fuca is a family of high
ministers for generations.

406
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,010
She was favoured by the late Emperor,
so we can't compete.

407
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,070
But Gao Clan's power is just mediocre.

408
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,830
She got to be the second wife
back in the prince's manor.

409
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,790
She was of the same rank as you,
but now in the Imperial Palace,

410
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:46,050
she was promoted to Noble Consort
and is pressing you down.

411
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,679
Where's the justice?

412
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,969
Mother, don't say anymore.
I don't want to hear this.

413
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,820
You don't want to hear it?

414
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,840
If you don't want to hear this,
what do you want to hear?

415
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,040
You have been with His Majesty for
many years and you are still Consort Xian.

416
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,240
Chengqian Palace is such a big place.
If His Majesty doesn't visit you,

417
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,160
what's the difference between
here and the Cold Palace?

418
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,050
Gao Clan's father and brother
are moving up in the ranks.

419
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:14,020
If you don't compete, you won't be able
to get any benefits for the family.

420
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,420
What's the use of
sending you to the palace?

421
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,350
Mother.

422
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:22,120
Your pitiful father has
worked diligently all his life.

423
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,750
He's already spent two whole
decades as a banner commander.

424
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,240
For your pitiful father, please say a few
favourable words before His Majesty...

425
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,270
so he can get a transfer too, can't you?

426
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:37,550
Mother, this can't be done in the harem.
I can't make it difficult for His Majesty.

427
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,860
Zhen Er.

428
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
Make it difficult for him? Alright.

429
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,900
Fine, just stay here
and endure the pain then.

430
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:49,250
I want to see whether His Majesty
will take pity on you and look at you.

431
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:00,430
How did I give birth to such an
unremarkable daughter like you?

432
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,750
Your Highness, why don't you
say a few soft words to her?

433
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,040
What do you really want?

434
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,110
My first wish is for
my man to live a long life.

435
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,580
My second wish is to stay healthy.

436
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,100
My third wish is for us to be
like sparrows on the beam,

437
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,650
together for a long time.

438
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,730
Your Majesty,
I would like to ask something.

439
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,230
Those twelve devotion paintings together,

440
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:02,890
is that your aspiration
for the harem consorts?

441
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,060
Your Majesty, at least I am...

442
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,500
still half a man.

443
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,000
I have seen many women
in the Forbidden City.

444
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,580
Women look so delicate and charming...

445
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,120
with their elegant figures so alluring.

446
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,920
Then they learn a few poems,
songs, dances, flutes and zithers.

447
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,680
That is already a rarity.

448
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,360
To ask them to meld all
the virtues into one body?

449
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,070
Where do you find one?

450
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,160
I just thought they were idling too much.

451
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,090
That's...

452
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,940
Idleness creates trouble.

453
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,160
I granted the devotion
paintings to the harem.

454
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,180
It should keep them busy for a while.

455
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,500
Busy for a while?

456
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,370
That's not all that useful though.

457
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,400
Because most of them...

458
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,670
are dumb like you.

459
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:11,010
That they only think I'm reminding
them to be virtuous and kind.

460
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,360
In order to meet my aspiration and...

461
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:17,870
be that virtuous and merit-bound
woman to win my fondness,

462
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,180
they would have to
keep quiet for a few days.

463
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,310
Then I can have a few
days of peace and quiet.

464
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,350
Your Majesty, all this trouble
and you're messing with them?

465
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:36,750
The tributes are complete!

466
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,210
The gates are being locked!

467
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,870
Beware of lantern and fire!

468
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:45,910
The tributes are complete!

469
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,760
The gates are being locked!

470
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,900
Beware of lantern and fire!

471
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,380
Hurry and pay respects!

472
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,350
What are you looking at?
You don't want to live?

473
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,340
That's the consort's "Yi Jia"?

474
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,280
What an ignorant thing.

475
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,810
Only the empress's
carriage is called "Yi Jia".

476
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,600
That was Noble Consort Gao
and it's called "Yi Zhang".

477
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,550
Then, what about other consorts?

478
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,720
Those are called "Cai Zhang".

479
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,190
But only a mistress of
a palace can use it.

480
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,100
Ying Luo, aren't you curious?

481
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,630
Madam, where is
Noble Consort Gao going then?

482
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:52,410
You don't need to worry about
where the mistress is going.

483
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,760
Your eyes are already popping out.

484
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,960
You aren't that lucky.

485
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,480
Let's go. Stop looking.

486
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,450
Your Majesty.

487
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,250
So everyone's gathered here today.

488
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,660
Your Highness, Consort Chun is down with
the chills and hasn't recovered fully.

489
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:36,450
Of the 365 days a year,
she's sick half of them.

490
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,750
What a sickly one.

491
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,080
Your Highness is right.

492
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,900
Sister Chun is sick every other day,
her bones and body are indeed quite weak.

493
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,900
Yesterday we were discussing
of visiting her in the sickbed.

494
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,250
Consort Chun is sick, but she's got
the Empress caring after her.

495
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,190
I guess you all don't need to worry?

496
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,970
Yes.

497
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,550
You're always in a pair.

498
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,820
How is it you're alone today?

499
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,490
Imperial Concubine Yi,
Noble Consort is asking you a question.

500
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,740
Where is Noble Lady Yu?

501
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,010
Noble Consort, Noble Lady Yu is
unwell so she reported to be absent.

502
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,940
Another sick one?

503
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,240
I wonder what malevolent breeze
is coming through this Forbidden City.

504
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,590
Everyone's falling ill.

505
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,440
I guess it's time for the royal
physician to have a good look.

506
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,560
I said the same to her.

507
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,880
Just that Yan is always
scared of taking medicine.

508
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:02,540
She's only coughing lightly,
so I believe it's nothing serious.

509
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:07,070
She really doesn't need to be
seen by the royal physician?

510
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,980
She'll be recovered in a couple of days.

511
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,550
She's troubled your concern.

512
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,040
But this really doesn't
need attention paid to.

513
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:20,850
Everyone, today's hall
selection has ended.

514
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:25,110
The newly-selected concubines
will be entering the palace soon.

515
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:28,470
If anyone is sick,
get yourselves recovered quickly.

516
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,420
Those who aren't sick,
get your spirits alert.

517
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,850
Don't let the newcomers press you down.

518
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,100
-Yes.
-Yes.

519
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,420
Disperse.
