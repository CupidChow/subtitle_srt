[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 10]

7
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,030
There is only one possibility then.

8
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,479
Fu Heng has violated my sister.

9
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,720
Ying Luo, this is a serious accusation.

10
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,730
I confronted him today,

11
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,480
I asked him if he knew Man.

12
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,910
He said he didn't,  but he was so nervous.

13
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,040
You will need evidence. Do you have any?

14
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,640
I'm sure he knows my sister,

15
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,850
but he denied it.  Isn't that too obvious?

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,150
And that didn't prove anything.

17
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,480
Ying Luo, you are clearly a smart girl.

18
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,250
Why are you so rash and relentless
when it comes to Man?

19
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,730
Think it through.

20
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,579
Maybe that jade pendant
was  merely found by coincidence.

21
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,970
She couldn't find the owner,
so she couldn't return it.

22
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,110
Or maybe, Fu Heng did know your sister,

23
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,160
but he has nothing to do with her death.

24
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,290
If his conscience is clear,

25
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,180
he should have been truthful with me.

26
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,770
He's been keeping secrets from me.

27
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,090
he was clearly acting out of guilt.

28
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,410
Ying Luo,

29
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,160
can you stop being so stubborn?

30
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,160
Madam, you said my sister
was no longer a virgin.

31
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,620
Yet you refused to name the man.

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,460
Other than His Majesty, the only men
in this palace are the imperial guards.

33
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,220
If it was His Majesty, she was favoured.
Why wouldn't she say it?

34
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,260
It can only be an imperial guard.

35
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,110
She looked gentle,

36
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,840
but she was actually resilient.

37
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,320
If she suffered humiliation,
she surely will seek justice.

38
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,200
She didn't say it,

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,730
not because she didn't want to,

40
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,140
but because she was afraid to.

41
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,670
She didn't want to cause any trouble
to our family.

42
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,610
Who could make her feel such fear?

43
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,060
It would be none other than
the powerful Fu Heng.

44
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,230
He is the noble young master
of the Fuca Clan.

45
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,960
He's Her Majesty's brother.
He's the trusted aide of His Majesty,

46
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,860
a soon-to-be imperial officer.

47
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,480
He can't afford to be
caught up in a scandal.

48
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,600
This is the reason
why my sister was killed.

49
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,940
Very well.

50
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,480
But these are nothing but speculations.

51
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,810
Speculations with reasoning and logics!

52
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,400
Very well.

53
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,450
Even if your guess is true,

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,840
tell me then,

55
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,770
-what do you plan to do?
-An eye for an eye.

56
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,690
A debt must be paid.

57
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,650
that is only natural.

58
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,540
Ying Luo, you know Fu Heng's background.

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,400
Acting rashly won't end well for you.

60
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,850
It was hard for your sister
to raise you.

61
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,780
Did she do that just so you could
get yourself killed?

62
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,630
You...

63
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,390
Calm down and think twice.

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,440
Is it Ying Luo?

65
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,020
Come in.

66
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,540
Grind the ink for me.

67
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,210
Yes.

68
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,920
This is the stock transaction record
by the Imperial Household Department.

69
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,260
Why is Your Majesty selling the stocks
of the Imperial Household Department?

70
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,220
The six warehouses are full of
relics from the past dynasties.

71
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,520
I ordered them to transfer these items
to Chongwen Gate and sell them.

72
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,620
All the money earned
will be donated for charity...

73
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,400
and provide for the homeless orphans.

74
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,780
Your Majesty, shouldn't the Charity Home
be funded by the State Treasury?

75
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:49,370
The land is full of all sorts of problems.
How do you get the money?

76
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,450
Her Majesty wanted to
reopen the Charity Home...

77
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,520
and make it be funded
by the Imperial Household.

78
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,600
But the Imperial Household Department
kept delaying the process.

79
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,200
They always make excuses like
limited funding and circumstances.

80
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,840
So, Her Majesty decreed
for the old stocks to be sold...

81
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,190
and the expanses of each palace be reduced
to make room for more funding.

82
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,920
The intention was initially good,

83
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,620
but people are complaining.

84
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,850
They think Her Majesty
is just after the fame...

85
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,720
and the money will end up
in Changchun Palace.

86
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,250
Fighting poverty is
always a good intention.

87
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,220
Your Majesty should explain to them,
so you won't be wronged.

88
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,340
Kindness desired to be seen
are not true kindness.

89
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,590
A person with status and power
should help the poor.

90
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,659
They should do everything within
their reach to help.

91
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
That was only natural.

92
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Letting everyone know that you've
done a good thing and celebrate it...

93
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,510
is not a true good deed itself.

94
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,370
Seeking attention by good deed
is not a good deed itself?

95
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,900
Your Majesty, I'm not that well-educated.

96
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,660
But I find this saying very meaningful.

97
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,830
I will grind all the ink for you.

98
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,200
Ming Yu, I asked you to check on
Noble Lady Yu's at Yonghe Palace.

99
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,330
Did you pass the task
to other people again?

100
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,240
I dare not.

101
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,880
I just came back from the Yonghe Palace.

102
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,080
Noble Lady Yu is still the same as before.

103
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,560
She cries all the time and
wakes up from nightmares.

104
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,610
She has lost so much weight,
I could barely recognize her.

105
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,429
Didn't His Majesty visit her?

106
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,340
His Majesty is busy with state affairs,
he wouldn't have time for her.

107
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,850
It's easy to obtain a priceless treasure,
but it's hard to find a man who loves you.

108
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,380
Too bad, Noble Lady Yu
weren't Consort Donggo.

109
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,450
And there will only be one Emperor Shunzi.

110
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,160
Your Majesty, His Majesty
treats you so well.

111
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,710
Why made you have such lament?

112
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,900
I must be confused.

113
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,380
I sounded like a fool.

114
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,200
But Your Majesty weren't wrong entirely.

115
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,600
When Consort Donggo passed away,

116
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,800
Emperor Shunzi got ill
because of the sadness.

117
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,330
He even considered becoming a monk.
But this tragic romance...

118
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,040
will only remain in history.

119
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,960
Emperor Shizu was so obsessed
with Consort Donggo.

120
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,100
It's a love to be envied.

121
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,020
It's a different matter from
another perspective.

122
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,650
What do you know?

123
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,950
Let her talk. I want to hear it.

124
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,410
I dare not say it.

125
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,720
Say it. I will forgive you for it.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,460
Greetings, Your Majesty.

127
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,290
The Empress will be thrilled
by your arrival.

128
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,760
-I'll inform her now.
-Never mind.

129
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,550
I'm here for a chat. Dismissed.

130
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,050
Yes.

131
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,240
When Consort Donggo passed away,
Emperor Shunzi was heartbroken.

132
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,580
He cancelled imperial meetings for
five days, burned down two palaces...

133
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,880
along with jewellery.

134
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,310
He also ordered the execution
of 30 palace servants.

135
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
For Consort Donggo,

136
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,700
it was indeed fortunate to have met
a ruler who loved her.

137
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,610
But for those servants,
they also had their loved ones.

138
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,810
They were human lives.

139
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,720
Moreover, Emperor Shunzi disregarded
the people over Consort Donggo.

140
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,570
The officials, the citizens,
they all would rather have a heartless...

141
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,290
Outrageous!

142
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,320
You have no right to speak so
ruthlessly about Emperor Shunzi.

143
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,080
Your crime is punishable by death.

144
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,480
-Guards!
-Your Majesty, please calm down.

145
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,520
I gave her the permission to talk,
I thought it was rude to interrupt her.

146
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,010
Only behalf of Ying Luo,
I humbly apologize.

147
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,390
Please forgive her.

148
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,810
Ying Luo, apologize to His Majesty.

149
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,920
I apologize for my misbehaviour.

150
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,710
You didn't finish it.
Come, continue your speech.

151
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,770
I want to hear what other
treacherous words you have.

152
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,200
-Say it.
-Ying Luo.

153
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,460
Now!

154
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,750
Your Majesty, Emperor Shunzi once left
an edict admitting all his mistakes.

155
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,080
He allowed Consort Donggo to be
indulged in luxuries.

156
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,430
He regretted that he let his love
got into the way of duty.

157
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,710
I was merely retelling
the words of Emperor Shunzi.

158
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,920
Did you not blame Emperor Shunzi for
letting those servants be buried with her?

159
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,340
Your Majesty, that is true.

160
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,980
But Emperor Kangxi has
already given a decree...

161
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
prohibiting the act of burying
servants with their masters.

162
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,120
From then on, such practice has been lost.

163
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,490
So it means, you also retold the words
of Emperor Kangxi?

164
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,930
I am a fool,

165
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,340
my improper choice of words
led to the misunderstanding.

166
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,080
Okay. Tell me. You mentioned...

167
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,570
people would rather have
the emperor heartless.

168
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,900
What does that mean?

169
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,330
I heard that Your Majesty wakes up
at three o'clock in the morning.

170
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,840
During the summer,
the sun isn't as bright.

171
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,990
During the winter, that's only
after the fifth night watch shift.

172
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,080
With military operation in
the western frontier and military reports,

173
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,640
Your Majesty calls for a meeting with
Military Executives despite the late hour.

174
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,050
Military Executives would be
on duty every five to six days.

175
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,800
That's quite a toiling duty.

176
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,560
Your Majesty does this
for years and years to come.

177
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,320
Your diligence is worthy
of admiration and commendation.

178
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,840
But, Your Majesty is
busy with state affairs.

179
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,500
You have no time for the harem.

180
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,160
It's only normal
if the consorts felt lonely.

181
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,970
To be a wise emperor,
Your Majesty would need...

182
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,700
to care for the nation and its people
while heartless to your consorts.

183
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,110
Your Majesty, pardon my foolishness.

184
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,070
I must have misspoken.

185
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,120
You're right.

186
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Duty requires one to be heartless.

187
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,170
His Majesty is a wise emperor
prioritize the nation.

188
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,820
Your Majesty, have some tea.

189
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,360
Why are you still kneeling there?
Do you wish to be caned?

190
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,560
Much obliged for Your Majesty's mercy.

191
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,840
Wait.

192
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,070
Your tone and voice,
why do I find them so very familiar?

193
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,990
I remember. You are...

194
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,440
Go out and kneel.

195
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,510
Stop bothering His Majesty.

196
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,450
Your Majesty, please calm down.
Ying Luo is sharp-witted.

197
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,780
She has helped me a lot.

198
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,320
Seeing she has been of great
help for me, please forgive her.

199
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,700
My lady, I have seen that person.

200
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,640
A month ago, she was still a lowly maid.

201
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,400
She made her way to Changchun Palace
in less than a month?

202
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,600
She even earned your trust. It's clear
she bears ill intention and motives.

203
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,610
My Empress, how could you
have such servant with you?

204
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,500
As her master,

205
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,130
I know her very well.

206
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,770
I shall vouch for her.

207
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,120
My Empress, being overly generous...

208
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,360
is like letting a tumour grow.

209
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,440
Your Majesty, never doubt whom you chose
and never choose whom you doubt.

210
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,890
I trust her.

211
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,690
Ying Luo is surely not as vile
as you think she is.

212
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,150
For the sake of the Empress,
I shall forgive you.

213
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,530
Any more clever talks
coming from your mouth,

214
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,250
and I will have your head for it.

215
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,630
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

216
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,270
Turn around.

217
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,160
Head to the Bureau of Internal Affair
and get 20 beatings.

218
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,280
Your Majesty, I didn't do anything wrong.

219
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,390
The person I ordered you to find
is right under our noses.

220
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,540
Yet you knew nothing.
Are you blind or what?

221
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,080
She is that servant who scratched
the spiritual tree?

222
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,790
Make it 30 beatings.

223
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,880
Your Majesty, you said 20 beatings.
Why are you making it more?

224
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,390
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
It was all your fault!

225
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,240
I won't forget about this! Your Majesty!

226
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,610
Get up.

227
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,850
What happened? What's wrong?

228
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,170
I spoke ill of the late emperor
and His Majesty heard it.

229
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,119
Mind your tongue from now on.

230
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,200
Don't ruffle His Majesty's feathers,
it could get you killed.

231
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,750
Your Majesty, you heard
what His Majesty said.

232
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,260
Wei Ying Luo should be
kicked out of Changchun Palace.

233
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,490
We don't want her to cause you trouble.

234
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,060
I know about His Majesty very well.

235
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,140
If he allow what he is fond of,
and get rid of what annoys him.

236
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,860
Once he developed prejudice,
it will be reflected in his attitude.

237
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,370
Wei Ying Luo risked her life to
save Noble Lady Yu so selflessly.

238
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,730
Such bravery is very hard to come by.

239
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,150
I will never chase her out.

240
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,570
Your Majesty.

241
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,680
Enough. I have made my decision.
There is nothing more to say.

242
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,880
Your Highness!

243
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,840
Your Highness, there is report of
Eldest Young Master contracting dysentery.

244
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,890
Madam wants you to
figure out a way to send money in.

245
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,810
Money?

246
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,200
I only get 300 taels a year for allowance.

247
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,960
Other than my daily expanses,
I've sent most back home.

248
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,840
Your Highness, it isn't
easy to be a capital official.

249
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,880
Master has always been upright and clean.

250
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,590
Most of his salary is used for
the expenses of this house.

251
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,500
When the Ministry of Justice raided,
they took away the remaining valuables.

252
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,210
We are almost out of money and Master
is seeking help from his peers.

253
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,760
But he had offended many people
during his tenure.

254
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,480
We should be grateful they aren't using
our misfortune to make us suffer more.

255
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,280
Madam is all out of idea
so she wrote to you.

256
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,400
Zhen, come with me to
the Imperial Household Department.

257
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,920
Your Highness, why are you going there?

258
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,650
I'll ask if I could advance my allowance
for next year. Let's go.

259
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,650
Consort Xian, it's not that I don't
want to help you,

260
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,220
I just can't do it.

261
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,290
The Empress said we can make a six-month
advance for urgent matters.

262
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,860
We just need to personally
make the request.

263
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,130
Why are you telling us it's impossible?

264
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,320
Your Highness, the new Minister of
the Imperial Household Department,

265
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,080
Lord Gao, has just taken the office.

266
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,560
He ordered the sealing of all warehouses
for inventory check.

267
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,130
No one is allowed to open the warehouses.

268
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,000
Even if His Majesty needs something,

269
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,920
he will have to wait for the executives
of the Imperial Household Department...

270
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,330
and the other supervisors to gather...

271
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,240
before the warehouses can be opened.

272
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,040
When then will you finish
checking the inventory?

273
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,760
That's hard to say.

274
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,090
There are six imperial warehouses,
the silver, ceramics, leather,

275
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,160
fabrics, clothes, and tea.

276
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,360
A completely inventory
would at least take two months,

277
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,640
or at most six months.

278
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,000
Are trying to make fun of Consort Xian?

279
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,880
An urgent matter can't wait for that long!

280
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,510
Your Highness, I'm just following orders.

281
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,040
-I humbly ask for your forgiveness.
-You...

282
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,710
Forget it, Zhen.
Do not make it hard for Eunuch Liu.

283
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,080
Let's go.

284
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,480
The Noble Consort Gao wants the best
leather for Snowball's vest.

285
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,860
-Is it ready now?
-Yes.

286
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,690
I would never disappoint Her Highness.

287
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,070
I opened the warehouse yesterday
to get the best leather there is.

288
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,360
Take your time.

289
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,910
What a scoundrel!

290
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,280
He wouldn't open the warehouse for you,
but he opened it for Noble Consort Gao!

291
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,200
What is the meaning of this?
I need to get answers!

292
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,110
Forget it, Zhen.
We don't want more troubles.

293
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,450
Now that the new Minister
is the father of Noble Consort Gao,

294
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,960
it is normal they would
want to please her.

295
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,910
Your Highness! Snowball is
just Noble Consort Gao's dog!

296
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,400
Does the Master of Chengqian Palace
not as important as a dog?

297
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,400
Your Highness, I am sorry.

298
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,200
I misspoke. I am sorry.

299
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,450
Let's go. I will figure something out.

300
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,240
The early spring is quite chilly.
While you are keeping His Majesty company,

301
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,040
you even have to keep watch
for several hours at night.

302
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,860
You must wear thicker clothes
and don't catch a cold.

303
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,190
Sister, don't worry,
I can take care of myself.

304
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,650
That is precisely what you should learn.

305
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,000
The weather is getting colder.
Do as I say or I will tell your parents...

306
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,480
so they can get you a wife.

307
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,210
Sister.

308
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,170
Fine. I know that you have your concerns.
I won't force you.

309
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,880
But, if you have any lady
that you like, let me know.

310
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,480
I'll request for His Majesty
to betroth her to you.

311
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,840
Stop being so nosy
or I won't come here again.

312
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,990
Fine. Leave now.

313
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,710
I will take my leave.

314
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,430
Young Master!

315
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,690
Young Master, please wait!

316
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,690
Ying Luo.

317
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,290
Young Master, you said
it was improper that day.

318
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,730
What about this distance?

319
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,440
Is this the proper distance?

320
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,850
What do you need from me?

321
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,920
This is for you.

322
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,080
What is that?

323
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,460
The Empress kept saying...

324
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,820
she's worried guard duty at the gate
was too cold for you.

325
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,050
But men are different,
they don't use hand-held hearth.

326
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,400
I asked for a hog bladder
from the kitchen...

327
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,670
With warm water in it,

328
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,730
and sealed with a rope.

329
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,920
This little thing should keep you warm.

330
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,960
Hog bladder?

331
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,380
I washed it very thoroughly.
I guarantee it won't stink.

332
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,510
-You can have a sniff.
-No. I don't feel cold.

333
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,510
Young Master, you don't want it?

334
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,120
Fine then. I'll report to the Empress.
Let's just see what she has to say.

335
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,280
Very well. I'll take it.
Don't tell the Empress.

336
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,980
Young Master, will you use it?

337
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,210
I will use it.

338
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,170
I am glad to hear that.

339
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,460
Young Master, take care.

340
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,620
Thank you.

341
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,650
[Fuca Fu Heng,]

342
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,420
[even though I cannot kill you now,]

343
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,360
[I must at least let you
get a taste of it.]

344
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,820
Fu Heng, it's late into the season.

345
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,140
The wind inside the Forbidden City
is still cold as ever.

346
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,600
It's blowing right at my neck.

347
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,720
Is it? I feel warm.

348
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,090
Warm? How so?

349
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,720
What are you hiding in there?

350
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,080
-Let me see.
-It's nothing.

351
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,960
Let me have a look.

352
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,180
-Wow
-Give it back.

353
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,220
What is this, it's so warm.

354
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,740
Hailan Cha, give it back!

355
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,190
Are you really my friend?
You won't even share this with me?

356
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,670
This thing doesn't look very special.

357
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,860
But it's very delicate.

358
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,420
I doubt a guy made this.

359
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,250
-Tell me, did a handmaiden fall for you?
-No.

360
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,810
-Really?
-No means no.

361
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,250
The why should I care?
I want to warm up too.

362
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,680
-I'm freezing to death.
-Give it back!

363
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,800
-Let me use if for awhile.
- Give it back!

364
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,280
Give it back!

365
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,360
Hailan Cha!

366
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,080
Ying Luo, Guard Fuca is waiting
by the well behind the palace.

367
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,480
He has questions for you.

368
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,920
What have I don't to you
that you wish to harm me so badly?

369
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,780
What are you saying?

370
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,550
I was just messing with you.

371
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,010
I didn't know you have good reflexes.

372
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,640
It really scared me!

373
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,440
Even if it was a joke,

374
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,650
you hurt someone with the hog bladder.
Was it a misunderstanding as well?

375
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,810
Don't move.

376
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,560
-What are you doing?
-Let me check for injury.

377
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,720
It's not me, it's Hailan Cha.

378
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,250
He took the pouch from me and got scalded.

379
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,470
I am glad you didn't get hurt.

380
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,160
I was too impatient.

381
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,980
I probably didn't seal
the opening tight enough.

382
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,110
The guard you just mentioned, is he okay?

383
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,500
It's not a big problem,
but the burn is rather serious.

384
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,460
You really didn't know?

385
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,550
Young Master,

386
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,830
I am not a seer or anything.

387
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,080
I couldn't have known.

388
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,880
Perhaps I'm overreacting.

389
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,570
You are really not hurt?

390
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,830
Let me see.

391
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,940
Stay away!

392
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,500
Why are you so afraid of me?

393
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,200
I told you, a woman should not
behave like this.

394
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,780
You are still suspecting me?

395
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,430
-I believe you.
-Then let me have a look!

396
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,930
I really do believe you.

397
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,850
Young Master, this seems improper.

398
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,730
My apologies.

399
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,680
Your face is turning red.

400
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,030
Are you feeling unwell somewhere?

401
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,120
-Shall I take a look?
-No need.

402
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,550
My lord, put some ice in the pouch.

403
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,540
It will be cooling during summer days.

404
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,320
[Fu Heng, you got lucky this time.]

405
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,490
[Next time, luck won't favour you again.]

406
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,460
Change the bandage every three days,
keep the wound from water, okay?

407
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,430
I'll keep that in mind.

408
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,710
-Thank you, imperial physician.
-Thank you.

409
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,590
Just my luck.

410
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,970
This came out of nowhere.

411
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,800
You shouldn't have taken my pouch.

412
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,130
What pouch? It's obviously a power keg!

413
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,380
I got scalded so badly
even with my thick skin.

414
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,780
If it were you, your would have
lost your skin.

415
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,980
Are you saying I'm not as tough as you?

416
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,570
Do you want to put it to the test?

417
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,100
It hurts.

418
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,840
The most unbearable thing really
is the grace of a beauty.

419
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,960
I don't want any business
with this kind of affection.

420
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,420
What are you rambling about?
She's just being thoughtful.

421
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,310
She was being thoughtful?

422
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,660
So why is no one being
thoughtful for me?

423
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,110
This thing may have blown up,

424
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,720
but to be honest it's not easy
to process a hog bladder.

425
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,000
You need to seal the opening with a rope.

426
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,920
That is at least two days worth of work.

427
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,490
If she made it just for you,

428
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,220
if it's not love, what else could it be?

429
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,510
Nonsense.

430
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,730
I bet the girl who made it for you,

431
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,580
has fallen for you!

432
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,930
Shut your mouth.

433
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,790
Where are you going? Don't go!

434
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,760
Let me use the pouch in the summer later!

435
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,700
It's been two hours,
is there any that you like?

436
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,900
What's wrong Supervisor Liu,
does this upset you?

437
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,310
I wouldn't dare.

438
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,840
Don't you worry, Lord Gao is...

439
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,110
Noble Consort Gao's father.

440
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,420
We are thus Noble Consort Gao's servants.

441
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,180
The dog of our master is like our brother.

442
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,140
We mustn't let our brother
wear a lousy rug.

443
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,920
Supervisor Liu, I didn't expect you
to be so humorous.

444
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,650
At least I managed to make you smile,
that is worth it for me.

445
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,550
Supervisor Liu, what was
Consort Xian doing here?

446
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,920
She wanted to withdraw her allowance
for the coming year in advance.

447
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,880
Your Highness, what are you doing?

448
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,650
These are your favourite jewellery.

449
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,190
Nothing comes before Chang Shou's life.

450
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,080
Take these and sneak them out
from the Shenwu Gate.

451
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,880
Pawn these for money.

452
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Your Highness, you mustn't do this.

453
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,290
Do as I say, we are running out of time.

454
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,560
Go on, go.

455
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,850
No, wait.

456
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,960
Your Highness, what's wrong?

457
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,750
Life is at stake here,
I will see to it myself.

458
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,800
Really?

459
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,340
It seems like Consort Xian is
very short of money indeed.

460
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,710
Keep an eye on them.

461
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,100
Yes.

462
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,400
Can we trust this person?

463
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,320
The eunuchs passing through Shenwu gate
cannot carry anything with them.

464
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,640
But the ones who know the way
can get pass the guards.

465
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,280
Zhao Qing is the head of eunuchs,
he has enough influence here.

466
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,860
He will find a way to sneak
the jewellery out.

467
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,950
They are here.

468
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,150
Greetings to the Consort.

469
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,240
At ease.

470
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,330
Take the bag, and sell the things inside.

471
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,260
You get 20 percent for commission.

472
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,640
Those are your belongings, we dare not.

473
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,340
Sneaking these out of the palace is risky,
you earned this money.

474
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,530
But I must make it clear for you.

475
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,570
When these left your hands
and entered the pawn shop,

476
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,960
you mustn't mention anything
about Chengqian Palace.

477
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,240
You mustn't use my name
to rip those merchants off.

478
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,280
They should be sold
at the price accordingly.

479
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,520
Do that or pay for your mistake.

480
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,740
Don't worry, I understand.

481
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,080
How dare you!

482
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,790
How dare you to steal from the palace.

483
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,200
How can Consort Xian,
who is respected by all,

484
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,600
resort to such unsightly conduct?

485
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,650
Greetings to the Noble Consort Gao.

486
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,460
You scoundrel!
How dare you steal from the palace!

487
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,040
Have you learnt nothing from me?

488
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,090
Do you not know the rules?

489
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,520
Master?

490
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,300
Your Highness, all the fault...

491
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,590
lies with this scoundrel!

492
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,070
He has been blinded
by power and greed.

493
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,920
I noticed he was acting suspicious,
so I followed him.

494
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,440
This is where I uncovered his crime!
Pardon me for the lack of discipline.

495
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,960
Please forgive us.

496
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,380
He is a liar!

497
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,800
Your Highness, it wasn't my idea!

498
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,370
Shut your mouth or they will
have your head for this!

499
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,180
Consort Xian, it's all my fault.

500
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,010
I was blinded by wealth
and I stole from you.

501
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:12,989
if you didn't stop me here,
I'd be committing a grave mistake.

502
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,969
Zhen, this...

503
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,790
Your Highness, it was all my fault.

504
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,440
I was secretly working with him.

505
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,739
My master knew nothing about this!

506
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,520
My master noticed something was off,

507
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,290
so she followed me here
and caught us red-handed.

508
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:31,100
-Please, this is not my master's doing!
-Zhen.

509
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,070
It was all my fault!

510
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,389
I deserve the punishment of death.

511
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,590
I deserve the punishment of death.

512
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,190
Consort Xian.

513
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,590
Did these servants secretly...

514
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,760
steal the items from Chengqian Palace?

515
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,320
Is that true?

516
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,929
Yes, we did it.

517
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,360
Your Highness,
I know you have a kind heart,

518
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,370
but you caught us in the middle
of our action.

519
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,270
I'm at fault.
I don't deserve any mercy from you.

520
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,330
I should be punished for this.

521
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,780
Zhen.

522
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,010
Did you hear what she said?

523
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,870
Admit your crime to Her Highness now.

524
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,690
Your Highness, they are lying!

525
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,150
-Admit your crime now!
-I didn't commit any crime!

526
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,520
Admit your crime! Admit it now!

527
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,720
I didn't commit any crime.

528
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,330
Stop denying it!

529
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,590
-We should double your punishment!
-I'm not guilty!

530
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,680
-Admit your crime now.
-I'm not guilty.

531
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,810
Enough.

532
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,730
Your Highness.

533
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,020
These two servants committed evil deeds.

534
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,130
How should we handle this?
We will listen to your judgement.

535
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,770
Stealing items from the palace...

536
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,930
is a major crime.

537
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,840
Take them to Bureau of Internal Affair.

538
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,190
One hundred beatings for each of them.

539
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,290
This was not my idea.
I'm not guilty. I'm not guilty!

540
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,720
-Your Highness!
-Stop it.

541
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,040
Zhen didn't steal anything
from the Chengqian Palace.

542
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,470
She merely followed my order.

543
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,740
Since the order came from you,

544
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,910
is there a reason why you did so?

545
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,970
I was short of money and
I sold my jewellery.

546
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,890
Consort Xian, oh, Consort Xian.

547
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,250
Are you turning senile?

548
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,160
Your jewellery?
Since when were these yours to sell?

549
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,980
These were given to you by His Majesty.

550
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,970
I didn't touch any of the palace rewards.

551
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,360
My mother prepared these for me
before I was married here.

552
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,720
None of these are from the palace.
I'm short of money now

553
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,750
I am pawning these for money.
What's wrong with this?

554
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,720
If anyone were to find out about this,

555
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,960
they will be so shocked.

556
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,360
A consort of the Qing dynasty...

557
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,760
has become as poor as
the lowly peasants.

558
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,010
These barely look decent to my eyes.

559
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,850
How much money do you expect
to get from these?

560
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,410
-None of your concerns.
-None of my concerns?

561
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,800
I will not intervene with your own
family matter if it was not my concern.

562
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,930
But you should know there are
rules in the Forbidden City.

563
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,740
Stealing from the palace...

564
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,420
is a major crime.

565
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,340
Regardless of who owns the jewellery,
as long as they are here,

566
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,820
they belong to the palace.

567
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,990
The eunuch sneaks
these out of Shenwu Gate to pawn them.

568
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,000
This is smuggling.

569
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,680
It's theft!

570
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,880
Noble Consort,
my younger brother, Chang Shou,

571
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,660
is now ill while imprisoned.

572
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,890
He needs money for treatments.

573
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,760
I had no choice but to sell my belongings.

574
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,950
I didn't intent to violate
the laws of palace.

575
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,170
Would you be so kind as to spare us...

576
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,260
and let me sell the jewellery.
You will be saving a man's life.

577
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,820
I will never forget your act of kindness.

578
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,880
You mean to say...

579
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,600
you are begging for my mercy?

580
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,190
Yes, I'm begging you.

581
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,290
If one wants to beg,

582
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,620
she must have the right attitude.

583
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,050
Fine.

584
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,520
Today, I, Hoifa-Nara Shushen...

585
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,500
-Your Highness!
-Kneel.

586
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,980
I beg for Noble Consort Gao
to show me mercy.

587
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,280
Fine. Since you have put it this way,

588
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,720
I shall be answer your begging
with my kindness.

589
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,100
From now on, we as sister...

590
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,680
will have each other's back
in time of needs.

591
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,160
Your Highness, these are
two very different matters.

592
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,640
I won't take part in the in-fighting
of the harem.

593
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:55,050
So, you refuse to obey me.

594
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,350
I am incapable of any grand plots,
I can be of no help for you.

595
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,630
Very well.

596
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,870
I can only handle this according
to the rules of the palace.

597
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,260
Your Highness, these are
my personal belongings.

598
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,410
I didn't steal anything from the palace.

599
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,140
How will you proceed with this?

600
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,920
Which is why I am...

601
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,640
going to destroy these smuggled goods

602
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,280
according to the rules.Take action.

603
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,080
Don't, Your Highness.

604
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,380
These are her favourite items.

605
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,050
Don't!

606
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,200
-Zhen.
-These are her...

607
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,100
Zhen. Forget about it.

608
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,440
Let's go back.

609
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,240
Say "Father".

610
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,160
-Father.
-Father.

611
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:18,090
-Father.
-Father.

612
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,840
Greetings, my father.

613
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,800
You are a prince. Yong Cheng.

614
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,560
Look at me.

615
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,750
"Greetings, my father."

616
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,480
"May you live long and prosper."

617
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,960
I have already taught you so many times.
You are a prince. Understand?

618
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,480
You must learn how to say this,
"Greetings, my father."

619
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,520
Greetings, my father.

620
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,800
Stop doing that or I am going to be mad.

621
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,340
Your Highness.

622
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,960
Fourth Prince is still young.
Take your time with him.

623
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,260
He is still young?  I leave him to you.

624
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,580
Come. Wet nurse?

625
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,570
He learns nothing at all.

626
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,030
-Take him with you.
-Yes.

627
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,960
He's still young?
He is already two years old.

628
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,040
He can't even speak clearly.

629
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,110
When the Second Prince was at his age,

630
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,960
he could recite the poem to His Majesty.
He was a brilliant child.

631
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,200
Your Highness, prodigies are
doomed with short life.

632
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,160
Second Prince was too outstanding.

633
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,530
That was why he died at such a young age.
In comparison,

634
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,080
our Fourth Prince may not
posses great talent,

635
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,460
but he's healthy.
He will surely be blessed with long life.

636
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,860
That does make sense.

637
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,800
By the way, any news
from the Yonghe Palace?

638
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,240
Her Majesty treated
Noble Lady Yu very well.

639
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,270
She has been invited to visit the garden.

640
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,190
The imperial physician said her health
has improved.

641
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,110
The Empress is too nosy.

642
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,400
If Noble Lady Yu gives birth
to a smart and witty child,

643
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,260
Yong Cheng won't have a place in here.

644
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,730
My Lady, are you saying...

645
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,760
Shuang, I think the weather
will be great tomorrow.

646
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,790
It has been a long time since
we invited Noble Lady Yu to the garden.
