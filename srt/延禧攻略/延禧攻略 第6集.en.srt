[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,210
She committed a grave scandalous act.
No one would dare mention it.

4
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,640
Liar!

5
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,900
My sister is not someone like that!

6
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,530
If you don't believe me,
you can ask Madam Zhang about it.

7
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,260
Are you saying that...

8
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,080
Madam Zhang knows about it too?

9
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,680
Your sister was her most
highly-valued embroidery maid.

10
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,610
How could she not know?

11
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,010
Did you see it?

12
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,400
Just do it like this.

13
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,480
-Madam, be careful.
-Okay.

14
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,560
Just move forward.

15
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,800
-Be gentle. You can't do it like this.
-Madam Zhang!

16
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,190
-Keep an eye on them.
-Be careful.

17
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,079
What happened? Why are you in such a rush?

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,040
Wei Ying Ning is my sister.

19
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,000
Come with me.

20
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,360
I told you many times
not to mention this name again.

21
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,520
You're breaking the taboo.

22
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,400
But you never told me that
she and Man are the same person.

23
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,740
They are indeed the same person.

24
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,870
I was the one who named her Man.

25
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,930
-But so what?
-Why?

26
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,150
What do you mean by why?

27
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,420
I told you not to mention her because
I was very disappointed in her.

28
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,740
Your older sister committed
a grave mistake.

29
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,120
Everyone is saying that
my sister committed a mistake.

30
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,030
What mistake did she commit?

31
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,670
Madam, say something.

32
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,940
Why is everyone so
tight-lipped with this question?

33
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,350
I racked my brain to get into this
Forbidden City just to find out the truth.

34
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,579
Madam, please tell me the truth.

35
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,720
Man did a scandalous act
and was found out by others.

36
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,230
What scandalous act?

37
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,630
For a woman, what else
is more important than her chastity?

38
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,070
One night, she didn't return
the whole night.

39
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,600
When she returned the next morning,
she got caught by Chief Wu.

40
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,320
They even found her soiled inner skirt
near the Imperial Garden's fake mountain.

41
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,990
My sister had always led
a clean and honest life.

42
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,530
-She would not do such a thing.
-I also didn't believe it.

43
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,909
Man is a very gentle and kind lady.

44
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,600
She would not have an illicit affair.

45
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,940
But I had personally asked her.

46
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,670
No matter how I asked her,
she gave me only one answer.

47
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,290
She said that no one forced her
and that it was with her consent.

48
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,640
According to the palace rules,
she should be caned to death.

49
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,910
That time, Empress Dowager was ill.

50
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,190
Any bloodshed was forbidden in the palace.

51
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,790
Hence, she was caned 50 times
and was expelled.

52
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:23,190
I never thought that your sister would
commit suicide because of it.

53
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,360
Everyone said that my sister...

54
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,460
hung herself out of shame.

55
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,190
But I checked her wound. She has bruises
in the shape of fingers on her neck.

56
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,520
My sister was strangled to death.

57
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,460
What?

58
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,990
She was strangled to death?

59
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,080
Yes.

60
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,760
If the affair was with her consent,

61
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,880
why would she be silenced to death?

62
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,840
Hence, there must be
more than meets the eye.

63
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:01,830
Madam, I have to find out the truth.
I can't let her die in an unrighted wrong.

64
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,780
But so much time has passed.

65
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,300
How are you going to investigate it?

66
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,810
By the way, Madam.

67
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,360
Have you seen this jade pendant before?

68
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,580
You recognize this jade pendant, right?

69
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,800
No, I don't.

70
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,040
The alphabet on this jade pendant
is a Manchu alphabet.

71
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,300
You've been in this palace for so long.

72
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,300
I'm sure that you can read it.

73
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,900
If you won't tell me,
I'll ask others to translate it for me.

74
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,240
Stop right there.

75
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,060
Madam, please tell me.

76
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,990
Fuca Hala.

77
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,360
What?

78
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,410
His Majesty is the brother-in-law
of the master of this jade pendant,

79
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,790

of you sister's death.]

Are you stupid or are you blind?

Your Majesty!

111
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,130
I grew up in Southern Rivers
and I love willow trees a lot.

112
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,730
Hence, I just made up
those lyrics on a whim.

113
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,190
I don't mean anything by those lyrics.

Your Highness, the water is very cold.

142
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,480
Pour it.

143
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,440

149

Your Majesty, Consort Chun is sick again.

150
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,240
So, the Imperial Affairs Bureau
took down her tag.

151
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,750
I'll go and visit her then.

152
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,630
Ask the consorts and concubines

There's no rush.

163
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,540
Ouyang Xiu wrote a poem
called "Beauty Yu".

164
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,050
The beauty in the poem is full of love.

165
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,320
But she can't tell anyone.

166
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,920
So she would fiddle
with charcoal as pretence...

167
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,440
to air her woes of love to the ash.

168
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,400
I wonder what woes you have
for you to do the same.

169
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,840
There's nothing I can't speak of.

170
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,470
I was just idling in boredom.

171
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,920
So, I wrote some words.

172
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,290
Is that so?

173
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,470
What does this character signify?

174
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,440
Your wish if for this country
to be united...

175
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,660
and live in harmony while I wish for...

176
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,760
the empress to be safe and sound
and harmony within the harem.

177
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,920
However, it's not easy to create harmony.

178
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,100
For example,
Noble Consort Gao has provoked...

179
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,460
the empress many times and
treated her with disrespect.

180
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,960
Although Her Majesty is magnanimous
and gave her free pass,

181
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,880
as a noble consort, she is too rude.

182
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,260
Looks like this is not just a rumour then.

183
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,150
Yes.

184
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,030
I know it now.

185
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,460
Your Majesty, you are a wise king.

186
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,560
But you are so tolerant towards
Noble Consort Gao.

187
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,080
Is it because the Gao family
is powerful or perhaps,

188
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,270
it's not Gao family that
you are worried of...

189
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,930
but Ortai, their backer?

190
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,960
You are worried that
if you offend Gao family,

191
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,400
you'll lose their support...

192
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,280
and chaos will arise within the court.

193
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,310
Consort Chun, the harem is
banned from getting involved in politics.

194
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,860
Please keep this in mind.

195
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,839
If you commit the same offence again,
I will not let you off so easily.

196
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,000
Farewell, Your Majesty.

197
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,480
Mistress, how could you laugh?

198
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,720
I was scared to death just now.

199
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,580
How could you say that to him?

200
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,720
If I didn't say that,
would His Majesty leave so soon?

201
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,960
Your Majesty, you are leaving already?

202
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,950
She deliberately chased me out.
Why should I stay?

203
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,670
Your Majesty, why did you come here then?

204
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,690
I was curious.

205
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,720
She always finds various ways
to reject me.

206
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,970
I want to see if she has
any new excuses for me.

207
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,140
Let's go back to Yangxin Hall.

208
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,630
To Yangxin Hall.

209
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,900
No. Let's go to Changchun Palace.

210
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,840
To Changchun Palace.

211
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,100
Your Majesty, where did you come from?

212
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,380
I just came from Zhongcui Palace.

213
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,390
Your Majesty. Consort Chun...

214
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,730
is a little bit arrogant.
But all outstanding...

215
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:48,840
and talented women
have their own temperament.

216
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,600
Your Majesty, once in a while,
just let her be.

217
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,480
I just feel that Consort Chun...

218
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,560
always closes the door to her heart
and is so secretive.

219
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,300
She's always finding ways
to alienate herself from me.

220
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,880
Your Majesty, what secrets
would Consort Chun have?

221
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,760
She's just a little bit sensitive.

222
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,000
She's just a little bit sensitive.

223
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,490
You must be more considerate towards her.

224
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,050
Enough. Let's not talk about her.

225
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,560
Your Majesty.

226
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,720
Your Majesty.
After giving it some thoughts,

227
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,440
I need to tell you something.

228
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,920
When Emperor Kangxi was still alive,
a carpet in the palace...

229
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,670
could be used for thirty or forty years.

230
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,920
But the carpets in Chuxiu Palace
are replaced every year.

231
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,980
They even use ivory seats and
expensive red candles without reservation.

232
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,890
The harem has always been like this
since the previous dynasty.

233
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,060
It's too extravagant and
extremely wasteful.

234
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,380
They always make it into a competition
and if this continues,

235
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,610
it'll create an unhealthy atmosphere
within the harem.

236
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,590
What is your suggestion then?

237
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,800
As the empress, I need to lead by example.

238
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,070
First, I'll abandon
the pearl and jade ornaments...

239
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,400
and replace them with paper and velvet
flower ornaments instead. Second,

240
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,840
I've decided to reduce
the expenses of Changchun Palace...

241
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,760
to set an example
for the other six palaces.

242
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,510
You are right.

243
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,160
The harem shouldn't be so wasteful...

244
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,680
in order not to set a bad example
for the people in the palace.

245
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,110
But you can't rush this.
Implement it gradually.

246
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,460
Your Majesty, what about the method
that I can use to reduce the expenses?

247
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,420
I'll let you make the decision for it.

248
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,200
I'm tired already.
Let's have an early rest.

249
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

250
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,560
Your Highness, you have to try hard
to give birth to another prince.

251
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,050
What are you talking about?

252
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,660
His Majesty values you the most.

253
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,230
You were upset before this
because of Second Prince.

254
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,160
Now that the misunderstanding has been
resolved, you have to grab this chance.

255
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,710
Or else, Noble Consort Gao
will be even more arrogant.

256
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,200
[How can I get near to Fuca Fu Heng?]

257
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,080
This year, all the embroidery maids
in the Embroidery House are rushing...

258
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,840
to finish the casual clothing for
His Majesty and Empress Dowager.

259
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,370
And the birthday of the empress
happens to be on the next month.

260
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,150
Every palace and workshop
are preparing birthday gifts for her.

261
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,880
According to tradition,
the Embroidery House...

262
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,230
will make a phoenix robe for Her Majesty.

263
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,540
We'll use phoenix and peony
as our design this year.

264
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,180
As for the main embroiderer,

265
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,910
I'll hand it over to Ying Luo.

266
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,650
Madam, you always save the best
for Ying Luo. What about us?

267
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,020
How dare you ask me that.

268
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,680
Am I being too nice to you?

269
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,640
Look at your own work.

270
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,880
Can you really discern the difference
between a phoenix and a hen?

271
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,360
I'm not as good as her...

272
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,140
but I can still discern the difference
between a phoenix and a hen.

273
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,030
I'll put this out here today.

274
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,630
If any of you dare to stand out and claim
that you can embroider better than her,

275
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,090
I'll hand over this project to you then.

276
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,190
If there's none, just focus on
completing your own task.

277
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,630
Madam! Madam Zhang!

278
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,130
Madam, I have a question for you.

279
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,960
You may leave first.

280
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,160
Embroidery requires
days and months of experience.

281
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,290
I'm still young. No matter how good
I am, my skills are still limited.

282
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,550
There are many more embroidery maids
from the Embroidery House...

283
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,000
and masters from outside
who are way better than I am.

284
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,040
Why did you choose me?

285
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,160
According to tradition, birthday gifts
for the empress and imperial consorts...

286
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,360
must be handled by new palace maids.

287
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,040
If the mistresses are happy with the gift,
you'll be rewarded handsomely.

288
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,120
Even if you don't do it well,
you won't be criticised too harshly.

289
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,620
We are giving you hope, a chance to shine.

290
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,760
You really like to get
to the bottom of everything.

291
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,370
Your silly sister was
my most valued disciple.

292
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,580
I'll take better care of you in her stead.

293
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,530
Alright now. Stop frowning.

294
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,400
No matter when, you must always smile...

295
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,040
to lift up the spirits of our mistresses.

296
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,080
Ying Luo.
This is the peacock feather thread?

297
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,280
Madam Zhang said that
the peacock feather thread...

298
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,590
is made from peacock feather,
gold, and silver threads.

299
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,520
Even the best weaver can only create
one metre of this thread in a day.

300
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,360
Look. It looks like rainbow
under natural light.

301
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,200
It's so beautiful. I want to try it too.

302
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,240
Ying Luo, if you do this well,

303
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,420
you might even be able to embroider
the emperor's royal robe in the future.

304
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,010
Dummy.

305
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,680
To make His Majesty's robe, the draft
must first be drawn by Ruyi Workshop.

306
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,980
Once His Majesty approves it,

307
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,630
it will be sent to the weaving factories
in Suzhou, Jiangning, and Hangzhou.

308
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,200
Once the fabric is done, they will send it
back to us to be made into clothing.

309
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,740
It'll take 595 embroidery maids to finish
the emperor's royal robe in two years.

310
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,620
With your current standards,

311
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,600
you can't even embroider a court robe,
let alone the emperor's royal robe.

312
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,110
Alright now. Just get back to your task
to embroider those spring clothing.

313
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,120
Yes, Madam Zhang.

314
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,440
Ying Luo. This peacock feather thread...

315
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,630
is very precious. Use it carefully.
No mistake is allowed.

316
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,430
Or else, your life might be in danger.

317
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,570
Yes, Madam Zhang.

318
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,480
Everyone, let's go and eat first.

319
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,920
Time to eat.

320
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,440
Let's go.

321
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,330
[Ying Luo, push aside
your sister's case for now.]

322
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,370
[Just focus on this phoenix robe
in front of you.]

323
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,430
Ying Luo, are you using
the couched thread method?

324
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Yes. The peacock feather thread
is different from the normal thread.

325
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,890
It'll look better with couched thread
and chain-stitch method.

326
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,760
Even if you want to work,
you shouldn't starve yourself.

327
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,040
Let's go and eat first, alright?

328
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,920
No. I'll stay here.

329
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,980
This peacock feather thread is
very precious. No mistake is allowed.

330
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,300
So, you'll guard them here all the time?

331
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,240
It'll take at least more than a month
to finish this phoenix robe, right?

332
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,350
Do you want to kill yourself?

333
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,530
How about this? Let's do this in shifts.

334
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,040
No need. I can do it.

335
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,080
How can you do it?

336
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,720
You have to work in the morning
and then guard them here at night.

337
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,730
Do you really think that
you won't collapse?

338
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,920
If you don't want me to guard them
at night, let me guard them for a while.

339
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,040
Just a while.

340
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,880
Go and eat now. It'll take you
less than an hour to eat.

341
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,890
Go now. Everything will be fine.

342
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,030
You have to guard it well now.

343
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,090
Got it. It'll be fine.
Don't worry. Go now.

344
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,210
You must be careful.

345
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:26,820
Oh, no! Fire!

346
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,470
Help!

347
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,560
Why will there be fire?

348
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,240
-Be careful!
-Hurry up and remove it!

349
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,360
Hurry up.

350
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,500
Who did this?

351
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,750
How did it happen?

352
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,770
Who warmed her dress in the room
with charcoal? So unethical!

353
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,880
-She almost set the room on fire.
-Oh my goodness.

354
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,640
If our room got burned down,
where would we sleep tonight?

355
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,240
That's right.

356
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,580
-Whose dress is this?
-Isn't this mine?

357
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,850
Who placed it beside the charcoal?

358
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,220
Ji Xiang, you did this, right? Why did you
warm your dress inside the room?

359
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,620
That's right. You've frightened all of us.

360
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,580
I didn't do it.

361
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,200
Ji Xiang, why are you here?
Why aren't you at the Embroidery House?

362
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,920
I heard that the palace maid dormitory
is on fire.

363
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,600
So, I just ran here
without further thoughts.

364
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,160
-You stupid girl.
-What's going on?

365
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,050
-Ying Luo!
-What's wrong with her?

366
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,920
Something's off. Let's go and take a look.

367
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,920
Ying Luo. Why are you so anxious?

368
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,970
How did this happen?

369
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,120
What's wrong?

370
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,470
Oh my goodness,
the peacock feather thread is gone.

371
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,130
She deserves it.
She always gets the good things.

372
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,380
This time, she finally has her misfortune.

373
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,960
That's right. Let's see how
she'll submit her task now.

374
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,420
If Madam had handed this task to me,
I wouldn't let this happen.

375
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,500
This time, I think she will be expelled
from the palace.

376
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,130
Not only that,

377
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,580
she will be sentenced to death.

378
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,110
With all of you to accompany me in death,

379
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,290
I don't feel lonely at all.

380
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

381
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,010
You are the one who lost them.
Why should we die with you?

382
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,540
The phoenix robe is a gift from
the Embroidery House. We are one.

383
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,640
If the empress asks about it,
do you think she'll blame me alone?

384
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,200
If you have time to gloat,

385
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,160
you better worry about your own lives!

386
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,160
What should we do then?
I don't want to die yet.

387
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,200
We can't say that in the palace.

388
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,040
This is not the time to worry about taboo.

389
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,620
She is just lying to us.
I don't believe her.

390
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,280
But this phoenix robe is indeed
a birthday gift from the Embroidery House.

391
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,590
Now that it's destroyed,
we'll have no gift for her.

392
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,200
What should we do?

393
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,340
That's right. What should we do?

394
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,390
What happened?

395
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,880
Who did this?

396
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,840
Who did this?

397
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,950
Madam, this is my fault.

398
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,960
Madam Zhang, it's my fault.

399
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,240
It's me who lost
the peacock feather thread.

400
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,080
If someone has to be executed,
just kill me.

401
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,800
The peacock feather thread is gone too?

402
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,420
Get up!

403
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,010
What's the use of beheading you?
Can that erase the offence?

404
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,510
Madam Zhang,
I should be held responsible...

405
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,050
for this incident today.

406
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,760
But this has already happened.
Death is not a solution right now.

407
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,220
If we're unable to give this phoenix robe
to the empress, all of us will die!

408
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,840
If everyone stops their tasks for now...

409
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,580
and embroider it day and night,

410
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,160
we'll be able to make
another phoenix robe.

411
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,900
But what about the peacock feather thread?

412
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,840
We can ask for more from
the Imperial Household Department.

413
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,280
Imperial Household Department?

414
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,160
To tell them that we lost
the peacock feather thread?

415
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,970
You want all of us
to be beheaded together with you?

416
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,880
Let's sew the phoenix robe first.

417
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,440
As for the peacock feather thread,

418
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,200
I will come up with the solution.

419
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,040
What solution can you think of?

420
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,440
Let's sew the phoenix robe first.

421
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,610
It's better than just sitting still
while waiting for our death.

422
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,080
Ying Luo. I'm sorry.

423
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,240
This is my fault. I was too careless.

424
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,320
I didn't think that there will be
thieves in the palace.

425
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,500
If the empress wants to behead anyone

426
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,840
just put all the blame on me.

427
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,010
Ying Luo. I'm sorry.

428
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,480
I really didn't do it on purpose.
I'm sorry.

429
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,280
Stop crying.

430
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:25,780
If crying could help, the Forbidden City
would long be sunken by tears.

431
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,739
I already told you.

432
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,230
This isn't your fault.
I'm the one to be blamed.

433
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,159
It has already happened.
Rather than spending time to cry,

434
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,219
we better come out with a substitute
for the peacock feather thread.

435
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,340
Ying Luo, will this work?

436
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,280
This is gold thread.

437
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,670
Peacock feather thread
looks like rainbow under sunlight.

438
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,360
They can easily tell that this is
not the peacock feather thread.

439
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,740
We have both
gold thread and silver thread.

440
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,100
But where can we find
peacock feather thread?

441
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,270
And we are running out of time now.

442
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,600
Ji Xiang. What's that?

443
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,800
It's a fur that we use
to make winter robes.

444
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,450
And it is a low-quality fur.
So, it's useless.

445
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,270
-She still won't open the door?
-What is she doing inside?

446
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,310
That's right. What is she doing?

447
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,160
How can she finish the phoenix robe
without peacock feather thread?

448
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,980
She locked herself in there.
She won't give up, right?

449
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,160
I don't mind if she gives up.
But she can't drag us down with her.

450
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,430
If the empress is infuriated,
we will all suffer together with her.

451
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,750
Ji Xiang. Did Ying Luo tell you about...

452
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,650
her solution?

453
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,250
I asked her but she wouldn't tell me.

454
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,330
She wouldn't tell you?
Is it because she wants to give us hope?

455
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,920
Why am I so pitiful to be
in this Embroidery House?

456
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,400
This is the busiest workshop and
I can't even save my own life.

457
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Even if the empress casts the blame,

458
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,820
she won't have all of us beheaded, right?

459
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,900
We'll just get a severe reprimand at most.

460
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,180
But that peacock feather thread
is too precious.

461
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,920
And this is a birthday gift
for the empress.

462
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,040
The Imperial Household Department
won't let us off the hook so easily.

463
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,780
Then, Ying Luo be pushed out
to be the sacrificial lamb?

464
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,160
-Is that it?
-What is she talking about?

465
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,920
She's out.

466
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,670
She's out.

467
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,020
-What is she doing?
-Where is she going?

468
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,800
-What is she doing?
-I don't know.

469
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,930
She's too dumb.

470
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,960
Is she going to go to Changchun Palace
just like that?

471
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,760
I've prepared
a pair of wishing jades for you.

472
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,600
May you have a long and prosperous life.

473
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,590
Your Majesty,
this is the gift that I've prepared.

474
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,000
Consort Chun, what is this?

475
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,250
It's a piece of warm jade.

476
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,560
The so-called warm jade
is basically just a Hetian jade.

477
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,500
We have plenty of that in the palace.

478
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,370
What is so special about your warm jade,

479
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,360
Consort Chun?

480
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,280
When you wear this warm jade
during the cold winter,

481
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,560
it can give you a faint warmness.
It's perfect for your constitution.

482
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,280
Birthday gifts are best given in pairs.

483
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,440
But I've found only one of this despite
searching the whole nation for two.

484
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,730
-Please forgive me.
-You're so thoughtful, Consort Chun.

485
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,080
I like it very much.

486
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:30,580
Your Majesty, I had someone
made this bonsai out of gemstone.

487
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,720
Every flower has rubies on them
and they are cast in gold. Do you like it?

488
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,790
It's really beautiful.

489
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,540
Her Majesty is someone
of high ranking and status.

490
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,360
She won't be impressed
with such a common gift.

491
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,320
Your Majesty.

492
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,720
Noble Consort Gao.

493
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,640
You're late.

494
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,000
I was preparing your gift.
Please don't blame me for my tardiness.

495
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,670
What present have you prepared
for Her Highness?

496
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,720
Your Majesty.

497
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:42,630
I specially ordered someone to carve...

498
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,220
a Child-Gifting Bodhisattva for you.

499
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,640
Do you like it?

500
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,960
Her Majesty has yet to recover
from the pain of losing her son.

501
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,790
You are putting salt on
Her Majesty's open wound.

502
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,760
By the rules of our ancestors,

503
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,300
only the empress can use pure gold.

504
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,920
So I had the Imperial Workshop...

505
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:23,290
made this Bodhisattva for you
in pure gold...

506
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,120
in order to compliment your magnificence.

507
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,270
Look. This is pure gold.

508
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,300
Noble Consort Gao.

509
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,840
You should put this Bodhisattva
in Chuxiu Palace instead.

510
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,990
I am still young.

511
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,670
If I want to have a royal heir, I still
have a lot of opportunities to do that.

512
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,320
So, this Bodhisattva...

513
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,800
should be given to the one
who needs it the most.

514
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,620
Noble Consort Gao is so considerate.

515
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,490
I shall accept...

516
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,150
this generous gift then.

517
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,890
Gift offering by the Imperial Workshop.

518
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,380
Her Majesty is not in a good mood.
Be vigilant.

519
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,120
Alright.

520
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,960
The Imperial Workshop presents
a pair of rosewood peacock fans.

521
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,880
A rosewood throne with flowers carving.

522
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,210
A pair of cloisonné crane candelabra.

523
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,080
Jade Workshop presents
two boxes of four-piece jade.

524
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,280
Two lucky tsavorites.

525
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,190
Imperial Pottery Workshop presents
two emerald flower vases.

526
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,550
Two paired-fish crystal vases.

527
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,650
Glasswork House presents
a pair of dressing boxes carved in ivory.

528
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:16,560
A handheld cloisonné mirror.

529
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,060
Are you a palace maid from
the Embroidery House?

530
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,320
Why aren't you going in
to present your gift?

531
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,370
Sister. Can you allow me
to wait a little longer?

532
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,350
What are you waiting for?

533
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,800
She didn't even smile.
At first, I thought we'll be rewarded.

534
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,280
But now, we should be happy that
we are not punished.

535
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,840
Embroidery House, present your gift.

536
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,380
-Alright now, hurry up.
-Let me wait for a little longer.

537
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,980
It's already the last hour.

538
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:44,200
If you don't go in now,
her birthday will be over already.

539
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,480
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

540
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,070
May you live a long life of good fortune.

541
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,590
Isn't this girl...

542
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,570
You are already inside the hall.
Remove the silk cloth now.

543
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,000
Yes.
