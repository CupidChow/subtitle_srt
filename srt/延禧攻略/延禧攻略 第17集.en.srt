[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Your Highness, please forgive me.
I was incompetent.

4
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,110
I didn't expect this rumour
to ruin Empress.

5
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,910
I simply wanted to vent my anger.

6
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,540
It's too bad that His Majesty
didn't find out anything.

7
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,440
But you've brought
something to my attention.

8
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,350
Consort Chun serves
Empress loyally all the time.

9
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,250
What is she after?

10
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,070
I don't know.

11
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,750
I'll figure out this secret
sooner or later.

12
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,010
Miss Ying Luo.

13
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,200
Why do you want to know who's on duty
on the 10th day of the first month?

14
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,270
I have use for it.

15
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,480
Hailan Cha.

16
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,240
I have something to tell Ying Luo.

17
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,120
Okay.

18
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,360
I'll go out first.

19
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,690
Look no further.

20
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,470
On the 10th day of the first month,

21
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,200
His Majesty and imperial guards
weren't the only men in the palace.

22
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,580
What does that mean?

23
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,060
On the 10th day of the first month,

24
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,400
His Majesty had a banquet with
his imperial relatives at Qianqing Palace.

25
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,540
Feudal princes, Prince of the Third Rank,
Prince of the Fourth Rank,

26
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,210
and imperial relatives of
the fourth rank and above.

27
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,500
They all attended it.

28
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,800
Imperial relatives?

29
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,290
Ying Luo.

30
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,320
If Man was killed...

31
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,320
as you claimed,

32
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,520
the person who killed her...

33
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,050
wouldn't want people to find out for sure.

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,920
If you keep on investigating it,

35
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,270
one thing is that the scope is too big.

36
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,480
It's hard to filter everything.

37
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,320
Second,

38
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,590
If you're found out,

39
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,460
you'll be in danger.

40
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,110
I understand.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,530
Thank you for reminding me.

42
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,390
Ying Luo.

43
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,940
Can't you just give up?

44
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,110
Young Master.

45
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,490
If something happened to Her Majesty,

46
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,900
what would you do?

47
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,180
You and Her Majesty are very close.

48
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,720
So were my sister and I.

49
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,829
I must find out the truth.

50
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,079
I'll risk my life for it.

51
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,340
I'll give up...

52
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,560
only if I die.

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,410
What do you want to do?

54
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,920
Since the banquet was held
in Qianqing Palace,

55
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,640
if anyone...

56
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,540
left that night,

57
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,140
surely he'd have left behind some clues.

58
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,720
The eunuchs on duty that night...

59
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,010
and the aides whom His Majesty trusts.

60
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,930
Anyone of them might remember something.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,130
As long as I investigate it patiently,

62
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,830
I'll find out the killer.

63
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,130
As for the eunuchs in Qianqing Palace,

64
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,860
I'll investigate them for you.

65
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,500
Young Master.

66
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,560
Promise me...

67
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,470
you won't act recklessly.

68
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,540
If you don't promise me,

69
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,360
I'll tell Her Majesty about this now...

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,620
and ask her to drive you
out of the palace.

71
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,330
Okay.

72
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,440
I promise...

73
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,900
I won't act recklessly.

74
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,120
What do you think His Majesty is up to?

75
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,070
At this time,

76
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,840
His Majesty is most likely
reading memorials...

77
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,650
at the study in Yangxin Palace.

78
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,750
I heard that Noble Consort Gao...

79
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,550
gifted His Majesty...

80
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,680
Timely Clearing After Snowfall.

81
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,540
His Majesty was so happy...

82
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,830
and kept it in his collection.

83
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,280
He even renamed his study
to Hall of Three Rare Treasures.

84
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,280
The name pertains to
his rare collectibles.

85
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,890
I too want to check it out.

86
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,590
Your Majesty.

87
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,890
Ming Yu.

88
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,860
Play me...

89
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,760
a song.

90
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,240
Yes.

91
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Ying Luo...

92
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,200
Look at Her Majesty.

93
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,330
This song is too sorrowful.

94
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,550
It's making me cry.

95
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,930
Yes.

96
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,500
It's making Her Majesty sadder.

97
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,640
Hurry and think of a way.

98
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,220
Your Majesty.

99
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,540
Look over there.

100
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,520
Wei Ying Luo, you bad girl!

101
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,740
-Ming Yu, you're so pitiful!
-I'll teach you a lesson!

102
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,160
- Your Majesty, she's bullying me!
-Wei Ying Luo, stop running!

103
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,600
Watch out your step.

104
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,400
-I dare you to hit me.
- Stop right there!

105
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,840
-Watch your step.
-I dare you to hit me.

106
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,900
Who allowed you to fool around
in the Changchun Palace?

107
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,820
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

108
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,830
Greetings, Your Majesty.

109
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,720
Empress.

110
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,590
She's such an unruly maid.

111
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,600
Yet, you treat her like a treasure.

112
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,280
Your Majesty, please calm down.

113
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,900
They fooled around simply because...

114
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,550
they wanted to cheer me up.

115
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,710
Ying Luo. Ming Yu. You may leave first.

116
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,110
-Yes.
-Yes.

117
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,980
Your Majesty, why are you here?

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,640
I was walking around and ended up here.

119
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,600
I came to visit you.

120
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,800
Your Majesty, you've had a long day.
Are you tired?

121
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,560
I'll instruct them to prepare
some snacks for you.

122
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,600
Empress, let's eat together.

123
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,330
Your Majesty.

124
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,070
An imperial consort mustn't
eat together with the emperor.

125
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,300
It's a rule set by the ancestors.

126
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,390
You're still the same.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,060
You strictly abide by the etiquette
and never break it.

128
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,790
Er Qing.

129
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,840
Close all the windows.

130
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,330
The wind is strong at night.

131
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,060
His Majesty might catch a cold.

132
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,560
Yes.

133
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,320
I feel stuffy.

134
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,990
It's better to keep the windows open.

135
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,520
Your Majesty.

136
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,310
You're having heart fire.

137
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,780
If you expose yourself to wind,
you'll easily get sick.

138
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,320
Go.

139
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,280
Your Majesty, I can't see it.

140
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,830
Sometimes...

141
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,180
I don't feel like attending
imperial court meetings.

142
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,720
I want to have a lazy day.

143
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,520
Your Majesty.

144
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,390
If you want to be a wise ruler,

145
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,990
you can't slack off at all.

146
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,830
If not,

147
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,440
it would be my fault.

148
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,340
What does me not attending
imperial court meetings...

149
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,990
have to do with you?

150
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,600
I'm responsible for advising you.

151
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,100
If you're lazy to govern,

152
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,890
of course...

153
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,740
it would be my fault.

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I've told you for many times.

155
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,230
You can't stop thinking that way.

156
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,980
Aren't you tired?

157
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,680
Let me do it.

158
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,010
A scholar studies.
A farmer works in the field.

159
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,850
A labourer toils.
A businessman runs a business.

160
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,600
Everyone has their own duty.

161
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,510
I...

162
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,300
must do my best...

163
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,200
in fulfilling my duty
as an imperial consort.

164
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,060
There's nothing tiring about it.

165
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,870
I know.

166
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,290
You're...

167
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,790
open-minded, magnanimous,

168
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,890
and compassionate.

169
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
I...

170
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,820
find no fault in you.

171
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,870
I...

172
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,080
feel proud...

173
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,280
to have a good empress like you.

174
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,700
Your Majesty.

175
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,210
I feel unworthy...

176
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,200
of your compliments.

177
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,990
For the past three years,

178
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,380
I've had many shortcomings.

179
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,220
I believe...

180
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,640
you will do very well.

181
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,560
I'm going to the imperial court!

182
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,020
Take care, Your Majesty.

183
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,970
By the way,

184
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,610
Noble Lady Yu is going to give birth soon.

185
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,890
Please take good care of her.

186
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,440
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

187
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,680
I'll definitely do my best.

188
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,470
Ming Yue.

189
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,290
What are you doing?

190
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,960
This is Her Majesty's favourite flower.

191
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,680
How can you destroy it?

192
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,830
I did everything for her...

193
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,560
but she's not grateful at all!

194
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,920
Keep cool.

195
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,320
Giving birth is a gamble with death.

196
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,060
Others avoided it at all cost.

197
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,850
Her Majesty insisted on letting
Noble Lady Yu stay in Changchun Palace.

198
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,320
Wasn't she looking for trouble?

199
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,500
Enough.

200
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,740
Noble Lady Yu has a blessed life.

201
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,020
She'll be fine.

202
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,330
Fine. Even if the labour goes smooth,

203
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,520
what does it has to do with our mistress?

204
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,050
She insisted on helping.

205
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,310
If something happens, they'll...

206
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,960
blame us servants first!

207
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,600
Stop talking nonsense.

208
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,100
Noble Lady Yu.

209
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,760
Ying Luo, get over here.

210
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,480
I made these clothes
for the little prince.

211
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,830
We don't know if
it's a prince or princess.

212
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,630
Whether it's a prince or princess,

213
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,910
they can be put to use.

214
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,940
Ying Luo.

215
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,230
Thank you.

216
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,870
Oh yeah.

217
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,650
Try this.

218
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,720
Noble Lady Yu, what is this?

219
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,970
Miss Ying Luo.

220
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,390
Our mistress has been craving sweet food
ever since she got pregnant.

221
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,080
She's been eating hot scones every day.

222
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,310
She can eat three in a day.

223
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,930
It's so scary.

224
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,470
Noble Lady Yu.

225
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,220
Look at me.

226
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,720
Do I look fatter?

227
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,150
No.

228
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,340
But it's easy to gain weight
from eating sweet food.

229
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,880
And hot food burns one's throat.

230
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:36,960
Noble Lady Yu.

231
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,500
You must take notice of it.

232
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,830
Ying Luo, these are Mongolian scones.

233
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,720
It's a snack from my hometown.

234
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,200
I thought I'd never get to eat this again
when I entered the palace.

235
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,260
I never thought a chef from
the Imperial Kitchen could do this.

236
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,670
It's so aromatic and crispy.

237
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,860
Try it.

238
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,630
Ying Luo.

239
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,850
What's wrong?

240
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,160
It's nothing.

241
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,870
Your Majesty.

242
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,720
I think you shouldn't have let
Noble Lady Yu stay in Changchun Palace.

243
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,290
Why do you say so?

244
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,850
Ming Yu was right.

245
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,480
Noble Lady is giving birth soon.
There are lots to worry about.

246
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,310
We need to take care of her diet.

247
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,220
If we fail to take good care of her,

248
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,180
you'll be blamed for it.

249
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,780
Ying Luo.

250
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,770
You helped Noble Lady Yu for many times.

251
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,640
Why are you saying so?

252
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,010
For me,

253
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,260
being fearless...

254
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,680
doesn't mean one should look for trouble.

255
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,220
Are you saying that...

256
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,890
I'm looking for trouble
by having Noble Lady Yu here?

257
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,810
I'm ignorant.

258
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,619
Please forgive me.

259
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,900
[Manage]

260
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,920
Do you know this word?

261
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,740
No.

262
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,780
There's a word mouth on its lower left.

263
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,160
On its upper right is a word hand.

264
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,490
This is the origin of the word
Empress in seal script.

265
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,050
Forbidden City is such a big place...

266
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,210
where countless of imperial consorts
and palace maids reside.

267
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,410
I'm the head of imperial consorts...

268
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,480
who presides over the six palaces.

269
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,020
I'm responsible for protecting
every woman in the palace.

270
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,760
But they're here to compete with
Your Majesty for His Majesty's favour.

271
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,760
They left their parents and families...

272
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,720
and will be kept in the harem for life.

273
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,390
They're pitiful enough.

274
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,350
If I got jealous...

275
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,600
and fight against the dissidents,

276
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,550
they'd follow in my footsteps.

277
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,700
Everything would get out of hand.

278
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,940
Even though I'm not so powerful,

279
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,590
I believe...

280
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,190
I can bring them some warmth.

281
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,430
When they're upset,

282
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
they can come to me.

283
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,960
Ying Luo.

284
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,800
You must remember this.

285
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,870
I'm an empress first...

286
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,550
before a woman.

287
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,040
Ying Luo, it's tough to survive.

288
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,790
You must do your best...

289
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,420
to help whoever you can.

290
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,990
Understand?

291
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,160
Ying Luo.

292
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,070
What's wrong?

293
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,330
Ying Luo.

294
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,190
Your Majesty.

295
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,470
I had a sister.

296
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,100
The way you said those things...

297
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,900
was exactly the same
like how my sister said them.

298
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,020
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

299
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,600
I feel that...

300
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,560
you...

301
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,460
and my sister are alike.

302
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,420
You're all kind-hearted.

303
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,690
God will definitely bless you.

304
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,920
Ying Luo.

305
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
I told you this today...

306
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,520
because I wanted to ask you for a favour.

307
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,130
Your Majesty.

308
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,190
What can I do for you?

309
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,080
I need to accompany Empress Dowager
to Changchun Garden for prayer.

310
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,640
Er Qing will go with me.

311
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,910
Hence,

312
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,420
I would like to...

313
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,000
leave Changchun Palace in your care.

314
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,070
Your Majesty.

315
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,300
I can't handle such
a heavy responsibility.

316
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,670
Ming Yu has been with me for years.

317
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,110
We're very close...

318
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,530
but she's not patient.

319
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,590
I want you...

320
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,310
to help me guard the Changchun Palace.

321
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,020
I will do my very best.

322
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,530
Don't be so nervous.

323
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,620
Noble Lady Yu's labour is two weeks away.

324
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,430
I'll get back by then.

325
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,410
From today onwards,

326
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,840
everyone in the Changchun Palace
will listen to me.

327
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,720
Sister Ming Yu.

328
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,880
Before Her Majesty left, she said...

329
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,390
we'll listen to Ying Luo.

330
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,080
Sister Ming Yu has served
Her Majesty for years.

331
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,040
Of course we need to listen to her.
How dare you disobey her!

332
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,840
It doesn't matter who said what.

333
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,110
What's more important is that...

334
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,690
when Her Majesty isn't around,

335
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,240
we must guard the Changchun Palace well.

336
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,470
You didn't need to say that.

337
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,680
I'll do so.

338
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,030
How can Ming Yu do this?

339
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,920
That's an order from Her Majesty.

340
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,250
Ying Luo, why didn't you speak against it?

341
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,160
Ming Yu has worked in
Changchun Palace longer than me.

342
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,000
Everyone will listen to her.

343
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,800
It doesn't matter what I say.

344
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,240
Since no one wants to listen,
why should I waste my breath?

345
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,000
Actually, as long as nothing happens
to Noble Lady Yu,

346
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,790
it doesn't matter who takes charge of it.

347
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,250
The Imperial Household Department
has hired a wet nurse and midwife.

348
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,430
Has everything been arranged?

349
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,240
Noble Lady Yu's labour
is few more days away.

350
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,920
What's the rush?

351
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,440
It's just that Her Majesty
left all of sudden.

352
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,420
We must be careful about everything.

353
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,400
Don't think you can slack off
just because Her Majesty isn't around.

354
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,800
Fei Cui. Zhen Zhu.
Go water the flowers.

355
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,860
Hu Po, replace the flowers in the room.

356
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,740
Manao, stop zoning out.

357
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,030
Go scrub the floor.

358
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,890
As for the three of you,

359
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,640
get the bedding aired.

360
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,190
Get it?

361
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,900
Yes.

362
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,920
Her Highness is going to give birth!
Go get the midwife now!

363
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,360
Hurry!

364
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,720
Hu Po, go get the midwife now!

365
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,750
-Yes.
-Zhen Zhu...

366
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,110
-I'm here.
-Get the things needed ready.

367
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,330
What are they?

368
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,500
Scissors and hot water.
As for others, ask the midwife.

369
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,920
Fei Cui, tell the wet nurse to stand by.

370
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,790
Yes.

371
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,180
-You two, go get the basin.
-Yes.

372
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,200
You, go get some cloth.

373
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,380
We don't need you in there.

374
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,310
Go make a pot of ginseng soup now.

375
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,190
Ming Yu.

376
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,470
Are you sure there won't be any problem?

377
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,040
I've served Her Majesty for many years.

378
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,890
I witnessed the birth of Second Prince.

379
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,620
You think I'm not better than you?

380
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,950
Go make the soup at once!

381
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:47,030
♫ Flourishing flowers ♫

382
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,940
♫ So lush and beautiful ♫

383
00:23:53,040 --> 00:24:01,430
♫ Like a beautiful face ♫

384
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:09,270
♫ The clouds look like ♫

385
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,880
♫ Bright-colored clothes ♫

386
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,130
Your Highness.

387
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,100
Here's a news from Changchun Palace.

388
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,830
Noble Lady Yu is having contractions
and will be giving birth soon.

389
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,970
Isn't it supposed to be two weeks away?

390
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,250
Things like this can't be
predicted accurately.

391
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,990
Stop singing.

392
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,910
Empress isn't around. My position
in the six palaces is after hers.

393
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,910
Of course I must show some concern.

394
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,130
Yes.

395
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,470
Your waist is so big.
When it comes to the part,

396
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,710
"Delicate and afraid, it's hard to
straighten the waist of willow tree",

397
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,620
how can you sing it?

398
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,790
Noble Lady Yu!

399
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,430
Push harder! Go get some water now!

400
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,150
How is it going?

401
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,260
Hurry and push harder!

402
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,480
It will be out soon! Push harder!

403
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,160
It will be out soon. Where's the water?

404
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,800
-Water!
-Water!

405
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,920
-Where's the water?
-Where's the water?

406
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,550
Hold this well and get more water!

407
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,040
I'll send this in myself.

408
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,680
Go to the backyard and
wash the dirty clothes.

409
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,720
Don't be an eyesore here!

410
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,680
Push harder, Noble Lady Yu!

411
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,410
Where's the water?
How come it's not here yet?

412
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,040
Noble Lady Yu, push harder!
It'll be over soon.

413
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Push harder!

414
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,270
I can see the head now.

415
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,790
Hurry and get more cloths!

416
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,570
Hurry! Go now!

417
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,430
Noble Lady Yu, it'll be over soon.
Hang in there.

418
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,350
Push harder!

419
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,560
Push!

420
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,200
Nobel Lady Yu!

421
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,120
Your Highness.

422
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,560
Madam.

423
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,750
Is it a prince or a princess?

424
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,910
It's a little prince.

425
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,580
It's a prince.

426
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,070
This child...

427
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,170
Hurry.

428
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,640
Let me take a look.

429
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,500
Noble Lady Yu, this...

430
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,550
What's wrong?

431
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,350
Sister Ming Yu, Noble Consort Gao
is on the way here.

432
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,040
Take good care of Noble Lady Yu.

433
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,700
Noble Consort Gao is coming.
Don't let them see the little prince.

434
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,180
Greetings, Your Highness.

435
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,480
I heard that Noble Lady Yu
is about to give birth.

436
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,990
It just so happens that
Her Majesty isn't around.

437
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,210
As the noble consort,

438
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,380
I must show concern on her behalf.

439
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,200
Your Highness,
please wait in the great hall.

440
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,960
I'll serve you tea now.

441
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,240
No need.

442
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,510
I'll go check it out myself.

443
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,240
Your Highness, the birthing room is dirty.

444
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,640
Don't go in!

445
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,600
Your Highness...

446
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,810
Don't go in!

447
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,120
Your Highness!

448
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,590
Your Highness, don't go in!

449
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,270
Your Highness...

450
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,070
Your Highness!

451
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,880
Your Highness, you can't go in!

452
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,320
Your Highness!

453
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,630
Your Highness!

454
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,970
Noble Lady Yu, the child...

455
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,300
Greetings, Your Highness.

456
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,790
Your Highness.

457
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,420
Let me take a look at it.

458
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,800
Your Highness.

459
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,850
Noble Lady Yu.

460
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,200
You gave birth to a child
with golden pupils?

461
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,040
Your Highness, what did you say?

462
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,620
What golden pupils?

463
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,150
Noble Lady Yu.

464
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,940
The little prince has golden eyes.

465
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,670
His whole body is all yellow.

466
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,120
I've delivered many children.

467
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,240
I've never met such a child.

468
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,530
Nonsense.

469
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,340
Give me the child!

470
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,480
-Give him to me!
-Noble Lady Yu.

471
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,680
Based on the palace rules,

472
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,000
a child with golden pupils
needs to be killed.

473
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,410
-Noble Lady.
-Give him to me!

474
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,220
-Noble Lady, this won't do.
-Give him to me...

475
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,750
Noble Lady Yu gave birth to
a child with golden pupils.

476
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,280
That makes her a sinner of Great Qing.

477
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,240
If anyone of you dares help her,
you'll be dealt with the same punishment.

478
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,430
Noble Lady Yu.

479
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,120
Your Highness.

480
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,680
Really?

481
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,000
Yes.

482
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,440
Noble Lady Yu gave birth to
a child with golden pupils.

483
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,840
It seems that we won't be able
to finish this game.

484
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,420
Golden pupils?

485
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,390
Let's go check it out.

486
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,190
Yu Hu.

487
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,360
Did you said Noble Consort Gao
is already there?

488
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,010
Surely Noble Consort Gao will
deal with it according to the palace laws.

489
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,040
Your Highness, let's go save her now.

490
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,020
Wait.

491
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,250
How come...

492
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,880
Noble Lady Yu suddenly gave birth
to a child with golden pupils?

493
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,320
Sister, what do you mean?

494
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Noble Consort Gao has always been a bully.

495
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,790
Why don't we give her a big present?

496
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,730
What do you plan to do?

497
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,620
I have to attend to something.

498
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,480
You may have to go to
Yangxin Palace first.

499
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,360
-Are we really not intervening in it?
-How can we do so?

500
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,620
If you're capable, go in there yourself.

501
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,130
You can't go in!

502
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,400
Didn't you hear what's going on in there?

503
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,040
Noble Lady Yu gave birth to
a child with golden pupils.

504
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,450
Noble Consort Gao is handling it
according to the palace rules.

505
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,760
No one can stop her.

506
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,490
If you want to look for trouble,
don't drag us into it.

507
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,610
Have you lost your mind?

508
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,270
Ying Luo, keep cool.

509
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,120
She doesn't know how to talk like a human.

510
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,920
What's there to reason with her?

511
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,120
I'm telling you.

512
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,470
It's been two days...

513
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,120
since Her Majesty left the palace.

514
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,840
I didn't make a fuss about
your tyrannical acts...

515
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,320
because I wanted Noble Lady Yu
to be at ease during her pregnancy!

516
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,910
It's not because I'm afraid of you.

517
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,610
The lives of Noble Lady Yu
and Fifth Prince are in danger,

518
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,060
Since you don't want to
do anything about it,

519
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,150
just stay aside!

520
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,590
Wei Ying Luo, you can't meddle in it!

521
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,800
It's against the ancestral rules to do so!

522
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,680
You'll drag Her Majesty into it!

523
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,940
Her Majesty has instructed us...

524
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,580
to protect Noble Lady Yu.

525
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,710
I only acknowledge that rule!

526
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,090
Everyone knows how to talk big!

527
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,690
Are you really that capable?

528
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,000
Ying Luo, where are you going?

529
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,180
Let's see how you're
going to meddle in it!

530
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,080
Ying Luo...

531
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,150
Do you have a way?

532
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,130
Let go of me!

533
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,730
Let go of me!

534
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,730
Noble Consort Gao!

535
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,140
I'm begging you! Please spare my child!

536
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,150
Let go of me!

537
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,100
Your Highness.

538
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,040
For the sake of Her Majesty,
please have mercy on Noble Lady Yu.

539
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,260
Let go of me!

540
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,630
Do it.

541
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,110
No! Let go of me!

542
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,700
No!

543
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,660
No!

544
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,860
No!

545
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,310
Wake her up with water.

546
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,800
I want her to witness...

547
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,850
the consequences...

548
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,200
of going against me.

549
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,680
Carry on with the burial.

550
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,590
Let go of me!

551
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,220
Let go!

552
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,860
Your Highness, I'm begging you...

553
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Noble Consort Gao, I'm begging you!

554
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,710
I'm begging you! Please spare my child!

555
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,120
Weren't you very pleased with yourself
during the lychee banquet?

556
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,480
I was wrong.

557
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,740
-How come you're begging me?
-I was wrong.

558
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,480
Your Highness,
you can punish me as you please.

559
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,260
My child is innocent!

560
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,090
Your Highness, I'm begging you.
Please spare...

561
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,170
Let him go!

562
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,030
Sister Ming Yu, you can't just do nothing.

563
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,990
No.

564
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,290
I can't interfere.

565
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,600
Sister Ming Yu!

566
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,670
The palace consort that gives birth to
a child with golden pupils...

567
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,990
must be put to death too.

568
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,790
I'll grant you a gift then.

569
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,590
I'll let you and your son die together.

570
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,270
Stop!

571
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,260
Move out of the way!

572
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,980
Noble Lady Yu.

573
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,989
Don't touch me...

574
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Just when I was thinking about you,
you came to me.

575
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,370
What?

576
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,400
You're afraid that the two of them...

577
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,159
will be too lonely?

578
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,270
You want to join them?

579
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,000
This is Changchun Palace.

580
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,000
You're not allowed to
make a huge fuss here!

581
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,280
Noble Lady Yu gave birth to
a child with golden pupils.

582
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,850
That will do the fortune of
Great Qing harm.

583
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,800
Of course it must be
immediately dealt with.

584
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,920
Our mistress is handling it
according to the rules...

585
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,320
and enforcing justice on behalf of Heaven.

586
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,219
Whether it's really
a child with golden pupils,

587
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
you have no say in it, Your Highness.

588
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We must wait for Her Majesty
to come back and handle it.

589
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,500
A child who was born with golden pupils.

590
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,260
Who has ever seen such a child?

591
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,550
Even if Her Majesty were here,
she wouldn't be able to protect them.

592
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,830
And a lowly palace maid like you...

593
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,500
keep defending them at all cost.

594
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,840
What is your motive?

595
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,570
Eunuchs.

596
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,470
Tie her up.

597
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,250
Why don't you do something?

598
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,510
Get lost!

599
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,360
Go away!

600
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,110
Why don't you do something?

601
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,800
Have you all forgotten
Her Majesty's instruction?

602
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,800
If something happens to Noble Lady Yu
and Fifth Prince today,

603
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,560
we'll all die!

604
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,960
Get over here now!

605
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Get over here!

606
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,500
What are you doing?

607
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,320
Each one of you is going against me.

608
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,700
Are you planning a rebellion?

609
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,360
Although we are servants,

610
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,960
we represent the reputation
of Changchun Palace.

611
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,990
Today,

612
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,840
if you take a step back,

613
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,640
not only will you ruin
Her Majesty's prestige,

614
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,280
the whole Forbidden City...

615
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,760
will ridicule Changchun Palace
and call us weaklings who can be bullied!

616
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,730
No one will show you any respect!

617
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,010
Her Majesty is the head
of the six palaces.

618
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,500
She must implement the palace rules.

619
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,320
If she doesn't do so,

620
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,840
that's going against the ancestors.

621
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,560
You lowly slaves.

622
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,770
If you buy into what this maid said,

623
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,360
do you know what will happen in the end?

624
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,020
Every single one of you...

625
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,980
will join her and get beheaded.

626
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,970
Don't listen to Ying Luo!

627
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,470
Her Majesty did instruct us
to protect Noble Lady Yu.

628
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,310
But she didn't ask us
to protect the child.

629
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,400
-That's right.
-When she returns,

630
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,080
she might even regret it.

631
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,900
Sister Ming Yu is right.

632
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,720
What if Her Majesty returns
and punishes us instead?

633
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,000
Back off now!

634
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,310
Her Majesty's golden seal is here!
Who dares back off?

635
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,800
Anyone who sees this golden seal
is like seeing Her Majesty in person.

636
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,830
Whether...

637
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,140
Fifth Prince is sick,

638
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,150
and how Noble Lady Yu
should be dealt with,

639
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,570
we must all wait for Her Majesty's decree.

640
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,080
No one...

641
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,860
is allowed to take any arbitrary action!

642
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,400
His Majesty has arrived!

643
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,810
Greetings, Your Majesty.

644
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,220
-Your Majesty.
-What has happened?

645
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,310
Your Majesty!

646
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,050
Your Majesty!

647
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,830
Fifth Prince...

648
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,790
Your Majesty.

649
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,760
The little prince was born
with golden pupils.

650
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,410
His body is all yellow.

651
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,050
Her Majesty isn't around.

652
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,840
I'm enforcing the palace rules
on her behalf.

653
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,880
I was about to punish
both the mother and child.

654
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,800
But I didn't expect that the servants of
Changchun Palace would stop me.

655
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,770
Your Majesty.

656
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:21,950
I dare not stop Noble Consort Gao
from implementing the rules.

657
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,830
It's just that Her Majesty
kept reminding us...

658
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,240
to protect Noble Lady Yu.

659
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,480
Until Her Majesty returns,

660
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,360
no one is allowed to do anything
without her permission.

661
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,440
Moreover, whether
the little prince is indeed sick,

662
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,320
how can we make conclusion
based on what we see?

663
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,520
We should at least have it checked
by an imperial physician, right?

664
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,030
That's too hasty...

665
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,290
of Her Highness.

666
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,680
Your Majesty, nothing is impossible
in this vast world.

667
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,120
Maybe Prince was born with golden pupils
because of some strange illness.

668
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,320
Your Majesty.

669
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,150
Surely Prince has had
some strange illness.

670
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,920
I'm begging you, Your Majesty!

671
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,640
I'm begging you, Your Majesty!
Please treat the prince at once!

672
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,400
Your Majesty!

673
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,830
-Li Yu.
-I'm here.

674
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,200
Call the Imperial Academy of Medicine
for a consult.

675
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,310
Yes.

676
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,140
Thank you, Your Majesty...

677
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,660
Noble Lady, it's all over.

678
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,250
Greetings, Your Majesty.

679
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,050
Is the prince sick?

680
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,940
I've come across
many cases of newborn jaundice.

681
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,500
But I've never seen one...

682
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,080
whose pupils are golden.

683
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,500
-No, Noble Lady Yu!
-So...

684
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,840
Physician Zhang,
is there no way to cure him?

685
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,800
It's not an illness,
so there's no way to cure it.

686
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,270
There's no such thing as
a child with golden pupils.

687
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,320
-Nonsense! Your Majesty!
-Noble Lady Yu...

688
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,390
Prince isn't sick! Your Majesty!

689
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,600
I'm begging you!
Please save the little prince!

690
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,200
Get Noble Lady Yu out of here.

691
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,330
Your Majesty...

692
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,900
Your Majesty, please save
the little prince!

693
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,640
Your Majesty!

694
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,970
Let's go, Noble Lady Yu.

695
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,970
Your Majesty.

696
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,160
Give me back my child...

697
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,480
Your Majesty!

698
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,780
Your Majesty!

699
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,750
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty.

700
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,480
You heard it.

701
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,210
-Your Majesty.
-I know you're very reluctant to do it.

702
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,520
But if we don't solve it today,

703
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,590
when the sun rises tomorrow,

704
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,990
the news of a noble lady
in Forbidden City...

705
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,920
giving birth to
a child with golden pupils...

706
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,430
will spread across the empire
as if it had wings.

707
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,680
I'm afraid the people will get panic and
it'll be hard to handle the consequences.

708
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,210
Thus, I hardened my heart...

709
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,000
for the sake of Your Majesty
and Great Qing.

710
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,380
I don't mind if people blame me for it.

711
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,770
Your Majesty, why are you waiting for?

712
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:12,500
Your Majesty!

713
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,410
Look.

714
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,160
Although the little prince's body...

715
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,820
is all yellow, he has a strong cry.

716
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,760
Your Majesty.

717
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,820
He's a human.

718
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,630
He's your son, Your Majesty.

719
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,760
How can you kill him?

720
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,880
Isn't Empress too kind-hearted?

721
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,410
How could she spoil this palace maid?

722
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,930
When your masters are talking,
you're not allowed to cut in!

723
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,640
Hand over the child.

724
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,450
Your Majesty.

725
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,000
The imperial physicians...

726
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,440
have been on duty in the palace
throughout the year.

727
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,200
Although they're very skilled,
they haven't come across many cases.

728
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,810
Maybe it's a misdiagnosis.

729
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,740
Nonsense!

730
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,000
Could an imperial physician of
Imperial Academy of Medicine like me...

731
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,730
be less knowledgeable and experienced
than a palace maid like you?

732
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,870
Your Majesty.

733
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,740
Although I'm skilled in paediatrics,

734
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,560
there's nothing impossible
in this vast world.

735
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,120
Perhaps there're many strange illnesses
that I have yet to come across.

736
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,920
One can't deny its existence
just because he hasn't encountered it.

737
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,480
Physician Zhang, are you old and confused?

738
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,530
How dare you report to His Majesty
something you're not sure about!

739
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,640
If something happens,
be it a natural or man-made disaster,

740
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,700
will you take responsibility for it?

741
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,410
Your Majesty.

742
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,000
It concerns the fortune of Great Qing.

743
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,700
You mustn't be lenient.

744
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,860
Your Majesty.

745
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,600
Noble Lady Yu has suffered a lot
in giving birth to Fifth Prince.

746
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,120
The little prince has just
opened his eyes!

747
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,160
There are thousands of
imperial consorts in the harem.

748
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,840
You don't need to worry about
not having any descendants.

749
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,120
If there's a problem, it'll lead to
unending trouble in the future.

750
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,370
Your Majesty, stop hesitating.

751
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,320
Besides imperial physicians,
there're common physicians!

752
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,340
They tend to travel all over the world.
Maybe they've seen such a strange illness.

753
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,210
Fifth Prince will be cured!

754
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,520
Are you asking His Majesty...

755
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,710
to paste bulletins across
the empire announcing...

756
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,740
that the little prince was born
with golden pupils?

757
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,040
We shouldn't let the people...

758
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,920
find out about it, should we?
