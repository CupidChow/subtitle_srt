1
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,259
Why would I harm the Fifth Prince?

2
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,200
I was the one who saved this kid.

3
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,840
Because I am on good terms with Noble Consort Chun,

4
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,250
so you deem with certainty that I betrayed the late Empress.

5
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,500
You brought me so much trouble, but I chose to forget it.

6
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,720
I thought on Yongqi's account,

7
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,440
we could still get along.

8
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,040
But I didn’t expect that you’d harm Yongqi!

9
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,120
He is just a kid!

10
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,040
He's utterly sincere with you and completely unguarded.

11
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,720
But you were so evil!

12
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,720
Are you a human? Have you any humanity?

13
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,660
Why does Palace of Everlasting Joy have such medicine?

14
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,970
Great question, Your Majesty.

15
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,220
In the entire Forbidden City,

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,730
other than Imperial Hospital,

17
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,770
it's probably only Palace of Everlasting Joy has it.

18
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,520
Your Majesty,

19
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,560
I hear Consort Ling was injured in the right arm

20
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
upon falling off the horse.

21
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,020
Doctor Ye prescribed a wolf's bane ointment

22
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,240
to treat the pain of bone dislocation and bleeding from fracture.

23
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,520
This ointment contains wolf's bane.

24
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,960
That’s why Palace of Everlasting Joy has it.

25
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,040
Your Majesty.

26
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,400
Consort Ling was granted royal grace but she does not repay it.

27
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,720
Instead she is jealous of Consort Yu and tried to kill the Fifth Prince.

28
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,320
A woman with such petty heart

29
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,160
and evil methods

30
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,079
is truly irritating.

31
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,240
I know that

32
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,440
Your Majesty can't bear to punish Consort Ling.

33
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,100
But if everyone follows suit,

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,840
then the Forbidden City will be in such chaos.

35
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,920
And the Imperial Harem will be chaotic too!

36
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,240
I dare to beg Your Majesty to punish her severely,

37
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,540
to serve as a stern warning to all!

38
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,280
So everyone knows

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,880
that killing a royal heir is unforgivable.

40
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,360
Palace of Everlasting Joy has wolf bane's ointment.

41
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,760
Consort Ling is indeed becoming a suspect.

42
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,160
However, we can't just be certain

43
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,650
that she is the one who tried to kill the Fifth Prince.

44
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
Your Majesty is right.

45
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,700
Consort Ling has no children.

46
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,280
To kill the Fifth Prince with poison,

47
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,880
other than venting of anger,

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,720
what would she stand to gain?

49
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,839
Empress,

50
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,360
the Fifth Prince and I

51
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,959
have been cared after by Noble Consort Chun generously.

52
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,280
Hence Consort Ling has insulted me many times,

53
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,920
saying I am a shameless social climber!

54
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,560
Even her maid Mingyu

55
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,520
threw in my face in public!

56
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,700
The Fifth Prince is young,

57
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,760
couldn't stand his mother being insulted,

58
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,240
so he spoke back a few words.

59
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,200
I didn’t expect that it would court such deep grudge from her

60
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,280
and bring this big misfortune to the Fifth Prince!

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,440
Empress, you are merciful,

62
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,280
so you wouldn't know

63
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,210
that such women exist in the world!

64
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,360
Your Majesty, if this incident gets out,

65
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,340
it will rile up a lot of gossip.

66
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
How about we detain the people from Palace of Everlasting Joy

67
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,200
and interrogate them later.

68
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,060
Just the eunuchs and palace maids are detained?

69
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,120
How are we going to punish Consort Ling?

70
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,080
Consort Ling is a fourth-ranked Imperial concubine,

71
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,040
so she is to reside in her Palace for the time being.

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,720
After the interrogation results come out, we’ll decide what to do with her.

73
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,880
Empress,

74
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,810
are you trying to winning more time for Consort Ling?

75
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,760
Now we have evidence and witness,

76
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,760
what’s the point then with the interrogation?

77
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,360
So you mean

78
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,860
we should sentence her

79
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,320
without interrogation?

80
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
Your Majesty.

81
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,320
I know

82
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,800
you pamper Consort Ling.

83
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,400
But the Fifth Prince is your son.

84
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,680
Can you bear to see him

85
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,160
suffer from such pain?

86
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,040
Your Majesty.

87
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
Your Majesty!

88
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
Yongqi,

89
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,370
your mother is useless.

90
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,840
Your mother can't protect you,

91
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,600
and I can't get justice for your grievance.

92
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
I should die..!

93
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,520
The truth has been found out yet!

94
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,780
Don’t be so emotional!

95
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,520
Your Majesty, I have always been useless.

96
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,520
I can only appeal for justice for Yongqi

97
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,840
in this way!

98
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,560
If you are not going to punish Consort Ling,

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,740
I can only use my death to show my conviction.

100
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,560
Your Majesty.

101
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,680
Now you see!

102
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,440
I’ve told you.

103
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,860
Even if I don't cause trouble,

104
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,140
as long as Your Majesty favors me,

105
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,360
others won't leave me alone.

106
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,800
Hurry! Hurry!

107
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,840
Slow down!

108
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,480
Slow down!

109
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,360
What’s going on?

110
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,600
Hurry up!

111
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,200
Consort Ling,

112
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,800
are you trying to get out of the guilt

113
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,040
with your words?

114
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,080
Look! The Fifth Prince remains unconscious.

115
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,640
Consort Yu almost committed suicide.

116
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,320
Haven't you sinned enough?

117
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,560
In the end,

118
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,760
your palace will be searched

119
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,760
and you will feel sorry after all!

120
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,400
In my opinion,

121
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,340
you should quit quibbling

122
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,850
and acknowledge your wrongdoing now!

123
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,120
Consort Ling.

124
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,480
I want to know,

125
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,840
did you do it?

126
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,720
Of course not.

127
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,680
Your Majesty, my witness will soon arrive.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,530
How come you have a witness?

129
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,840
You're just buying more time.

130
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,800
At this point,

131
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,200
waiting a bit more won’t make a difference.

132
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,240
Doctor Ye is here!

133
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,480
Greetings to Your Majesty and Your Highness the Empress.

134
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,120
Rise.

135
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

136
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,400
So doctor Ye is your witness?

137
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,240
Doctor Ye,

138
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,760
did you prescribe wolf bane's ointment for Consort Ling?

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,840
I did.

140
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,840
Wolf's bane and fritillary bulb clash with each other.

141
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,600
Yes.

142
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,760
Consort Ling,

143
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,320
what do you want doctor Ye to tell me?

144
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,760
Doctor Ye,

145
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,540
I don't know medicine.

146
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,320
But if someone eats something wrong,

147
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,240
what's the first thing you should do?

148
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,500
Eats something wrong?

149
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,160
Yes.

150
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,400
A slight dose of poison.

151
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,640
Or eating foods that clash each other.

152
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,160
That's easy. Take emetic.

153
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,760
Doctor Liu,

154
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,300
did you make the Fifth Prince vomit earlier?

155
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,000
The Fifth Prince is weak

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,860
and I don't dare to make him vomit.

157
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,560
So I could only have him drink detoxing medicine.

158
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,880
Has the Fifth Prince been out of danger?

159
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,720
Well…

160
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,520
Of course not.

161
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,120
Don't you see

162
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,320
that the Fifth Prince is still unconscious?

163
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,160
Since the Fifth Prince isn't out of danger yet,

164
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,680
which means that detox medicine is useless.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,080
Why don’t we try doctor Ye’s method?

166
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,480
Consort Ling! Haven't you harmed Yongqi enough?

167
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,250
You want him to suffer more?

168
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,960
Your Majesty. Please trust doctor Ye!

169
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,120
And please trust me

170
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,180
that that I have no intention to harm Yongqi.

171
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,760
Ye Tianshi, are you sure about this?

172
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,640
Your Majesty, don’t worry!

173
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,080
Allow me to check his pulse,

174
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,400
and prescribe a mild emetic.

175
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,880
Have the Fifth Prince take it

176
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
and the poison will be removed soon.

177
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,490
Alright.

178
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,400
Prescribe the medicine now.

179
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes.

180
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,600
Your Majesty.

181
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,930
I believe in Ye Tianshi's medical skills.

182
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,600
Your Majesty,

183
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,320
the Fifth Prince is so frail.

184
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,320
How can he withstand such torment?

185
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,120
If something happened to Yongqi,

186
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,560
I couldn't live either.

187
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,440
Consort Ling is a murderer.

188
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,160
How can you listen to her?

189
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,880
Take Consort Yu to get some rest.

190
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,400
Your Majesty!

191
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,160
Your Majesty!

192
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,020
Your Highness!

193
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,600
Your Highness!

194
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,400
Your Majesty!

195
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,760
Reporting to Your Majesty.

196
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,320
the Fifth Prince has already vomited

197
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,960
all the food he ate today.

198
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

199
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,880
There is no wolf's bane?

200
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,680
Your Majesty,

201
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,400
wolf's bane dissolved as soon as it enters the stomach.

202
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,460
Even if he vomits, it's gone already.

203
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,840
But

204
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,280
the Fifth Prince also vomited lots of

205
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,880
undigested ginseng slices.

206
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,880
I find it really strange.

207
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,480
The Fifth Prince has a coughing disease resulting from lung deficiency,

208
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,280
hence the partaking of ginseng.

209
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,760
Even if it’s for restore the Fifth Prince's energy,

210
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,480
you can just use it for brewing ginseng tea.

211
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,600
Why use so much?

212
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,680
Reckless use of ginseng will cause harm to health.

213
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,520
Furthermore,

214
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,770
the Fifth Prince is young and healthy.

215
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,720
Overuse of ginseng will instead cause energy obstruction,

216
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,880
trouble to circulation of the stomach and blood,

217
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,320
and grave defect to the health.

218
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,980
That's why he's unconscious!

219
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,920
Doctor Liu,

220
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,100
aren't you versed in pediatric care?

221
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,360
How did you commit such a grave mistake?

222
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,080
Well…

223
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
Unless he was instructed by someone

224
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,440
to frame Consort Ling on purpose?

225
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Your Majesty, spare my life.

226
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,000
Your Majesty, spare my life!

227
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,280
It...It was Consort Yu who insisted on using ginseng slices.

228
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,200
I already dissuaded her,

229
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,040
but she wouldn't listen!

230
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,000
It was also Consort Yu

231
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,320
who was certain that the Fifth Prince took in wolf's bane,

232
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,680
so I misread the pulse!

233
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,160
The clash between Wolf’s bane and fritillaria

234
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,490
is totally different from misusing ginseng.

235
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,140
Eating wolf's bane and fritillaria together is fatal.

236
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,200
Consort Yu couldn't bear for the Fifth Prince to lose his life.

237
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,160
So she could only bribe this doctor to

238
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,720
frame me.

239
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,160
Consort Yu.

240
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,520
Your Majesty.

241
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,880
I didn't know overuse of ginseng is dangerous.

242
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,960
I was wrong. I am ignorant!

243
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,000
Your Majesty,

244
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,600
it's all my fault.

245
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,720
I harmed the Fifth Prince for no reason

246
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,160
and defamed Sister Ling too.

247
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,040
It is your fault!

248
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,280
As a mother,

249
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,920
you actually harmed your own son

250
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,770
in order to frame Consort Ling.

251
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,640
You are unworthy of being Yongqi's mother.

252
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,280
Say it!

253
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,680
Who told you to do it?

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,800
Consort Yu, you had better confess the truth,

255
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
or else you will be the culprit.

256
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,920
It was Noble Consort Chun. It was all Noble Consort Chun's instructions!

257
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,400
She came up with the idea and gave me the ginseng!

258
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,520
Your Majesty, Yongqi is my son!

259
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,160
If she didn’t force me, how could I do this?

260
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,680
Your Majesty.

261
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,300
It was Noble Consort Chun.

262
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,160
It's all her doing!

263
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,060
Consort Yu!

264
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,000
Have you gone mad?

265
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,400
I treat you very well.

266
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,680
You not only vent out your resentment of jealousy to Consort Ling,

267
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,280
but also

268
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,920
try to frame me in order to defend yourself!

269
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,040
Even the fierce tiger won't eat its own cub.

270
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,280
Can’t believe there’s a mother like you in this world!

271
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,080
Your Majesty!

272
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,130
Please don’t listen to her.

273
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,160
Everything I said is true.

274
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,040
I can swear to God.

275
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,680
Right!

276
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,740
Imperial Household Department must

277
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,090
have record showing that Palace of Gathering Essence has got the ginseng.

278
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,520
Mother. Royal Father.

279
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,160
Come here.

280
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,960
Yongqi. Do you feel better?

281
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,600
Royal Father.

282
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,280
I feel weak and dizzy.

283
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
It'll be alright.

284
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
You will be better very soon.

285
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,080
Don't worry.

286
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,760
Royal Father won't forgive those

287
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,160
who schemed after you.

288
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,770
Attendants!

289
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,880
Confine Noble Consort Chun in Palace of Gathering Essence.

290
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,210
Take the rest to the Office of Punishment.

291
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,080
I want an answer before dusk!

292
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,130
Your Majesty, then Consort Yu?

293
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,460
Detain her as well!

294
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,360
Yes.

295
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,600
Your Majesty.

296
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,840
Your Majesty.

297
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,480
Your Majesty.

298
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,760
Don't take my mother.

299
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,880
Don't take my mother.

300
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,400
Mother.

301
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:33,840
Yongqi.

302
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,640
Don't go.

303
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,560
Yongqi.

304
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,880
Remember!

305
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,530
You must listen to Mother Consort Ling in the future!

306
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,840
Don't go. Mother!

307
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,840
-Don't go. Mother! –Yongqi!

308
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,180
Consort Ling, you are wronged today!

309
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,440
Thank you, Empress, for believing in me!

310
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,640
If you did it, no one could save you.

311
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,680
If you did not, the real culprit can’t flee either.

312
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,360
Your Highness, please give instructions.

313
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,560
Your Highness, no matter how we interrogate,

314
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,680
she won't confess.

315
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,530
Your Highness the Empress,

316
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,080
my master was framed.

317
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,260
She really didn't frame Consort Ling

318
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,720
and she also didn't…

319
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,560
Yuhu.

320
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,960
Consort Yu confessed

321
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,930
and Noble Consort Chun can't get out of her guilt.

322
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,560
As her maid,

323
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,220
you should be punished first.

324
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Noble Consort Chun gave birth to the Sixth Prince.

325
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,160
No matter what grave crime she commits,

326
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,690
His Majesty won't kill her.

327
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,200
But what about you?

328
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,610
Your Highness the Empress.

329
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,200
I am willing to die to atone for my crime!

330
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,480
But Noble Consort Chun

331
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,319
really is innocent!

332
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,440
How loyal!

333
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,599
Unfortunately,

334
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,780
loyalty and filial piety can't both be devoted.

335
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,660
You have your parents and family.

336
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,400
You should think of them.

337
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,400
Your Majesty?

338
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,560
Why did you startle me?

339
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,560
I saw you sitting here alone,

340
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,900
so I didn't let them announce.

341
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,720
What?

342
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,650
It’s ok when you startle me,

343
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,440
but I can’t startle you?

344
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Your Majesty said you'd protect me.

345
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,700
But earlier when I was pressed by others,

346
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,880
you didn’t say anything.

347
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,400
If I sided with you too obviously,

348
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,410
you'd really become

349
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,160
the entire harem's target.

350
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,440
So, Your Majesty trusted me?

351
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,120
If I didn’t,

352
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,330
you wouldn’t even have had the chance to quibble.

353
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Reporting to Your Majesty.

354
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,780
Her Highness the Empress is here.

355
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,610
Greetings to Your Majesty.

356
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,680
Rise.

357
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,920
Your Majesty,

358
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,840
I have interrogated the palace maids and eunuchs of Palace of Gathering Essence severely.

359
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,680
I discovered a secret that’s hard to deal with.

360
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,040
As it’s related to the Seventh Prince,

361
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,480
I can't make a decision on my own.

362
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,610
So I came to ask Your Majesty to decide.

363
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,920
Bring her here.

364
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,840
Tell His Majesty

365
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,320
what you just told me.

366
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,120
Your Majesty.

367
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,620
Noble Consort Chun ordered me

368
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,600
to get close to Wang Zhong, supervisor of the Heating Office,

369
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,680
and to bribe him to work for us.

370
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,480
That year on New Year's Eve,

371
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,850
the late Empress was merciful.

372
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,760
She sent us back early to take rest.

373
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,650
Noble Consort bribed the junior eunuch of Palace of Eternal Spring

374
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,960
to switch to chrysanthemum charcoal that bursts easily.

375
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,680
She also arranged Wang Zhong to

376
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,280
mess with the bottom of the auspicious barrel,

377
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,040
causing the fire rescue with melting ice to die out halfway.

378
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,960
That’s why

379
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,760
the Seventh Prince was burned to death.

380
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,120
Your Majesty,

381
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,080
I was interrogating the case of Consort Yu.

382
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,040
But I didn’t expect that

383
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,800
it’d lead to the incident in the past.

384
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,640
The Seventh Prince was talented and everyone had high hope for him.

385
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,440
Your Majesty and the late Empress both adored him.

386
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,080
Can’t believe that

387
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,680
Noble Consort Chun would hold malice over him.

388
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,240
If nothing had happened to the Seventh Prince,

389
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,960
the late Empress also wouldn't have...

390
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,890
It's a pity that everyone who served at Palace of Eternal Spring has...

391
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,240
Your Majesty.

392
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,880
My maid Mingyu

393
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,100
once served at Palace of Gathering Essence.

394
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,040
Mingyu.

395
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,760
Your Majesty,

396
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,360
I served at Palace of Gathering Essence for two years.

397
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,890
Noble Consort Chun held a gentle attitude and was considerate.

398
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,020
But there was on day

399
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,240
I bumped into

400
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,680
Wang Zhong and Yuhu when they were talking about their plan,

401
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,760
then Noble Consort Chun mistreated me

402
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,800
and wanted to kill me to keep the secret!

403
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,000
Why didn't you say something back then?

404
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,760
I...

405
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,800
Your Majesty,

406
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,370
Mingyu held it in for a long time

407
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,080
because she had no evidence.

408
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,120
It’d be like knocking a stone with an egg

409
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,160
if she were to reveal her crime

410
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,760
with just her words.

411
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,920
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

412
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,210
Your Majesty, palace maids have parents too.

413
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,280
Even if I don't value my own life,

414
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,400
I need to think about my family.

415
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,280
Everything I said is true.

416
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,700
I am willing to testify against my master and be punished by death.

417
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,760
Your Majesty,

418
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,640
spare my family on the account

419
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
that I told the truth to make up my mistake!

420
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Your Majesty,

421
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,160
After Yuhu's confession,

422
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,360
I summoned Wang Zhong

423
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,780
and indeed it was true.

424
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,440
What about Consort Ling's falling off the horse?

425
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,200
Consort Ling used to serve at Palace of Eternal Spring.

426
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,130
She was devoted to the late Empress

427
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,880
and she's garnered Your Majesty's favor.

428
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,520
Noble Consort Chun was worried the old incident would come to light.

429
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,380
So she roped in Consort Yu to get rid of Consort Ling.

430
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,090
Falling off the horse didn’t work,

431
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,490
so she thought of another plan.

432
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,220
Taking advantage of the Fifth Prince's coughing disease,

433
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,640
she tried to frame Consort Ling in order to save herself.

434
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,400
Alright.

435
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,040
What an evil and vicious

436
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,040
Noble Consort Chun!

437
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,880
Take her away.

438
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,960
Your Majesty. Your Majesty,

439
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,440
please spare my family!

440
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,640
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

441
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,800
Your Majesty!

442
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,920
Noble Consort Chun killed the Seventh Prince.

443
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,880
Her crime is not forgivable.

444
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,330
Starting today,

445
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,770
strip her title,

446
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,360
demote her to a Second Class Attendant!

447
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,090
Confine her to the Cold Palace!

448
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,320
Your Majesty is sage.

449
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,520
Consort Ling,

450
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,680
this time I've helped you.

451
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,960
Your Highness isn't helping me.

452
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,860
You're helping yourself.

453
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,980
Noble Consort Chun is only second to Your Highness.

454
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,530
And she gave birth to the Sixth Prince.

455
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,490
If she’s out of the picture,

456
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,120
Your Highness will benefit the most.

457
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,080
Consort Ling is loyal and devoted to the late Empress.

458
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,720
How touching!

459
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,680
Yingluo,

460
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,060
If Her Highness in heaven knew

461
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,880
that the killer of the Seventh Prince got punished,

462
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,280
she would be so happy.

463
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,960
Let's go prepare offering items

464
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,160
and pay our respect to the late Empress,

465
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,320
tell her this good news, okay?

466
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,240
Hailancha.

467
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,250
May Your Majesty instruct.

468
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,880
Do all women

469
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,680
have two faces?

470
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,200
Well…

471
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,720
I am not yet married.

472
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,580
I’m not quite sure.

473
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,480
Noble Consort Chun was gentle and talented

474
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,840
in my eyes.

475
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,080
I never thought

476
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,160
that she has such an evil heart

477
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,600
hidden under such a lovely appearance.

478
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,960
Yongcong was so little.

479
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,760
Can’t believe she killed him.

480
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,840
Over the years,

481
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,650
she hasn’t showed any guilt

482
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,410
whenever mentioning Yongcong

483
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,240
How scary it is

484
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,420
having a woman like her by my side!

485
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,080
Your Majesty,

486
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,680
no matter how beautiful the appearance is,

487
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,740
the true color will show eventually.

488
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,080
Noble Consort Chun deserves

489
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,880
to be punished.

490
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,720
I keep thinking

491
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,080
that Consort Ling

492
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,320
has been guiding me all along

493
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,360
to investigate the truth

494
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,090
and punish Noble Consort Chun.

495
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,720
Your Majesty,

496
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,400
Consort Ling used to serve at Palace of Eternal Spring.

497
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,440
She abhors evils.

498
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,800
I’m not surprised that she would do this.

499
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,020
The late Empress was as gracious and kind to her.

500
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,170
I’m also not surprised that

501
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,740
she’d repay her kindness.

502
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,640
But whether she...

503
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Your Majesty,

504
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,480
what are you

505
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,000
worried about?

506
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,680
Nothing. You may go.

507
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,400
Yes.

508
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,760
Your Majesty,

509
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,560
the Fifth Prince is kneeling outside the hall,

510
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,160
hoping you can forgive Consort Yu.

511
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,640
Tell him,

512
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,600
Consort Yu

513
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,130
is not worthy to be a mother.

514
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,280
You may go.

515
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,280
Yes.

516
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Yongqi,

517
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,240
you are too stubborn.

518
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,760
Consort Yu's sin is not forgivable.

519
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,680
I won't plead her case.

520
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,720
Even though my mother did something wrong,

521
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,280
she is still my mother.

522
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,080
She gave life to me and took care of me!

523
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,920
She fed me

524
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,000
and educated me with all her heart.

525
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,420
Even if the whole world scorns at her,

526
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,320
I can’t!

527
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Empress Dowager has always loved me dearly.

528
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,520
Please spare my mother's life

529
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,640
on my account.

530
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,600
I beg you.

531
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,480
I beg you, Royal Grandma.

532
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,320
Royal Grandma, I beg you.

533
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,840
Alright. Alright.

534
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,880
Rise first.

535
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,040
Royal Grandma,

536
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,640
only you can save my mother now.

537
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,280
I beg you.

538
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,600
Allow me

539
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,480
to think about it.

540
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,100
What's wrong with you?

541
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,400
I can't sleep.

542
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,160
His Majesty summoned the military officers to discuss affairs.

543
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,400
He says he won't come.

544
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,970
I'm not talking about that.

545
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,360
Then why can't you sleep?

546
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,700
I just find that something's off.

547
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,360
You

548
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,080
worry too much.

549
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,840
careful that your hair will become grey

550
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,700
while you are still young.

551
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,520
Where are you going?

552
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,280
Wait for me.

553
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,570
Don't get a cold.

554
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,320
I had thought

555
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,840
that the one who would come here tonight

556
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,480
should be Wei Yingluo.

557
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,760
I didn't think it would be you.

558
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,400
Wei Yingluo?

559
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,040
I finally understand

560
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,360
why Wei Yingluo would rather invite

561
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,000
the hatred of the entire harem to

562
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,930
fight for favor with all her might,

563
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,580
Of course it was for you

564
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,280
to grow jealousy

565
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
and concern.

566
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,200
No,

567
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,960
there’s fear as well.

568
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,330
You’d fear that she’d reveal your crime of

569
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,560
killing the Seventh Prince.

570
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,060
The more aggressive Wei Yingluo became,

571
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,980
the easier for you to take action.

572
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,200
As long as you act,

573
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,280
you’d expose yourself.

574
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,480
She spread news of horseback riding on purpose

575
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,560
and lured me to act.

576
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,320
Actually, even if I didn't do anything,

577
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,530
she would still create an incident

578
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,930
to plant suspicion in His Majesty.

579
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,360
One step wrong

580
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,970
and all steps wrong.

581
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,700
This is the opportunity she’s been waiting for.

582
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,400
But Empress?

583
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,980
What kind of role you’ve been playing

584
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,520
during this whole time?

585
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,440
Me?

586
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,320
Noble Consort Chun and Consort Ling had a conflict?

587
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,980
I am the Empress of Great Qing.

588
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,240
Of course my role is to be just.

589
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,600
I am such a fool.

590
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,600
I have been your pawn all along!

591
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,320
You really had nothing to do

592
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
with the late Empress's death?

593
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,960
Of course not!

594
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,760
You're lying!

595
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,320
First,

596
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,400
you found out my affection for Fuca Fuheng.

597
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
You made me betray the late Empress.

598
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,560
Second,

599
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,450
you told me the harem is lonely.

600
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,160
You asked me to have a child,

601
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,880
inciting my desire of fighting for His Majesty’s favor.

602
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,200
Third,

603
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,480
after I had Yongrong,

604
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,840
it was also you who told me

605
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,280
when the Seventh Prince grows up,

606
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,680
he’d be the most suitable one to succeed the throne,

607
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,640
and His Majesty liked Yongcong so much

608
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,640
that he’d make him the heir for sure.

609
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,090
These are just your suppositions.

610
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,760
Have you any proof?

611
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,520
I'm guessing

612
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,680
it was also you who

613
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,730
asked Imperial Household Department

614
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,120
to switch the chrysanthemum charcoal.

615
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,240
Don’t forget

616
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,280
That when the late Empress gave birth,

617
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,120
you were assigned to take charge of the Imperial Harem.

618
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,480
You were well aware of

619
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,360
what Imperial Household Department has done!

620
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,480
You

621
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,640
put the dagger in my hand,

622
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,040
making me your cat's paw.

623
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,520
No! Not just that!

624
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,449
You knew the Seventh Prince

625
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,600
was the late Empress' everything.

626
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,080
If he died, the late Empress would be over.

627
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,159
Nara,

628
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,639
you won with every step you went,

629
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,679
and successfully forced the Empress to die.

630
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,260
And during the whole time,

631
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,800
you’ve been wanting to replace her.

632
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,000
Continue.

633
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,179
You murdered the Seventh Prince,

634
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,540
forced the late Empress to kill herself,

635
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,960
encouraged me to fight with Wei Yingluo,

636
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,920
then used her

637
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,000
to push me into hell.

638
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,880
But your hands

639
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,560
have been clean all along!

640
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,200
Ridiculous!

641
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,160
So ridiculous!

642
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,000
So ridiculous!

643
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,600
Who

644
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,840
have I been fighting for?

645
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,450
And who have I been working for?

646
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,960
My dream has totally fell apart,

647
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,570
and all my effort ended up benefiting others.

648
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,760
Nara,

649
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,040
why are you so evil?

650
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,000
Why?

651
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,880
Why?

652
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,760
Because Fuca Rongyin was too hypocritical

653
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,800
and hateful!

654
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,920
And you…

655
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,640
I only want to be with His Majesty,

656
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,960
but you kept threatening me!

657
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,120
I couldn’t take a breath

658
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,320
getting stuck between Fuca and Gao!

659
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,180
Who have ever been merciful to me?

660
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,280
My mother died.

661
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,000
Every night, I would dream of her standing next to my bed,

662
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,860
with blood all over her head, and interrogating me!

663
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,520
Who would understand that kind of pain?

664
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,360
You were being unreasonable first,

665
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,890
yet expecting me to be kind?

666
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,200
That’s such a big joke!

667
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,720
Attendant Su.

668
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,680
Your hatred for the late Empress

669
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,560
stemmed from your love for Fuheng.

670
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,020
The deeper the love, the greater the hatred.

671
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,400
Don’t pretend that you were thinking of Yongrong’s future

672
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,480
and make yourself sound so noble!

673
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,570
You did it because of hatred

674
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,040
and discontent!

675
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,680
No, I did it for Yongrong.

676
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,770
It was all for Yongrong!

677
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,080
Then,

678
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,160
are you now thinking of

679
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,200
Yongrong

680
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,520
or Fuheng?

681
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,560
Or perhaps

682
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,480
what you did to Fuca Rongyin?

683
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,920
She fell from the corner of the watching tower,

684
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,400
badly-mutilated!

685
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,040
When you dreamed of her,

686
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,800
did she ask you

687
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,280
why you killed her son?

688
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,520
Yes.

689
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
I can’t accept it!

690
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,120
I really can’t!

691
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,760
I did so much

692
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,200
and ended up gaining nothing!

693
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,040
I hate Fuheng.

694
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,360
I hate the late Empress.

695
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,720
I hate them

696
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,680
for ignoring me!

697
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,880
So,

698
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,280
I killed the Seventh Prince in person!

699
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,640
I wanted them to regret.

700
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,960
This was a sin.

701
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,440
It was a lifetime sin.

702
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,280
But fortunately,

703
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,520
I will be seeing her soon.

704
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,320
You are here tonight

705
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,040
to see me off, aren’t you?

706
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,850
It's good that you understand.

707
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,280
Do it!

708
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,400
Mother Ling.

709
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,120
Where did you go?

710
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,360
I just came back from Palace of Longevity and Peace.

711
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,960
Mother Ling, what happened?

712
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,970
Everything's fine.

713
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,920
Yongqi.

714
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,040
Your mother

715
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,800
told you something in the end,

716
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,440
didn’t she?

717
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,560
What did she say?

718
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,400
Can you tell me?

719
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,560
Your Majesty, the day is breaking already.

720
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,800
No matter how important the affairs of the country are, you should still take care of your health.

721
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,840
I know.

722
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,480
Your Majesty.

723
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,960
Attendant Su…

724
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,880
I heard the blood was all over the place.

725
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,200
Her neck was almost broken.

726
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,680
Broken?

727
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,160
This is what I heard.

728
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,960
but I heard that the palace maid who was responsible for cleaning

729
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,160
fainted from shock.

730
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,880
What could break a person's neck?

731
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,480
Your Majesty,

732
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,210
this is a string from a kite.

733
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,560
This case ends here.

734
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,480
Forbid anyone in the Forbidden City to talk about this.

735
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,940
If there's any violation,

736
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,440
punish according to the palace's law.

737
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,000
Yes.

738
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,000
You may withdraw now.

739
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,320
Yes.

740
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,320
The string of the kite may seem harmless.

741
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,680
But once it's tightened,

742
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,680
it can break a person's neck.

743
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,460
How would this happen?

744
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,600
In this case,

745
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,680
everyone will suspect

746
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,650
that it's Yingluo who killed Noble Consort Chun.

747
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,880
Yingluo.

748
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,200
Why aren't you saying anything?

749
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,560
Why?

750
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,280
Maybe it’s because...

751
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,320
Mother asked me to listen to you in the future.

752
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,640
Yingluo, where are you going?

753
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,200
Yingluo!

754
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,840
Wait.

755
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,810
Consort Ling, the Empress Dowager has ordered me

756
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,460
to see Consort Yu off to cultivate Buddhism.

757
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,600
Empress Dowager wants Consort Yu to leave and cultivate Buddhism?

758
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,960
It's for mediation.

759
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,560
Granny,

760
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,400
can I speak with Consort Yu for a moment?

761
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,680
Why?

762
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,080
The spoils go to the victor.

763
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,680
You won. You should be happy.

764
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,440
Why bother asking the reason?

765
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,170
I don’t understand.

766
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,480
Consort Yu,

767
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,080
you lost too quickly

768
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,440
and easily.

769
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,600
It makes me suspicious

770
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,360
that you knew it’s going to happen.
