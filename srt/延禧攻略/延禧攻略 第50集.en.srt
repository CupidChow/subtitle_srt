[Story of Yanxi Palace]
[Episode 50]

3
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,600
The supervisors of
the Imperial Horsemasters,

4
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,490
supernumerary, curators, and eunuchs,

5
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,200
have all been interrogated.

6
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,790
All of them plead innocent, nothing else.

7
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,230
Give the eunuch handling the horse
eighty heavy strokes of flogging.

8
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,130
Withheld twelve-month wages from the rest.

9
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,050
Then release them.

10
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,010
-Release them?
-Yes.

11
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,750
Release them.

[Zhongcui Gate]

13
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,730
Greetings, Your Majesty.

14
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,040
What brings Your Majesty here today?

15
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,880
I wasn't told beforehand.

16
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,050
You seem to be joyous for some reason.

17
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,010
I am glad Your Majesty is visiting
the Zhongcui Palace.

18
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,540
But Consort Ling suffered great injury.

19
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,750
The imperial physicians have been
coming and going from Yanxi Palace.

20
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,870
I am worried for her as well.

21
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,680
If it wasn't for Your Majesty's order

22
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,550
that no one is to be allowed
to bother her,

23
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,300
I would have visited Consort Ling by now.

24
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,250
Your Majesty.

25
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,240
In my palace, there some reishi and
antlers granted by Your Majesty before.

26
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,430
I will have them sent to Consort Ling.

27
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,870
These should be great tonics
for her recovery.

28
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,190
Jing Hao.

29
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,159
you have always been gentle and kind.

30
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,980
I have always valued you.

31
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,650
But smart people tend to be stubborn.

32
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,260
I am sure you are familiar with the phrase
"outsmarted by one's self"?

33
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,470
Your Majesty,

34
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
I…

35
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,160
Someone tempered with the horse
Consort Ling was riding.

36
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,640
As far as I can see,

37
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,610
Her Majesty is seen as the mother
of the whole nation.

38
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,540
Even if Consort Ling was favoured,

39
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,910
her power won't be threatened.

40
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,130
As for other concubines,

41
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,690
I doubt they would be so bold.

42
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,840
Enlighten me, who would have done
such a thing?

43
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,520
Your Majesty,

44
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,760
do you suspect...

45
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,760
I have served Your Majesty
before you ascended to the throne.

46
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,710
I have nothing to accompany me other than
music, poetry, and paintings.

47
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,140
I desire nothing more
than the little attention...

48
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,020
Your Majesty would spare me.

49
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,810
Your Majesty can feel
free to suspect anyone,

50
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,990
but I shouldn't be your suspect.

51
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,930
Before Consort Ling,
you were the most favoured.

52
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,260
After she became my consort,
wouldn't her presence...

53
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,890
affect your power the most?

54
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,720
Your Majesty,

55
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,600
when I was favoured,

56
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,170
I pitied other concubines' solitude.

57
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,080
I often persuaded Your Majesty to be
impartial to all of us.

58
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,540
That would bring harmony
to the whole harem.

59
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,730
Consort Ling has all greatness with her,

60
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,520
but she never let Your Majesty to
visit other consorts and concubines.

61
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,760
She is acting like a tyrant.

62
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,130
I had tried to persuade her,

63
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,110
but she remains stubborn and conspicuous.

64
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,760
That was exactly why someone
took revenge on her out of jealousy.

65
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,770
I can swear to heaven,

66
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,750
it has nothing to do with me.

67
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,180
Jing Hao.

68
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,160
The more you want,

69
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,240
the more you will lose.

70
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,360
Before you take any action,

71
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,570
remember that Sixth Prince's
life could be at stake.

72
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,520
Keep my words in mind.

73
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,220
Your Majesty.

74
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,700
I didn't do that.

75
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,170
I really didn't.

76
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,150
I do hope...

77
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,650
this has nothing to do with you.

78
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,510
Don't disappoint me.

79
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:07,820
Your Majesty.

80
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,230
Your Majesty.

81
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,160
Your Highness.

82
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,900
Can't you get anything done?

83
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,539
Your Highness, I didn't expect...

84
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,669
His Majesty would
risk his life to save her.

85
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,559
But I assure Your Highness,

86
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,400
all those involved in the plan
have been bribed to cover it up.

87
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,000
Your secret is safe.

88
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,000
I didn't do that personally.

89
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,180
If the investigation goes on,

90
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,640
Consort Yu,

91
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,830
you are putting your son at risk.

92
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,890
[Yanxi Gate]

93
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,770
Consort Yu,

94
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,390
We are grateful for your arrival.

95
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,970
How is Consort Ling?

96
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,010
I am worried for her and
I wish to pay her a visit.

97
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,730
But as His Majesty ordered,

98
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,090
no consort or concubine are allowed
to visit Consort Ling.

99
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,560
Consort Yu, my master is awake.

100
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,490
Since you're here,

101
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,040
please allow me to inform Her Highness.

102
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,740
If Consort Ling found out I didn't
ask Your Highness to stay,

103
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,450
she would scold me for being rude.

104
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,150
Consort Yu, this way please.

105
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,060
Consort Ling.

106
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,630
I wouldn't dare...

107
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,610
to have you address me that way.

108
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,920
Wei Ying Luo.

109
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,850
That's more like it.

110
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,700
Since you have made me your enemy,

111
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,690
why bother pretending to be friendly?

112
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,010
Don't be so pretentious.

113
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,370
You saved me so many times.

114
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,530
I didn't want to harm you.

115
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,170
But you still choose to...

116
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,380
side with Noble Consort Chun.

117
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,490
You attempted to kill me.

118
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,290
Ying Luo.

119
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,440
Not everyone is as fortunate as you.

120
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,920
You are favoured by
the late Empress and His Majesty.

121
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,390
I have nothing.

122
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,010
My only chance of survival in Forbidden
City is to side with Consort Chun.

123
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,150
I don't have a second option.

124
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,290
It's all for survival.

125
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,100
Do you understand...

126
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,910
that Consort Chun had
Seventh Prince killed?

127
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Do you know she killed the late Empress?

128
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,750
I don't know.

129
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,090
And I don't want to know either.

130
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,720
I am just a humble person.

131
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,350
I must survive...

132
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,880
to protect my son Yong Qi.

133
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,440
I..

134
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,400
These matters are beyond
my capability to meddle with.

135
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,470
You!

136
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,290
Ying Luo, be careful!

137
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,580
If you fed a dog,

138
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,320
at least the dog would guard your house.

139
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,360
You received the late
Empress' protection...

140
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,540
time after time,

141
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,430
yet you sided with Noble Consort Chun.

142
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,500
Consort Yu, you are worse than an animal!

143
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,190
Animal?

144
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,700
The harem is full of perils,

145
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,790
a woman who won no favour...

146
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,920
must learn to be dependant.

147
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,760
In order to survive,

148
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,940
I had to watch as my best friend
die right in front of me.

149
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,510
In order to survive,

150
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,560
I lower my pride to
please Noble Consort Gao.

151
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,720
The late Empress did rescue me before.

152
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,270
But she was so pitiful
she could barely protect herself!

153
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,570
And you, Wei Ying Luo!

154
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,140
You once gave me hope.

155
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,880
But when I wanted to live with dignity,

156
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,700
you were nowhere to be seen!

157
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,810
I felt like falling into the abyss.

158
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,080
At that time, only she...

159
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,530
Only Noble Consort Chun
reached out to me and pull me back!

160
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,970
Did you tell His Majesty...

161
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,130
Noble Consort Chun planned
for you to fall off the horse?

162
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,310
Stop it!

163
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,200
Stay your hand out of this matter.

164
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,100
I beg you.

165
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,570
If this goes on,

166
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,920
Noble Consort Chun...

167
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,620
will surely use me as her scapegoat.

168
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,570
I deserve to die.

169
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,930
But Ying Luo,

170
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,280
I have a child.

171
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,210
Don't you remember...

172
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,460
you once rescued Yong Qi
from Noble Consort Gao's hands?

173
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,880
How could you let him lose
his mother at such a young age?

174
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,510
You've gone crazy.

175
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,650
You want Ying Luo to
forgive Noble Consort Chun?

176
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,280
I mean to turn hostility into friendship.

177
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,310
Give up on the investigation.

178
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,690
Stop investigating the late
Empress' death.

179
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,000
They are things of the past.

180
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,660
Isn't it good for all to live in peace?

181
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,640
You want me to give up?

182
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,880
Now,

183
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,350
you are favoured most by His Majesty.

184
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,080
Why are you still holding onto
the grudge of the past?

185
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,450
If you reconcile with Noble Consort Chun
and bear a child,

186
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,890
no one in the harem
will waver your status.

187
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,010
I am doing this...

188
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,400
not just for myself,

189
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,260
but for the Fifth Prince you saved,

190
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,890
and for your own good.

191
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,860
If I stop taking revenge on her,

192
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,360
will Noble Consort Chun stop
trying to kill me?

193
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,250
She won't.

194
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,460
You have my word,

195
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,090
if you put an end to this,

196
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,760
I will do my best to
persuade Noble Consort Chun.

197
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,950
You?

198
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,320
Let me think about it.

199
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,720
How can you forgive that woman?

200
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,370
She betrayed the late Empress!

201
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,750
I barely escaped from death's doorstep.

202
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,210
Do you want me to make more enemies?

203
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,630
Ying Luo.

204
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,390
I assure you,

205
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,690
I will never let
Noble Consort Chun harm you again.

206
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,980
Consort Yu.

207
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,330
You made this choice.

208
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Are you certain you won't regret it?

209
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,010
For Yong Qi's sake,

210
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,960
for my son,

211
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't care if the people loath me,

212
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,060
even if I have to bow down to my enemy,
I shall have no regret.

213
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,090
Ying Luo.

214
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,730
One day,

215
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,960
you will become a mother too.

216
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,570
You will have your own child.

217
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,370
When that happens,

218
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,820
you will surely understand
how I feel today.

219
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,800
Mother, look.

220
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,120
Your writing has improved a lot.

221
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,800
My teacher said that to achieve good work,

222
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,640
we must to write with close attention.

223
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,040
It's the same for calligraphy
and conducting oneself.

224
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,900
Only with upright mindset
and positive attitude...

225
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,110
can we write well and be a good person.

226
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,350
These are words of wisdom. Come.

227
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,400
Yong Qi, you have a great teacher.

228
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,740
From now on,

229
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,370
you must listen to your teacher, okay?

230
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,180
Yong Qi, your braid is messy.

231
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,640
Let me comb it for you later,
how does that sound?

232
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,680
Yes.

233
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,570
Mother, why are you crying?

234
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,010
Yong Qi,

235
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,160
I'm happy.

236
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,700
In just a blink of an eye,

237
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,520
you've already grown so much.

238
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,800
Why do you cry when you're happy?

239
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,320
Yong Qi,

240
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,500
come with me, we are meeting someone.

241
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,450
Keep in mind that...

242
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,250
you must please her.

243
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,610
Why?

244
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,190
Because only by having her favour...

245
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,710
will you be safe forever.

246
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,840
Your Highness, this knee guard is for...

247
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,540
My father's getting old,
his arthritis is getting worse.

248
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,340
The one my mother made for him...

249
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,090
has worn out.

250
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,520
Your Majesty, you miss Old Mistress again.

251
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,790
When I was young,

252
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,130
my mother was especially strict to me.

253
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,550
She asked me to follow rules...

254
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,380
for everything I do in life.

255
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,720
She wouldn't allow me to make any mistake.

256
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,160
But my father loved me the most.

257
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,210
He always stood up for me.

258
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,590
Your Majesty,

259
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,610
Lord Naerbu is waiting for you
by Qianqing Gate.

260
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,410
I thought he is working on disaster relief
in Eastern Zhejiang.

261
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,990
Why is he back?

262
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,770
Lord Naerbu said the work has been done.

263
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,800
He asked for leave to return for
the Old Mistress's death anniversary.

264
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,300
The palace gate is about to be locked.

265
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,160
We cannot meet now.

266
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,510
Tell him we will meet another day.

267
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,690
Your Majesty, Lord Naerbu travelled
great distance to come here.

268
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,550
Why not make an exception for him?

269
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,090
As the Empress, I must follow
the palace rules strictly.

270
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,360
Otherwise I will be bashed for it.

271
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Go.

272
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,770
The next time my father comes,

273
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,990
this knee guard will be finished.

274
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,150
I will give it to him personally.

275
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,090
It is God's will.

276
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,870
Lord Naerbu, what's wrong?

277
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,030
I want to meet Her Majesty
for one last time,

278
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,320
but sadly that won't be possible now.

279
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,640
Now I can only wish...

280
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,700
for Her Majesty to have peace
and be in good health.

281
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,250
Long live Her Majesty.

282
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,900
Give it to me.

283
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,220
Prince He, what are you doing?

284
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,160
I ask you to hand over
complaints filed against Lord Naerbu.

285
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,200
This is for His Majesty.

286
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,830
It's false accusation.

287
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,960
Don't forget.

288
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,680
The mastermind who framed
Master Sun has been beheaded.

289
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,190
Go away.

290
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,800
Hailan Cha, come in.

291
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,220
Yes.

292
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,150
Curse that Naerbu.

293
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,040
He must be too bold and confident...

294
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,690
to embezzle the money I sent
for disaster relief.

295
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,750
Brother,

296
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,580
Lord Naerbu has always been honest
and clean from corruption.

297
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,810
It must be a false accusation.

298
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,440
Please allow me to have some time
to investigate the case.

299
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,280
False accusation?

300
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,370
The porridge he provided
was as good as plain water.

301
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,450
It caused 185 lives to be lost
and over 500 casualties!

302
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,290
How was that false accusation?

303
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,890
Lord Naerbu is to be
imprisoned immediately.

304
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,960
Have the Ministry of
Justice interrogate him.

305
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,090
Yes.

306
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,870
Your Majesty! Your Majesty.

307
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,830
Lord Naerbu has been imprisoned.

308
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,220
Your Majesty, His Majesty
will not see any guests.

309
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,050
I have urgent matter to
discuss with His Majesty.

310
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,260
Your Majesty, you can't go in.

311
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,010
Your Majesty. Well…

312
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,470
No, you can't do that.

313
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,510
Your Majesty.

314
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,550
Your Majesty, where is your manner?

315
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,220
Your Majesty, my father is innocent!

316
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,120
Refugees destroyed the relief Center.

317
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,100
As for him,

318
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,760
he and other officials failed
to take any actions.

319
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,040
The disorder got out of control,

320
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,450
which ended up with heavy casualties.

321
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,120
The investigators I dispatched...

322
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,670
found there was
merely less than a third...

323
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,600
of the provision sent there recently
left in the warehouse.

324
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,800
Tell me.

325
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,140
Who would have wronged your father?

326
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,580
The refugees, the censors?

327
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,720
Or was it me?

328
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,730
Your Majesty, for over 20 years,

329
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,720
my father has never sought for fame,
promotion or wealth.

330
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,850
He has never failed to live up
to the people's expectation...

331
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,320
nor Your Majesty's.

332
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,890
Three years ago when
Zhili River overflowed,

333
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,700
he stayed to help the locals...

334
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,820
even thought he was
merely passing by the place.

335
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
During the thirty days of hard work,

336
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,550
his boots worn out

337
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,360
and his hair went grey.

338
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,120
At the most critical moment,

339
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,440
he and over 300 officers, along with
the locals went down to the levee breach.

340
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,970
they tried to block the breach
with sandbags.

341
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,080
Why would he risk his life for that?

342
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,640
All because he the only mistake
in his life and career...

343
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,120
was that he bribed Prince Yi for his son.

344
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,080
That was the greatest stain in his life.

345
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,520
He had failed Your Majesty
and the Qing Empire.

346
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,580
So he wished to atone for his mistake
with his very life!

347
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,400
Your Majesty, would a man like him...

348
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,040
embezzle the people's provision?

349
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,490
-My Empress.
-Days ago,

350
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,290
my father came to visit me.

351
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,180
He knew his life would be forfeit today.

352
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,580
So he came to bid me farewell.

353
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,400
But I failed as his daughter.

354
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,910
I refused to see him.

355
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,930
I beg for Your majesty...

356
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,580
to get to the bottom of this, please!

357
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,240
What if the result...

358
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,200
remains the same?

359
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,410
No.

360
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,130
I believe my father will
never do such a thing!

361
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,040
Your Majesty,

362
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,560
I have already lost my mother.

363
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,030
My brother is gone too.

364
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,570
My father is the only kin I have left.

365
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,660
I was once disdained his incompetence...

366
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,180
and his stubbornness.

367
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,970
What I resented the most was his decision.

368
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,560
But blood is thicker than water.

369
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,770
He is my father.

370
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,610
He is my only family.

371
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,520
Your Majesty. I beg of you,

372
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,660
please give him another chance.

373
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,530
Very well.

374
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,320
I promise you.

375
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,400
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

376
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,320
Concubines must not get involved
in state affairs.

377
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,360
But my father's life is at stake.

378
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,940
I was out of line, please forgive me.

379
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,870
You may leave now.

380
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,160
Your Majesty.

381
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,100
Your Majesty,

382
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,810
are you not feeling well?

383
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,230
Your Majesty, be assured.

384
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,460
I will prove Lord Naerbu innocent.

385
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,740
Thank you.

386
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,610
Greetings, Your Majesty.

387
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,540
-Rise.
-His Majesty, glad to see you.

388
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,860
Mother, why are you in a good mood
to trim the plant yourself?

389
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,840
I was bored.

390
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,020
The overgrowing branches are hideous,

391
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,980
I thought I should trim them down.

392
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,560
Mother, you summoned me here...

393
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,010
about Lord Naerbu?

394
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,890
I haven't said a word,

395
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,560
yet you already read my mind.

396
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,460
You have always been against...

397
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,480
the concubines getting involved
in state affairs.

398
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,960
But you allowed you Empress to plea
for your mercy.

399
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,840
Which also means your intuition...

400
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,380
tells you Naerbu is innocent.

401
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,970
The truth shall remain the truth.

402
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,960
Hong Zhou and Ministry of Justice
have investigated many times.

403
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,560
There are evidence that provisions have
secretly taken away...

404
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,790
before they even reached the refugees.

405
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,120
Without enough food,

406
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,560
how can he help the refugees?

407
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,530
Does that make a difference?

408
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,760
Mother, you mean to say...

409
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,360
you disagree with me?

410
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,030
Naerbu has been a loyal officer.

411
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,800
But he lacks the quality of an officer.

412
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,640
There are 126 refugee camps
in Eastern Zhejiang alone.

413
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,520
Yet only the camp he was in charge of
had ran into trouble.

414
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,120
There was an uproar from the refugees.

415
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,850
And he failed to put an end to it.

416
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,920
He allowed the trouble to brew
and get out of hand.

417
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,400
There were heavy casualties among
the refugees.

418
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,530
That made a wave in the imperial court.

419
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,290
If...

420
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,960
we are all as incompetent as him,

421
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,330
the nation of Qing...

422
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,550
will be engulfed in chaos.

423
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,810
Mother,

424
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,360
you mean I should kill Naerbu?

425
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,070
If you don't kill him,

426
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,280
you can't pacify the anger of the people.

427
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,640
You usually...

428
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,460
abstain from meat...

429
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,570
and you recite scripture.

430
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,520
You are so compassionate
you would pardon...

431
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,450
even the handmaidens and eunuchs.

432
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,160
But now...

433
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,000
you are asking me to kill a loyal officer.

434
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,590
You clearly know he is innocent.

435
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:57,050
Mother, may I ask,

436
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,920
why?

437
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,320
Son,

438
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,400
if you don't kill Naerbu,

439
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,190
you will have to investigate
this matter thoroughly.

440
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,989
Then more people
will be caught up in this,

441
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,130
that includes your uncle,

442
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:19,280
your brother, and thousands
officers in disaster relief.

443
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,159
The provision was passed to them,

444
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:29,920
slowly and surely the provision has gone
missing under their supervision.

445
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,659
Mother,

446
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,480
the corruption that involved
various officers of various ranks...

447
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,739
is what caused the issue.

448
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,199
Of course,

449
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,850
they should pay for this.

450
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:53,290
Son, sit down.

451
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,440
These people...

452
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,320
deserve to die for their crimes.

453
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,830
However,

454
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,480
you can't kill them all.

455
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,540
You need to trace the clues
back to each and everyone of them.

456
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,680
You need to be patient with your action.

457
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,440
Haste will get you nowhere in this matter.

458
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,530
If you startle...

459
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,920
Prince Lu or Duke Ping,

460
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,240
you would be making
the imperial family your enemy.

461
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,090
Think about the late Emperor back then.

462
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,640
His brothers opposed him
by joining hands with the imperial family.

463
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,990
All his decrees were undermined
at every corner.

464
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,680
Other than your Thirteenth Uncle,

465
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,440
no one else stood by him.

466
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,530
Even the people loathed him
for being so cruel.

467
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,230
He could only stop
the killing with more killings.

468
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,200
After you ascended to the throne,
you stand on his shoulder...

469
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,390
to build up the reputation of being
merciful and wise.

470
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,080
Do you mean to leave
all the officers in fear...

471
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,280
and suffer betrayals?

472
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,530
Mother,

473
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,850
to protect imperial clans and officials,

474
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,950
I must kill an innocent man?

475
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,360
I told you, he was not innocent,

476
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,760
he was incompetent.

477
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,330
Many people only believe what they see,

478
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,100
and what they managed to hear.

479
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,560
They only understand what they were told.

480
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,330
To them, Naerbu is a corrupt official.

481
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,860
So you should give him death penalty.

482
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,950
That's easy logic.

483
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,720
Mother,

484
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
he is the last kin my Empress has.

485
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,280
If he were someone else,

486
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,930
we could delay his execution.

487
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,490
But it is precisely because
he's Her Majesty's father...

488
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,120
that we must kill him.

489
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,190
Only by killing him...

490
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,050
will the people believe...

491
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,660
Great Qing's laws aren't
bending for personal ties.

492
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,120
So they can believe...

493
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,570
you are fair and just.

494
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:27,040
Your Majesty, you can preserve
the reputation of imperial clans...

495
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,860
at the expense of his life.

496
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
Mother,

497
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,230
if I were to do so,

498
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,890
it will set a bad precedent
to the imperial court.

499
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,480
The corrupted who feed off the people
will become even more ruthless.

500
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,490
-Your Majesty.
-Mother,

501
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,360
I know.

502
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,570
I know you are saying this
for the good of this nation.

503
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,830
But I as the Emperor...

504
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,600
need to think it through.

505
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,050
Empress Dowager,

506
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,730
why do you insist on it?

507
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,950
That upsets His Majesty.

508
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,820
If Her Majesty finds out,

509
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,030
she will be dismayed.

510
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,400
Now,

511
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,560
there are constant skirmishes
at the borders.

512
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,170
Many areas are struck by disasters.

513
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,480
If His Majesty kills Naerbu,

514
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,760
others will praise him for being decisive.

515
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,490
But if he is to punish officers
of all the ranks,

516
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:55,600
the imperial clans will
blame him for being too cruel.

517
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,920
The people will doubt the integrity
of our government.

518
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,750
The two outcomes are the exact
opposite of each other.

519
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,240
Empress Dowager,

520
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,170
His Majesty will make up his mind.

521
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,630
I hope so.

522
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,910
Your Majesty, His Majesty
said he won't see you.

523
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,400
The guards are here too.

524
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,470
I really can't let you barge in again.

525
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,550
Even if you keep waiting,

526
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,490
it won't help with anything.

527
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,330
I will wait here until His Majesty
agreed to see me.

528
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,130
Your Majesty, please don't make it
difficult for me.

529
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,070
The wind is strong out here.
If Your Majesty caught a cold,

530
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,040
they would have my head for it.

531
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,580
Your Majesty, what are you doing?

532
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,670
I will stand up...

533
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,010
when His Majesty sees me.

534
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,460
Miss Zhen, please persuade
Her Majesty for me.

535
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,750
Her Majesty won't change her mind.

536
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,480
Your Majesty,

537
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:11,050
more complaints filed against Lord Naerbu.

538
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,590
All of them...

539
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,460
are requesting for me to execute Naerbu?

540
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,240
Li Yu.

541
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,590
Yes.

542
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,100
Servants!

543
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,140
It is a stack of complaints...

544
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,160
from the people of Easter Zhejiang,
stating their request to execute Naerbu.

545
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,290
Hailan Cha, if you were in my position,

546
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,140
what would you do?

547
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,360
I don't dare to speak.

548
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,820
You may speak.

549
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,410
If I were to handle this matter,

550
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,100
I would kill Naerbu without hesitation.

551
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,310
Hailan Cha,

552
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,530
you are honest and frank.

553
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,320
What made you say so?

554
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,750
Your Majesty, killing him can appease
the anger of the people.

555
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,170
But killing a group of officers
will bring an uprising.

556
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,590
It's never too late to deal with
the imbeciles.

557
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,880
But Naerbu must be killed right now.

558
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,120
Your Majesty, Her Majesty is
kneeling outside the hall.

559
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,930
She refuses to leave.

560
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,440
Your Majesty,

561
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:01,010
His Majesty is met with
a difficult circumstance.

562
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,930
Please don't make it harder for him.

563
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,870
Your Majesty, His Majesty is now asleep.

564
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,420
Are you going to keep kneeling here?

565
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,810
Your Majesty, His Majesty is asleep.

566
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,810
He wants you to return.

567
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,510
Your Majesty, Her Majesty is persistent.

568
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,030
She won't leave.

569
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,470
Your Majesty should get some rest,

570
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,820
there is a morning court tomorrow.

571
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,720
Your Majesty,

572
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,870
only very little provision was passed to
my father from the higher-ups.

573
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:24,400
There was barely anything left
when my father go the provision.

574
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,540
You have been kneeling all night.

575
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,130
Should I see this as a threat? My Empress?
