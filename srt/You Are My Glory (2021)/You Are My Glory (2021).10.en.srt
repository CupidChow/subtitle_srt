Mr. Yu.

You should eat first.

00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:30,019

00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:55,579
and remembered)

24
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,698
(your classmate that day

25
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:58,258
was Qiao Jingjing.)

Don't know when I'll be back.)

31
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:30,498
Why didn't you invite me for lunch?

32
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:33,698
I saw you doze off at your desk,

33
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,019
so I didn't call you.

34
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:35,698
I brought you some food.

35
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:37,258
Let's eat outside
and get us some fresh air.

36
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,579
I'm getting older,
not like I used to be.

37
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,739
I don't know what's come over me,

38
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:46,618
dozing off a lot lately.

39
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,698
Why didn't you order noodles?

40
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:50,099
You're not having noodles here in Xi'an?

41
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:51,739
We have oily noodles, saozi noodles.

42
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:52,579
They're delicious.

43
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:54,698
You don't know when to eat them.

44
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:56,259
Noodles stick together easily.

45
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:57,699
You're particular.

46
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:00,579
By the way,

47
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:02,218
I received a message

48
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:03,539
right when I came out.

49
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:05,579
The ESA's Tycho Brahe

50
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,419
was also affected by the solar wind.

51
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,058
Their situation is worse than ours.

52
00:04:09,058 --> 00:04:11,019
They announced
that they gave up on saving it.

53
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,299
The Brahe?

54
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:16,378
The one they launched last year?

55
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:18,498
They said

56
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:20,218
its power supply had got hit hard,

57
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:21,338
so it's hopeless.

58
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,179
JX has only been out
for more than a year.

59
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:29,378
It's supposed to last five years.

60
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:31,179
It hasn't completed its mission.

61
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:35,618
So many stars are yet to be seen.

62
00:04:38,498 --> 00:04:39,058
My,

63
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:40,459
you sound artsy all of a sudden.

64
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:41,898
Let me correct you.

65
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:44,338
JX is to observe the earth.

66
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:46,859
It's a quote from Jade Rabbit's Weibo.

67
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:48,778
Someone told me that.

68
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,179
You didn't take a hint, did you?

69
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:57,179
Look on the bright side.

70
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,419
JX will not end up like Brahe.

71
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:01,739
At least we have

72
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:03,139
successfully established

73
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,299
solar orientation regular recharge.

74
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,338
These past few days,

75
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:07,579
every step in the way,

76
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,139
it's been suspenseful.

77
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,658
We figured out

78
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:11,459
that our attitude orbit control

79
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:13,179
may have abnormalities,

80
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:13,898
but we did not expect

81
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:15,498
the main interface to be broken too.

82
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:28,218
By the way,

83
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:30,098
currently, the earth-oriented

84
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:30,979
attitude maneuver

85
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:32,378
can only be implemented by the backup.

86
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:34,218
We still have to optimize

87
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:35,338
the implementation strategy.

88
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:37,058
I have to go back.

89
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:41,139
You haven't finished your lunch.

90
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:42,618
I have.

91
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:44,299
What a workaholic.

92
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,919
(Two days later)

93
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:06,138
Attention, all units.

94
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:07,378
The Jiamusi Station reports

95
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:08,899
that the satellite will make entry
in one minute.

96
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,519
Let's hope nothing goes wrong.

97
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,079
Attention, all units.

98
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,240
The Jiamusi Station reports

99
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,519
(that the satellite has made entry.

100
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,559
According to telemetry data,

101
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:41,718
all systems are working normally

102
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:43,398
and it is conditioned
for attitude maneuvering.

103
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:45,478
As planned,

104
00:06:45,798 --> 00:06:47,679
send the Satellite-to-Earth
Orientation Command Sequence

105
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:48,639
right away.

106
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,759
The satellite has entered
earth orientation mode.

107
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,519
Attitude normal.

108
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,039
All system parameters normal.

109
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:40,998
It is now conditioned

110
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:42,159
for on-orbit missions.

111
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,159
Thank you for rescuing

112
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,680
this satellite with us.

113
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,799
We'd like these young people

114
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
to get some rest.

115
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,000
They haven't slept much lately.

116
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,640
Mr. Hu.

117
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,760
I'm impressed

118
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,760
by your younger members.

119
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,279
The same goes for your unit.

120
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,320
They're all fine young people.

121
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:18,520
Dedicated, persistent,
and full of ideas.

122
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
You've been out for a month.

123
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,000
You're as sharp as ever.

124
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,760
You're still thinking one step ahead.

125
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,081
You deserve praise too.

126
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,880
Mr. Guan,

127
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,161
your orbit simulation
calculation capability

128
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:00,760
is also very amazing.

129
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,880
Even Mr. Li was about
to poach you on the spot.

130
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:04,641
Good news

131
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:06,680
it can put Mr. Hu on edge.

132
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,200
But the lifespan of the satellite

133
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,841
has still been affected.

134
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:20,281
Still, it could exceed
its planned lifespan.

135
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:22,880
Should be way more than that.

136
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:25,081
It's already very lucky

137
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,401
to be rescued.

138
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,680
This satellite is the first model

139
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,800
you participated

140
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,120
in the design

141
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,200
It was the first time
we worked together.

142
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,841
Do you know how I felt

143
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:40,200
when I first met you?

144
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:45,281
You were jealous?

145
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:47,120
It was quite obvious.

146
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:47,921
Nah.

147
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,240
When I first met you,

148
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,000
I thought

149
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:54,001
you were keeping up appearances.

150
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,840
It didn't take long

151
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,800
before you gave me

152
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,320
a detailed plan
of the information flow interface.

153
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:01,001
So I thought,

154
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,560
your talent was as good as your looks,

155
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,161
so we'd make a good couple.

156
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,840
Watch your words.

157
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,921
You're making us
engineering students turn red,

158
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:11,921
okay?

159
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,521
Shall we...

160
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,560
talk about money?

161
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:27,480
Did the professor tell you?

162
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,361
When Mr. Zhang called me,

163
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,401
He wished I could beat around the bush.

164
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:35,720
Are you facing any difficulties?

165
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:38,041
Or...

166
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:39,401
is it about your family?

167
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:40,840
By the way,

168
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,001
I remember

169
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:43,521
after you answered a call
from your family,

170
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:45,560
something was up with you
the next day.

171
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:49,560
No, not at all.

172
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,720
I was just flustered.

173
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,200
Glad to hear that.

174
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,480
I'm a little curious.

175
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,401
Are investment banks really profitable?

176
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,560
You earned over a million
upon graduation.

177
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,600
Really?

178
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,641
Well...

179
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:10,480
It depends on the situation.

180
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
Before the 2008 financial crisis,

181
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,401
someone could achieve it.

182
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,361
By the time I graduated,

183
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:18,241
the crisis was abating.

184
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
It wasn't too bad.

185
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:22,401
If I were in Google,

186
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:23,800
I'd earn huge paychecks.

187
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:25,761
Rather than Google,

188
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:27,200
how about NASA?

189
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:30,200
But we're merely foreigners there.

190
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:31,761
We'll probably

191
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:33,600
never have access to their core tech.

192
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,401
Do you know

193
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:41,001
why I never urged you to stay?

194
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,521
Because I never thought

195
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:46,641
you'd leave.

196
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,200
I thought we're two peas in a pod.

197
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,401
Just like my wife said,

198
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,001
simply put,

199
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:57,361
it was untimely.

200
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:00,881
I also made a bet with my folks

201
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:02,241
that if you really leave,

202
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:03,840
I will change my name

203
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,881
to Pigpen Guan.

204
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,521
Wouldn't that be a reunion?

205
00:12:11,241 --> 00:12:12,680
We're all siblings, right?

206
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Shut up.

207
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,401
Aren't you and I brothers?

208
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,121
Can I ask you something, Yu Tu?

209
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:24,281
About the satellite failure,

210
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,521
no one could tell what caused it.

211
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,480
We solved it in five days.

212
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,960
Some cases took us

213
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,761
months to solve.

214
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,761
If it really takes months,

215
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:36,800
will your investment bank wait?

216
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,200
Or...

217
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,680
Will you run away

218
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,840
and abandon us?

219
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,840
It's almost 5 am.

220
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,921
Shen Jing should be up by now.

221
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,641
By the way.

222
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:08,361
How's it going

223
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,161
between both of you?

224
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:12,921
Nothing.

225
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,521
She has a junior

226
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:17,800
whom she'd like to introduce to you.

227
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:20,200
Last time she saw

228
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,361
our group photo

229
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:23,800
and asked if you have a girlfriend.

230
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:26,361
You're so good-looking,

231
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:27,881
so you stand a good chance.

232
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,440
But it took Shen Jing

233
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,960
a lot of effort to court me.

234
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:38,521
Turn her down for me.

235
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
You really don't need one?

236
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,320
But I met her.

237
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,521
She's quite pretty.

238
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,080
Please, no.

239
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,560
Recently...

240
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,881
I met

241
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,560
a girl.

242
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,921
She's quite clever,

243
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,761
a little mischievous,

244
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:27,761
and receptive.

245
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,560
That's great.

246
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,281
You met her on vacation?

247
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,440
No.

248
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,121
We're from the same high school.

249
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:35,401
From the same high school?

250
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:37,080
Why are you dating with her only now?

251
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:40,361
Back then,

252
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,080
I had poor judgment.

253
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,680
So I didn't date her.

254
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,080
You're kidding me.

255
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,440
Is it because she doesn't like you?

256
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,361
But I don't think so.

257
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,200
You still got it.

258
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,080
It's locked.

259
00:15:29,881 --> 00:15:31,080
Not a soul in sight.

260
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:32,600
Maybe they're busy.

261
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:34,001
Just keep waiting.

262
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,281
In ten minutes,

263
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:41,560
Shen Jing should be up from bed.

264
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,521
Then we'll call her,

265
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:44,521
tell her I'm safe,

266
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:45,720
so we don't have to go in.

267
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,921
Otherwise, once it gets warmer,

268
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:48,320
I'll go out like a light.

269
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,881
Let's rest here for now.

270
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,641
(Yu Tu.)

271
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,361
(I hope)

272
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:19,761
(you'll reconsider your resignation.)

273
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,041
(You belong to aerospace.)

274
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,600
(Luckily, I'm fine.)

275
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:50,241
(Otherwise, we'll end up spending)

276
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:51,720
(what's left of our savings.)

277
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,641
(At times like this,)

278
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:55,440
(I think)

279
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,080
(our son doesn't need
to be a high achiever.)

280
00:16:57,241 --> 00:16:58,401
(He might as well find a job)

281
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:00,080
(in our little hometown)

282
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,401
(or dabble in finance.)

283
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,800
(At least he'll have some free time.)

284
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:10,840
(Can I ask you something, Yu Tu?)

285
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,881
(If it really takes months,)

286
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,560
(will your investment bank wait?)

287
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,480
(Or...)

288
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,600
(will you run away)

289
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:19,921
(and abandon us?)

290
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,041
(Yu Tu.)

291
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:27,680
(I'm so disappointed at you.)

292
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:33,921
(Do you know why)

293
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:35,440
(I never urged you to stay?)

294
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,921
(Because I never thought)

295
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:38,881
(you'd leave.)

296
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:44,401
I wish more than anyone else

297
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:45,001
for you to remain

298
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:46,121
an aerospace designer.

299
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:17,141
(Qiao Jingjing)

300
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:21,141
(To Qiao Jingjing: I'm off to a business trip.
Don't know when I'll be back.)

301
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,081
You can call Shen Jing now.

302
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,321
Easy there.

303
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,641
You should take it easy a few days

304
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:56,641
before you return to Shanghai.

305
00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:00,480
I'll have to go back sooner or later.

306
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:03,680
I'm getting homesick.

307
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:09,601
Once I'm there,

308
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,520
I'll head straight home.

309
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,040
You should go home and rest too.

310
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:16,641
You don't have to take me

311
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:18,601
to hospital in Shanghai.

312
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,760
No.

313
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,321
I'll speak to her

314
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:24,801
alone.

315
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:31,081
So...

316
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,921
I will take you downstairs.

317
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:10,141
(Shen Jing)

318
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:14,981
(Yu Tu, tell me what you like to eat.
Even Guan Zai has no idea.)

319
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:16,141
(Anything will do. Thanks for asking.)

320
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:16,734
(I shouldn't count on engineers
like you for advice.)

321
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:18,161
She asked me yesterday,

322
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:19,480
when I'd be home.

323
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:22,280
I didn't reply.

324
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:26,361
What should I tell her?

325
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,601
I promised her last year

326
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:31,200
that I'd take her,

327
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,081
and our son out this year.

328
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,680
I reneged twice.

329
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,960
I was thinking

330
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:42,641
of taking them out by year end.

331
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:44,000
I fibbed.

332
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:48,641
What should I say?

333
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,801
Get me my medical records

334
00:21:57,121 --> 00:21:58,680
and examination report.

335
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,881
I'll take them to hospital myself.

336
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:03,321
Bear this in mind.

337
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,121
If I hadn't sensed something wrong,

338
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,161
and pressed the doctor for answers.

339
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:15,561
You wouldn't have

340
00:22:15,561 --> 00:22:17,121
planned to tell me?

341
00:22:22,361 --> 00:22:23,480
I...

342

Mengmeng,

350
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,561
it's breakfast time.

351
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:29,040
Mom, have you figured out

352
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,280
how to solve this additional problem?

353
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,200
Wei Wei said,

354
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,960
her dad came up with two solutions.

355
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,480
Your phone.

356
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:36,641
Now eat.

357
00:24:38,921 --> 00:24:40,200
Have you figured it out?

358
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:44,641
What grade are you?

359
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,321
Can a math problem be so hard?

360
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,601
My teacher said
it was an additional problem.

361
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:51,000
Take it or leave it.

362
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,601
But it'll be a shame to leave it.

363
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,801
So...

364
00:24:57,841 --> 00:24:59,641
You haven't figured it out, have you?

365
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,841
You're not as good as dad.

366
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:03,401
He'd know.

367
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:05,361
Is this your homework

368
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:06,601
or mine?

369
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
My teacher said

370
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,801
we could ask our parents.

371
00:25:10,121 --> 00:25:11,161
Maybe,

372
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:13,000
The teacher wanted to test the parents' IQ.

373
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:14,921
Mom,

374
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:16,361
are you a little slow up there?

375
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:19,401
Then I inherited it from you.

376
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,280
Only very few people are as smart

377
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,801
as your father.

378
00:25:23,801 --> 00:25:24,520
I am only of

379
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,480
average IQ.

380
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,161
I'm not slow or anything.

381
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,801
I'm not so sure about that.

382
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:30,801
Remember Uncle Yu

383
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:32,121
who dropped by for dinner?

384
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:33,361
I had one question I couldn't answer,

385
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
but he managed to answer it

386
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,601
at just one glance.

387
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,161
Uncle Yu

388
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,841
graduated from Tsinghua.

389
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:40,520
He's awesome enough

390
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
to earn two degrees.

391
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,841
That puts him

392
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,561
in the same league as your dad.

393
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:50,081
Coming.

394
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,161
Who is it so early in the morning?

395
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:51,960
Eat up.

396
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,321
Your savior is here.

397
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:11,520
There are two kinds.

398
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:14,000
Dad, write another,

399
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,401
and I'll be the first in my class.

400
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:17,401
Wait till you see.

401
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:25,921
Plus four...

402
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:27,841
Multiply by...

403
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:30,321
Done.

404
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,680
I'm the first in my class!

405
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:34,000
But I'll hold it back

406
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,280
from my class for now.

407
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,680
Then I'll show them tomorrow.

408
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:38,801
No one can surpass me by then.

409
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,321
I wonder who he inherited
his wit from.

410
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,321
All right.

411
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:44,520
You should pack up

412
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,760
and head for hobby class.

413
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,720
I'll pick you up at noon

414
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,760
and we'll have delicious lunch.

415
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:50,081
I don't want to go to hobby class.

416
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:51,960
It's not every Sunday
that dad is home.

417
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:53,240
I want to be with him.

418
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,601
You have no class in the afternoon.

419
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,641
You'll have time to be with him.

420
00:26:57,641 --> 00:26:59,040
Hurry up and get changed.

421
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:00,680
I'm not so sure about that.

422
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:02,601
You know how elusive dad is.

423
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,561
I'm afraid he'll disappear

424
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,601
by afternoon.

425
00:27:06,161 --> 00:27:07,321
Then ask your dad,

426
00:27:08,121 --> 00:27:09,121
"Will you wander away?"

427
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
I'm home now.

428
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:19,561
No business trips.

429
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:42,361
Hello?

430
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:43,960
What you asked me this morning,

431
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,200
Kings got back to me.

432
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,601
The match

433
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:47,960
will use today's updated version.

434
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,720
There could be new heroes.

435
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,361
So can I try out one of them?

436
00:27:53,561 --> 00:27:54,960
Some adjustment may be made
to the items for heroes.

437
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:56,841
Sorry for the trouble.

438
00:27:57,081 --> 00:27:59,321
About a month ago,
you were a newbie at this.

439
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:01,280
And now, you're an expert.

440
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,161
You even took notice of details

441
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:04,841
like what version to use.

442
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:06,240
Well?

443
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:07,280
Any idea?

444
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:08,960
In e-sports,

445
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
I could be wrong,

446
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:12,240
but there can't possibly be
any shoo-ins.

447
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,881
Even pros will lose.

448
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:14,881
And I'm no exception.

449
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,720
The least I can do

450
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,601
is to show

451
00:28:17,601 --> 00:28:18,480
the very best of me.

452
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,520
I think

453
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,280
you shouldn't push yourself too hard.

454
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,000
Besides,

455
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,921
I think you're doing

456
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:24,081
really great at it.

457
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:24,601
Look at you.

458
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:25,720

459
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,520

not teaching you lately?

463
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,601
I can climb the ranks myself,

464
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:39,000

467
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:45,081
Okay.

468
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:46,440
