00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,839
They are probably at

175
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,879
the measurement and control hall now.

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,319
But, don't ask me

177
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,639
what is the difference between
these two halls.

178
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,519
I don't know the answer.

179
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,759
I'm only an actress.

180
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,680
In this hall,

181
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,240
from the space probe team,

182
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,079
only the chief engineer and
the deputy chief engineer will be here.

183
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,639
So, in a while,

184
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,759
Yu

185
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,559
and Hu will be here.

186
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,840
Also,

187
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,519
they will also

188
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,440
announce their success here.

189
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,320
Of course, Professor Zhao
has more experience in this.

190
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,240
Right.

191
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,320
Back then,

192
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,200
I went to Jiuquan Launch Site.

193
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,799
It was more than ten years ago.

194
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,440
The facilities there

195
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,720
weren't as good as what Wenchang has.

196
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,960
Being an aerospace engineer

197
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,360
is not an easy job.

198
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,919
They stayed there for
a few months every time.

199
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,519
At that time, we didn't have
developed communication system.

200
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,600
We could only speak on the phone

201
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,200
no more than a few times in one month.

202
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,639
Yu Tu stayed in Hainan

203
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,080
for more than half a year too.

204
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes.

205
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:09,679
They are doing this

206
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,679
to contribute

207
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,519
to the national aerospace development.

208
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,399
Fortunately,

209
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,480
things have gotten better now.

210
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,200
Otherwise,

211
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,399
I need to work harder

212
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,879
so that I can work together
with my wife,

213
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,879
and go on work trips together.

214
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't think I can take it

215
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,720
if I am only allowed to call her

216
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,159
a few times in a month.

217
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,080
Zhang,

218
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,120
does it mean that

219
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,000
we can't see the launch
of the rocket from here?

220
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,600
You can watch it from here.

221
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,480
You can either

222
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,559
watch it on the screen here,

223
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,639
or go downstairs

224
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,039
to watch it from the launch site.

225
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,559
Such a tough decision to make.

226
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,039
I get to see my wife here.

227
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,679
But, if I go downstairs,

228
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,440
I get to see the rocket launch live.

229
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,360
Of course, we have to leave them here,

230
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,000
and go watch the rocket launch.

231
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,360
Yes.

232
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,600
They're here.

233
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,320
They

234
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,679
must be really nervous now.

235
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,080
Of course, they are nervous.

236
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,320
Even I felt nervous

237
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,480
when I saw the rocket on the way here.

238
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,960
This time,

239
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,519
they are receiving a lot of attention.

240
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,720
This is our country's first

241
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,039
Solar System Boundary Explorer.

242
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,080
It's receiving

243
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,360
a lot of global attention too.

244
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,919
Exactly.

245
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,879
Family members.

246
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,399
We are very sorry to inform you that,

247
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,639
due to some issues,

248
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,639
we might not be able to

249
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,279
watch the rocket launch here.

250
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,480
We will arrange for you

251
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,720
to go downstairs
to witness the rocket launch.

252
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,600
Is that okay?

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
Sure.

254
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,639
Okay. Thanks.

255
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,960
This way.

256
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,960
This is not a bad thing.

257
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,480
At least, we don't have to decide

258
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,759
whether to stay here,

259
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,200
or go downstairs.

260
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,480
Let's go to find a good spot.

261
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,039
Let's go.

262
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,080
Okay. Let's go.

263
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,879
Let's go.

264
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,399
This is good.

265
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,480
When I'm finally ready,

266
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
they may have already
built the moon base.

267
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,879
Then, the moon will be
my starting point,

268
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,759
as I conquer Mars

269
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,639
and escape the Solar System.

270

What do you want to do
when you grow up?

275
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,440
I don't know.

276
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,120
How about you?

277
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:17,960
I don't know either.

278
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,320
I have too many ideas.

279
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,000
But, I believe

280
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,799
Yu Tu will definitely become

281
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,480
an excellent aerospace engineer.

282
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,519
Why?

283
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,960
Because he likes it.

284
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,440
(We don't need another 40 years)

Great.

378
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:39,160
We have accomplished our mission.

379
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,281
Good luck with the space probe.

380
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,321
Thanks for your hard work.

381
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,961
The rocket was launched really nicely.

382
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:45,801
This has set off to a good start.

383
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:46,880
I can finally

384
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,281
have a good night's sleep

385
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:49,761
tonight.

386
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:51,281
Well done!

387
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:01,040
I don't understand this.

388
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,081
So, have they succeeded?

389
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,441
Yes, they have successfully
launched the rocket.

390
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:06,800
But, Search for God hasn't yet.

391
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,081
Nonetheless,

392
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,641
it has set off to a good start.

00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:57,617
Great.

397
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:10,802
Our honorable leaders,

398
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:11,682
experts,

399
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:13,202
and colleagues.

400

(The destination of our expedition
is the galaxy)

401
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:15,841
According to the bulletin

402
00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:19,401
from Aerospace Control Center
in Beijing,

403

407
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:33,321
The nuclear reactor
has been deployed successfully.

408
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:35,242
I hereby

409
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:36,482
announce that

410
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:39,121
(China Haijiao Launch Center)
the launching of Search of God

411
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:40,921
is a complete success.

412
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:41,401
Great.

413
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:42,321
That's great.

414
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:44,121
Great.

415
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:49,989
(The destination of our expedition
is the galaxy)

416
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:51,202
On behalf

417
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:54,641
of Haijiao Launch Center,

418
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:56,762
I wish to

419
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:59,601
express my sincerest congratulations

420
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:01,601
to all the departments and researchers

421
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:03,601
that are involved in this project.

422
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:05,841
The rocket launch event

423
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:07,841
will end here.

424
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:08,881
Thanks, everyone.

425
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:12,722
Yes.

426
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:37,569
(Congratulations)

427
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,629
(on the successful launch
of Search for God)

428
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:55,281
Do we look silly?

429
00:21:55,801 --> 00:21:57,001
We're too happy.

430
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:57,761
Precisely.

431
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:00,721
Everyone else has left.

432
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,842
We should get going too.

433
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:04,602
Wait a minute.

434
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:05,721
There will be an interview later.

435
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,202
Let's stay for that interview.

436
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:16,241
At this moment,

437
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:17,521
the hall is filled

438
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:18,882
with a totally jubilant atmosphere.

439
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,642
Everyone is celebrating

440
00:22:20,642 --> 00:22:22,321
the successful launch of Search for God.

441
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:23,402
We are also very honored

442
00:22:23,402 --> 00:22:25,202
to be able to interview

443
00:22:25,202 --> 00:22:26,041
the deputy chief engineer
of Search for God.

444
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,241
It's Hu.

445
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:28,402
Hu.

446
00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:29,402
Li, take a look.

447
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:29,882
It's Hu.

448
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,081
I'm overwhelmed.

449
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:31,801
After ten years of hard work,

450
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:33,442
Search for God

451
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:35,281
has finally embarked on its expedition.

452
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:36,642
The rocket launch

453
00:22:36,642 --> 00:22:37,721
was also flawless.

454
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:39,081
The navigation of the space probe
was highly accurate.

455
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:40,122
(The launch of Search for God)
This has ensured an ideal environment

456
00:22:40,122 --> 00:22:41,162
(is a success)
for our space probe

457
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:42,682
to carry out its following job.

458
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:45,882
I notice that
you mentioned expedition.

459
00:22:45,882 --> 00:22:47,122
You kept emphasizing this

460
00:22:47,122 --> 00:22:48,481
during the live-stream too.

461
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:49,882
So, Search for God's work

462
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:51,402
will only start

463
00:22:51,402 --> 00:22:52,442
after the launch, right?

464
00:22:52,442 --> 00:22:53,041
Exactly.

465
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,241
For a Solar System Boundary Explorer,

466
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:58,041
a successful launch is only the beginning
of Search for God's work.

467
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,642
It still has a long way to go.

468
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:01,442
We will have many challenges
in the future.

469
00:23:01,442 --> 00:23:02,561
(Congratulations on the successful launch)
Search for God

470
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:03,481
(of Search for God)
has the farthest destination

471
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:05,202
compared to our nation's
other space probes.

472
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:06,682
What's so special about it?

473
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:08,481
Search for God

474
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:10,362
is set to explore the boundary
of the Solar System.

475
00:23:10,362 --> 00:23:11,001
Compared to

476
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:12,642
the exploration of the moon and Mars,

477
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,081
it has to go further.

478
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:15,402
Hence, it will be

479
00:23:15,402 --> 00:23:16,561
in a more complex environment.

480
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,281
When

481
00:23:17,281 --> 00:23:18,842
we were developing it,

482
00:23:18,842 --> 00:23:20,721
we were faced with
more challenging technical issues.

483
00:23:21,362 --> 00:23:22,521
Has Search for God experienced

484
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:24,281
any technological breakthrough?

485
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:24,922
Can you

486
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:26,321
briefly tell us about it?

487
00:23:26,962 --> 00:23:27,882
For example,

488
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:28,481
for the propulsion system

489
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:30,241
of Search for God,

490
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:31,281
we spent two years

491
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:32,801
researching key technologies

492
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:33,922
and eventually developed

493
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:35,202
the nuclear reactor

494
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:35,842
which later replaced

495
00:23:35,842 --> 00:23:37,402
the conventional solar panel.

496
00:23:37,882 --> 00:23:39,402
(The launch of Search for God is a success)
Thanks for your time.

497
00:23:39,402 --> 00:23:41,001
Let us also wish that

498
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:41,801
Search for God

499
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:42,962
can bring humankind's dream

500
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:44,801
to a further place.

501
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:47,041
Mr. Hu is much more handsome
than usual.

502
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:48,281
This is probably the charm

503
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:49,761
that comes with his profession.

504
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:51,842
Jingjing.

505
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:52,362
Why didn't Mr. Yu

506
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:53,761
take any interviews?

507
00:23:54,882 --> 00:23:56,602
I guess the reporter only interviewed

508
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,801
the person she found good-looking.

509
00:23:58,202 --> 00:23:59,882
No one can beat Mr. Yu.

510
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:00,561
Exactly.

511
00:24:02,922 --> 00:24:04,241
Why don't

512
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:04,922
we wait for them,

513
00:24:04,922 --> 00:24:05,882
so that we can leave together?

514
00:24:05,882 --> 00:24:06,721
Sure.

515
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:08,602
When are they coming out?

516
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:09,721
I've no idea.

517
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:11,081
I'll have to wait for her anyway.

518
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:12,481
Can you sleep tonight?

519
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:14,081
No, I can't.

520
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:14,481
We should stay here

521
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:15,801
and keep each other company.

522
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:16,761
Exactly.

523
00:24:17,442 --> 00:24:18,162
Mr. Zhang,

524
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:19,561
can we wait here?

525
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:20,402
Sure.

526
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:21,122
But,

527
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:22,281
please don't go anywhere else.

528
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:23,241
We won't.

529
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:23,801
We won't.

530
00:24:23,801 --> 00:24:25,041
Good.

531
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:31,801
They're here.

532
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:34,362
They must be from
the launch vehicle team.

533
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:36,362
The space probe team will leave later.

534
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:41,122
My wife is here.

535
00:24:41,122 --> 00:24:42,001
Guys, I'll get going.

536
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:43,561
Bye.

537
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:52,721
Here.

538
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:53,561
Here.

539
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:54,442
Bye.

540
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,442
Mr. Xiao.

541
00:24:58,001 --> 00:24:59,041
You...

542
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:01,402
Why are you still here?

543
00:25:02,922 --> 00:25:03,882
Jingjing.

544
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:05,561
This must be your idea, right?

545
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:06,402
Yes.

546
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:09,041
You and your husband are the same.

547
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:10,721
You are

548
00:25:10,721 --> 00:25:11,842
not only creative,

549
00:25:11,842 --> 00:25:12,922
but also quick-witted.

550
00:25:14,761 --> 00:25:17,162
Yu Tu will take a while more.

551
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:18,202
But, the rocket launch

552
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:19,682
was flawless.

553
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:20,922
So he won't stay too late.

554
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:21,922
I'll wait for him.

555
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:22,842
Okay.

556
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:23,882
Then,

557
00:25:23,882 --> 00:25:24,962
we'll get going.

558
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:25,882
Sure.

559
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,122
Okay. Bye.

560
00:25:27,122 --> 00:25:28,122
Bye, Mr. Xiao.

561
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:29,081
Bye.

562
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:30,162
Bye, Mr. Xiao.

563
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:30,682
I will

564
00:25:30,682 --> 00:25:31,561
send Mr. Xiao off.

565
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:32,162
I've to go.

566
00:25:32,162 --> 00:25:33,882
Thanks for the hospitality.

567
00:25:37,081 --> 00:25:38,122
My husband is here.

568
00:25:38,122 --> 00:25:38,962
My husband is here too.

569
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:40,321
Bye!

570
00:25:42,962 --> 00:25:44,202
My husband is here.

571
00:25:44,202 --> 00:25:45,122
I've got to go.

572
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:45,481
Sure.

573
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:46,786
Bye.

574
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:48,682
My husband is here too.

575
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:50,081
We'll get going. Bye.

576
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,241
There are only both of us left.

577
00:25:59,081 --> 00:26:00,602
Hu, over here.

578
00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:02,362
Your wife is there.

579
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,321
- Well done.
- You too.

580
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:04,481
- Take a good rest.
- I've got to go.

581
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:05,842
No worry.

582
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:07,361
Come on.

583
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,160
Are you waiting for me?

584
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,920
Who else?

585
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:23,081
Where's Yu Tu?

586
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,160
Why is he not here yet?

587
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,321
We left together.

588
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:26,601
Someone stopped him on the way.

589
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:27,841
I think he'll be here soon.

590
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,521
We'll keep you company

591
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:35,881
as you wait for him.

592
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:36,841
Please don't.

593
00:26:36,841 --> 00:26:37,801
Don't interrupt

594
00:26:37,801 --> 00:26:39,361
Mr. Yu and I.

595
00:26:47,321 --> 00:26:48,121
Hu,

596
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:49,321
Yu Tu told me that

597
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:50,081
you had done several drafts

598
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:51,321
of your apology letter.

599
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,081
Are you done yet?

600
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:00,281
You don't have to apologize.

601
00:27:02,361 --> 00:27:03,641
It was neither of our faults.

602
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,920
Give me some more time
to think about it.

603
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,801
We'll talk at home.

604
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:13,000
Sure.

605
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,400
I think Yu Tu is here.

606
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,480
You go ahead.

607
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,361
Don't be the third wheel.

608
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:40,440
Go.

609
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:41,960
Go.

610
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,760
Is he going to call me?

611
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:31,521
He's so mean.

612
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,240
He was not calling me.

613
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:43,400
There will be a lot of challenges

614
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,680
for Search for God in the future.

615
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,321
But, up till now,

616
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,601
I've lived up to your expectations.

617

620
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:21,321
Did you see it?

621
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:25,200
Yes, I saw it.

622
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:28,801
Congratulations

623
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,000
on the launch.

624
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Jingjing,

625
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:40,841
when they announced that
the launch was a success,

626
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:42,281
everyone else was applauding.

627
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:44,521
At that time, I recalled

628
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:45,641
what you told me

629
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,240
a long time ago.

630
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,920

I finally can

634
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,641
see more stars.

635
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:05,480
Thank you.

636
