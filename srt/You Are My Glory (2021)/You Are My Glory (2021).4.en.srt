14
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,680
I'll pick the items

15
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,079
set by the system.

16
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,959
I pick whatever shows up

17
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,879
on the left side.

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,000
I know.

19
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,439
Mage's items

20
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,519
are usually very conventional.

21
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,120
Take Wang Zhaojun for an example.

22
00:01:59,359 --> 00:01:59,680
If

23
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,920
your opponent is playing as Cai Wenji,

24
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,439
you may buy the Nightmare Fang

25
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,719
based on the situation.

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,760
What for?

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,159
To suppress health regeneration.

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,560
Also,

29
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,040
there is an issue

30
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,400
you should know.

31
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:13,760
What is it?

32
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,439
When you play as Support,

33
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,079
don't upgrade to Tier Three
Support Item.

34
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:23,080
What is Tier Three Support Item?

35
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,960
Who taught you how to play?

36
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,159
You said you were a beginner.

37
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,719
How do you know so much about it?

38
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:32,840
You don't need research.

39
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,159
I learned about it by playing a few matches.

40
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,080
These are the basics.

41
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,080
It's getting late.

42
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,439
I'll see you off here.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,319
See you tomorrow.

44
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,199
Come over tomorrow at 9 am.

45
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,879
As you know,

46
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,520
it's not easy for me to go out.

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,400
Sure.

48
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,879
See you.

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,879
Bye.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,159
Xiao Zhu!

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,039
One of my teenage dreams

52
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,680
just came true.

53
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,800
What was it?

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,599
The genius taught me maths!

55
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,120
Hello?

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,039
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

57
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:35,840
How was it?

58
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,800
Is Jingjing back yet?

59
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,879
Did he agree?

60
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,520
He did,

61
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,520
but...

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,800
Did something go wrong?

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,400
I think they are having...

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,400
maths lessons.

65
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,120
Seriously?

66
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,599
He's back.

67
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,319
Relax.

68
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,919
Why is it taking so long?

69
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,120
I missed the train
and had to use the other subway line.

70
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,080
Save me!

71
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,439
I couldn't save you.

72
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,000
Yu Tu.

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,479
Did you fix the air purifier?

74
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,960
Ask Ms. Qiao.

75
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,360
Cotton.

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,599
It's up to her.

77
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,080
I have something

78
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,600
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,959
What kind of answer is that?

80
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,800
Aren't you joining us?

81
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,040
I have something

82
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,639
I'm sure not if I should say.

83
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,680
I'm busy. I can't join you.

84
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,439
He started acting weird

85
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,000
after going to Cotton's home.

86
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,360
Cotton.

87
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,040
Is your air purifier

88
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:50,879
fixed or not?

89
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,680
Yes.

90
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,439
Master Yu Tu

91
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,600
was amazing.

92
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,240
You live with him,

93
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,120
are you his colleague?

94
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,800
No.

95
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
We studied in college together.

96
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,879
I just quit my job.

97
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,439
The rental contract just ended.

98
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,160
So I moved out.

99
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
I'm staying with him
while transitioning.

100
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,000
Only a handful of people

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,240
of our age

102
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,600
are still single.

103
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,000
Cotton.

104
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,240
Were you surprised

105
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,600
when you met

106
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,920
the mighty Jade Rabbit God?

107
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,959
He is great at the game,

108
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,920
but also strikingly handsome.

109
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,480
Not bad.

110
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,519
Come again?

111
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,680
If he's only mediocre to your eyes,

112
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,680
you're setting a high bar, Cotton.

113
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:49,372
(School's About to Start So Panicky)

114
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,800
You just stole my kill!

115
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,480
Who taught you that?

116
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,319
A pro match?

117
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,519
When did you start dabbling in this?

118
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,680
I think

119
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,600
it started with a whim.

120
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,920
Do you think Cotton

121
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,000
looks pretty?

122
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,160
Just an average-looking girl.

123
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,800
Don't be so mean.

124
00:06:59,560 --> 00:06:59,839
You can't

125
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,040
be so harsh on her.

126
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,680
I was honest.

127
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,360
Fine.

128
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,839
She thinks you look...

129
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,920
mediocre.

130
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,360
Normal.

131
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,800
Mr. Zhai.

132
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,160
Please stop bothering me.

133
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,160
Carry on. I'm hitting the sack.

134
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,839
Close the door.

135
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,279
Get out.

136
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,160
Then, close the door.

137
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,160
Good night.

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,839
(Do you trust me?)

139
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,360
(You're my classmate.)

140
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,879
It's only 2 am.

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,600
(I missed the train and had to
use the other subway line.)

142
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,679
(Order the driver to pick up Yu Tu.)

143
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,320
(That doesn't seem adequate.)

144
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,559
(Right.)

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,799
(I forgot to ask for Yu Tu's WeChat.)

146
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,960
(Recall)

147
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,720
(You've recalled a message)

148
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,480
(Jingjing, what was the message
you recalled?)

149
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,480
(What did you need me to do?)

150
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,480
(Did you have a stomachache?)

151
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,879
(Bring me two sets of breakfast.)

152
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,159
(Hold on.)

153
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,759
(You don't need to
come here this morning.)

154
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,720
(Jade Rabbit God, bring me my breakfast.)

155
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,679
Hi.

156
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,720
I bought you some.

157
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:13,960
Thanks.

158
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,039
Come in.

159
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,399
The slippers are behind you.

160
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,039
Can we even finish all of this?

161
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,080
I had my breakfast.

162
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,559
This is all for me?

163
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,240
Do you think

164
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,320
all celebrities eat so much?

165
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
I don't know what you like,

166
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,440
so I bought everything.

167
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,000
Then we could have
the leftovers for lunch.

168
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,679
I won't need Xiao Zhu to send me lunch.

169
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,440
Right.

170
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,440
Well...

171
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
I can't go out.

172
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,159
So Xiao Zhu will send me

173
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,639
my lunch and dinner here.

174
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,840
Is that okay with you?

175
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,919
Dinner?

176
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,559
Yes.

177
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,960
So my working hour

178
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,440
will end at...

179
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
It's 9 pm.

180
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,759
Okay.

181
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,320
As long as your hands are fine.

182
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,399
Did you finish it?

183
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,000
Yes.

184
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,320
You brought your laptop.

185
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,440
Who taught you how to play?

186
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,679
My manager's husband.

187
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,720
Did he teach you how to play

188
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,639
as Cai Wenji and Sun Bin?

189
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,519
Yes.

190
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,720
He thought I would do better

191
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,679
as Support.

192
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,559
But after I played

193
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,559
with you and your friends,

194
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,720
I think I play better

195
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,759
with Wang Zhaojun.

196
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,799
Have you watched a pro match before?

197
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,039
Watch this.

198
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,960
What do you think?

199
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,320
(He actually asked for a report.)

200
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,519
They didn't die many times.

201
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:49,960
Unlike us,

202
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,159
we die a lot.

203
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,480
They are aware of the damage

204
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,360
they take.

205
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,799
Can they win?

206
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Is the fight worth it?

207
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,480
They don't start team fights recklessly.

208
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,320
Have you noticed

209
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,120
how You Yu from Team Luo Shen played?

210
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,919
The guy who used Zhang Fei
in the first round?

211
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,320
The commentator

212
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,559
mentioned his name a lot.

213
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,879
In the last team fight,

214
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,440
he played a decisive role.

215
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,559
He was the MVP

216
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,360
of that round.

217
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,919
Support

218
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,039
plays an important role.

219
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,080
Sometimes

220
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,840
it acts as the commander.

221
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,639
Guo,

222
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,720
the husband of my manager,

223
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,919
he said Support was easier to play with.

224
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,080
So he was wrong.

225
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,200
I can see

226
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
you're at Gold rank.

227
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,960
You got it yourself?

228
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:30,840
I was even the MVP

229
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,759
for a few matches.

230
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,399
Try playing with my account.

231
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,879
(My heart melted.)

232
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,879
Carry on.

233
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,279
(Hang in there! We will win!)

234
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,360
(Good job!)

235
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,480
You could play well in Gold rank.

236
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,519
But you don't do well in Diamond rank.

237
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,279
The match you'll join

238
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
has pro players in it.

239
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:33,285
The difficulty will be even greater.

240
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,559
I didn't know

241
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,720
the challenge you might face.

242
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,360
That was

243
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,879
why I thought using
Wang Zhaojun was good.

244
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,480
The truth is,

245
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,120
this is far from enough

246
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,600
to face the challenge that awaits you.

247
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,639
What should I do now?

248
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,399
There is one month left.

249
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,600
Become a King player

250
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,159
with your own strength.

251
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,900
(Gold)

252
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,480
(I think I can do it.)

253
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,720
Should we start playing
ranked matches now?

254
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,519
No.

255
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,759
We'll do 1v1 matches.

256
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,200
After I went home last night,

257
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,480
I watched a few pro matches.

258
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,080
I have a general understanding

259
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,240
about the current sandbox of the game.

260
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:33,759
Up next,

261
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,080
we will practice with every hero

262
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,840
through our 1v1 matches.

263
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,200
You must remember their skills,

264
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,960
the cooldown of their ultimate moves,

265
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:40,799
damages,

266
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,200
and some fine maneuvers

267
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,759
with practice.

268
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,799
All of the heroes?

269
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
There must be over

270
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,759
100 heroes in this game.

271
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,960
So there aren't that many of them.

272
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:54,840
Yu Ji is one of the best Marksmen

273
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,519
in the current sandbox.

274
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,759
She's easier to control.

275
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,080
Her specialty

276
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,519
is the Skill 2

277
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,759
that gives physical invulnerability

278
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,480
and a speed boost.

279
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,240
That protects her from Assassins
with physical damage.

280
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,519
Donghuang Taiyi.

281
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,399
This Support suits you.

282
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,559
But you upgraded

283
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,240
the wrong skill.

284
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,759
You should upgrade the skill 1.

285
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,780
(Match scoreboard: Defeat)

286
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,120
I must stay strong.

287
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,799
I must stay strong.

288
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,380
(Lousy performance by the endorser!)
(Qiao Jingjing is a fraud!)

289
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,399
Stop watching!

290
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:00,919
Get ready.

291
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,080
We'll practice with Xiao Qiao.

292
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,519
Jingjing!

293
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,360
I brought you dinner.

294
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,519
How did it go today?

295
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,720
Don't ask me

296
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,120
questions I can't answer.

297
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:15,519
Is there any meat?

298
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,400
I crave meat.

299
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,640
Hard-boiled chicken breast.

300
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,440
I want braised chicken.

301
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,759
I didn't prepare yours,

302
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,799
only Mr. Yu's portion.

303
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,519
We can't have meat at night.

304
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,119
Be good.

305
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,920
I'll do the dishes

306
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,640
after Mr. Yu leaves.

307
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,880
I should stay outside.

308
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,480
Practice well.

309
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,400
Be good.

310
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,759
Do you want some?

311
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,000
Never mind. Carry on.

312
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,240
I put on some weight lately.

313
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,640
This isn't fair.

314
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,920
Look. My level is too low.

315
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,240
I'm below level 30.

316
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,079
I don't have a full page of runes.

317
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,000
Yours is higher than mine.

318
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,400
Of course I couldn't beat you.

319
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:47,039
I barely have any.

320
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,400
Are you flexing with this?

321
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,720
My ranking is too low.

322
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:58,359
I see.

323
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,599
We've been at it all day.

324
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,079
Can you tell

325
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,599
which hero suits me the best?

326
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,759
We'll see after more practice.

327
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,039
You might as well tell me

328
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,240
more torture is waiting for me.

329
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,839
Hold on!

330
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,920
Wait! No...

331
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:34,559
I died.

332
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,559
It's been two days.

333
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,440
Why can I win just one round?

334
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,000
That's not what I mean.

335
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,839
Then you're asking too much.

336
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,519
Look at my scores.

337
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:18,880
Yeah.

338
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,440
You can only beat other players.

339
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,160
(I can only win against other players?)

340
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,240
(It's a fact,)

341
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,759
(but you are)

342
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,519
(too narcissistic.)

343
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,480
A solo match with other players?

344
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,920
Do you think I can win?

345
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,000
If you can't,

346
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,480
then pass me your phone.

347
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:39,799
Here I go.

348
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,100
(First blood!)

349
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,140
(Killed by Hand-picked Cotton)

350
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,100
(Enemy surrendered)

351
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,079
Did I win already?

352
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:03,920
Carry on.

353
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,960
Hurry up.

354
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,359
Can we make a comeback?

355
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,640
You died too many times just now.

356
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,839
You have less money and worse gear.

357
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,400
Don't fight him head-on.

358
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,519
Sidestep and get him poked

359
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,119
Remember to clear the minions.

360
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,759
Don't let the minions approach the tower.

361
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,680
Eat this!

362
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,519
(Can you win against the wind?)

363
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,559
(This is your punishment!)

364
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,160
(He made a comeback
after falling so far behind.)

365
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,480
(Were you messing with me earlier?)

366
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,480
I told you.

367
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,880
Yu Ji's skill 2

368
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,559
shields her from any physical damage.

369
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,079
But you didn't

370
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:07,960
time the skill well.

371
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:08,559
How about this?

372
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,960
I'll use Assassin. You use Yu Ji.

373
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:11,880
We'll carry on.

374
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,599
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

375
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,200
I really appreciate it.

376
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,160
Goodbye, Mr. Yu.

377
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:42,680
I saw Mr. Yu leave

378
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,720
while I was downstairs.

379
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,599
So I came up.

380
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,440
It took you

381
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,519
longer than usual today.

382
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Everything is already cleaned.

383
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,359
Didn't you tell Mr. Yu

384
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,680
I would clean the dishes?

385
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,480
I couldn't tell him.

386
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,400
He would have known

387
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,759
I was too lazy to do my chores.

388
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,519
Well, you need some cover.

389
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,319
How did it go today?

390
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,559
Not only did he teach me maths,

391
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,240
he played for me.

392
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,279
I mean, homework.

393
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,559
Homework?

394
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,279
After so many 1v1 matches,

395
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,440
you should understand

396
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,200
all the heroes

397
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,599
in this game.

398
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,359
Next, we'll practice with 3v3 matches.

399
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,119
But I'll be your opponent.

400
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,680
How can you be sure

401
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,920
you would be matched against me?

402
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,799
We can open a lobby in this game.

403
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,559
We each can have

404
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,200
two AI teammates.

405
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,440
I'll invite you over.

406
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:28,920
Okay.

407
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,960
I need some rest.

408
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,119
See?

409
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,119
We've been playing with AI teammates

410
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,720
almost the whole day.

411
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,960
Let's not

412
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,599
get a lobby, okay?

413
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,599
Sure.

414
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,160
We should team up

415
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,279
and play against the others.

416
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,200
I'll allow you to go jungling

417
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,119
and skip team fights.

418
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,400
Let me get you some water.

419
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,359
Get in the team.

420
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,359
What about the break?

421
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,039
Forget about the break.

422
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,240
What for?

423
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,039
I need to win.

424
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,359

we can't know for sure.

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,640
I have work here.

473
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,960
I thought you had an interview here.

474
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,920
I had dinner

475
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,319
with Dragon King in Hangzhou.

476
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:17,720
He told me

477
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,279
you planned to resign
from the institute.

478
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,640
Is that true?

479
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,160
I plan to do so.

480
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:28,920
But why?

481
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,400
You broke up with me

482
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,519
for your own pursuit,

483
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,799
but now you're giving up so easily.

484
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:40,519
I hope

485
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,559
you carry on with the work.

486
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:44,839
Otherwise,

487
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,559
it'd seem as though
I meant nothing to you.

488
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,359
You are willing to give up your pursuit.

489
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:54,920
It's just that I wasn't worth it.

490
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,640
Before we had the relationship,

491
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:00,960
you knew

492
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,440
what my goal was.

493
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,559
What was the saying again?

494
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,559
The most foolish fantasy
is the misconception...

495
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:14,279
that you could

496
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,440
change a person.

497
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,480
Are you still in QE?

498
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,240
I hopped to another job.

499
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,039
I'm now a marketing director.

500
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,160
My salary is far more handsome
than when I was

501
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,960
a fresh grad.

502
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,640
There is also more work to do.

503
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,839
You've always been outstanding.

504
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
But I'm tired.

505
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,079
I've been thinking.

506
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,119
As a woman, why should I

507
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,039
work myself to the bones?

508
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,480
Which field do you plan to work in?

509
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,119
From what I heard,

510
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,920
the DF headquarters in Beijing

511
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,079
gave you the job offer.

512
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,880
DF has been doing well.

513
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,440
We share the same office building.

514
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,279
I know them well enough.

515
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,920
If you need any help,

516
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,759
I could give you a free inquiry.

517
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,160
Thanks.

518
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,720
But I turned down the offer.

519
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,519
