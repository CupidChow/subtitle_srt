15
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,560
Proposal SK-1 is both innovative

16
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:15,040
and refreshing.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,760
However, aerospace belongs to
systems engineering.

The prerequisite

19

of your proposal is

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,040

so quiet today?

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,000
you were so eloquent.

31

00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,040
Why? Discouraged?

And now I'd like to ask

127
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,760
the victim in question:

128
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:17,880
are they real or fake?

129
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,679
Some are real, some are fake.

130
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,000
That one about me being ugly was fake.

131
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,440
I've always looked this good, okay?

132
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,119
Also,

133
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,119
he rejected me, yes,

134
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,239
but it wasn't ugly.

135
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,320
He was really polite.

136
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:34,359
So you admit that

137
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,679
you confessed to him

138
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,519
but got rejected?

139
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,160
Yes.

140
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,720
That guy...

141
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,079
(Yu Tu)

142
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,760

and really smart.

144
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,559
So did he really

145
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,880
think that you were dumb

146
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,959
and so he chose the other girl over you?

147
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,760
I'm not dumb. You are.

148

(You have always been pretty.)

153
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:31,640
(You were just a bit unpolished.)

154
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,640
(By the way,)

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,279

(Speaking of which, Jingjing,)

166
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,520
(do you think Yu Tu
regrets rejecting you?)

167

Sure, go ahead.

172
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,479
Do you want a girlfriend now?

173
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,679
If so,

174
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,760
what do you think of me?

175
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,599
(Sorry.)

176
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
(I want someone)

177
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,479
(who can work together with me.)

178
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,919
(But who you found)

179
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,880
(didn't stick with you till the end.)

180
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,520
It's already 10 PM.

181
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,280
Should we

182
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,840
return to Shanghai?

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,960
We'll leave tomorrow morning

184
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
and arrive at Hengdian in the afternoon.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,760
I'll ask them

186
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,039
to postpone your scenes.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,520
No.

188
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,679
I have ten scenes tomorrow.

189
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's go to Hengdian now.

190
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,320
Ask the driver to drive slowly.

191
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,039
Look how tired you are.

192
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,159
Mr. Wang

193
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Hengdian it is.

194
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,039
No problem.

195
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:24,760
Thank you.

196
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,740
(Class 5 Senior 3)

197
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,719
(An exam?)

198
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,039
(How many calories
does a strawberry have?)

199
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,039
That's tough.

200
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,440
Even a brainiac won't know the answer.

201
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,820
(Math)

202
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,820
(Math Exam)

203
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,479
Jingjing.

204
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,919
Jingjing.

205
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,080
Wake up!

206
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,719
Did you play Honor of Kings?

207
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,520
(Xiao Qiao,)

208
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,159
(you can become stronger.)

209
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,080
(Enemy Legendary)

210
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:06,080
(Enemy Unstopable)

211
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,360
(You've been slain)

212
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,140
(This level? Pro gamer?
Honor of Kings Endorser?)

213
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,479
This Xiao Qiao was you?

214
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,080
Congratulations.

215
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:17,880
You're famous on Weibo now.

216
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,840
Look.

217
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,559
First in trending:

218
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,440
Qiao Jingjing, a fake gamer,

219
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,000
sending ripples through
the entertainment

220
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and the esports industry.

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,559
When did you start playing this game?

222
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,799
When I was filming earlier this year.

223
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,960
I played it on and off.

224
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,479
I didn't play it for long.

225
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,440
In Honor of Kings,

226
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,039
you can be a spectator

227
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,760
and watch people fight,

228
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,719
even record it.

229
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:38,719
Didn't you know?

230
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,320
Such a function exists?

231
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,640
You didn't know?

232
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,760
Why did you even play the game?

233
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,359
I have endorsed the game.

234
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:46,919
You guys said I was a pro gamer.

235
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,960
Fake it

236
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,280
till you make it, right?

237
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,119
I knew you're like this.

238
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,000
Just one or two compliments

239
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,440
are enough to make you think
you're good at something.

240
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,200
It's serious, you know.

241
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,479
Do you have any idea
how popular this game is?

242
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,960
How many people are lining up

243
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,479
to endorse it?

244
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,719
Some will even do it for free!

245
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:07,840
Honor of Kings

246
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,359
was supposed to renew
the contract with us.

247
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,080
But with the current drama,

248
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,239
I guess it's gone.

249
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,119
Of course, this is not the worst.

250
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:17,159
You're an actress.

251
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,280
Endorsement is just a side job.

252
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,719
What's more important

253
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:22,679
is the leading actress role
for Mr. Li's latest movie.

254
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:23,760
Do you know

255
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,679
what this new movie

256
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,640
will be called?

257
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,359
Authenticity.

258
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,479
You're saying that

259
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:32,000
someone stirred this up

260
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,440
to get the role in Mr. Li's movie.

261
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,360
(Alex-Honor of Kings)

262
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,799
Call from Honor of Kings.

263
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,359
Hi,

264
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,080
Ms. Qiu, I'm Alex.

265
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:48,359
Hi.

266
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,640
What's with the trending topic today?

267
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,359
Does that alt belong to Jingjing?

268
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,119
Was she practicing some heroes?

269
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes.

270
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
She was using her alt

271
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,039
to practice heroes
she was not familiar with.

272
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,239
That's why it was like this.

273
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,599
In this case,

274
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,159
you should clarify

275
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,599
(Honor of Kings World Champion Cup)
on Weibo.

276
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,520
Or else,

277
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,840
you'll put us in a weird position.

278
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,000
You're right.

279
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,559
We'll do it right away.

280
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:07,799
By the way, Ms. Qiu.

281
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,359
We have discussed internally
and we believe that

282
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,000
a clarification on Weibo

283
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,799
might not be able to cut it.

284
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,599
We will have an event soon

285
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,359
and we might be able to turn this crisis

286
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,400
into opportunity.

287
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,320
What event?

288
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,559
So,

289
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,080
the World Champion Cup

290
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,599
will end in a month.

291
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,280
And then,

292
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,919
we'll hold

293
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,640
an award ceremony.

294
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,520
In this ceremony,

295
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,599
we would love to invite Jingjing

296
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:31,840
to play a casual match.

297
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,840
We will select randomly

298
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,599
five lucky players from Weibo.

299
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,119
Together with Jingjing, the six of them

300
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:37,280
will be divided into two teams.

301
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,159
Each team can select

302
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,039
two professional players
as their teammates.

303
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:43,559
But this is not stipulated

304
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,880
on our contract.

305
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:46,960
The contract also doesn't say that

306
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,599
a video like this

307
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:48,679
would be leaked.

308
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,039
It's just a casual match.

309
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,400
Don't worry.

310
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:53,880
Unless Jingjing is...

311
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,000
It's not about her player skill.

312
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,479
It's that in our...

313
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,799
It's okay. I'll do it.

314
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,280
Ms. Qiu.

315
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,640
Hello.

316
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,280
That voice just now was...

317
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,559
It was Jingjing.

318
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,880
As you know,

319
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,640
she's an avid fan

320
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,880
of your game.

321
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Since

322
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,960
Jingjing already said yes,

323
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,080
I see no point in refusing you.

324
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,760
Let's discuss more in detail.

325
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,280
Qiao Jingjing updated her Weibo.

326
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,559
(That was the best I could do.)

327
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,039
(We both have Qiao in our name)

328
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,799
(so why can't I use you well?)

329
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,280
The comments and the reactions

330
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,159
from the netizens seem good.

331
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,159
Many have bought

332
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:34,880
her explanation.

333
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,799
However, some still remain skeptical.

334
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,640
Post the message we said just now.

335
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:41,719
(In this year's award ceremony,)

336
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,039
(the endorser of Honor of Kings,)

337
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:45,000
(Qiao Jingjing will have a casual match)

338
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,159
(with some lucky winners.)

339
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,840
(Are you excited about)

340
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,239
(Qiao Jingjing's Xiao Qiao?)

341
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,400
(Apply now.)

342
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:54,080
(Jingjing's so cute! Go!)
(Jingjing, you're the best! Go!)

343
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:54,719
After announcing that

344
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,000
Qiao Jingjing will play
in a casual match,

345
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,280
the tide has turned.

346
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,479
Everyone is looking forward to it now.

347
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,527
(Qiao Jingjing:
I'm done with Xiao Qiao!)

348
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:01,599
In fact, everyone thinks that

349
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,280
it's normal

350
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,919
to be unable to perform well
on certain heroes.

351
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,000
Look.

352
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,159
Some players came to her defense too.

353
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,679
However,

354
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,760
how good is she?

355
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:11,000
If she's as bad as she was

356
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,080
in the video,

357
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:14,080
then that would be disastrous.

358
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,200
We will look bad.

359
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,200
When that happens,

360
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,960
we'll remove her as our endorser.

361
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,400
The dissenting voice

362
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,520
has gone down temporarily,

363
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,799
but the casual match

364
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,000
will begin in around a month.

365
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,320
Your level

366
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,520
is not good enough for a match.

367
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,640
I have already found

368
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,039
an excuse for you.

369
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:43,799
You really don't have to

370
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,280
take part in this match.

371
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:46,200
Jingjing,

372
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,239
you're too reckless this time.

373
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:54,599
Jingjing.

374
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,559
Ling,

375
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,200
I don't usually accept a stranger's

376
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
friend request on WeChat.

377
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,760
Don't worry.

378
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,280
I'll find out

379
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,479
who's behind

380
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:08,479
all this.

381
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,799
No need for that.

382
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,080
It's my fault.

383
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,599
Don't be mad.

384
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,479
I'm not mad.

385
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,719
The culprit will suffer my wrath soon.

386
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,280
Try to get me the role

387
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,439
from Mr. Li.

388
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:23,920
Okay.

389
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,680
As for the game,

390
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,719
find someone reliable

391
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:26,680
to coach me.

392
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,479
This show

393
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,959
will finish shooting in a few days.

394
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,400
Keep the current schedule.

395
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,599
Don't add other things.

396
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,160
I was planning

397
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,599
to give you a 2-week break.

398
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,680
But now that the casual match

399
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,199
is in a month,

400
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:38,760
you plan to

401
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,199
spend this period to practice hard?

402
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,520
Look.

403
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,760
In the comments,

404
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,400
(Jingjing, go!)
my fans voiced their support.

405
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:47,920
(Looking forward to Jingjing's performance)
If I lose in the match which will take place

406
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,040
in a month,

407
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,079
not only will I be mocked,

408
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,920
my fans too.

409
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,599
I see.

410
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,560
I'll arrange for it then.

411
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,479
It's my fault this time.

412
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,640
Thank you.

413
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh, please.

414
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,199
No need to

415
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,079
to thank me.

416
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,479
I still have one month.

417
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:09,560
I can do this.

418
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,280
In no way is this

419
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,359
harder than abs training.

420
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,239
Of course.

421
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,160
You can do this.

422
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,199
All right. It's 2 AM now.

423
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,359
You still have shooting tomorrow.

424
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:17,040
Sleep early.

425
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:17,560
All right.

426
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,239
Jingjing.

427
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,599
Even though I agree that

428
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,520
abs training is harder than gaming,

429
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,599
but your abs are nowhere to be seen

430
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,599
despite the weight loss.

431
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:37,400
Good night.

432
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,880
Really? You can't see them?

433
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,800
Congratulations, Ms. Qiao

434
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:58,239
(End of shooting celebration)
for completing the shooting.

435
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,359
Yay!

436
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,380
(Fushan Production Team,
End of shooting celebration)

437
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,400
Come, let's take a group photo.

438
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,640
Look at this camera.

439
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,680
Three, two, one. Good.

440
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:08,839
Thank you.

441
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,160
Thanks, everyone. Goodbye.

442
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,119
Take care.

443
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,640
Good job.

444
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,160
Goodbye.

445
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,959
Since you've decided

446
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,199
to play in this casual match,

447
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,880
then we have to prepare thoroughly.

448
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Only one goal in mind:

449
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,160
don't let anyone know that

450
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,119
you're a novice.

451
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,640
Once you're back in Shanghai,

452
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,199
you'll need to start training.

453
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:36,880
Got it.

454
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:37,959
Take this.

455
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,920
You'll use this phone
for the casual match.

456
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,119
Use it

457
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,959
for your practice

458
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,199
so that you can get used to it.

459
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:44,520
Your account has been created.

460
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,000
No one will know it's you.

461
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,400
I've also found you

462
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,680
a professional coach for you.

463
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:02,920
Who?

464
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:04,920
A professional player?

465
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:07,920
I can't wait.

466
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,719
Here.

467
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,880
My husband.

468
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,119
Are you sure he's good at it?

469
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:45,800
Guo

470
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,319
is a King player, okay?

471
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,500
(Guo, King Player x0
Best Heroes: Cheng Yaojin, Xiahou Dun...)

472
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:53,880
I decided to ask you to

473
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,280
endorse Honor of Kings

474
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,880
because

475
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,640
I was inspired by

476
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,800
how engrossed he was in the game.

477
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,920
He's a veteran,

478
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,160
more than qualified to be your coach.

479
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,439
Also,

480
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,599
with our current situation,

481
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,400
I don't dare to find
an outsider to coach you.

482
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,000
What if he or she
shares this with everyone?

483
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,599
Fine then.

484
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,880
Train hard.

485
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:13,160
If you have half of

486
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,560
what Guo has,

487
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,800
then your performance
should be satisfactory.

488
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:17,520
I still have work.

489
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,040
This meeting room

490
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:19,920
will be your classroom

491
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,880
from now onwards.

492
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:21,760
Start whenever.

493
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,359
Train hard too, Xiao Zhu

494
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,400
so that you can be her partner.

495
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,040
All right.

496
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,119
I'll leave her to you, darling.

497
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,359
Go finish your things.

498
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,400
Go.

499
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,599
I'll be in your care then.

500
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:41,920
No need to be so formal.

501
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
We're almost like a family now.

502
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,800
Ling has told me

503
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,199
about the general situation.

504
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:48,359
Don't worry.

505
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,239
This game is simple.

506
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,280
You can be good at

507
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:52,520
several heroes

508
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,359
in a month.

509
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,560
Calm yourself down.

510
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,160
Okay.

511
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,280
So let's start

512
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,439
from the basics.

513
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:58,839
Okay.

514
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,040
Let's go to the tutorial.

515
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,920
(Welcome to the Honor of Kings.)

516
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,040
From the blue side's perspective,

517
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:40,000
this is mid,

518
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,479
this is top,

519
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,400
and this is bottom.

520
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,119
Since

521
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,239
you're new,

522
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:46,520
let's start with Support.

523
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,199
Just follow the Marksman.

524
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,199
Okay.

525
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:51,359
By the way,

526
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,239
Ling told me

527
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,359
about the match rules.

528
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,760
You'll have

529
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,880
two random players

530
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,199
and two pro players

531
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:01,239
as your teammates.

532
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,319
Honestly,

533
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,680
you can never outperform

534
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:08,479
a professional player anyway.

535
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,359
Professional players

536
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,959
will want to be the carries.

537
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,119
There are carries in this game?

538
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,280
Yes.

539
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,439
There are five positions

540
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,359
in total.

541
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:20,520
Mid, Jungler, Marksman,
Tank, and Support.

542
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:21,599
The first three

543
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,760
are the carries.

544
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,520
Can I be a carry then?

545
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,239
Do you want to win?

546
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,880
Yes.

547
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,959
Then play Support.

548
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,280
Do you know why?

549
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:37,719
First,

550
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,680
Support is easier to pick up.

551
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,520
Secondly,
it's not the most pivotal role.

552
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:45,359
You can definitely be Support.

553
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,199
Let me teach you

554
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,880
some common supportive

555
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,920
skills.

556
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,640
Look.

557
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,760
Let's start with Zhang Fei.

558
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,359
His abilities

559
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,520
are quite simple.

560
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,119
Five Tiger Generals,

561
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,319
at your service.

562
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,740
(Victory)

563
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,319
Just like that.

564
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,160
Now, let's matchmake and practice.

565
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,000
(Welcome to the Honor of Kings.)

566
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,000
Just follow me, Hou Yi.

567
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,040
Use your Skill 1 once you're out.

568
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,340
(Get Ready. Prepare to engage)

569
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:44,520
Okay.

570
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,839
Your Skill 2 is a shield.

571
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,479
Use it on me.

572
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,359
Good.

573
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,359
If you can use it at the right time,
it will be even better.

574
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:55,560
Okay.

575
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,479
You're level 4 now.

576
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:57,520
You can use your ultimate skill.

577
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,520
Use it to blow him away.

578
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,319
Follow my march!

579
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,387
(Yikes!)

580
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,479
(Thank you.)

581
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,680
He was about to die.

582
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,000
Why did you blow him away?

583
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,520
I just wanted to see how it looks like.

584
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,319
It's okay.

585
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,079
Let's continue.

586
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Gao Jianli is after me now.

587
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,400
Hurry

588
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,599
and blow him away
with your ultimate skill.

589
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,300
(First Blood)

590
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,160
Jesus!

591
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,000
I don't have much HP left.

592
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,760
Why did you

593
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,839
blow him towards me?

594
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,439
It's okay.

595
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:28,079
Let's continue.

596
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:28,760
Don't sweat it.

597
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,040
You can do this.

598
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,040
Come.

599
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,220
(You've been slain.)

600
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,220
(You've been slain.)

601
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,220
(Enemy unstoppable)

602
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,980
(Defeat)

603
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,199
Don't worry. It's not your fault.

604
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,000
This hero is not meant for you.

605
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:50,800
So,

606
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:52,400
let's use another hero.

607
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Let's use Sun Bin.

608
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,400
He's quite good.

609
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,220
(Defeat)

610
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,760
Try Niumo.

611
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,700
(Defeat)

612
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,319
Zhuang Zhou.

613
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,620
(Defeat)

614
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,839
Today

615
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,560
is still a fruitful day.

616
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,839
We have found several heroes

617
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,079
that don't suit your play style.

618
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,119
Let's not give up

619
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,479
and do this again tomorrow.

620
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,000
We'll definitely find

621
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
your true calling.

622
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,680
Okay.

623
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,160
Yes.

624
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,079
How's the training?

625
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:57,520
Well,

626
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:01,000
full of surprises.

627
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,040
Oh, my.

628
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,959
You worked hard.

629
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,199
Your arms must be tired.

630
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,040
How's the practice?

631
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:20,839
Not bad.

632
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,520
We've tried out

633
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,400
all Supports.

634
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,439
Really?

635
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,280
Did she find a hero

636
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,319
that she's good at then?

637
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,439
Cai Wenji.

638
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:36,880
Zhuang Zhou and Yao
are not bad too, right?

639
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:40,040
Wait,

640
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,640
even though

641
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,959
you're not at your best form yet,

642
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:44,479
but the random players

643
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:45,719
selected

644
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:46,760
won't necessarily be King players either,

645
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,640
right?

646
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,160
So let's call off tomorrow.

647
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,160
Have a break.

648
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,359
I will revise

649
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,079
a new coaching plan

650
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,479
based on

651
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,880
Jingjing's capability.

652
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,079
Okay.

653
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,839
She has to shoot
an ad tomorrow anyway.

654
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,719
She won't be able to practice.

655
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:02,520
Jingjing,

656
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,719
go back now

657
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:04,560
and sleep early.

658
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:06,359
I'll practice

659
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,520
on my phone tomorrow.

660
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,439
I'm not used to this phone.

661
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:09,800
Don't. Don't.

662
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:11,160
If people record your game again,

663
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,280
we'll be in deep trouble.

I can use my alt.

668

Disable spectating?

669
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,040
That's...

670
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,680
