14
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,959
Hey.

15
00:01:58,279 --> 00:01:58,760
Jingjing.

16
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,000
I told you via WeChat

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,239
that Mr. Li changed his itinerary.

18
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,440
He's going back to Beijing tonight.

19
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:03,360
We'll meet him

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,680
this afternoon instead.

21
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,839
Did you see it?

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,239
I didn't check WeChat.

23
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,000
What time are we meeting him?

24
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,959
3:30 PM.

25
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,239
The make-up artist, stylist, and I

26
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,400
are already downstairs.

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,160
We'll come up now.

28
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,879
You brought the make-up artist

29
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,720
and stylist too?

30
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,599
We don't have much time.

31
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,919
It will be faster if they help you.

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,919
This afternoon,

33
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,599
we happened to be at the office

34
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,440
discussing some work,

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,000
so I brought them over.

36
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,399
I forgot.

37
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,119
Is Mr. Yu

38
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,520
with you?

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,759
Of course he is.

40
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,639
You knew, and you brought
so many people over.

41
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,679
Figure something out.

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,479
We're in the elevator already.

43
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,039
Tell them

44
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:37,839
that I'm here to fix appliances.

45
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,360
Aren't you too handsome for that?

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,759
Yes.

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,839
Right.

48
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,119
What if

49
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:46,520
you close the door

50
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,639
after you leave?

51
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:51,960
Well...

52
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,119
The make-up artist and stylist

53
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:53,839
are from a team

54
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,160
we outsourced.

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,399
So...

56
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,240
Actually,

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,320
Ms. Ling has long wanted to meet you.

58
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,039
Go.

59
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:06,839
Okay.

60
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,399
I'm coming.

61
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
We're coming in.

62
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,559
Come in.

63
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,279
Should we do it

64
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,440
in the living room?

65
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,919
Don't, let's do it...
Let's do it at the balcony.

66
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,279
The natural lighting would be better.

67
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,520
Okay, go in first,

68
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,160
and set things up.

69
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,839
Okay.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,520
Where did you hide Mr. Yu?

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
I'm very curious now.

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,039
Exactly how handsome is he?

73
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,199
Xiao Zhu is full of compliments for him.

74
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,080
This is what we'll do.

75
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,039
I'll go and say hi in secret.

76
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,479
Don't... Don't do it in secret.

77
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,839
He'll feel shy.

78
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,620
(Projector bulb)

79
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:07,320
Come on.

80
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,639
We're going to be late.

81
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:17,880
I'll get going.

82
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,800
(Wait for me to come back.)

83
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,600
(Okay.)

84
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,320
Slowly.

85
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,480
Ms. Sha said

86
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,359
that they asked Duan Wu

87
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,839
and his manager to come along.

88
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,359
Don't be nervous later.

89
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,920
Mr. Li doesn't usually give out scripts.

90
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
He just wants to chat.

91
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,760
A big-shot director

92
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,239
has his own way of checking out people.

93
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,160
I heard about that.

94
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,559
If he's willing to meet you,

95
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,279
it means he feels

96
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,399
that you have something in you

97
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,760
that's suitable for the role.

98
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,679
Anyway,

99
00:04:58,679 --> 00:04:59,920
just act natural.

100
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:01,720
Ling.

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,640
Ms. Sha.

102
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,799
Here, let me introduce you.

103
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,000
This is Jingjing.

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,320
This is Ms. Sha.

105
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,079
She's the big-shot producer
and administrator

106
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,959
that Mr. Li always works with.

107
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,279
Hi, Ms. Sha.

108
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,559
Jingjing is more beautiful in person

109
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,799
than on-screen.

110
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:13,799
Being beautiful is secondary.

111
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,200
The important thing is that she acts well.

112
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,119
Is that so?

113
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,119
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

114
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:18,359
Duan Wu and his manager just arrived.

115
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,359
- Let's go.
- Come on.

116
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,959
What are you busy with lately?

117
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,040
I just finished a reality show.

118
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,239
I was out in the sun for 12 days.

119
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,720
Look, I've gotten a tan.

120
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,799
That makes you look more real.

121
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:29,959
It's all right.

122
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,839
I think it looks quite natural too.

123
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,239
Right.

124
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:31,760
Director.

125
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,160
Jingjing and her manager are here.

126
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,279
Hi, Director.

127
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,279
Welcome.

128
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,320
We meet again, Director.

129
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,679
Hello.

130
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:39,119
Jingjing met with Director before?

131
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,440
I think

132
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:41,880
it was one or two years ago.

133
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,200
We met

134
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,720
at a film festival.

135
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,000
Right.

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,480
Am I right?

137
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:45,920
Ms. Qiao.

138
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,160
We haven't met for two years already.

139
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:49,519
You know each other?

140
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,079
We guested together
at a variety show before.

141
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,440
But I just made my debut back then.

142
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,559
I didn't know anything.

143
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,959
Good thing Ms. Qiao took care of me.

144
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,200
No.

145
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
You're being too kind, Mr. Duan.

146
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,239
Come on, sit down.

147
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,640
Sit down.

148
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,119
I

149
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,200
have some urgent matters to attend to.

150
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,959
I must go to Beijing tonight.

151
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,640
So at the last minute,

152
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,079
I gathered everyone here.

153
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,640
You don't mind, right?

154
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
No.

155
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,559
I play better
when there is a crowd.

156
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,839
Don't feel pressured.

157
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,200
Let's just have a casual chat.

158
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,160
Come on, have some tea.

159
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,720
Have some tea.

160
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,119
Thank you.

161
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:18,839
Here, Jingjing.

162
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,519
Okay.

163
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,079
Try Director's tea.

164
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,940
(Aerogel application in the field
of Aerospace - Shortcut)

165
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,860
(Email sent)

166
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,160
(I'm back!)

167
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,359
(Where are you?)

168
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,480
(Guarding the house.)

169
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,880
(Guarding the house?)

170
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:47,559
(I don't see you!)

171
00:06:59,279 --> 00:06:59,839
She feels at ease

172
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,079
to leave me all alone here.

173
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:05,839
I must keep
this movie's material confidential

00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,440
until the last moment.

175
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,959
I'm sure

176
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,119
that it's completely different

177
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:12,160
from all the movies I've filmed.

178
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,279
Perhaps

179
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,839
it's even cooler

180
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,799
and

181
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:16,920
more imaginative.

182
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,200
Mr. Li.

183
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,000
When I entered your home just now,

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
I saw

185
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,040
two game machines by the wall.

186
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,160
I was wondering if your movie

187
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,799
could be related to a game.

188
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,279
Based on what you said,

189
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,279
I think that's even more likely.

190
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,559
Duan, you're so perceptive.

191
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,160
No wonder they say online

192
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,359
that the temporary title

193
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,760
of your movie is called "Authenticity".

194
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:38,440
I can understand it now.

195
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,880
Game and reality.

196
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,399
Authentic and fake.

197
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,679
It's not

198
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,559
a simple representation.

199
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,079
The structure is more complicated.

200
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,160
For example...

201
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,040
Stop fishing for information from me.

202
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,440
I might let things slip.

203
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,160
Director, you're so secretive.

204
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,160
Then we'll stop making blind guesses.

205
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,600
We're looking forward to being surprised.

206
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,760
Okay.

207
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:18,480
Yu Tu.

208
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:19,959
Let me tell you some good news.

209
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,079
You got the role?

210
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,640
I think so.

211
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,559
But the most important thing

212
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:27,040
is that Mr. Li said

213
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:29,160
I was too thin.

214
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,399
You're still in my house, right?

215
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,559
Come downstairs.

216
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,559
Let's have a free dinner.

217
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,359
It's Ms. Ling's husband's birthday.

218
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,399
She went ahead.

219
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,720
I'll bring you to her house
for a free dinner

220
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,920
to give her a surprise.

221
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Are you sure

222
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,719
that it will be a surprise?

223
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,799
What's the matter?

224
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,559
When I think

225
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,440
that I'll get to eat food
that my wife cooks,

226
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,000
I...

227
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,400
I feel so happy.

228
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,559
What does that mean?

229
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,599
Are you saying that I'm busy with work,

230
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:03,640
and I have no time for our household?

231
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,359
No.

232
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,760
That's definitely not what I meant.

233
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,440
I'm taking care of the household.

234
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,840
Cut the crap.

235
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,440
Try

236
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,559
how my soup tastes.

237
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,359
Be careful, it's hot.

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,719
What do you think?

239
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,960
You can open a restaurant now.

240
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,559
Go and open the door.

241
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,679
The cake I ordered has arrived.

242
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,799
I'm coming.

243
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,200
I'm coming.

244
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,919
Mr. Guo, happy birthday.

245
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,919
We're here for dinner.

246
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:37,760
Guo.

247
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,719
You're so well-informed.

248
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:39,799
This is for Huihui.

249
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:40,960
You don't need to buy anything.

250
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,919
No.

251
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,239
Leave.

252
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,080
Today,

253
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,919
you can't be our third wheel.

254
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,080
This is our quality time together.

255
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,200
Our daughter is here.

256
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,440
What the heck?

257
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,559
We're just having a simple dinner.

258
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,280
If you don't mind, come in.

259
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,760
Come in.

260
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Come inside.

261
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,599
Xiao Zhu, come in.

262
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,599
Sit anywhere you like.

263
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,640
I'll pour you some tea.

264
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,239
This is the legendary

265
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,840
Chief Coach of 80 Heroes,

266
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,760
Mr. Yu, right?

267
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,559
Hi, Ms. Ling.

268
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,719
Just call me Yu Tu.

269
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:15,000
Come on, come inside.

270
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,400
I came here empty-handed.

271
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,320
I'm sorry.

272
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,679
Why are you being so shy?

273
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,640
You don't need to prepare anything.

274
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,960
Just come here.

275
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,559
Before, Jingjing

276
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,200
wouldn't let me go to meet you.

277
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,640
Sit down.

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,880
He's so handsome.

279
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,200
Come on, sit down.

280
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,919
Come on.

281
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,479
Well...

282
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,760
It's been a while

283
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,159
since I received jewelry
for my birthday.

284
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,840
I feel so moved.

285
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,599
Ms. Qiao.

286
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,479
It's my birthday.

287
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,719
What are you saying?

288
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:58,520
It's your birthday,

289
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,799
and I bought a gift for your wife.

290
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,359
Am I not helping you save money?

291
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,239
So it's like a gift for you.

292
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:04,599
If you don't like it,

293
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:05,280
go to the store

294
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,400
and exchange it
for something you can use.

295
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,719
Yes, you can exchange it.

296
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,359
What are you talking about?

297
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,039
How can I exchange this?

298
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,239
If I do, I must

299
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,520
add more money and exchange it
for something more expensive for you.

300
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,960
I must personally help you put it on.

301
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,280
That's enough. Cut it out.

302
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,159
Go and get Huihui.

303
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,200
Tell her that Jingjing is here. Hurry.

304
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,080
Yes, she'll definitely be so happy.

305
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,320
Thank you.

306
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:25,200
Give me another gift
on my lunar calendar birthday.

307
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,799
What are you looking at?

308
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,280
What do you mean?

309
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,599
Mr. Yu.

310
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,440
Well...

311
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:37,760
I want to talk to you.

312
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Do you think

313
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,000
you have the interest

314
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,599
in joining the entertainment circle?

315
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,679
I don't have any talent in that area.

316
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,719
Move.

317
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,559
Why do you need talent?

318
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,520
Your face is your talent.

319
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,080
Your IQ is so high.

320
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,719
Your comprehension must be very strong.

321
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:56,440
How will you know
that you don't have

322
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,239
any talent in acting if you don't try?

323
00:11:58,599 --> 00:11:59,799
Our circle

324
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,679
lacks your age group

325
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,799
and with  your kind of aura the most.

326
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,520
Let me tell you.

327
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,080
It's not too late to make
your debut now.

328
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,119
I'm very confident

329
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,200
that in half a year,

330
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,359
I can surely make you famous.

331
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,880
I'm sorry.

332
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,919
No.

333
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,320
Don't be sorry first.

334
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,400
Think about it carefully.

335
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,919
- Huihui, look who's here.
- Here she comes.

336
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,880
- Huihui.
- Come on.

337
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,159
Look who's here.

338
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:18,880
Huihui, come on.

339
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,679
Come here.

340
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,960
Hurry, Jingjing is here.

341
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,880
Come on, give her a hug.

342
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,840
Do you miss me?

343
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,520
Yes.

344
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,479
You do?

345
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,280
Good girl.

346
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,400
Think about it carefully again,

347
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,840
really.

348
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,119
You don't need to answer me today.

349
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,640
Go home, and think about it carefully.

350
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,359
You can do it.

351
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,080
There's no need to think about it.

352
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,679
Mr. Guo.

353
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,679
Look. It's your birthday,

354
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,760
and your wife is staring
at a handsome guy.

355
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,479
Aren't you sad?

356
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:38,679
Aren't you mad?

357
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,400
I'm not sad.

358
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,960
I'm not mad.

359
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,239
She stares at handsome guys daily.

360
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:45,039
What are you talking about?

361
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,760
Jingjing.

362
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't try to sow discord between us.

363
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,880
I'm working, okay?

364
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,559
Besides,

365
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,760
I haven't even commented about you.

366
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,440
You didn't even call to say
that you were coming.

367
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,640
We didn't make enough food.

368
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,239
It doesn't matter.

369
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,320
It's not a big deal.

370
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,960
Then we can order hot pot.

371
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,799
I want to have hot pot.

372
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,559
Right, there's no problem no matter
how many people come.

373
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,440
All right then.

374
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,400
Xiao Zhu, make a call.

375
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,440
Call Dandan and the others over

376
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,359
to join in the fun.

377
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:05,919
All right.

378
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,719
Right.

379
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,719
I'll call the people in the office.

380
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:08,359
Call everyone who can come.

381
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,719
We're having hot pot.

382
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,559
Excuse me, don't burn yourself.

383
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,440
It smells so good.

384
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,799
This is rare. Look.

385
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,719
Here comes the braised ribbonfish.

386
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:23,320
Thank you, Ms. Ling.

387
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,799
Thank you.

388
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,760
Eat more.

389
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,080
Who's that?

390
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,520
Mind your images.

391
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,840
It's fine, Ms. Ling.

392
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,479
Since junior to senior high,

393
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,320
Mr. Yu

394
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,440
has already faced
this kind of situation.

395
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,599
He's used to it.

396
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,320
Junior high?

397
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,760
We went to the same junior high.

398
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,679
Our schools merged.

399
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,559
You were in Class 1, and I was in Class 9.

400
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:01,400
Jingjing.

401
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,960
Does your school

402
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,719
divide you into sections
according to grades?

403
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,919
I think you've watched
too many idol dramas.

404
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,000
When I was in junior high,

405
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,960
I got very good grades.

406
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Otherwise, how can I get
into the same senior high

407
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,080
as Mr. Yu?

408
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,760
Right.

409
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,159
It was just that in senior high,

410
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,119
I was suppressed by annoying people
with this kind of IQ

411
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,919
like Mr. Yu.

412
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:22,119
Eat less.

413
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,080
You might get fat.

414
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,520
It's fine. Let her eat.

415
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,960
Mr. Li requested it.

416
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,960
Did Jingjing get the role?

417
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,400
Pretty much.

418
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,679
We're just waiting to sign the contract.

419
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,479
That's great.

420
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:35,599
But let me tell you.

421
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:36,239
Today,

422
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:37,679
when we went to meet Director,

423
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,559
we encountered a very weird thing.

424
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,320
What happened?

425
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,119
What was it?

426
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,640
Well,

427
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,080
Duan Wu's manager

428
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,559
was giving us a hard time face-to-face.

429
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,159
After being in the entertainment circle
for so many years,

430
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,479
I've never encountered such a thing.

431
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:51,479
Wait, what happened?

432
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,679
Stop fishing for information.

433
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:56,000
I might let things slip.

434
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,679
Then we'll stop making blind guesses.

435
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,960
We're looking forward to be surprised.

436
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,880
Okay.

437
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,640
But speaking of games,

438
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,119
among us,

439
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,719
Jingjing should be
the best player, right?

440
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,640
Honor of Kings, which Jingjing endorses,

441
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,000
is the national game.

442
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,359
We all love playing it.

443
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:14,359
We just couldn't get our ranks up.

444
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:17,039
When will you have the time to carry me?

445
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:22,520
What is your rank?

446
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,359
Platinum.

447
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,599
My rank is higher than yours.

448
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:26,520
If I carry you,

449
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,799
it might increase the difficulty.

450
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,719
Give me your mobile phone.

451
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,840
I'll help you play one game.

452
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,239
Sure.

453
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,559
Wasn't she intentionally giving you
a hard time?

454
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,520
I know, right?

455
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,039
What did

456
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,320
she mean by that?

457
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,880
Don't they want to work with us anymore?

458
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,520
Duan Wu just became popular last year,

459
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,719
and he's so arrogant already this year.

460
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,039
That has nothing to do with him.

461
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,440
Later on,

462
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,760
he explained it to me via WeChat.

463
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,640
He said that their company

464
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,960
wanted to replace his manager.

465
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,280
I think she heard some news about it,

466
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,280
so

467
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,119
she did that on purpose.

468
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,239
She was trying to give both of us
a hard time.

469
00:15:59,239 --> 00:15:59,799
I'm sure that Mr. Li

470
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,119
didn't have a good impression
of Duan Wu.

471
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,559
So that's the reason.

472
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,599
What did you do then?

473
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,320
I got her phone,

474
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,960
and won

475
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,080
Most Valuable Player.

476
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,760
- Well done.
- What do you think, Mr. Yu?

477
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,080
I didn't embarrass you, right?

478
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,000
Good job.

479
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:17,640
Jingjing, you're so good right now?

480
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,239
Her rank

481
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:19,520
is just Platinum.

482
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,320
Look at how pleased she is.

483
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,200
Right.

484
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:25,280
Eat up.

485
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,280
Jingjing.

486
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm considered

487
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,799
as the one who initiated you
into this game.

488
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,679
Right?

489
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,760
How can you easily

490
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,719
switch... switch to another teacher?

491
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,359
He's jealous.

492
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,320
Mr. Yu.

493
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,200
Do you want

494
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:45,400
to have a one-on-one game?

495
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,320
A solo?

496
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,919
Do a solo game!

497
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,640
- Solo!
- Solo!

498
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,599
You can't go easy on him

499
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,799
just because it's his birthday.

500
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:55,840
Well... Let's eat first.

501
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,280
We'll play.

502
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,799
You guys eat.

503
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,799
We'll play while eating.

504
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,479
Let's have a one-on-one game.

505
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,280
Come on.

506
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,440
Hurry.

507
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,580
(Diao Chan, Guo VS
Baili Shouyue, Jade Rabbit Pounding Elixir)

508
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,000
(Prepare to engage)

509
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,980
(Yu Tu's First Blood)

510
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,420
(Yu Tu's Second Kill)

511
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,580
(Yu Tu's Killing Spree)

512
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,719
Nice.

513
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,880
My hero won't do.

514
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,199
I'll use another one.
Let's play one more round.

515
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,119
Sure.

516
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,119
Hey, you're playing again?

517
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,400
Come on, hurry.

518
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes, he's good.

519
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,839
He can do it.

520
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,359
Mr. Guo, you can do it.

521
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,560
All the best.

522
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,040
Why do I feel

523
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,560
like Mr. Guo is going to lose again?

524
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,479
Touch wood.

525
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,060
(Defeat, Victory)

526
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:19,680
This... This is what we'll do.

527
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,880
Let's use the same hero.

528
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,400
Last round.

529
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,160
Sure.

530
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:24,959
Come on.

531
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:25,839
Mr. Guo, I'll give you some motivation.

532
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,599
All the best.

533
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,180
(Hou Yi, Jade Rabbit Pounding Elixir VS
Hour of Glory Hou Yi, Guo)

534
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,680
He lost again.

535
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,319
Forget it.

536
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:50,800
I know

537
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,280
what happened.

538
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,920
I didn't have lunch today.

539
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,760
Right.

540
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,239
I feel dizzy, so...

541
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:57,000
Come on.

542
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,959
We understand.

543
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:58,880
Have some beef.

544
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,520
Eat more.

545
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,479
This is cooked, right?

546
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,839
Here, have some beef.

547
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,920
Besides,

548
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,599
well...

549
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,239
Friendship is the priority,
competition comes second.

550
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:05,680
Right?

551
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,400
- Right.
- Right.

552
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,079
Right.

553
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,319
Right.

554
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,319
Here, Mr. Yu.

555
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,959
This beef of friendship smells so good.

556
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,599
Don't say that.

557
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
Don't be so naughty.

558
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,239
All right.

559
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,079
Mr. Yu.

560
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,719
You're the only one

561
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:21,959
who can deal with her now.

562
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,560
She's jealous.

563
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,520
You insist on letting everyone
be jealous of me.

564
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,160
Here, Mr. Guo.

565
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,119
Happy birthday.

566
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,319
Come on.

567
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,199
- Mr. Guo, happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

568
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,880
Happy birthday.

569
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,959
My goodness.

570
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:41,959
This is

571
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:42,560
too exaggerated.

572
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,280
Do you want it?

573
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,479
What's the matter?

574
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:47,040
It must be five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

575
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,520
Right, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

576
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,199
Listen, don't be so arrogant.

577
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:51,000
Right.

578
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,719
I'm so furious.

579
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:52,280
That's indeed the case.

580
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,160
Come on.

581
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,079
But you don't need

582
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,520
to consider my opinion too much.

583
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,359
I haven't paid attention to it
for many years already.

584
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,119
I've only checked the situation lately.

585
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,520
No.

586
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,000
I think what you said makes sense.

587
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:04,160
I should definitely
reduce holdings accordingly.

588
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,640
Mr. Yu.

589
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,040
Look,

590
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,800
you're handsome and talented.

591
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,359
When you just arrived,

592
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,599
I.. I really thought

593
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,239
that you were
from the entertainment circle.

594
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:15,760
After we played games later on,

595
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,280
you're

596
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,920
definitely a professional.

597
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,520
I'm curious. What...

598
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,040
What exactly is your job?

599
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,680
Next month,

600
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,400
I'll go to work at an investment bank.

601
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,199
An investment bank?

602
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,920
No wonder.

603
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:39,479
You're incredible.

604
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:42,040
Not everyone

605
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,800
can work in an investment bank.

606
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,040
Guo.

607
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,520
Come here.

608
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,880
I'm having such bad luck.

609
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,959
Does anyone want this?

610
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,359
When was your luck good?

611
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:51,760
She can't survive without me.

612
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,719
Hurry.

613
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:53,560
Make yourself at home.

614
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:55,520
Okay, I'm coming.

615
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,839
I need one more card.

616
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
One more card. I need one more card.

617
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,079
Does anyone want this card?

618
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,160
No, we don't want it.

619
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:29,800
It's so refreshing here.

620
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:31,040
Yes.

621
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,319
Are you really planning to work
at an investment bank?

622
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,280
Actually, in senior high,

623
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,839
I always admired you.

624
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,520
Because you always got
a perfect score

625
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,599
in Math and Physics.

626
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,400
Back then, I thought

627
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:14,680
that you'd

628
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,760
probably become

629
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,319
a very incredible scientist.

630
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,199
That way,

631
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,040
I'd probably feel very honored too

632
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,760
as your classmate.

633
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:28,640
I'll probably disappoint you.

634
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,479
No.

635
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,119
It's good to work
at an investment bank too.

636
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:35,959
I think

637
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:36,920
that no matter what you do,

638
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,079
you'll be very incredible.

639
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:53,000
Someone once said

640
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:54,760
that I was very selfish.

641
00:22:59,239 --> 00:22:59,959
I'm capable

642
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:00,719
of giving my family

643
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:02,000
a better life,

644
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:03,359
yet I'm being selfish

645
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:05,000
by letting my family sacrifice

646
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,839
for my so-called dream.

647
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,520
Then you should tell that person,

648
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,439
"I'm sorry.

649
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,560
This is the only thing I'm capable of."

650
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:24,479
Think about it.

651
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:26,000
If you can't do everything well

652
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,800
like you do now,

653
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,319
and you can only do one thing well,

654
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:30,599
based on people's standards,

655
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,959
you're actually
very outstanding already, right?

656
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,680
Will anyone say that you're selfish?

657
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:36,079
I'm sure the person said
that you were selfish

658
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,400
because you have too many types

659
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,239
of outstanding capabilities.

660
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,280
How can he blame you

661
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
because you're outstanding?

662
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,239
I think I have good logic.

663
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,040
Am I wrong?

664
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,119
Right.

665
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,719
You're so smart.

666
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,680
Everything you say is right.

667
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:55,920
Of course.

668
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,319
I didn't expect us

669
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,640
to talk about these things one day.

670
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,199
Yes.

671
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Compared to this, what's even weirder

672
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,280
is that I taught you
how to play games one day.

673
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,199
Weren't you tricked into it?

674
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:18,800
By the way,

675
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:19,920
why is it

676
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,400
Chief Coach of 80 Heroes?

677
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:22,359
Doesn't Honor of Kings

678
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,760
have over 100 heroes?

679
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,560
Do you have OCD?

680
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,000
You insist on letting me explain.

681
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,439
Because I'm not worthy of practicing

682
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,599
the remaining 20 heroes.

683
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,520
For example, Li Bai, Wan'er,

684
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,760
Sima Yi, Zhuge Liang.

685
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,119
I won't count them anymore.

686
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,599
It hurts my pride to count them
one by one.

687
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,359
Right.

688
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:42,959
Ms. Qiao.

689
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,199
You just

690
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,800
don't have time to practice them.

691
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,839
Of course.

692
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,640
That's the reason.

693
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,880
You said that you'd work
at the investment bank next month.

694
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,199
When exactly is it?

695
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,680
Around the middle of the month.

696
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:00,839
Then you can keep teaching me

697
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,119
until the match.

698
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,439
Sure.

699
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,920
We're friends now, right?

700
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,599
Of course.

701
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,079
Weight Gain and Ace Plan begins.

702
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,520
Our goal is

703
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:20,719
(Jingjing's All New Battle Plan:)
to reach Ace rank within ten days.

704
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,439
Within 30 days,

705
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,199
gain five pounds

706
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,000
in weight.

707
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,439
Don't be so agitated.

708
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:41,560
My plan

709
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,719
just has a minor problem.

710
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,040
I executed it too fully.

711
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,199
I think you're the one who's too full.

712
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,439
Didn't you say

713
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:50,280
that you'd increase
your weight gradually

714
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,079
in 30 days?

715
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,000
Why did you gain five pounds

716
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,280
in one week?

717
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,439
Can I control

718
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,040
my weight?

719
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,319
Doesn't it have a mind

720
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:59,199
of its own?

721
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:01,479
Control yourself, okay?

722
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,319
Don't gain 15 pounds

723
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,560
in 30 days.

724
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,599
That blogger

725
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,719
will bash you again later on.

726
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,400
Don't worry.

727
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,599
I checked using an alternate account.

728
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:08,800
Someone took a photo of her
on the streets.

729
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,959
She gained at least ten pounds.

730
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:10,599
Her face is so big.

731
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,599
She even dares to comment about me?

732
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
Your weight gain plan

733
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,199
is a success.

734
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,959
What about the plan
to raise your ranking?

735
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:17,160
It's even more successful.

736
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,160
I'm already in Diamond 1 rank.

737
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,439
I'll reach Ace rank soon.

738
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,079
That's fast.

739
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,880
Mr. Yu is carrying you, right?

740
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,599
How is that possible?

741
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,760
I've been playing alone.

742
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,439
Mr. Yu is so cold.

743
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,199
I encountered
teammates that set me up consecutively,

744
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:31,599
lost ten times in a row,
and he wouldn't carry me.

745
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,959
Tonight,

746
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:34,839
after my last big meal,

747
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,760
I'll start to control myself.

748
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,520
I'm hanging up.

749
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,560
No, I...

750
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:42,719
That brat.

751
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,319
When playing alone,

752
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:46,920
you'll encounter

753
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,359
all sorts of situations and teammates.

754
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:50,079
It's beneficial in training
your personal capability.

755
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,400
And during the match,

756
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,040
you'll have two teammates
whom you don't know.

757
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,000
You don't know their competence.

758
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,160
So

759
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:58,119
you must plan for the worst.

760
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,280
Also,

761
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,719
you were the one who set others up
in the previous round,

762
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,079
not the other way around.

763
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:05,760
For two team fights,

764
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,239
you engaged in the team fight when
your teammates hadn't caught up yet.

765
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:08,920
You were too impatient.

766
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
I recorded them.

767
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,040
Take a look.

768
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,560
Wait.

769
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,880
I'll weigh myself again.

770
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,560
The figure earlier was
before I had breakfast.

771
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:34,560
(After having lunch,)

772
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,400
(I'm already 105 pounds.)

773
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,640
(Even if it would usually go down)

774
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,160
(in the morning,)

775
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,959
(if I continue)

776
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:41,119
(having a big meal tonight,)

777
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:41,520
(perhaps)

778
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,400
(I'll have an inflated weight
of 106 pounds.)

779
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,719
(Should I still eat)

780
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:46,599
(at the place we reserved then?)

781
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,400
(I haven't gone out for a meal
in a long time.)

782
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,920
(But as a female celebrity,)

783
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,839
(how can I weigh 107 pounds?)

784
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,000
Earlier,

785
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,160
I was a bit too strict.

786
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,959
This is what we'll do.

787
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,479
Before 5:30 PM,

788
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:18,479
if I can reach Ace rank,

789
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:18,839
let's still

790
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:19,959
go out to eat.

791
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:20,839
But starting tomorrow,

792
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,160
we can't do that anymore.

793
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:32,880
Come and watch the video
from the last round.

794
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,439
Hurry.

795
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:37,199
Your future child

796
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:38,280
will surely be very pitiful.

797
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,239
Hurry up.

798
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,439
How would I know

799
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:52,680
where they are then?

800
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,160
Last time, I told you

801
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:00,479
some jungle battle concepts

802
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,160
and key positions.

803
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,040
I forget when I'm playing.

804
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:08,680
After being caught a few more times,

805
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:09,959
you'll remember.

806
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,839
Go on watching.

807
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,119
Do you understand now?

808
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:19,400
Yes.

809
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:20,640
How can you find

810
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,800
so many problems?

811
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:22,719
When you're in the match,

812
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,079
thousands of viewers

813
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,160
will be watching more carefully
than I am.

814
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:27,640
Okay.

815
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,000
I'll begin then.

816
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,359
You still need four stars
to reach Ace rank.

817
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,839
You still have one and a half hours

818
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,199
before 5:30 PM.

819
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,079
Basically, winning is the only option.

820
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:39,880
You can't lose.

821
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,880
Begin, I'll watch.

822
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,920
Timi.

823
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:43,560
Consider that I am

824
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,040
your endorser.

825
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,119
(The enemy's army will arrive
on the battlefield in five seconds.)

826
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,160
(Please get ready.)

827
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,040
Why is someone away
from the keyboard now?

828
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,560
Our Jungler is amazing.

829
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,000
I can't believe he got five kills already.

830
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,060
(Diamond)

831
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:10,959
Go on playing.

832
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,180
(Diamond)

833
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,119
Look.

834
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,160
I'm the Most Valuable Player.

835
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,719
Thirty-three percent damage.

836
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,920
Don't be too proud.

837
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,640
There's one more round.

838
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,239
I think their Mid and Jungle players

839
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:34,239
are fighting.

840
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:35,520
They just stood there for me to kill.

841
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,780
(Victory, Diamond)

842
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,220
(Ace)

843
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:46,839
What happened?

844
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,000
Wasn't it supposed to be difficult
to advance to the next rank?

845
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:53,800
It seems like Timi

846
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,719
wants their endorser to eat more.

847
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,959
Where are we eating?

848
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,440
(Xinjian Road Tunnel)

849
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:19,307
(Ye Olde Station Restaurant)

850
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,439
Why is there such a long line?

851
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,719
I remember that this restaurant

852
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:24,079
wasn't that popular before.

853
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:24,959
I think they got

854
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,160
on the Michelin guide a while ago.

855
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,439
But we made a reservation.

856
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:28,280
We don't need to wait.

857
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:29,079
Jingjing.

858
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:29,680
Mr. Yu.

859
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,560
Go inside first.

860
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,760
I'll return some stuff to the brand.

861
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,880
I'll come to find you later.

862
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:33,719
Okay.

863
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,119
You go ahead.

864
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:38,800
That's what I was thinking too,

865
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,920
so that you won't get photographed
because of me.

866
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,280
Hello.

867
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,359
Reservation for Ms. Zhu.

868
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,280
Please come inside.

869
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,000
Thank you.

870
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:00,719
This is the room Ms. Zhu booked.

871
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,199
Let's order a few more dishes.

872
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:25,880
If we can't finish them,

873
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,040
you can bring takeout to So Panicky.

874
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,839
I want to try

875
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,959
a few dishes.

876
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,640
Jingjing.

877
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,199
I want to ask a favor.
