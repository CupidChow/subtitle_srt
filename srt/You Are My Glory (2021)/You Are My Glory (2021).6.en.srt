00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,520
(What do you want for breakfast?)

15
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:09,959
(Anything.)

16
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,119
(Finally awake?)

17
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,880
(I bought you breakfast.)

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,840
(Thanks, Mr. Yu)

19
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:32,319
Jingjing,

20
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,160
I suppose I don't have

21
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,039
to buy you breakfast today again?

22
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,079
You're asking me now?

23
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,639
Stop playing dumb.

24
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,880
I just woke up.

25
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,760
Mr. Yu took my job

26
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,880
so I have quickly adopted

27
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,599
the habit of sleeping in.

28
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,800
He sent me a message on WeChat

29
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,120
and said that
he already bought the breakfast.

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,279
It should arrive soon.

31
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,639
However,

32
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,079
what he bought these two days

33
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,279
are high in calories.

34
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,200
I gave him an earful yesterday.

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,519
I wonder

36
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,279
if he'll learn today.

37
00:02:58,999 --> 00:02:59,639
Jingjing,

38
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,999
do you notice that

39
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
ever since

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,040
you gave Mr. Yu that bottle of wine,

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,159
he started to

42
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:08,359
behave differently.

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,519
He'll ask you

44
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,040
if you want breakfast or not.

45
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,840
That's to be expected.

46
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,320
I was keeping him company that day.

47
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,079
I'm such a sweet person.

48
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,359
He must have been touched
by my kindness.

49
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:21,359
Really?

50
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:22,320
You were busy

51
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,200
posting selfies
in the group chat that day.

52
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,920
More than ten selfies, at least.

53
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,840
Let me count them.

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,359
You see, that's my trick.

55
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:31,320
That's how I make him relax.

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,279
It's hard for me to explain it

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,040
to someone
who doesn't share my high EQ.

58
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
I have to go now.

59
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,760
I'm trying to find out
how to brew coffee.

60
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,480
See you!

61
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,660
(139 cal. 112 kcal.)

62
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,380
(186 kcal.)

63
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,559
The calories of today's breakfast

64
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,359
should be within the limit you set.

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,399
What a quick learner!

66
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,920
As expected from a brainiac.

67
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,760
I simply used addition...

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,320
By the way,

69
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,200
I made you coffee.

70
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,679
It's in the kitchen.

71
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:25,679
Find it yourself.

72
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,720
I feel like this is unfair.

73
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,320
How so?

74
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,200
I came all the way
to bring you breakfast

75
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,639
and now,

76
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,839
I have to get the coffee myself too.

77
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,200
But I

78
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,559
brewed the coffee.

79
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,320
I even drew something

80
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,600
on the foam.

81
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
I don't know what you drew

82
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,839
but I appreciate it.

83
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,639
Wait!

84
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,880
Can't you tell it's a rabbit?

85
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,920
Look at those ears.

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,959
So obvious.

87
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,359
I was wondering

88
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,239
why you drew three parabolic lines.

89
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,480
You lack artistic perception.

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,440
Should we

91
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,920
matchmake on 5v5 today?

92
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,280
You have been playing for a while.

93
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,920
Which heroes do you like?

94
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,119
Wang Zhaojun, Angela,

95
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,639
Donghuang Taiyi, Cai Wenji,

96
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,160
Yu Ji, and Luban No. 7.

97
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,320
They are all good.

98
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,359
But my favorites

99
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,920
have to be Zhuge Liang and Li Bai.

100
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:48,839
They are the flashiest in the Valley.

101
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,119
You can't use heroes

102
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,160
with high mobility.

103
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,280
Judging

104
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,639
from the matches these few days,

105
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,519
you should

106
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,239
avoid Jungler.

107
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,799
During the casual match,

108
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:03,559
find a

109
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:04,439
professional

110
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,160
jungler.

111
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,920
The positions that suit you the most

112
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,080
are mid

113
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,160
and bottom.

114
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,640
So, Marksman, Mage, and Support.

115
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:13,759
For Mage, you can use Angela,

116
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,119
Ganjiang Moye, or Xiao Qiao.

117
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,359
They have long ranges

118
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
so they suit your play style.

119
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,679
As for Support,

120
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,439
you can go for Donghuang Taiyi,

121
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,559
Zhang Fei, Niumo, or Zhuang Zhou.

122
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,640
They are very forgiving.

123
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,080
Zhang Fei?

124
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,759
He has simple abilities.

125
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:31,759
Very easy to use.

126
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,480
As for Marksman,

127
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,720
you like Yu Ji?

128
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:41,759
Her skill 3 is useful.

129
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,920
Her skill 2 allows me
to run for my life.

130
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,879
You sure run very quickly, though.

131
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,359
A compliment?

132
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,960
You never leave
other players high and dry

133
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,679
but you drop me like a hot potato.

134
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,480
I have always wanted to know

135
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,480
what you're

136
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,520
thinking.

137
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,679
I just have faith in you.

138
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,960
Thank you.

139
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,840
But they are not flashy enough.

140
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,160
Not cool enough.

141
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,920
If you want someone flashy,

142
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,960
you can use

143
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,080
this Marksman.

144
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:34,960
Which is...?

145
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Baili Shouyue.

146
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,700
(Defeat)

147
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,999
His abilities are flashy.

148
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,400
Long-range sniping.

149
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,080
Are you sure that I can play him well?

150
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,119
Your aim is good.

151
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,160
You hit the enemy

152
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,679
with Yu Ji's skill 1 quite consistently.

153
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,319
You had a bad game just now because

154
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,879
one, your teammates
took resources from you and

155
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,799
two,

156
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,199
you need to sidestep better.

157
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,359
Yu Ji and Baili Shouyue

158
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,679
require kiting

159
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,239
but they are not

160
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,600
as demanding as Sun Shangxiang

161
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,799
and Marco Polo.

162
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:28,239
You can still use them.

163
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,400
But for the latter two,

164
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
you...

165
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
I don't have any word for it.

166
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,040
You're harsh, you know.

167
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:37,840
Your comments

168
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,160
regarding my Nakoruru

169
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,840
were circulating

170
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,520
in the office thanks to Xiao Zhu.

171
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,920
What did I say?

172
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,119
Feeder and suicidal.

173
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,600
It was an objective view.

174
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Stop laughing!

175
00:08:58,439 --> 00:08:59,400
Other than sidestepping,

176
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,480
you also lack map awareness.

177
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,960
You always ask a lot of questions

178
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,160
while you're playing.

179
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,359
Such as?

180
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,799
Where should I go?

181
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
What should I do?

182
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,520
Should I use my ultimate skill?

183
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,840
From now onwards,

184
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:13,600
we'll spend half a day practicing,

185
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,799
and another half

186
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,999
watching pro games.

187
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,199
Before the match,

188
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:21,879
you need to come up with

189
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,879
a basic overview of

190
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,400
both parties' composition.

191
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,199
Are they early game-focused
or late game-focused?

192
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,359
What will they do?

193
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,559
What will you do?

194
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,600
Start with the red buff
or the blue buff?

195
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,920
Any early invasion?

196
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,080
These are all strategies.

197
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,879
I guess.

198
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,439
Do you have a pen

199
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,799

The only difference is that

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,599
you need to clear minions
before level four.

217
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,280
Got it now?

218
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,040
At night,

219
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:38,079
watch some pro games

220
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,040
and try it out.

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,959
then you'll pass this test.

That's a lot.

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,360
I kind of hate you now.

226
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,400
What?

227
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:57,280
I mean,

228
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,719
you're merciless,

229
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,360
demanding, and deadly serious.

230
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,599
If you had taught me maths

231
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:03,599
in high school,

232
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,760
I could have gotten into Tsinghua too.

233
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,520
What's your result
in the National College Entrance Exam?

234
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:13,880
How dare you ask me this question?

235
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,160
Mine was like

236
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,599
70 or 80 points lower than yours.

237
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,520
Your score was too high anyway.

238
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:24,599
If I could get into Tsinghua,

239
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,319
I could be one of the

240
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,439
smartest actresses.

241
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,799
My fans would be over the moon.

242
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:36,679
If your fans knew that

243
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,439
you want to get into Tsinghua for them,

244
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,479
they would be really happy.

245

It's not because of...

246
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:49,679
Let's call it a day.

247
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,880
I'll head back now then.

248
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,520
All right. Take care.

249
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,599
I'll stay here.

250
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,400
Nexus and I are tired now.

251
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,760
I think Nexus is fine.

252
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,920
See you tomorrow.

253
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,079
I have to go to Jiangsu tomorrow

254
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,240
for the Double 11 Celebration.

255
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,400
I'd like to take a day off.

256
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,040
Okay.

257
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,319
Feel free

258
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:08,479
to watch my performance.

259
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:09,360
I'll sing

260
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,000
but my slot is quite late.

261
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,120
Send me a message

262
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,079
before you perform then.

263
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,959
You want a reminder?

264
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,040
Who are you, a VIP?

265
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,319
Respect your teacher.

266
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,719
All right, Mr. Yu.

267
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,559

What have you been up to recently?

273
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,240
You always sneak out

274
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,160
early in the morning

275
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,439
then come back late.

276
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,400
I went out to be a tutor.

277
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,360
What?

278
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,520
Nothing.

279
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,679
Are you heading out now?

280
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,280
Why so mysterious?

281
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,640
Didn't I tell you already?

282
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,280
I'll be out with Dragon King
for two days.

283
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,439

Yes.

286
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:31,799
For some good food and good times.

287
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,479
Let's go.

288
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,760
I'm not as free as you.

I dare say that if Jingjing

306
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,000
wears this gown,

307
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,679
she'll look even better
than the supermodels.

308
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:13,799
Of course.

309
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,319
Your fans haven't met you
for half a month.

310

You need to surprise them tonight.

You look so good.

I'm a female celebrity.

314

315
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,240
can you be then?

316
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,040

Speaking of which,

321
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,640
now that the rehearsal is over,

322
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,280

324
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,760
Time for you to practice.

325
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,719
No, I want to take a break.

326
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:37,160
Give me the phone.

327
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,000
I will never

328
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,280
click on Honor of Kings.

329
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,439
I'll watch live broadcasts.

330

Yes.

332
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,760
I won't press on that icon.

333

When you put it this way,

334
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,280
it becomes clearer.

335
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,479
I haven't really

336
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,439
researched this area.

337
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:56,920
It seems like

338
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,520
you have covered more ground.

339
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,599
If you want, I can

340
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,719
send some

341
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:03,439
latest research papers to you.

342
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:04,079
Yes, please.

343
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,679
Let me brush up on this area.

344
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,240
That said,

345
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,199
I really hope that

346
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,079
you can

347
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,280
join my team soon.

348
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,760
That way, everything can run more smoothly.

349
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,000
We have two projects

350
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,760
pertaining

351
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,599
to this field next year.

352
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,319
We need an analyst

353
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:19,599
who's well-versed in this area.

354
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,520
This area

355
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,280
has become popular recently.

356
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,479
Truth be told,

357
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,959
we have candidates who can

358
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,000
do this.

359
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,880
But personally,

360
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
I want you

361
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,319
to join my team.

362
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,160
After all, we're friends.

363
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,880
Right?

364
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:35,439
Also, you told me that

365
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:36,920
you gave your professor your word that

366
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,880
you'd think this through

367
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,199
this month.

368
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:40,520
I won't rush you.

369
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,439
Once you make up your mind,

370
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:42,439
you tell me.

371
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:43,079
Today is just

372
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,679
a friendly get-together.

373
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:50,719
Thanks,

374
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,800
Ren Wang.

375
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,759
Don't be so polite.

376
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,479
Come.

377
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,519
Here's hoping that

378
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,160
you'll be back on the Earth soon.

379
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,940
(You have one new notification.)

380
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,080
(Are you there?)

381
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:11,800
(Yes.)

382
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,719
(I'm bored.)

383
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,959
(Let's play a game.)

384
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,840
(I'm hanging out with Ren Wang.)

385
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
(I need 30 minutes.)

386
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,120
You know,

387
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,279
you're still

388
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,999
the ladies' man

389
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,400
Do you know that

390
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,679
when you came to my office,

391
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,759
after you left,

392
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:33,759
the girls in my company

393
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,120
kept pestering me

394
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,479
because they wanted to know

395
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,560
who this handsome guy was,

396
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,039
where he was from etc.

397
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:39,800
When they knew that

398
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,560
you might be

399
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,959
a new colleague,

400
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,560
they all went ballistic.

401
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,160
It was just like back then

402
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,719
when you joined the football team.

403
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,479
After you joined

404
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,640
the football team,

405
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,600
everyone in the school

406
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,880
had their eye on us.

407
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,120
My effort

408
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,239
in persuading you

409
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,640
to join us paid off.

410
00:19:58,679 --> 00:19:59,920
So you asked me
to join the football team

411
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,239
solely for my looks?

412
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,080
No,

413
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,360
for your talent.

414
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,800
Good looks

415
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,999
is a talent.

416
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,840
Let's talk about your private life then.

417
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,679
When I met Sandbag that day,

418
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:13,320
he told me that

419
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,880
you're still single.

420
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,880
How can someone

421
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,640
like you

422
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:19,880
remain single?

423
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,719
(Okay.)

424
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:24,800
(Let me know when you're done.)

425
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,920
(I'll play on my own.)

426
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,640
I'm still single.

427
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:31,479
It's good to be single.

428
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,439
No need to find a girlfriend now.

429
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,199
Soon,

430
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,519
you'll be in even higher demand.

431
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:38,719
Oh,

432
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:39,679
do you have any plans

433
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,759
after this meal?

434
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,959
Do you want to

435
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,199
grab a drink

436
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,560
with my friends in the bar next door?

437
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,640
I don't feel like it.

438
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,560
Next time, perhaps.

439
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,959
I have plans.

440
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,519
I knew it.

441
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,600
The nightlife of a handsome guy

442
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,719
is always eventful.

443
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,600
All right then.

444
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,640
I'll let you be.

445
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,279
I'll just let

446
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:56,519
my female colleagues

447
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,279
return home disappointed.

448
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,840
Cheers.

449

(Celebratory Night.
Double 11 Mega Festival)

450
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,519
What are you doing?

451
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,519
It'll be fine.

452
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,920
We still have time.

453
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,800
Mr. Yu asked me to practice.

454
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,039
Can I say no?

455
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,080
I can't.

456
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,239
(30 minutes have passed.)

457
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,360
(Ready now.)

460
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,080
So punctual.
You guys finished your dinner?

461
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,199
Yes.

462
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,120
Are you still in the restaurant?

463
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,479
Did your senior leave?

464
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,519
Yes.

465
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:03,719
He went to the bar.

466
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,800
Without you? Poor thing.

467
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,239
I know right?

468
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,239
He left me alone.

469
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,920
Let me try Niumo this round.

470
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
You'll play Marksman.

471
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,560
Sure.

472
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,600
Oh, I accidentally enabled
the team's voice chat.

I think Niumo
is harder to use than Zhang Fei.

478
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:26,239
I don't know
where to place my ultimate skill.

479
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,519
Just do your best.

480
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:28,840
You'll win anyway?

481
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,239
I'll record it.

482
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,439
And then we'll review it?

483
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,120
Yes.

484
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,560
I knew it.

why do I feel like

488
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,160
your girlfriend is worse

489
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,560
than my girlfriend?

490
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:50,880
It's not like

491
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,400
you're as good as my boyfriend.

492
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,719
I have to win this argument.

493
00:22:58,719 --> 00:22:59,600
Don't mind it.

494
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,199
Settle down.

He is playing Marksman.

496
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,560
I'm not familiar with Li Bai.

497
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,759
Let me invite you next game

and show you
how a good Marco looks like.

You can do it, darling.

Stop arguing

501
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,920
or I'll be away from the keyboard.

502

Today is the Double 11 Festival,
the day of singles.

Couples are everywhere.

504
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,400
I decided to stay home,

505
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:21,999
play some games,

506
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:23,560
and yet, I found two couples.

507
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,080
I'm done.

508
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,199

Yes.

(Magical Bug: Let's fight the enemy
together. Voice chat?)

00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,340
(Sorry, maybe next time. Send)

521
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:08,039
Gaming is exhausting nowadays.

522
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,719
You have to coax those singletons.

523
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,380
(Invites you to a 5v5 match,
Valley of Kings)

524
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,239
The Li Bai from the previous round
invited you.

525
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,840
In the last round, Mr. Yu's Marco

526
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,479
was the MVP.

527
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:19,080
Does he want

528
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,320
to show off his Marco too?

529
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,759
Men are so childish.

530
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
What are you guys talking about?

531
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,999
Seems interesting.

532
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:25,719
Let me see.

533
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,860
(5v5 Party, Magical Bug,
Birds and the Bees, Hand-picked Cotton)

534
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:30,039
Why did your boyfriend
reject my invitation?

535
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,719
Did he chicken out?

536
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,519
Hold on.

537
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,680

reject my invitation? Did he chicken out?)

( Hand-picked Cotton: Hold on.)

539
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,560
Invite me.

540
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,180
(5v5 Party,
Jade Rabbit Pounding Elixir joins in.)

541
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,039
I knew he wanted to show off his Marco.

542
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:01,039
Mr. Yu chose Li Bai.

543
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,800
This is war then.

544
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,080
They swapped heroes.

545
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,640
Look how excited you are.

546
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,719
Why did you disable the voice chat?

547
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:08,360
I'm worried that

548
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,320
Mr. Yu would put on a great show

549
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,880
and you guys start fangirling.

550
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,600
Is his Li Bai that good?

551
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,199
I have never seen him play

552
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,479
Li Bai in 5v5.

553
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:17,719
Technically, he's a talented player,

554
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:19,320
especially with those mobile heroes.

555
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,999
Li Bai?

556
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,600
You're provoking us then.

557
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:28,999
I rarely use him.
Just want to try him out.

558
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,320
You can do this, darling.

559
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,239
All the best, honey!

560
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,960
(Hand-picked Cotton: All the best, honey!)

561
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,480
(So Sleepy: Two couples?)

562
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:41,239
Two couples, I see.

563
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,039
Stay strong. Don't be away from the keyboard.

564
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,360
I won't.

565
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:47,880
I have a cat.

566
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,740
(An ally has been slain!)

567
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,980

(Penta Kill!)

Mr. Yu's Li Bai

577
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:49,880
is so good.

578
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,320
Penta Kill!

579
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,320

580

This is nothing.

581
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:56,920
This hurts my pride.

582
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,600
It's okay, darling.

583
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,560
You're the best.

584
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,679
You can do this.

585
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,900
(Aced)

586
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,060
(Victory!)

587
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,640
Cheer up.

588
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,800
We won.

589
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:19,720
(MVP: ade Rabbit Pounding Elixir)

590
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,479
ade Rabbit Pounding Elixir)
Mr. Yu made up

591
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:22,039
40% of our damage output.

592
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,600
Not bad, Mr. Yu.

593
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,479
Guo

594
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,920
has never gotten a Penta Kill before.

595
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:30,880
He never mentioned it.

596
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:36,439
You're so naughty.

Let's review this part.

606
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,880
You engaged too early.

607
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,279
Your teammates were behind you.

608
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,120
Can you see?

609
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,199
I used Marco Polo

610
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,400
so I could follow up.

611
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,279
But if I used
a short-range Marksman...

612
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,199
Niumo

613
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:48,840
is more suitable for counter-engage.

614
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:52,560
(So why did you)

615
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,439
(recall the message yesterday?)

616
00:29:59,039 --> 00:29:59,640
Come.

617
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,199
Let's watch two pro games

618
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,160
where they used

619
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,239
Niumo.

620
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,479
(It's the Singles' Day.)

621
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:06,600
(I'm already single.)

622
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,999
(And I have to practice
on a holiday like today.)

623
00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:10,120
(Let me use a cool hero at least.)

624
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:12,360
(Niumo is so ugly.)

625
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,240
(Real man!)

626
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,600
Did you see their teamwork?

627
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,039
Did you get it?

628
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,039
Yes.

629
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,600
So,

630
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,439
what did they do then?

631
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:34,279
I...

632
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,439
This screen

633
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:37,880
is too small.

634
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,320
I can't view the team fights clearly.

635
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:40,600
Oh,

636
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
we have a multimedia room.

637
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,999
Should we watch it there?

638
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,920
Not bad.

639
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,800
You have a lightning-fast reflex

640
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:48,360
when you're looking for an excuse.

641
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,080
Let's call it a day.

642
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,080
I have a gathering
with my colleagues tonight.

643
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,199
I have to leave soon.

644
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,080
I'll check out

645
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,320
the multimedia room tomorrow.

646
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,439
You have a lot of gatherings.

647
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,600
Is that not normal?

648
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,199
Also,

649
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,199
it's about

650
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,360
the Singles' Day.

651
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,320
They want to ask me something

652
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,439
about work.

653
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:22,920
Go ahead then.

654
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,479
Practice Supports like

655
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:27,959
Niumo and Zhang Fei.

656
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:28,759
Understood?

657
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Yes.

658
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,600
He's out there

659
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,880
having fun while I have to practice.

660
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:41,320
How nice would it be if I could

661
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:41,920
hang out with you.

662
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,279
You sure you would come
with me if I said yes?

663
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,039
Have fun!

664
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,479
Bye.

665
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:00,999
