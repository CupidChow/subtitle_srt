14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,600
Come here.

15
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,039
Over here.

16
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Pay the bill if you are late.

17
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,560
Yup.

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
I'm not late.

19
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,639
We are all singletons.

20
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,959
Why bother?

21
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:14,479
Yeah.

22
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,080
Come, come.

23
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,519
Shall we toast?

24
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:16,760
Here.

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,999
Cheers.

26
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,559
It's still the same bunch of friends.

27
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,000
Sadly,

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
next year

29
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,680
not all of us will be here.

30
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,519
Yu Tu will work in an investment bank.

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,760
It's a complicated circle.

32
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,400
He won't

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,799
be as passionate as we are.

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,199
Which means,

35
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,720
we will always be one man short.

36
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,519
Maybe we'll have another Guan.

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,239
What's with Guan?

38
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:48,879
Shen Jing's divorcing him.

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,799
No way!

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,680
They're such a loving couple.

41
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,680
She gave up a high-paying job

42
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,760
in America

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,520
just to be with him.

44
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Yes way.

45
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,520
His model task is already arduous.

46
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,279
Since Yu Tu pulled out,

47
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,400
he had to do it all by himself.

48
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,120
He's been working overtime

49
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,120
and hardly had time to see anyone.

50
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
Of course Shen Jing would be mad.

51
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
What about the others?

52
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,680
Didn't they hire two new hands

53
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
before I took leave, right?

54
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,760
What's the point of having new hands?

55
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
No one knows it better than you.

56
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:13,800
Besides, you know

57
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,960
how fussy Guan is.

58
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,199
One screw-up or two,

59
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,320
and he'll dismiss you.

60
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
Stop it, you guys.

61
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,240
Mr. Guan

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,400
even showed off

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,320
a lovely breakfast to me.

64
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
Yeah, Dameng.

65
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,559
You said this out of sheer envy

66
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,999
as a bachelor.

67
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,600
Can you at least aim first?

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,040
Let me see.

69
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,999
Okay, let's dig in.

70
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,960
Just this one.

71
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,320
Yu Tu.

72
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
I recently read a paper

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,040
that gave me some inspiration.

74
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
I want to discuss it with you.

75
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Remember to keep it secret.

76
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,439
Don't divulge our technology.

77
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,800
We only talked
about foreign technology.

78
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,400
What's wrong?

79
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,120
What can we talk about instead?

80
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,800
The real estate market in Lujiazui?

81
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,639
Insolent!

82
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,520
You're not worthy of discussing

83
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,960
the real estate market of Lujiazui.

84
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,680
Remember your place here!

85
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,920
Fine, I'm not worthy.

86
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,520
Okay, let's chow down.

87
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,260
(Gudai Road)

88
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:40,960
(We don't come here very often.)

89
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,719
(Let's sing Karaoke.)

90
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,279
(Yeah.)

91
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,200
(Count me out.)

92
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,279
(I don't know any new songs.)

93
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,839
(You still have me.)

94
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,080
So you're out.

95
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,240
Why me?

96
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,279
You guys go ahead.

97
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,240
I'm not coming.

98
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:55,400
Yu Tu.

99
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,240
Are you really going to leave?

100
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,240
Pretty much.

101
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,520
No matter what,

102
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,680
I wish you a bright future.

103
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,520
All the best.

104
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,319
Alright.

105
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Let's toast.

106
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,120
Best wishes.

107
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
After this...

108
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,120
you'll treat us to dinner.

109
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,120
Yeah.

110
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:39,999
Shall we?

111
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:40,759
Sure.

112
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,360
Okay.

113
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:41,920
Come on.

114
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,640
Bottoms up.

115
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,840

118
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,840

(Match Scoreboard: Victorys, one MVP)
While I'm all alone,

120
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,120

(Wanna see your performance in the match.)

126

(Love you! Jingjing!)

127

(It seems you did it pretty well.)

130

(Yu Tu)

132
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,800
Hello?

133
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,160
Are you playing Wang Zhaojun again?

134
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,399
Are you spying on me?

135
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,879
I just took a look.

136
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,199
Do you want to hang out with me?

137
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,480
Where are you?

138
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,600
You're back.

139
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,399
Is your rendezvous

140
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,280
also nearby?

141
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,800
Pretty much.

142
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,160
They went to karaoke,

143
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,920
but I'm not interested.

144
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,600
Then where are we going?

145
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,959
To the movies.

146
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,160
How about this movie?

147
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,840
Are you doing this on purpose?

148
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Everyone knows

149
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,480
I'm on bad terms with the female lead.

150
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,800
I don't know much about your circle.

151
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,759
What about this?

152
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,120
This movie is pretty good.

153
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,360
But let me tell you

154
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,959
that this male lead

155
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,120
just broke up with his girlfriend,

156
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,600
who happens to be my bestie.

157
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,240
No matter how good the movie is,

158
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,879
I can't betray my bestie.

159
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,480
You choose.

160
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,920
There is an animated film.

161
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,319
It looks like a rerun.

162
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,199
Only the seats by the aisle are left.

163
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,399
Put your finger here.

164
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,639
We have to go quickly.

165
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:33,959
It's in 15 minutes.

166
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,720
Let's split up.

167
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,959
Don't look back.

168
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:05,920
Someone's following us.

169
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,519
Hurry up.

170
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,879
(You get the ticket and go in first.)

171
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,960
(Looks like I'll have
to buy two tickets in one go.)

172
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
(How will you get in?)

173
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,480
(I'll tell you
after you get our tickets.)

174
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,560
(I hope no one else takes his ticket.)

175
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,440
(I feel like)

176
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,279
(being in a spy movie
rather than watching one.)

177
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,679
Excuse me.

178
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,519
Is this seat taken?

179
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,399
I got a ticket from the counter.

180
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:34,480
No.

181
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,540
(A Pixar Production)

182
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,827
(Coco)

183
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,720
(Sometimes, I can't help but wonder)

184
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,200
(what if that didn't happen to us.)

185
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,200
(Did he just tease me?)

186
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,919
(I didn't even tease him back.)

187
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,240
(I'm embarrassing myself)

188
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,360
(in my entertainment circle.)

189
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,039
(Maybe I didn't see it right.)

190
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,720
(What's wrong with music?)

191
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,279
(Nonsense! Music brought us misfortune.)

192
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,679
(You are never to play music again.)

193
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,639
(But please...)

194
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,320
(Miguel,)

195
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,560
(listen to your grandma.)

196
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,159
(No more music.)

197
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,639
(Please let me play once.)

198
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,840
(This is final.)

199
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,279
(Aren't you afraid
you'll end up like him?)

200
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,440
(No one will remember him,)

201
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,720
(and he won't have a place
on the altar.)

202
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,639
(I don't care)

203
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,159
(about being on a silly altar!)

204
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,679
(No!)

205
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,320
(Mother!)

206
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:14,600
(During the college application process,)

207
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,720
(my parents didn't approve.)

208
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,720
So I decided to leave the Galaxy.

209
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,759
(What a coincidence.)

210
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,360
(Doesn't Yu Tu feel bad)

211
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,999
(watching this?)

212
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,639
I will send you home.

213
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,360
The movie just now,

214
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,799
I haven't watched it before,

215
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,720
so I didn't know the plot.

216
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,320
It was nice.

217
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,720
The protagonist

218
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,600
is a fortunate dreamer.

219
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,240
You said you wanted to give up.

220
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,120
Why?

221
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,879
Is it because of your family?

222
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:45,600
But I remember

223
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,240
that your uncle
also works in aerospace.

224
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,879
Why would your parents object?

225
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,120
You know, Peipei, she...

226
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,240
I know.

227
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,679
She's the top gossiper in her circle.

228
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,200
Do your parents still disapprove?

229
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,240
When I went further with
postgraduate study,

230
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,120
they approved.

231
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,720
Then why?

232
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,960
A while ago...

233
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,159
my parents came to Shanghai

234
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,679
without informing me.

235
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,440
Rather, my aunt called me

236
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,639
asking about my mom,

237
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,999
(saying, "Is it benign?")

238
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,120
(That was when I knew
they were consulting a doctor.)

239
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,960
(When I went to see them,)

240
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,120
(they stayed in a budget hotel)

241
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,440
(for one night,)

242
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,999
(In their room,)

243
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,480
(I only saw some cookies
and instant noodles.)

244
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,519
How's your mother now?

245
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,639
She's fine.

246
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,240
It was a false alarm.

247
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,039
But I can't help but wonder.

248
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,440
If anything happens to her,

249
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,720
will I be able to give her

250
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
the best medical treatment,

251
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,240
or have the time

252
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,080
to be with them and care for them?

253
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,840
I won't.

254
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,999
I should be able to,

255
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,600
but I won't.

256
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,320
What are you going to do next?

257
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,360
Work at an investment bank, maybe.

258
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,360
Having abandoned it for so long,

259
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,840
I have to start it all over again.

260
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,639
I've been conceited since I was a kid.

261
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,440
Till when I hit 30,

262
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,120
I've accomplished nothing.

263
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,039
Let's go.

264
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,919
It's late.

265
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:57,800
Son,

266
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,239
we really didn't mean
to hide it from you.

267
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,520
When we called you,

268
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,879
your phone was off.

269
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,760
Then, when you called back later,

270
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,360
well...

271
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:09,439
the tension was all gone.

272
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,120
We just wanted

273
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,000
to tell you after the results were out.

274
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,800
Besides,

275
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:14,679
you were

276
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:16,520
carrying out your duty.

277
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,280
Telling you

278
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,080
would only make you anxious.

279
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,520
Since your father
is right here with me,

280
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,399
what's there to worry about?

281
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,439
Right?

282
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,879
The doctor said I was fine.

283
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,080
We are not going anywhere.

284
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,040
It's pretty good here.

285
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:37,760
Besides,

286
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,840
your place is too far away,
it's inconvenient.

287
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,760
The doctor said I was fine,

288
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,600
we'll head home tomorrow.

289
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,239
She's right.

290
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,879
Don't worry. I'm really okay.

291
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:56,679
(80 yuan per night,)

292
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,760
(upfront.)

293
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,320
Thanks.

294
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,399
(I still have)

295
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,479
(an examination report
to pick up tomorrow.)

296
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,879
(Leave Yu Tu alone.)

297
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,479
(He's busy with his work.)

298
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:18,840
(If he)

299
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,560
(can't take leave to spend time with us,)

300
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,199
(he will feel depressed.)

301
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,280
(I didn't ask him to come.)

302
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:27,159
(Why don't you believe me?)

303
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,439
(Say,)

304
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,040
(why do we need
our son to be a high achiever?)

305
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,959
(At times like this, I think)

306
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,199
(that he ought to find a job)

307
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:37,760
(in our little hometown,)

308
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,239
(or dabble in finance.)

309
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,840
(At least he'll have more free time.)

310
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,879
(You may not be a high achiever,)

311
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:46,199
(but our son is doing so well.)

312
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:47,639
(We should support him.)

313
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:48,879
(Yeah, yeah.)

314
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,600
(Good thing I'm okay now.)

315
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,840
(With the savings we have,)

316
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,239
(we can't afford to overspend a penny.)

317
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,239
(When he forms his own family,)

318
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,719
(he'll have to pay for
other daily expenses.)

319
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,000
(He returned half of the money)

320
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,840
(you gave him for
the house loan down payment.)

321
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,760
(I guess he doesn't have)

322
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,280
(any money left with him.)

323
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,399
Something came across my mind,

324
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:36,399
a quote that describes you well.

325
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:39,800
What is it?

326
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,239
But you are already

327
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,320
the rabbit who has seen

328
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,280
the most stars.

329
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,360
From Jade Rabbit's official account
on Weibo?

330
00:21:58,959 --> 00:21:59,399
Yeah.

331
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,159
I was almost convinced by what you said.

332
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:16,080
How could you say

333
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,280
you accomplished nothing?

334
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,879
Even if you want to give up

335
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,840
your previous career

336
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,919
and start over,

337
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,280
but your past accomplishments

338
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,360
are still there.

339
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,000
Although I don't know

340
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,120
what you actually did,

341
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,120
it must be very valuable.

342
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,439
So even if you're not

343
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:30,760
doing this anymore,

344
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,479
you don't have to deny the past, right?

345
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,879
At least you strived

346
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:37,199
for your ideals.

347
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,479
It's better to compromise
than never try.

348
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,840
To me, at least it's not a mistake.

349
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,879
Do your best, Jade Rabbit God.

350
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:05,439
Thanks.

351
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,280
(You should go to bed.)

352
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,159
(We'll start doing
ranked matches tomorrow.)

353
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:15,679
(Good night.)

354
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
(But you are already)

355
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,760
(the rabbit who has seen)

356
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,879
(the most stars.)

357
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:16,919
Hey.

358
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:17,800
Jingjing.

359
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,919
I'll tell you two things.

360
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:19,600
First, Mr. Li has returned

361
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,760
from abroad.

362
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,159
He's asking us to meet him

363
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,919
at 3 PM tomorrow.

364
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,600
He invited us himself?

365
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,520
Not really.

366
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,360
We've kept in touch

367
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:27,879
from time to time

368
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,120
over the time he was away,

369
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:30,600
but I didn't

370
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,120
make my intention too obvious to him.

371
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,479
Don't worry about that.

372
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,760
There's one more thing

373
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,000
that's particularly serious.

374
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,879
On Singles' Day,

375
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,120
you went to the movies, didn't you?

376
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,000
They caught me?

377
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,000
Why are you so surprised?

378
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,159
What's so surprising

379
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:47,560
that you'd be seen

380
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,679
go to the movies?

381
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:50,919
I think

382
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:53,080
you should be finding love now.

383
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,320
A gorgeous girl like you,

384
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,399
going to the movies alone
on Singles' Day?

385
00:24:57,399 --> 00:24:57,879
Listen.

386
00:24:57,879 --> 00:24:58,919
As your agent,

387
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,360
I feel ashamed about that.

388
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,840
Singles' Day is not Valentine's Day.

389
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:03,879
And you're actually

390
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,199
encouraging me to find love?

391
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,600
The world is different now.

392
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,320
Not the same as before.

393
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:09,000
Can't you see

394
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,280
your fans are roasting you?

395
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:11,520
"Why is Qiao Jingjing

396
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,120
still single?"

397
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,000
Fine, I guess this is it.

398
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,199
You're going to see Mr. Li

399
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,280
at 3 PM tomorrow,

400
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,959
so get ready for that.

401
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,600
There's nothing special

402
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,919
about Mr. Li's movie.

403
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,080
Why do I have to prepare myself

404
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,719
just for him?

405
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,239
I have watched all his previous works.

406
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:30,239
Good, that's good enough.

407
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,639
When the time comes,
we should be pragmatic.

408
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,600
Bye.

409
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:41,360
Hang on a sec.

410
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,300
(Don't fret! Even a star watches
a movie alone on Singles' Day)

411
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Not bad.

412
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,239
It's pretty spy-ish.

413
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,160
(Save)

414
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:07,600
(I think)

415
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,679
(you should be finding love now.)

416
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,919
(Going to the movies alone
on Singles' Day?)

417
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:12,639
(Listen.)

418
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:13,679
(As your agent,)

419
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,080
(I feel ashamed about that.)

420
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,959
Maybe I could start a relationship.

421
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:18,679
But only if

422
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:20,439
he's as handsome as Baili Shouyue.

423
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:50,280
What was I thinking?

424
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,560
Only I can be

425
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,679
Baili Shouyue.

426
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:02,479
(It's peaceful at the Great Wall today.)

427
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:20,000
Did you let me win on purpose?

428
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,879
I don't believe it.

429
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:26,399
Then what were you asking?

430
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,159
When did I let you win?

431
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:31,199
If you couldn't hit me with a single shot,

432
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,320
then I would have been a failure.

433
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,000
You're right.

434
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,560
You taught me

435
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,679
how to play Baili Shouyue.

436
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,840
I'm going to beat you this time.

437
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,900
(Defeat, Victory)

438
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:51,959
The AI teammates

439
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:53,120
assigned to my team

440
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,439
couldn't control the minions' advance.

441
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,120
Don't blame the AI teammates.

442
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,520
You were going to lose

443
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:58,360
only because

444
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,639
you kept chasing me

445
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:02,120
without farming or destroying towers.

446
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:05,959
I'm practicing, okay?

447
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:08,320
Oh,

448
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,120
Snow's about to go live now.

449
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,320
Let's go check it out.

450
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,520
Ouch.

451
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,320
Live broadcasts have really gone viral.

452
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,719
If I weren't an actor today,

453
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:27,199
I'd like to be a host

454
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:29,199
who sings, plays games,
or something like that.

455
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,080
You, play games?

456
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,719
Of course.

457
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
I didn't play well

458
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,320
because I was

459
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,360
so busy acting.

460
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
If I really want to be

461
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,520
a professional host,

462
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,800
I will definitely practice hard.

463
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
I can't just sing,

464
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,560
or it'll be monotonous.

465
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,560
I can also teach everyone

466
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:51,280
how to make up and dress,

467
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,840
and also yoga.

468
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,600
Come to think of it,

469
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm so versatile.

470
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,080
I could be famous.

471
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:00,879
Zhou Yin hasn't started
his live broadcasts either.

472
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,439
You have an understanding

473
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,360
of pro players now.

474
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,639
Since you took me

475
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:06,159
to a pro game,

476
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:06,760
I have become a fan

477
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,120
of quite a few of them.

478
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:11,000
Zhou Yin and Snow.

479
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,840
They're all good-looking.

480
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,959
Don't think so little of me, okay?

481
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,560
They are good players

482
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,840
who also look good.

483
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,280
It's started.

484
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:24,959
(Sun Shangxiang.)

485
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,520
(It's Sun Shangxiang, right?)

486
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,639
(Don't you guys get bored?)

487
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,320
Actually you can also play e-sports.

488
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:37,080
You'll surely be more viral than them.

489
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,959
E-sports

490
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:45,000
has a high age requirement.

491
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,360
How old do you think they are?

492
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,840
Twenty-something?

493
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,800
The one you're watching is 18.

494
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,280
He's 11 years younger than me?

495
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,760
You mean, 12?

496
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:01,600
I'm 29.

497
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,040
My birthday's next month.

498
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,840
(I've been trying his
Lightning Blade technique lately.)

499
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,639
Attention to detail.

500
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,600
I miscalculated.

501
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,199
(His stamina should be
better than before,)

502
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:11,120
(but the same can't be said
of his firepower.)

503
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
The opponent is too weak.

504
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,280
But the game is good.

505
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:17,800
The semi-finals will be in a few days.

506
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,199
Why don't we go and watch it live?

507
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:20,800
This venue

508
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,959
doesn't seem to be very big.

509
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,439
Aren't you afraid they'll see you?

510
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,280
You're right.

511
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:32,080
How about this?

512
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:33,560
Let's make a guess.

513
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,280
Will Snow use Sun Shangxiang

514
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,719
next round?

515
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:36,879
If he does, we'll go.

516
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,280
If not, we're not going. Okay?

517
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,520
It might have short-circuited.

518
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,280
Last time you tricked me
into fixing the purifier.

519
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:08,159
You said, you had
a full set of tools at home.

520
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,360
Right?

521
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,040
Where is it?

522
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,919
On the shelf in the storage room.

523
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,120
Must be the black plastic box

524
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
on the fourth rack.

525
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,679
Found it.

526
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,040
It hurt my feeling
when you put it that way.

527
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,919
It's not like I tricked you

528
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,320
into playing the game with me.

529
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,719
So you put on an act.

530
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,239
Well, I'm a professional actor.

531
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,520
Do you really know how to fix this?

532
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,000
It's worth the try.

533
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:57,439
(Mr. Li has rescheduled)

534
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:58,959
(the meeting for this afternoon.)

535
00:31:58,959 --> 00:31:59,560
(I will pick you up.)

536
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,159
(I brought you
a makeup artist and stylist.)

537
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:02,399
(Get ready.)

538
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,479
Careful.

539
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,199
It may be a problem
with the power board.

540
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,040
Do you want to replace this board?

541
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,399
That'd be expensive.

542
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:42,679
Might as well fix it.

543
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,159
You aerospace people

544
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:48,320
are also into this?

545
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,120
This is one of the fundamentals.

546
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,919
Aerospace is systems engineering.

547
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,520
You should know a bit of every aspect.

548
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:55,560
Doing the welding alone

549
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:57,199
makes me a first-rate worker.

550
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,439
(The genius)

551
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,600
(is just as narcissistic
as he was in high school.)

552
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,399
Hello?

553
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:08,159
Jingjing.

554
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:09,199
I texted you on WeChat

555
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:10,520
that Mr. Li changed his itinerary.

556
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,800
He'll return to Beijing in the evening.

557
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,679
So we'll meet

558
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:14,040
this afternoon instead.

559
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:15,120
Have you read it?

560
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:16,639
No, I haven't.

561
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:17,399
What time is it again?

562
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,479
Half past three.

563
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:19,800
Me, my makeup artist and stylist

564
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,040
are downstairs.

565
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,919
