28

Zhai Liang is a bad Marksman.

29
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,720

Isn't she the one on QQ?

55
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,679

Yes, it's the one.

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why should I hide there?

61

You can see
if our enemy is surrounding us.

62

Yu Tu,

70

should be responsible for her too.

Sure.

72
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,559
A terrible Marksman like you

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,199
isn't worth being protected.

well in hand,

and get ready for the next scene.

Okay.

108

Yes, I have.

110
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,959
I've bought all the nice skins.

111

I can guarantee that, from now on,

112

you'll be the most handsome one
in the valley.

113

Even if you die in the Valley of Kings,

114
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,279
you'll die
in your most beautiful costumes.

115

That's right.

116

have requested to be your friends.

122

Each one of them will get two skins.

(Gold sharing+1; Gold sharing+2)

124

Then, they'll feel embarrassed

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,839
if they don't invite me.

Do you not want me to stay?

129
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,839
It's okay.

130
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,000
Go spend time with your mom.

131

Okay.

132
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:24,119
I'm leaving.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,959
Take a good rest.

134
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,000

Miss,

139
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,480
you gave me two skins.

140
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,480
Don't get too excited.

141
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,160
I received two too!

142
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,200
Yo, yo!

143
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,480
I got two too.

144
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:54,880
Heroes, please carry me.

145
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,799
Of course.

146
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,480
I have never received skins

147
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,079
from anyone before,

148
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,720
let alone from a girl.

149
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,799
Miss, don't worry.

150
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,239
Dragon King will carry you.

151
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:06,279
Let's start.

152
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:08,920
Yu Tu.

153
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,359
Why didn't you put on

154
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,760
the skin she gave you?

155
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,040
I didn't get any.

156
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:16,720
Oops.

157
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,959
Yu Tu.

158
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,679
I didn't expect you

159
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,359
to get to the bottom of a girl's list.

160
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:27,640
Yu Tu, were you betraying me?

161
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,640
Be smart and retreat.

162
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:31,320
Don't worry.

163
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,480
I've gotten the blue buff.

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,559
We won't lose anything

165
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,760
this round.

166
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,920
(You're still as annoying as always.)

167
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,519
Yu Tu,

168
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,480
I invited a friend to join us.

169
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,480
Together with the four of us,

170
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,359
we'll do 5v5 ranked match.
Are you joining us?

00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:45,679
Sure.

172
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,280
Miss, after this round,

173
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,400
we'll play the ranked match.

174
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,719
We'll see you tomorrow.

175
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,679
Can't I join you?

176
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,919
You won't get any ranking.

177
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,799
You don't have a rank yet, right?

178
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:58,840
Yes.

179
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,599
I have not played
a ranked match before.

180
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,140
(Victory)

181
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:06,599
I got left behind again.

182
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,559
I bought six skins

183
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,359
for nothing.

184
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,640
Does she know that

185
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,919
if she doesn't exit the room

186
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,799
after the game,

187
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,200
we can hear her speak?

188
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:27,000
Why don't you carry her?

189
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,719
I'll invite another person.

190
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,239
After all, you never like playing
the ranked match.

191
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,239
I'm not the one who received her skin.

192
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:34,960
What about this?

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,359
If you win a match, then I'll...

194
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:40,559
No.

195
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,960
If you win two matches,

196
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,559
I'll handle all the chores today.

199
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,640

Look at this.

202

You're such a brute.

203
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:02,960
I just got my four stars,

204
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,960
and you have won a dozen of matches.

205
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
You'll handle the household chores
for a week.

How's it going?

218
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,000
Has she made a lot of progress
in the past two days?

219
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:16,039
Of course.

220
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,719
Really?

221
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:20,359
But, frankly,

222
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,520
Jingjing doesn't have much talent

223
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,000
in playing games.

224
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,559
But, she has extraordinary willpower.

225
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,239
It's true.

226
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:28,599
No matter how badly she's defeated,

227
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,000
she only needs
to have a good night sleep,

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,760
and she'll regain all her enthusiasm
on the next day.

229
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,880
To be fair,

230
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,719
not everyone

231
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,760
can be a celebrity.

232
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,080
You need to have

233
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,479
the tenacity.

234
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,599
That's enough.

Cut straight to the chase.
How's the performance?

Practice a little more, please.

why didn't you tell Ling?

253
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,520
It's more impressive

254
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,880
if I can turn into a peerless master

255

You're not bald yet.

It seems like you people
who do scientific research

are not working as hard as us

who are in the financial industry.

273
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:17,599
Am I right?

274
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,400
Come. Have a seat.

275

Don't just stand there.

I'll make tea for you.

Wait a minute.

280
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,280
Guess who I met at Wuhan

281
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,239
two days ago.

282
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,239
It's Sandbag.

283
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,919
He told me that

284
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,719
you are going to resign

285
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:37,359
from the institute.

286
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:38,159
Is it true?

That's my plan.

288
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,280
But, nothing's final yet.

289
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,479
I'm quite surprised.

290
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,200
Back then,

291
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,039
you were determined to join
the Aerospace Research Institute.

292
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,760
You have been working there
for so many years.

293
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,440
Why are you resigning now?

294
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:54,760
Due to personal issues.

295
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,479
Sure.

296
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,080
Then, I won't press on.

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,159
But, often,

298
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,960
you need to experience it yourself

299
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,640
before you know if it really suits you.

300
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,840
After

301
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,760
you truly understand it,

302
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,520
you'll realize that

303
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:10,359
a lot of things

304
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,520
are different

305
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,440
from what you expected.

306
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:18,000
I guess

307
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,119
you already know

308
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:20,960
why I want to meet you today.

309
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,840
I want to let you know that

310
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,400
if you eventually decide

311
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
to resign from the institute,

312
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,960
you're welcome to join us.

313
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,119
Hey.

314
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,760
Hey.

315
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:57,599
Yu Tu,

316
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,239
have you met Ren Wang?

317
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,080
I just met him.

318
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,119
When Ren Wang visited Wuhan
a few days ago,

319
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:03,280
I bought him a meal.

320
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
I accidentally let it slip.

321
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,679
Will you blame me for being nosy?

322
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:07,960
Of course not.

323
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,840
I've been sending out resumes anyway.

324
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,479
Zhai Liang told me that

325
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:12,080
you received

326
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,640
a letter of offer from DF Capital.

327
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,239
Yes.

328
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,520
But, they want me to

329
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,440
work at the headquarters in Beijing.

330
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,320
That's great.

331
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,599
Because you haven't set foot

332
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,679
in this industry

333
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,520
ever since you graduated
from university,

334
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,000
I thought it'd be difficult for you

335
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
to land a good job.

336
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,719
Apparently, I underestimated you.

337
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,599
Let me tell you.

338
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,880
Both investment banking and
venture capital financing

339
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,760
have their pros and cons.

340
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,280
Think twice about it.

341
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,280
Don't worry. I know what to do.

342
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,960
Okay. I'm going home then.

343
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,320
See you in the valley tonight.

344
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,039
You have been a bit devoted recently.

345
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:39,719
Why?

346
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,520
Is a humble white-collar worker like me

347
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,960
not allowed

348
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,119
to have my own hobby?

349
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:45,520
Besides,

350
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,919
ever since Zhai Liang

351
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,239
brought you in,

352
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,359
I've got more and more pumped up.

353
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:51,000
I didn't expect you

354
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,880
to play so well.

355
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,599
You are

356
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:54,479
quite a good teammate.

357
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,640
I was tricked by Zhai Liang.

358
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,559
You and Zhai Liang
work really well together.

359
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,320
You share the same opinion
on your teammates too.

360
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,559
He's just trash.

361
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,679
I'm hanging up.

362
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,440
See you tonight.

363
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,580
(You've got a new message)

364
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:11,400
(Yu Tu,)

365
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,840
(look at our high school chatroom.)

366
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,640
(Someone uploaded a post)

367
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,919
(about you and Qiao Jingjing.)

368
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:23,140
(Jade Rabbit Pounding Elixir, offline)

369
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,479
He's not online yet.

370
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,439
Hey, Peipei.

371
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,479
You know what.

372
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,920
They have started

373
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:54,680
spreading rumors

374
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,560
in our high school chatroom.

375
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,280
Everyone

376
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,400
is scolding the bastard
who spread the rumors.

377
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,400
Guess what happened next.

378
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,280
What happened?

379
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,839
Yu Tu spoke.

380
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,760
You definitely haven't expected this.

381
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Let me tell you.

382
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,959
Besides

383
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,479
scolding the guy who spread rumors,

384
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,280
there were also a few others

385
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,119
who left insensitive remarks.

386
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,199
Eventually, Yu Tu spoke.

387
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:14,599
He said that he had never said
anything like that,

388
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,959
giving all of them
a slap in their faces.

389
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,359
Immediately, those guys went quiet.

390
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:19,400
Isn't he great?

391
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,439
Yu Tu.

392
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:23,520
Are you free now?

393
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
I'd like to ask you something.

394
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,959
Sure. Go ahead.

395
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,920
Do you want a girlfriend?

396
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,400
If you want one,

397
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,319
what do you think of me?

398
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:40,800
Sorry.

399
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,599
I don't want a girlfriend
for the time being.

400
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:45,959
Why?

401
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,239
Are you worried that
it will affect your studies?

402
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,760
You do sports

403
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,400
and read novels every day,

404
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,680
but your studies
have never been affected.

405
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,079
That's not the reason.

406
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,040
Then, why?

407
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,400
There's nothing wrong with me.

408
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,400
Sorry.

409
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,160
Give me a minute.

410
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,199
You have to tell me why, right?

411
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:11,479
Sorry.

412
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:13,959
I want someone

413
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:15,359
who will work hard together with me.

414
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:30,479
Take a screenshot of the conversation

415
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,479
and send it to me.

416
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,479
I'll do it now.

417
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,119
Wait.

418
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,800
(I haven't said anything
like that before.)

419
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:41,119
(If any of you)

420
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,239
(is still in touch with Qiao Jingjing,)

421
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,719
(send my apologies to her.)

422
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,040
(If there's anything
that requires further explanation,)

423
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:47,239
(I'll do it.)

424
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,920
Apologize to me?

425
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,359
How will you apologize to me?

426
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:52,920
Will you provide an explanation too?

427
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,319
How?

428
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,239
Are you going to post it on Weibo?

429
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,280
You know nothing about
the entertainment industry.

430
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,719
If you have time to spare,

431
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:02,959
why don't you play with me?

432
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,239
Why waste your time in the chatroom?

433
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,420
(Shop, Skin)

434
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,420
(Gold Sharing,
To Jade Rabbit Pounding Elixir, Send)

435
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,719
I've moved

436
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:05,920
all the remaining items here.

437
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,760
I have also terminated the rental.

438
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:10,280
I'll stay here

439
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,599
for a while.

440
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,079
Your house is quite far

441
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,040
from the town.

442
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,239
The traffic was smooth
the last time I came here.

443
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,839
This time,
I was stuck in a traffic jam,

444
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,959
and it took me one and a half hours.

445
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,280
It's near to my workplace.

446
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,760
I visit the town

447
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,520
not more than a few times in a year.

448
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,520
If you're going to work at Lujiazui,

449
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,920
are you going to sell this house?

450
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:40,040
We'll see how it goes.

451
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:43,719
When are you

452
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,560
going to Shenzhen?

453
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,560
I will officially start working
after the New Year.

454
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,119
Don't you want to go home?

455
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,040
Later.

456
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,239
For now,

457
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,439
I'll enjoy my free time here.

458
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,800
If I go home,

459
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,560
they will definitely
pressure me to get married.

460
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,079
They will arrange blind dates for me.

461
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:00,599
Also, I haven't told them

462
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,640
about my resignation.

463
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,839
They will be furious if they find out.

464
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,040
Didn't you go home a few days ago?

465
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,719
How did you

466
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:08,439
break the news to your parents?

467
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,319
I haven't told them anything.

468
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:13,040
You only stayed there for two days.

469
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,920
Why?

470
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,839
Why are you hesitating?

471
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,079
A job that pays you
a million yuan a year

472
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,560
and a taxing job
that pays you only a quarter of that.

473
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,439
Yet, you can't make up your mind?

474
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,520
Is it that difficult?

475
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,560
No one pays me a million yuan a year.

476
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,359
Why not?

477
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:38,439
When you got your degree,

478
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,959
you received so many offer letters.

479
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,640
If you had accepted
either one of those offers,

480
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:43,920
you'd now be earning
millions of yuan annually.

481
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,599
You're silly to have chosen
to work in an aerospace company.

482
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,760
Even if you've earned yourself
a doctor's degree,

483
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,599
and been burning yourself out,

484
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,880
you're still earning so little.

485
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,560
If you hadn't done the research,

486
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,800
and earned yourself some prize money,

487
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,599
how could you have afforded

488
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,520
paying your mortgage loan?

489
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,920
Living your life like this.

490
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,000
You've wasted your intelligence.

491
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,520
At least...

492
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,680
At the very least,

493
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,839
you wouldn't have broken up
with Xia Qing.

494
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,880
Let the bygones be bygones.

495
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,359
You will regret it sooner or later.

496
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:15,280
Where can you find

497
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,760
such a beautiful and smart wife

498
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,640
in the future?

499
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,640
Worry about yourself.

500
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,560
Pfft!

501
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,560
You are lucky you look good.

502
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:31,920
You can't live on

503
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,239
your dreams and sentiment.

504
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:36,839
I have different goals.

505
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,319
I worked hard to earn my degrees.

506
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,560
Now, I want to make
as much money as I can,

507
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,000
and live the best life I can afford.

508
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:46,560
In today's society,

509
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,800
a celebrity and a live-stream seller

510
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:52,000
can earn up to millions of yuan
every minute.

511
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,280
Look at yourself.

512
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,760
You've launched satellites into orbit.

513
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,520
You can ask around.

514
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,680
No one knows who you are.

515
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,479
You've sold your soul for your company,

516
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,000
but is only making so little.

517
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:13,280
Aren't these days

518
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,239
probably

519
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:17,000
the idlest days in your life?

520
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:19,479
You only play games at home.

521
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:22,800
How about this?

522
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,359
You should visit Beijing

523
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:27,719
and meet up with your old friends.

524
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,680
I heard that

525
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,160
Xia Qing is still single now.

526
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,239
Perhaps,

527
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,520
both of you

528
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:37,599
will rekindle your romance.

529
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:41,000
You've been single for so long.

530
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,239
Is it because...

531
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:44,000
No.

532
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,800
I'll never understand you.

533
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:17,839
(For the past two years,)

534
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,920
(you've never taken a day off.)

535
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,239
Let's talk

536
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:27,640
only after you clear your annual leave.

537
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,839
After that,

538
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,719
only shall you make a decision.

539
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,800
I will agree.

540
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,060
(You've got a new e-mail.)

541
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,700
(Hand-picked Cotton sent you two new skins.)

542
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,319
It's so difficult to handle Zhuge Liang.

543
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,000
How did Yu Tu do it?

544
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,319
He comes and goes as he pleases.

(Invitation)

548
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,959
Why is he still not inviting me?

549
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,520
Did my hefty investment

550
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,280
go down the drain?

551
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,400
Have you not seen

552
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,479
the skin I sent to you?

553
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,599
(You don't need to send me skin.)

555
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,599
Hey.

556
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,280
Hello, Jingjing.

557
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,760
You left in such a hurry.

558
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,800
I forgot to tell you that

559
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,920
we will have

560
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,800
a family activity tomorrow.

561

You don't have to practice at the studio

562
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:47,920
tomorrow.

563
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,319
Oh.

564
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,319
Okay.

565
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,280
Then, I'll practice on my own.

566

Do a good job.

567
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:53,880
Guo said that
you had made significant progress.

568
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:54,760
That's all.

569
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:55,479

(to be my coach,)

(when I'm basically a stranger to him?)

578
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,439
Back then,

579
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,719
he even rejected

580
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:46,680
a beautiful girl like me.

581
