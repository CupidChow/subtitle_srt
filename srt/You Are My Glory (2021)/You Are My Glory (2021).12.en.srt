14
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:52,639
Well...

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,919
Yu Tu.

16
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,160
These days,

17
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,319
can I use your mobile phone

18
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,319
to play games?

19
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,120
For the match, we must use

20
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
a phone model meant for
the match.

21
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,480
Your mobile phone happens
to be that model.

22
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,160
I was thinking if I can

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,279
practice with it first.

24
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,360
The passcode is 0424.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Take it from the living room yourself.

26
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,679
Yu Tu.

27
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,759
Did you join our high school group chat?

28
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,479
Yes.

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,479
I didn't.

30
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:40,199
I'm very curious

31
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,559
what our classmates are doing.

32
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,199
Can I

33
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,119
use your WeChat

34
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,800
to check their Moments?

35
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,360
Moments

36
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:50,080
are for friends to see.

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,639
You're their classmate too.

38
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,399
I'll use your WeChat?

39
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,559
Sure.

40
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,700
(WeChat)

41
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,599
(Class 5 Senior 3)

42
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,620
(Xia Qing)

43
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,639
All

44
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,639
our classmates?

45
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:50,759
Yes.

46
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,679
(He doesn't get my point at all.)

47
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:56,240
(Forget it.)

48
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:57,520
(It's good if he doesn't get it too.)

49
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,240
I won.

50
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,839
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

51
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,720
I haven't even mocked Su Lie yet.

52
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll give a thumbs up to my team.

53
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,720
I played so badly earlier,

54
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,000
and they didn't complain about me.

55
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:26,880
All right.

56
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,239
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

57
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,519
I'll help you win one round too.

58
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,720
I think

59
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,040
you should just check WeChat Moments.

60
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,959
I was kidding.

61
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't want to check it.

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,040
What's the matter?

63
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,480
You don't believe that I can win?

64
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:43,640
Do whatever you want.

65
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,519
I'll do that then,

66
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,839
and help you win.

67
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,119
Xiao Zhu is calling you.

68
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:55,920
Help me answer it.

69
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,320
Hey, Jingjing.

70
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,799
A brand sent you a birthday gift

71
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,119
and three big boxes.

72
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,880
I'll tell the driver to bring them up.

73
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:05,880
Wait.

74
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,519
It's not convenient for the driver
to come up.

75
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,959
Can you help me bring them here?

76
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,480
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

77
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,720
Which brand

78
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,279
sent me a birthday gift
so far in advance?

79
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,279
The one you're endorsing.

80
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,959
They send them to you in advance
each year.

81
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,160
All of these?

82
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,399
These three boxes aren't from them.

83
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,160
These are the clothes, bags,
shoes, and stuff

84
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,040
that you bought

85
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,920
last time.

86
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,000
They arrived at the same time.

87
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,959
You can mix and match them

88
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,239
for the next match.

89
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,480
Didn't you tell me

90
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,040
that a brand gave me a gift?

91
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,880
It's this one.

92
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,519
I'll do it.

93
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,160
It's a bit heavy.

94
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,079
Thank you.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,119
It's so heavy.

96
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:57,880
Jingjing.

97
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:58,880
Do you want to see

98
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,160
what the brand gave you?

99
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,720
Just leave it there.

100
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,959
I'll place it in the cloakroom then.

101
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,040
Should I move these to the cloakroom?

102
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,640
No, there's no need.

103
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,279
My cloakroom is very messy.

104
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,160
Actually, I don't

105
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,320
usually buy so many clothes.

106
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,200
Jingjing.

107
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,000
There are too many clothes

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,399
in your cloakroom.

109
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,720
I'll gather those clothes

110
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,160
that aren't suitable for you.

111
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,760
Many of them still have the tags on.

112
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,880
Just like before,

113
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,760
I'll distribute it to everyone.

114
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,959
I'll give some to Peipei.

115
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,880
(Who taught you)

116
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,399
(such an exaggerated acting technique?)

117
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:47,880
That's quite good.

118
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,200
You mean it?

119
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,519
Yes.

120
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,160
I still have some work lately.

121
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,640
I must leave around 6 PM.

122
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,519
What time is it now?

123
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,880
You're leaving now?

124
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,160
What about dinner?

125
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,079
You won't eat anymore?

126
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,399
Xiao Zhu already brought the food.

127
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,359
I'll take the food today.

128
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,519
Starting tomorrow,

129
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,760
you don't need
to bring me dinner anymore.

130
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:24,839
Then

131
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,040
you won't finish watching

132
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Saturday's final match?

133
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:28,519
The official match starts

134
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,160
at around 5 PM.

135
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,519
I'll inform them,

136
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:37,559
and I'll finish watching it
before leaving.

137
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,519
But I might arrive later

138
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,000
in the morning.

139
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,200
Okay.

140
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,720
See you tomorrow then.

141
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,559
See you tomorrow.

142
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,079
But tomorrow,

143
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,399
don't bring me meat buns.

144
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,920
Xiao Zhu.

145
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,160
Can your EQ be any lower?

146
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,279
If you say those things,

147
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,320
and Mr. Yu misunderstands me

148
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,600
as a spoiled girl who doesn't
spend money wisely,

149
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,279
what should I do?

150
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,799
I think

151
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,880
that's not a misunderstanding.

152
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,760
Who says I'm that way?

153
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,959
I work so hard.

154
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,000
I work until so late at night

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,440
and even hang on wires.

156
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,959
Who says that I'm spoiled?

157
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,480
Besides, didn't I buy

158
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
these clothes, bags, and shoes

159
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,880
for work?

160
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,279
Even if I don't wear them,
I give them away.

161
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,119
I didn't let them go to waste.

162
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,839
However,

163
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,760
Mr. Yu said that it was quite good.

164
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,000
Through my beautiful

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,920
and dazzling performance,

166
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,760
he must have seen

167
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,559
my beautiful,

168
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,239
dazzling, and simple heart.

169
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,559
Right.

170
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,640
Mr. Yu must know

171
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,840
that you have a simple heart.

172
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,239
I think so too.

173
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,200
This one is nice.

174
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,679
I can wear this

175
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,840
during the match, right?

176
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,719
Try it on.

177
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,760
And this one is really nice too.

178
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,559
No.

179
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:58,960
This one.

180
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,400
This one.

181
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,280
This one's nice.

182
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,520
That one's nice too.

183
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,039
Take a look.

184
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,400
Yes, this one's nice.

185
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,760
(In-patient Department)

186
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,520
How would I dare to fool you?

187
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,799
I really told Yu Tu already.

188
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,159
He's here.

189
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,239
Ask him

190
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,400
if he has a girlfriend already.

191
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,159
Who says that I didn't work hard

192
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,440
to recommend your junior?

193
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,640
Not to recommend,

194
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,159
it's

195
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:37,840
introduction.

196
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,440
It has only been a while

197
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,640
since you went to my house for a meal.

198
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,159
You have a girlfriend already?

199
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,239
Yes, I do.

200
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:57,919
Is that so?

201
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
What does she look like?

202
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,719
Do you have a photo?

203
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,000
A photo.

204
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,080
It's fine if you don't have one.

205
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,760
It's fine if you don't like her.

206
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,919
Why can't you just be open about it?

207
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:20,919
Look at you.

208
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,159
You've gone too far.

209
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,000
You even said that she liked you.

210
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
But you can't

211
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,400
even show us a photo.

212
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,479
I don't have time for you two.

213
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm going to pick up our kid.

214
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,919
I'll see her off.

215
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,640
I was intentionally joking

216
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,039
with Guan Zai just now.

217
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,239
Don't take it to heart.

218
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,359
He's not feeling well today.

219
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,400
I wanted

220
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
to distract him.

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
On the other hand,

222
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,559
I didn't want to let him feel

223
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,599
that I'm under a lot of pressure.

224
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,799
I wanted him to relax a bit.

225
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,640
I understand.

226
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:05,919
Actually, I won't introduce

227
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,520
my junior to you.

228
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,760
What if she ends up hating me later on?

229
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,799
You and Guan Zai

230
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:15,000
are the same.

231
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,880
I don't see him all day.

232
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,159
He just keeps working

233
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,039
and working.

234
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,640
I remember that he wasn't home

235
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,280
for a maximum

236
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,359
of half a year.

237
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,479
For the remaining half,

238
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,520
he was working overtime daily.

239
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,159
He didn't have time for family at all.

240
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,799
You should go back to the ward.

241
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:42,679
I'll see you off.

242
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:43,799
There's no need.

243
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,520
Go on.

244
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,000
Ren Wang.

245
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,919
I'm really sorry.

246
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,880
I hope I didn't waste your time.

247
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,320
It's fine.

248
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,080
There are always many people

249
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,359
who want to work in our industry.

250
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,760
It's good as long as you've thought
about it carefully.

251
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,599
However,

252
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,400
have you resolved the reason

253
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,280
why you wanted to resign before?

254
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,359
What are you looking at?

255
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,520
For the work

256
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
that can be handled over the phone,

257
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,880
I must provide instructions.

258
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,919
It's not convenient
if my wife is around.

259
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,239
Keep this a secret for me.

260
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,799
15 minutes.

261
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,520
That's enough.

262
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,159
There actually isn't a lot

263
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,239
that can be handled over the phone.

264
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,000
That's enough.

265
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,960
I'll heat up some food.

266
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,400
What did you have for dinner?

267
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,599
I had some porridge.

268
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,280
You bring

269
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,760
your own food now?

270
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:31,060

(Where did you go
for your business trip?)

272
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,280
(It was so sudden.)

273
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,640
(Xi'an.)

(I can't tell you anything else.)

275
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,080
(It's confidential.)

276
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,599
(You can't tell your family too?)

277
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,159
(I can't.)

278
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
How boring.

279
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,880
There's no topic to talk about then.

280
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,880
(You and Guan Zai)

281
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
(are the same.)

282
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,239
(I don't see him all day.)

283
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:09,479
(He just keeps working)

284
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:10,359
(and working.)

285
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,159
(He doesn't have time)

286
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,520
(for family at all.)

287
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
(You're only thinking)

288
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,280
(about your ambition.)

289
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,119
You shouldn't delay people.

290
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:52,119
Yu.

291
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,359
Your colleague suddenly vomited.

292
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,080
He suddenly vomited.

293
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,479
Here.

294
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,520
Slowly.

295
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,359
Go, ring the bell.

296
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:09,359
Ring the bell.

297
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,333
(In-patient Department)

298
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,100
Based on his condition,

299
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,600
(Doctor's Office)

300
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,159
patient's stomach

301
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,799
has obvious changes.

302
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,799
We can confirm that it's cancer.

303
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,799
But it was discovered early,

304
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,039
and it hasn't metastasized

305
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,080
to other organs.

306
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:34,880
He kept feeling dizzy before.

307
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,880
Is it related to the cancer?

308
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,599
Dizziness

309
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,400
has nothing to do with stomach cancer.

310
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,880
And his brain exam results

311
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,520
don't indicate any illness.

312
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,000
His dizziness

313
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,919
should be related

314
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
to over exhaustion

315
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,159
and too much stress.

316
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,400
But we should

317
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,119
be thankful for his dizziness.

318
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,880
Because of it,

319
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,760
the patient

320
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,599
was able to discover this cancer.

321
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
After he

322
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,719
becomes stable,

323
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,119
undergo surgery as soon as possible.

324
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,400
I'm fine.

325
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,239
Back in Xi'an,

326
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:09,280
I kept thinking

327
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,359
if the hospital

328
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:11,359
misdiagnosed him.

329
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,119
Now that it's confirmed,

330
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,280
I'm not thinking much about it anymore.

331
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,679
Just treat the illness.

332
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,280
Didn't the doctor also say

333
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,119
that it was discovered early?

334
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,479
Just treat the illness.

335
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,599
Mr. Hu.

336
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,479
Mrs. Hu.

337
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
In the past couple of days,

338
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,799
he has been lethargic.

339
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,000
What if

340
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
you go home first?

341
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
After he wakes up,

342
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,799
I'll tell him that you came by.

343
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,119
Okay.

344
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,760
We won't disturb you then.

345
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,239
We'll come here during the weekend.

346
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,880
Before coming,

347
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,039
I'll call you.

348
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,599
There's no need
to go through such trouble.

349
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,159
You need to travel far
to come here as well.

350
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,679
How can it be troublesome?

351
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,880
We must go out anyway.

352
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
On the weekend,

353
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
I'll make him

354
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,640
some clear soup

355
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,599
and bring it over.

356
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,400
Thank you, Mrs. Hu.

357
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,679
We'll go ahead then.

358
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,039
I'll see you off.

359
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:07,880
There's no need.

360
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,359
Stay with him.

361
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,239
Yu.

362
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,400
Go home too.

363
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,039
You weren't able to rest well
in the past couple of days.

364
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,520
Guan Zhu called me

365
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,000
saying that he'd be back soon.

366
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,280
It's hard on Shen Jing too.

367
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,839
She's alone,

368
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,640
and she has to take care of her child,

369
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,280
and she must take care of Guan Zai.

370
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,599
Before,

371
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,680
she was such a beautiful and neat girl.

372
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,079
Now, she looks so haggard.

373
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,119
I remember how we were back then.

374
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,760
You

375
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,359
didn't have time for family as well.

376
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,479
When I gave birth,

377
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,760
you almost didn't make it home.

378
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,680
Telephones weren't so common back then.

379
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,680
All right.

380
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:56,760
I'll stop.

381
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,359
It's all in the past now.

382
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,079
Yu.

383
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,640
If Shen Jing

384
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,920
needs any help,

385
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,280
you must tell me.

386
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,280
Guan Zai

387
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,640
doesn't want to tell others.

388
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,760
Otherwise,

389
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,239
our office could have made
some arrangements.

390
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,479
The two of them

391
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,800
aren't willing

392
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,119
to trouble others.

393
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,119
Tell me.

394
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,959
Guan Zai is such a nice person.

395
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,119
How can he get this kind of illness?

396
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,959
He'll recover.

397
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,520
Yu.

398
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,640
We need to hide this

399
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,079
from Mr. Zhang.

400
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,800
He's not in good condition.

401
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,280
You and Guan Zai

402
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,400
are the students

403
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,880
he cares about the most.

404
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,040
Guan Zai is so sick now.

405
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,760
I'm afraid that he won't be able
to handle it.

406
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:52,880
Mr. Hu.

407
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,640
I want to apply
for an extended vacation.

408
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:58,959
An extended vacation?

409
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,280
Right.

410
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,920
I've accumulated a lot
of vacation leaves before.

411
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,880
I don't know if they can be used.

412
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,280
You mean...

413
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:11,000
Regarding the investment bank...

414
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,599
I've already turned down their offer.

415
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,920
We must

416
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,040
still carefully consider

417
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,400
certain things.

418
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,400
Your teacher, Guan Zai

419
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,079
isn't your responsibility.

420
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,800
So don't keep feeling responsible

421
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,160
for a lot of things.

422
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,959
And don't change your decisions

423
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,479
because of others.

424
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,199
It has nothing to do with others.

425
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,319
When I went to Xi'an

426
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,920
to save JX,

427
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,400
I thought that I should stay here.

428
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,880
That's good.

429
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:44,560
I'll handle

430
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,400
the extended vacation.

431
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,920
For how long?

432
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,839
One week.

433
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:53,760
Aside from Guan Zai,

434
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,000
there are other things
I need to do as well.

435
00:19:58,199 --> 00:19:59,640
I promised a friend
that I'd do something,

436
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,719
and I haven't completed it yet.

437
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,199
I worked so hard

438
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:27,920
to get this vote.

439
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,640
Who should I vote for?

440
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,400
Who did you vote for?

441
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,800
I haven't voted yet.

442
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,599
Help me vote for Luo Shen.

443
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,079
You really want to vote for Luo Shen?

444
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,079
Luo Shen was the champion
for the spring season.

445
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,880
He has a lot of experience too.

446
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
But Snow's condition is very good too.

447
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:52,640
If you want to win,

448
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
vote for Luo Shen.

449
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,800
The chances are higher.

450
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,560
If you want to support your idol,

451
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,599
vote for Heavenly Palace.

452
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:00,800
What if

453
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,119
we make a bet?

454
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,599
Whoever bets on the losing team

455
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,359
will agree

456
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,199
to one request.

457
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,959
This will make it more fun.

458
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,239
Sure.

459
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:15,560
I think the match has begun.

460
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,640
Get your own juice.

461
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:21,359
Right.

462
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,359
Heavenly Palace is in
very good condition now.

463
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,439
And Cai Wenji too.

464
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,439
They can't be guarded against.

465
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,680
And once the soldiers come in...

466
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,719
12 minutes and 22 seconds.

467
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,560
A tank can hold off well
in a head-on battle.

468
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,479
Guard the nexus.

469
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,199
Bring the soldiers in.

470
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:30,839
They're in.

471
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,119
12 minutes and 25 seconds.

472
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,439
- Congratulations, Luo Shen!
- Luo Shen!

473
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:35,160
He won at 1:0.

474
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,719
Just now,

475
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:37,680
Luo Shen's nexus

476
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,560
was almost destroyed.

477
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,680
Just circle around the back.

478
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,479
Ghost Valley Kings are in.

479
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,599
Get three.

480
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,160
Push back.

481
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,359
Got the fourth one.

482
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,839
This team fight is so good.

483
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:52,920
Instant kill.

484
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,400
He's catching up.

485
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
12 minutes.

486
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,119
Look.

487
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:57,520
I told you.

488
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,719
Heavenly Palace's Team
is very incredible.

489
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,040
Their rhythm in this round is very good.

490
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,280
Snow is really amazing.

491
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,119
I would have died 100 times already
if it were me.

492
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,199
You can't kill him head-on.

493
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,040
He got him.

494
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,160
Snow got killed.

495
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,640
Luo Shen is still very stable.

496
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,800
What do you...

497
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,079
Why does a guy

498
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,599
have such nice eyelashes?

499
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,400
What have you been busy with lately?

500
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,160
Didn't you say

501
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,040
that you were resigning
from the Research Institute?

502
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,839
You even have heavy dark circles.

503
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,640
You can even fall asleep while watching

504
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,920
such an intense game.

505
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,319
It's not easy to edit the photo
from this angle.

506
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,520
(He didn't wake up from that?)

507
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,280
(I'm so light after all.)

508
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,239
(Quietly.)

509
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,880
(Quietly get up.)

510
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,319
Well...

511
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,800
What were you trying to reach?

512
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:26,319
An orange.

513
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,160
Who won?

514
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,400
Guess.

515
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,319
I'm guessing

516
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,079
that you lost.

517
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,319
Yes, I lost.

518
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,760
Make a request then.

519
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,439
Your birthday is at the end
of the month.

520
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,160
What gift do you want?

521
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:27,760
You're the one who should
make a request.

522
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,719
The request

523
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:30,160
for our bet is

524
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,599
to tell me

525
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,359
what gift you want.

526
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,680
I won't be shy then.

527
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,199
Don't be shy.

528
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,239
This is too sudden.

529
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,319
I'll tell you after I think about it.

530
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,839
(Mr. Yu is such a dense guy.)

531
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,880
(Who asks people what gift they want?)

532
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,040
(Shouldn't he suddenly take it out)

533
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,359
(as a surprise?)

534
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,359
The final match is over.

535
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,920
The awarding ceremony

536
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,079
will occur after a few days.

537
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,239
Have you decided to choose
which professional players

538
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,479
as your teammates?

539
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm still thinking about the gift.

540
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:18,719
Any suggestions?

541
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,640
First choice,

542
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:23,239
Heavenly Palace,

543
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,280
Zhou Yin.

544
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,199
Heavenly Palace

545
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,479
may have lost to Luo Shen
in the final match,

546
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:29,880
but as a team leader,

547
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:31,359
he's a rare all-around player

548
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,959
in the match.

549
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,119
I thought

550
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,800
you'd recommend Luo Shen's team.

551
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,280
Luo Shen may be very competent,

552
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,079
but their strongest point

553
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,560
is in their overall coordination.

554
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,719
Okay.

555
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,680
I quite like Zhou Yin too.

556
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,119
Zhou Yin is handsome too.

557
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:49,199
He's only 19 years old.

558
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,319
You even know his age?

559
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,439
Pay attention to Zhou Yin's way
of playing.

560
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,439
What can you see?

561
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:01,920
What?

562
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,479
While training with you
in the past few days,

563
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,079
I've been imitating Zhou Yin.

564
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,239
The heroes he often uses,

565
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:11,719
his habit in playing,

566
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:12,760
his behavior.

567
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
During the match,

568
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,000
you'll be more familiar

569
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,599
and more easily coordinate with him.

570
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,800
You were imitating him

571
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,920
to familiarize me
with his way of playing

572
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,160
and practice coordinating with him?

573
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:27,560
I even imitated Snow.

574
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,079
You didn't notice?

575
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,680
I know what I want
for my birthday gift now.

576
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:49,040
Give me a Penta Kill.

577
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,040
Until now, I haven't gotten

578
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,239
a Penta Kill yet.

579
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,680
But I want you to give it to me,

580
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,839
not them.

581
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,040
So you don't need to imitate

582
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,920
their way of playing.

583
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:56,920
Because I like

584
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,040
coordinating with you more.

585
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,319
Why are you laughing?

586
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:04,800
Nothing.

587
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,920
I just think that it's hard work.

588
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:09,880
Don't think I can't tell

589
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,920
that you're laughing at me.

590
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,319
I was just unlucky.

591
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,000
That's why until now,

592
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,280
I haven't gotten a Penta Kill yet.

593
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,680
Let's begin then.

594
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,920
Play alone first.

595
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,199
Drop 30 stars.

596
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,479
Your level is too high now.

597
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:29,199
I can't afford

598
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,119
a 50-star Penta Kill.

599
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,760
I don't care.

600
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:38,079
Oh, right.

601
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,160
These are the tickets
to the awarding ceremony.

602
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:47,400
Bring So Panicky

603
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,119
with you.

604
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,839
But please

605
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,079
get a good sleep first.

606
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:51,599
Don't fall asleep again

607
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,719
halfway in the ceremony.

608
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,160
Bring

609
00:29:58,719 --> 00:29:59,599
So Panicky?

610
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,599
Then you can

611
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,640
tell him

612
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,040
that the most competent...

613
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:07,119
The most beautiful person on stage

614
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,839
is Hand-picked Cotton.

615
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:37,060
(Spend more time together)

616
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,479
(I promised a friend
that I'd do something,)

617
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:45,520
(and I haven't completed it yet.)

618
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,920
(Then you can keep teaching me)

619
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,959
(until the match.)

620
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:51,760
