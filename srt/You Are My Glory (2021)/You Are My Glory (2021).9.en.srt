00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,598
Let's order more dishes.

15
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,439
If we can't finish them,

16
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,598
just pack some for So Panicky.

17
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:04,439
I want to try

18
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,318
some of the dishes.

19
00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:07,038
Jingjing.

20
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:09,519
I need your help.

21
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:11,439
For what?

22
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:12,638
I bumped into

23
00:02:12,638 --> 00:02:13,799
my professor and his wife.

24
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,398
They are waiting at the entrance

25
00:02:16,038 --> 00:02:16,638
and there are

26
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,918
more than ten customers ahead of them.

27
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:18,638
So,

28
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,439
can we

29
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,638
let them take this room?

30
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,679
I'll bring you to somewhere else.

31
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,039
I don't mind

32
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,758
but why can't we

33
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:27,838
invite them over?

34
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,079
You don't mind?

35
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,399
Why would I?

36
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:36,959
I'll bring them over.

37
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,319
Here, sir, madam.

38
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:54,079
Hello.

39
00:02:55,118 --> 00:02:56,198
This is my high school classmate,

40
00:02:56,198 --> 00:02:57,039
Qiao Jingjing.

41
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:57,918
Jingjing,

42
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,758
this is my professor, Mr. Zhang,

43
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:01,239
and his wife, Mrs. Wang.

44
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:02,478
Hi, Mr. Zhang.

45
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,198
Hi, Mrs. Wang.

46
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,278
Hello.

47
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:05,879
Hello.

48
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:10,039
Come, have a seat.

49
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:14,718
Here.

50
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,198
You can put this here.

51
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:18,439
Have a seat.

52
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:19,879
Okay.

53
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:21,079
Yu,

54
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:22,758
when did you find

55
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:23,679
such a beautiful

56
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:25,079
high school friend?

57
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:28,558
I feel like

58
00:03:28,998 --> 00:03:30,638
I've seen you somewhere.

59
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:35,278
Is today your birthday, Mrs. Wang?

60
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:36,319
No.

61
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,039
Today is actually

62
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,959
our

63
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,159
wedding anniversary.

64
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:44,159
We will have dinner here

65
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,399
every year to celebrate it.

66
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:46,558
We actually

67
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:47,959
booked a table

68
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,478
but for some reason,

69
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:50,358
they couldn't

70
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:51,599
find

71
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,558
the record.

72
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,599
They must have a lot of customers.

73
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,159
Mr. Zhang,

74
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:58,558
if today is your

75
00:03:58,558 --> 00:03:59,439
wedding anniversary,

76
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:00,679
then we...

77
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,039
It's no bother!

78
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:05,918
You know very well that

79
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:07,319
both of us

80
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,278
like company.

81
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,679
Having a meal

82
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:11,799
with you two,

83
00:04:12,278 --> 00:04:14,079
one of which is a pretty girl,

84
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:17,718
it can't possibly be better
than this, can it?

85
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:19,838
Okay.

86
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,799
I'll order food then.

87
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:22,959
No need.

88
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,758
We are its patrons for several decades.

89
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:28,999
I know very well which dish is the best.

90
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:31,038
Just enjoy

91
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:33,239
the free meal today.

92
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,079
You take their room first.

93
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:37,839
Excuse me.

94
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:41,839
Hello.

95
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:42,999
Ready to order?

96
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:43,559
Yes.

97
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:46,318
For the cold dish,

98
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,999
one portion of smoked fish,

99
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,598
drunken chicken,

100
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:50,918
candied lotus root,

101
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,799
and the Four-Treasures-In-Huadiao-Wine.

102
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,878
That's all.

103
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,438
As for the hot dish,

104
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,598
red braised pork belly is a must-have.

105
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,679
Then, one portion of stir-fried prawn.

106
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:02,559
And then...

107
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:03,158
Mr. Zhang,

108
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:04,839
wouldn't it be too oily?

109
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:05,719
We should have something light.

110
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,918
This is a rare occasion.

111
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:07,878
Also,

112
00:05:07,878 --> 00:05:09,839
you guys are still young.

113
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:11,399
Sautéed peas.

114
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,559
Fish noodle.

115
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:13,559
Those will do.

116
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:14,918
Okay.

117
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,839
You're staying in Shanghai?

118
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,839
No travel plan?

119
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:20,719
Yes,

120
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:22,438
I have some business here.

121
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,638
I was looking for you.

122
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:26,478
Yu Tu,

123
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:28,198
I have dealt with

124
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:30,719
your problem.

125
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,638
I know that

126
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:35,758
Guan Zai and you

127
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,999
have reached a bottleneck

128
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,279
in the model research project.

129
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:41,158
The school

130
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:43,158
has always played safe.

131
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,839
You have to understand that

132
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:47,158
that's how

133
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:48,839
we survive thus far.

134
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:50,358
Safety

135
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:51,878
is the most important part.

136
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:54,038
Redundancy is always good

137
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,438
because

138
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,079
the stake is too high.

139
00:05:58,719 --> 00:05:59,279
However,

140
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,719
the time has changed.

141
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:03,318
Our nation has become stronger

142
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:06,158
so we need to change our mindset too.

143
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,358
We ought to encourage the young

144
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:09,399
to innovate.

145
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:12,198
I can understand why you suddenly said

146
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:13,438
you wanted to quit.

147
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:14,758
That's why

148
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,399
I gave you a break.

149
00:06:17,198 --> 00:06:18,279
Let you take your mind off.

150
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:21,079
During this month,

151
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,399
I was busy as well.

152
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:24,758
I discussed

153
00:06:25,438 --> 00:06:27,198
with Mr. Hu many times.

154
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:31,839
The school's attitude

155
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,638
has now softened.

156
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,758
Your project represents the future.

157
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,318
The higher-ups

158
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:46,198
have their eye on Guan Zai and you,

159
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,318
the future leaders.

160
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,038
We don't want you

161
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,758
to follow the old mindset,

162
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:52,719
and refuse to change.

163
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:55,758
Your break is almost over.

164
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:58,079
When you return,

165
00:06:58,438 --> 00:06:59,079
revise

166
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,239
the proposal

167
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,799
with Guan Zai

168
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:04,799
and try to get

169
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:06,878
the school's support.

170
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,079
Did you hear me?

171
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:29,399
You still wish to quit?

172
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,959
Let's not talk about business.

173
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:34,279
Relax.

174
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:36,119
Come.

175
00:07:36,638 --> 00:07:37,438
Let him speak.

176
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:41,119
Do you have other reasons?

177
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:47,918
Mr. Zhang,

178
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:52,559
I left

179
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,239
for money.

180
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:18,079
I understand.

181
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,679
Many people

182
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,119
have left over the years.

183
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:27,598
I can sympathize

184
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:29,799
with them.

185
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:35,358
I'm just a bit disappointed.

186
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:40,119
Yu Tu,

187
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:45,399
you really let me down.

188
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:48,039
You're my proudest student.

189
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:48,719
I thought...

190
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,159
Let's not talk about how my generation

191
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,079
started everything from zero.

192
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:01,479
Look at your colleague,

193
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:02,479
Guan Zai.

194
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:04,079
He gave up his high-paying job

195
00:09:04,118 --> 00:09:05,359
and came back from the US.

196
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:06,558
I thought

197
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:07,638
you're like him,

198
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:08,998
that

199
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:11,079
you have your own belief.

200
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,079
Yu Tu gave up

201
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:22,318
his high-paying job too.

202
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,599
Yu Tu and his colleague

203
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:29,758
are talented people.

204
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:31,238
They deserve the best.

205
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:32,438
But

206
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,839
asking them to do what they are told

207
00:09:33,998 --> 00:09:35,438
for the sake of their dream,

208
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:37,079
isn't this...

209
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,198
isn't a guilt trip?

210
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,558
Jingjing!

211
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,079
Sorry.

212
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:17,719
I apologize,

213
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:19,159
Mr. Zhang.

214
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:20,798
We should leave now.

215
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:21,878
Enjoy your anniversary dinner.

216
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:48,318
You're

217
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:49,959
the biggest beneficiary
of our current system,

218
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,479
so you shouldn't

219
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,479
say those things to my professor.

220
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:58,719
What do you mean?

221
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:01,438
If I'm not Qiao Jingjing,

222
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:02,519
if I'm not a celebrity,

223
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,558
I'll be able to say it?

224
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:06,198
I just wanted to defend you.

225
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:12,079
I want you to be

226
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:12,678
an aerospace engineer

227
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:13,719
more than anyone else.

228
00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:28,878
Why?

229
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,238
Jingjing.

230
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:36,238
Mr. Yu.

231
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,118
Why are you guys out here?

232
00:12:52,678 --> 00:12:53,359
Can you

233
00:12:54,118 --> 00:12:55,479
delete the photo you took just now?

234
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:03,399
Thank you.

235
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,238
(I'm sorry.)

236
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:55,758
(Don't take what
Mr. Zhang said to heart.)

237
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:57,079
(He was just a bit upset.)

238
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:58,839
(We respect your decision.)

239
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:01,039
(Also, don't be mad at your friend.)

240
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,599
(What she said was true.)

241
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,479
(Thanks, Mrs. Wang.)

242
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:17,459
(Qiao Jingjing. Sorry.)

243
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,459
(Qiao Jingjing. But you're the rabbit
who has seen the most stars.)

244
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,459
(Good luck, Jade Rabbit God!)
(Thanks. You should sleep now.)

245
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,459
(Let's start a ranked match tomorrow.)
(Goodnight)

246
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,459
(I'll leave then. Wait for my return.)
(Okay.)

247
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:26,659
(Sorry.)

00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:32,479
What's happening?

252
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,719
Why haven't we received
the telemetry signal?

(Unknown ID)

255
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,039
Yu Tu,

256
00:15:57,678 --> 00:15:58,959
Satellite JX

257
00:15:58,959 --> 00:15:59,839
has some emergency issue.

258
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,678
The attitude is out of control.

259
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:02,198
I don't care where you are.

260
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:03,399
Your break is terminated

261
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:05,039
and get to

262
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,878
Northwest Satellite Control Center
immediately.

263
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:20,279
The boot.

264
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,118
What happened?

265
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:30,599
Mr. Hu summoned you

266
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,399
with one phone call?

267
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:33,558
I grabbed some documents
from the institute

268
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:34,719
and took the last flight

269
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,519
to Xi'an.

270
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:37,599
Why are you here?

271
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,159
I flew over from Beijing.

272
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,399
I just arrived.

273
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:41,599
Mr. Hu said you'd be here

274
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:42,638
so I was waiting for you.

275
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,079
What exactly happened?

276
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,279
They didn't tell me anything.

277
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:47,079
Let's go in first.

278
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,238
Are you two the staff from Base 158?

279
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,798
ID, please.

280
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:03,519
These are your passes.

281
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:04,238
Follow me.

282
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:04,719
Okay.

283
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:06,839
Here.

284
00:17:17,678 --> 00:17:19,839
JX was working properly.

285
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,079
But last night,

286
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,438
after it finished its first rotation,

287
00:17:23,438 --> 00:17:24,639
the ground station did not receive

288
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:26,038
any telemetry signal.

289
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,038
The center

290
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:28,558
informed us

291
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,038
straight away.

292
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:31,558
Fixed channels transmission
from the ground station,

293
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:33,518
RF module from the transponder,

294
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:34,839
issuing commands to the back-up.

295
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:36,398
They did it thrice

296
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:38,318
but they still couldn't

297
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:40,079
receive the telemetry signal
from the satellite.

298
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:42,318
MIA straight away?

299
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:45,678
No response even from the backup?

300
00:17:46,678 --> 00:17:47,318
Yes.

301
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:48,918
The backup

302
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:50,278
transponder on Satellite JX

303
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,558
is heterogeneous.

304
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:53,318
The possibility of a simultaneous

305
00:17:53,318 --> 00:17:54,558
error is extremely low.

306
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:56,318
But it happened.

307
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:58,438
We are the first to arrive.

308
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,918
Others who worked on JX

309
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:01,918
are occupied.

310
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:03,038
They'll be here by tomorrow.

311
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,040
Our colleagues from Base 158 are here.

312
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:19,681
Hi.

313
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:21,321
Hello.

314
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,600
Allow me to introduce,

315
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,841
Mr. Li, Head of the Technical Department
in this center.

316
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,561
These two are
Mr. Yang and Mr. Han,

317
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:29,040
also from the Technical Department.

318
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,800
I'm Guan Zai from Base 158,

319
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,441
Satellite JX Head Engineer.

320
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:33,640
I'm Yu Tu from Base 158,

321
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,681
Satellite JX Engineer.

322
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,361
Mr. Hu is in Taiyuan now.

323
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:38,920
He has some business to attend to.

324
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,079
He'll be here tomorrow afternoon
at the latest.

325
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:40,680
Wonderful.

326
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,880
Have you prepared for their reception?

327
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,239
The receptionists have done it.

328
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:43,800
Don't worry.

329
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,719
This is not urgent.

330
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,401
Last night, after you transmitted

331
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,641
the commands during the second

332
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:50,320
and third rotation,

333
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,761
any downlink signal?

334
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,281
So,

335
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:54,480
when it entered our range,

336
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,960
we sent the command straight away.

337
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,240
However, we still haven't received

338
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,720
the downlink signal.

339
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,681
We switched to the backup and sent
the command via fixed channels

340
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,761
but there's no response.

341
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,999
Do you have any recent telemetry data

342
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:08,519
of the satellite?

343
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,080
It's all in our system.

344
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,600
Let's figure out the problem then.

345
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,759
Once we find it,

346
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,999
we can devise a solution.

347
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:19,340
(Real-time fault diagnosis system
for on-orbit spacecraft)

348
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,020
(Two hours later)

349
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,279
Are you okay?

350
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
I'm getting old.

351
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:50,600
One white night
and I'm all dizzy already.

352
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:52,320
Back then,

353
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,320
a few hours of sleep

354
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,960
for a few nights? No problem.

355
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,279
I'll head to bed now.

356
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:19,600
I received

357
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,999
another call from the ministry.

358
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,040
The government

359
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,239
invested a lot

360
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,159
to launch this satellite.

361
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,759
Now that it's not working out,

362
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,680
the ministry wants an explanation.

363
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,720
Should we explore other options

364
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,279
instead of focusing on the transponder?

365
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,920
It could be the power supply.

366
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,359
Besides,

367
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:36,159
is it possible that its orbit

368
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,320
has changed?

369
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,080
The fixed channels

370
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,359
might not be able to reach it.

371
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,320
The power subsystem

372
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,279
and the recent orbital data,

373
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,279
I've read them all.

374
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:43,920
The telemetry data

375
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,720
is within the normal threshold.

376
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,440
I've also checked the orbital data.

377
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,080
It matches quite well with the

378
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,440
predetermined orbit.

379
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,159
However, Mr. Guan and I

380
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,960
designed the model.

381
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,999
To reach a conclusion,

382
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,759
we need to wait for the

383
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,519
electrical and orbital engineers'

384
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,759
input.

390

391
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,560
Guan.

392
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,040
We found the satellite?

393
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,800
No,

394
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,239
but I might have found an explanation.

395
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,920
All right. Let's have a meeting.

396
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,279
(Four hours later)
Solar energetic particle

397
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,479
(Four hours later)
is already a rare phenomenon.

398
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:28,200
But to have one whose energy

399
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,159
affects two machines at the same time?

400
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,759
This is

401
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:33,320
too unlikely.

402
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,200
Previously,

403
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,080
we've

404
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,960
been focusing on the satellite itself

405
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,239
and we couldn't locate the problem.

406
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:41,040
I was exploring the possibility
of external factors

407
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,519
and I suddenly thought of

408
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,279
the solar wind forecast I saw earlier.

409
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,680
I consulted

410
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,759
the International Space Environment Web

411
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,759
and I did find some relevant info.

412
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:53,159
While we were waiting for you,

413
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,040
Mr. Guan and I

414
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,440
did a rough calculation.

415
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:57,999
This possibility cannot be ruled out

416
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,279
but to reach the final conclusion,

417
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,200
we still need

418
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,720
a lot of calculations and simulations.

419
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:05,920
The backup is a dynamic backup.

420
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,960
Did we really hit the jackpot this time?

421
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,479
This year is also

422
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:10,759
the year of peak solar activity

423
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,320
according to the 11-year solar cycle.

424
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,040
Contact the Space Department of
the Chinese Academy of Science.

425
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,560
Ask them to provide us the details

426
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,720
regarding

427
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,320
Satellite JX in its trajectory
yesterday.

428
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,960
On it.

429
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,320
Mr. Li.

430
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,440
Mr. Hu of the Base 158

431
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,800
and others who worked on JX

432
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,920
have arrived.

433
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:31,759
Li.

434
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:32,800
Mr. Hu.

435
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,840
You arrived earlier.

436
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,359
Time is of the essence.

437
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,519
I traveled through the night via car.

438
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,359
Let's not waste time chatting.

439
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,159
Any update on JX?

440
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,800
Look at me. So anxious that

441
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,759
I got sick.

442
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:46,239
Satellite JX

443
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:47,759
is my last work before

444
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,960
I retire into administration.

445
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:50,720
If it's gone like that,

446
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,920
I will regret it
for the rest of my life.

447
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,999
Take a break first, Mr. Hu.

448
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,200
We might have found

449
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,040
the reason.

450
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,279
We're waiting for the confirmation.

451
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,300
(Two hours later)

452
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,920
The Chinese Academy of Sciences replied.

453
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,759
They confirmed that
the malfunction of the satellite

454
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,159
coincided with the solar storm.

455
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,740
(Xi'an Satellite Control Center)

456
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:15,279
Run the simulation now.

457
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,080
Cross-check the satellite's position,

458
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,800
the time of the malfunction,

459
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
and the range
of the energetic electron storm

460
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,239
triggered by the solar storm.

461
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,239
See if they match.

462
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,020
(Northwest Satellite Control Center)

463
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,759
How long will it take?

464
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:24,999
No longer than two hours.

465
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,840
We can still salvage it today.

466
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,280
The one in charge of orbit monitoring,

467
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,559
calculates its orbit

468
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,440
and surmises its

469
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:33,800
precise trajectory and travel time.

470
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:34,960
Transponder

471
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,680
and satellite coordinator,

472
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,279
write the command script now.

473
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,519
The staff in charge of power supply,
copy the previous energy level

474
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,999
on the satellite and evaluate

475
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:42,479
if there's any breach
in the power supply.

476
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:43,440
Besides,

477
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,359
the solar storm

478
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,560
is only the most

479
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,239
probable explanation so far.

480
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:48,920
We need to wait for the result.

481
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,600
Think

482
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,320
if there are any other

483
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,759
latent factors.

484
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:54,200
Guan Zai.

485
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,239
Since you're the head engineer,

486
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,200
stay in the loop.

487
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Report to me every hour.

488
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,639
Noted.

489
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,340
(Two and a half hours later)

490
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:32,440
According to the simulation,

491
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,800
we can confirm that

492
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,119
before the Satellite JX

493
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,320
rotated to within our range

494
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,680
last night, it was hit

495
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,600
by the energetic electron storm

496
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,680
that happens once

497
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,759
every 11 years.

498
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:42,800
The massive energy released

499
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:44,960
might have affected

500
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,840
both transponders.

501
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,920
Single-event upset took place
simultaneously

502
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,200
and damaged the satellite's

503
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,119
communications system.

504
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,600
We have already devised

505
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,720
a contingency plan for this.

506
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:58,960
The reception part

507
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,320
of the transponder

508
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,720
uses analog electronics.

509
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,359
It won't be affected

510
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,920
by the single-event upset.

511
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,040
Therefore,

512
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,960
when the satellite
rotates into our range again,

513
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,159
transmit reboot command

514
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,159
to the two transponders

515
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,159
via fixed channels.

516
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:12,639
If the satellite

517
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:14,119
receives the command successfully,

518
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:15,560
its telecommunication system

519
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,200
should come back online.

520
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,840
K35 Satellite Transponder.

521
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,640
Launching module.

522
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,920
Reboot command for both machines.

523
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,240
Command sent by Jiamusi post.

524
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,039
The signal is in.

525
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,360
Telemetry signal received.

526
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,360
No interference.

527
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,039
Please check every system now.

528
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,320
How's the satellite?

529
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,680
Stabilization subsystem malfunction.

530
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,160
Three-axis
earth-oriented stabilization failed.

531
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,399
Power system normal.

532
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:05,479
Excessive power supply.

533
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:07,440
It uses less power than expected.

534
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:08,800
We did take into account

535
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,639
the damage to the stabilization subsystem
due to the solar storm.

536
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:14,160
We have a plan for this exact scenario.

537
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,359
The power supply malfunction

538
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,160
must be the side product

539
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,119
of the damaged

540
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,160
stabilization subsystem.

541
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,639
I think it is
because of the solar sails,

542
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,200
that we can't establish
solar orientation properly,

543
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,800
so the power demand has increased.

544
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,119
Our utmost priority now

545
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,800
is to reduce the workload
on the satellite.

546
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,840
Contain its energy consumption

547
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,519
and correct its attitude
as soon as possible.

548
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,320
Follow the protocol
and launch the commands.

549
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,240
Meanwhile,

550
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,319
launch solar-oriented commands.

551
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:44,039
The satellite is now
out of the monitoring range.

552
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,439
The next rotation will be at 8:03 PM.

553
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,760
Attention, everyone.

554
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,640
Reporting in from Kunming post.

555
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,600
Target is in range.

556
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,441
The satellite has not entered
a solar-oriented stable state.

557
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,239
Another white night.

558
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,759
Send the amended contract

559
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,040
to my e-mail.

560
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,879
The latest one, okay?

561
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:47,320
Xiao Zhu.

562
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,680
Come here.

563
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,359
Yes?

564
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,160
What happened to Jingjing recently?

565
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,759
She came to the office
three days in a row now.

566
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,119
She's in an argument with Mr. Yu.

567
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,920
Mr. Yu has been absent these few days.

568
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:01,680
Really?

569
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,440
Don't they get along well?

570
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:10,440
Jingjing.

571
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,960
I have good news.

572
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,399
Mr. Li sent us the contract

573
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:14,359
back.

574
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,479
I quite like the conditions.

575
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,639
Also,

576
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:18,359
if we announce this news now,

577
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,759
we'll have a higher offer

578
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,920
for the upcoming drama.

579
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:25,720
Am I worth the money?

580
00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:29,479
I mean,

581
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,440
shooting for a drama usually
lasts for five months.

582
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,639
Am I worth the money?

583
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,399
Of course, you do!

584
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:38,999
Just think about it.
When you star in a show,

585
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:40,599
TV channels and streaming platforms

586
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,680
all want it.

587
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,599
Advertisers want to
place their products in it.

588
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:44,359
That's how the TV channels

589
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:46,200
and the streaming platforms make money.

590
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,840
Of course, you're worth the money.

591
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Other B-listers

592
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,720
would ask for this price,

593
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,759
not to mention

594
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,359
you're an A-Lister yourself.

595
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,680
I don't want to be compared to them.

596
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,879
To who then?

597
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,160
Am I too

598
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,680
sentimental now?

599
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:13,680
Well,

600
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:14,879
it's not about

601
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,519
being sentimental or not.

602
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,440
I've thought about

603
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,759
this question too.

604
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,200
But you see,

605
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,160
that's how the market works.

606
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,999
If you don't grab it, someone else will.

607
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,239
Besides,

608
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:27,680
if you don't take the money,

609
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,999
the main investors

610
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:31,200
will still sell the copyright
at the same price.

611
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,519
So where will the price difference go?

612
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,320
Into the pocket

613
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,160
of the investors, of course.

614
00:30:35,879 --> 00:30:36,479
It has

615
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:38,080
nothing to do with sentimentality.

616
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,560
Dwelling on it will serve no purpose.

617
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,279
Let me ask you then.

618
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,160
If someone offers you
tens of millions of yuan

619
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,399
for a drama,

620
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,320
would you say,

621
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,999
No, I just want
millions of yuan?

622
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:52,599
I wouldn't.

623
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,560
See?

624
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,239
There's no point in dwelling on this.

625
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,080
Just do your job properly.

626
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,359
Act well.

627
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,680
Stay out of trouble.

628
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,200
Respect their work.

629
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,800
Respect their money.

630
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,320
Donate to charities

631
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,840
like we're supposed to.

632
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,519
Is that not enough?

633
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,359
Look at you.

634
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,920
Sulking.

635
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,359
Why this all of a sudden?

636
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,279
Where's Mr. Yu?

637
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:36,879
All right.

638
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,359
I'll leave now.

639
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:41,800
Cheer up.

640
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:43,759
See you then.

641
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:44,800
Call me if anything.

642
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,080
Check on her.

643
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,239
If something happens,

644
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:57,359
call me.

645
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,479
See you then.

646
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,399
Will do. Don't worry.

647
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,260
(Yu Tu)

648
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,240
