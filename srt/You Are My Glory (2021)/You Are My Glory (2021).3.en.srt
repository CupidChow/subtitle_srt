(I haven't tried it before.)

42

If you guys have a unit match,

43
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,919
there's a good chance
it's in Draft Pick.

44
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,120
You might not necessarily get Cai Wenji.

45
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,039
It's all right for a newbie
to get Wang Zhaojun.

For the summoners' abilities,

47

Hold on.

49
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,840
Is there something

50
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,120
that I'm not aware of?

51
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,560
What unit match?

52
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,560
It's the Honor of Kings match

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,759
organized by our unit.

54
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,840
I would like Jade Rabbit God

55

to teach me.

56
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,520
Look.

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,039
Yu Tu is quite a good coach.

58
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,719
Zhai Liang is a good example.

59
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,000
Look how screwed up it was

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,039
when he used Xi Shi.

61
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,599
I watched him for once

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,159
to learn the techniques.

63
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,599
But I learned the rest

64
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,000
all by myself.

65
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,400
Come off it.

66
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,199
Finally,

67
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,439
the kill count is more than
the number of times when I was slain.

using Wang Zhaojun as well?)

71
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,400
(It feels worse than an outfit clash.)

72
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,240

73

78

When I was learning acting,

79
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,839
I had to watch the videos

80
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,720
of my seniors repeatedly.

81
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,680
Now, I have to do the same and watch

82
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,040
how I got slain when playing games.

83
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,160
I bet

84
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,879
it's because I have been gifted

85
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,160
with such great beauty.

86
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,399

need to be cut back.

Yu Tu is way more devious.

91

That's why we won.

92
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,639
Is this game

93
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,639
all about being devious?

94
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,879
That explains why I lost.

95
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,480
It's all because I'm an upright person.

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,040

97

Sure enough.

99
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,839
It's more satisfying
than using Cai Wenji.

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,300
(Victory, Continue)

171
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,600
Let me see.

172
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,600
Wait.

173
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,039
Guo never taught you
how to use this hero.

174
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,320
Did you practise it yourself?

175
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,919
Actually, I asked a game expert

176
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,879
to teach me.

177
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,519
I think he's better than Guo.

178
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,320
That's hard to say.

179
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,120
Is he reliable?

180
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,840
Will he expose your identity?

181
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,960
Don't worry.

182
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,080
I bet he doesn't even know

183
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,759
who I am.

184
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,360
Is he an online friend?

185
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:42,879
How does he teach you then?

186
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,159
Through the voice chat.

187
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,919
He teaches me how to use the abilities,

188
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,840
how to sidestep,

189
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,519
and what I should do.

190
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,159
I'm going to take a sip.

191
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,399
Let's see.

192
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,879
Who is it?

193
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,519
Open up my friend lists

194
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,480
in the game.

195
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,679
His name is Jade Rabbit Pounding Elixir.

196
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,440
Click on the avatar,
and you can see his performance records.

197
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,993
(Battle Stats)

198
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,200
He has a 93-percent win rate.

199
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,600
For real?

200
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,519
Indeed.

201
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,120
He seems to be better than Guo.

202
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,799
It's a shame.
He's just an online friend.

203
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,919
If there's such a good player

204
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:15,759
in real life who's that reliable

205
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,799
to teach you in person,

206
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,159
you'll progress

207
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,679
a lot faster.

208
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,039
(Yu Tu)

209
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,840
(exists in real life.)

210
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,919
(If he teaches me in person...)

211
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,159
But it's okay.

212
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,440
Just keep up the training.

213
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,879
There's still a month to go.

214
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,799
You need to step up your training.

215
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,720
Basically,

216
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,080
I've declined all the job offers.

217
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
But for those that we accepted
a few months ago,

218
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,360
we still have to fulfil them.

219
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,799
Why are you in a daze?

220
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,360
I know.

221
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,320
You do?

222
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,279
Really?

223
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,559
I'll get going then.

224
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,679
I still have a contract to discuss.

225
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,440
Okay.

226
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,960
Keep it up.

227
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,200
Okay.

228
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,720
Drink more water.

229
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,559
Protect your skin.

230
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,279
Bye.

231
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,180
(Match scoreboard)

232
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,799
Why is Yu Tu

233
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,320
online every day?

234
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,200
He plays games every day.

235
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,200
Is this how he spends his holidays?

236
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,559
(Jade Rabbit God.)

237
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,720
(Do you spend your holidays)

238
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,879
(playing games at home?)

239
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,240
(What does he do now?)

240
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,279
(It doesn't feel like
he's in the financial industry.)

241
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,000
(Peipei.)

242
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,000
(Do we have any classmates)

243
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,600
(who have a really cool job now?)

244
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,519
(It's you, isn't it?)

245
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,360
(I mean)

246
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,600
(what are those with good grades)

247
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,559
(doing right now?)

248
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,000
(I see. Those guys?)

249
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,039
(Qi Qi is working as an editor-in-chief)

250
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,039
(in a book company.)

251
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,120
(Wang Jiang is now a vice president)

252
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,200
(in one of the top 500 corporations.)

253
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:59,600
(Who else?)

254
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,039
(Sun Xiu is working in the Office
of the Secretary to the Mayor.)

255
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,279
(How about Yu Tu?)

256
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,720
(I think Yu Tu is working)

257
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,360
(in Aerospace Research Institute
in Shanghai.)

258
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,120
(Aerospace?)

259
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,759
(He's in the aerospace industry?)

260
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:39,960
(But didn't he study finance)

261
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,200
(back in college?)

262
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,480
(How do you remember so clearly?)

263
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,480
(How would I know)

264
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,759
(why he joined aerospace?)

265
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,279
(Why do you ask?)

266
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
(Check this out.)

267
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,020
(Class 5 Senior 3)

268
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:00,639
(Yu Tu,)

269
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,240
(I bought the air purifier)

270
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,639
(which posted by your institute
on Moments.)

271
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,519
(It broke down all of a sudden.)

272
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,720
(I called to request a repair,
but I couldn't get through.)

273
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,080
(Could you help me with it?)

274
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:08,879
(I just managed to reach them.)

275
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,840
(They said)

276
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,720
(they could only come over
tomorrow night to fix it.)

277
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,320
(This is for the kid's room.)

278
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,360
(Could you inform them)

279
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,080
(to come as soon as possible?)

280
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,679
(This kid coughs a lot
when he has a cold.)

281
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,120
(Yu Tu sells purifiers?)

282
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,200
(I think they developed it)

283
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,039
(for civilian use or something.)

284
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,720
(I thought aerospace tech
must be really cool.)

285
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,679
(But still, totally unexpected.)

286
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,440
(Which part is broken?)

287
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,480
(I couldn't turn it on.)

288
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,919
(Are you staying in Minhang?)

289
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,679
(I'll go over and take a look.)

290
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,120
(Why did you send this to me?)

291
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,840
(It was in the group chat.)

292
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,759
(I just recalled.)

293
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,759
(So I sent it to you.)

294
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,559
(He's indeed in the aerospace industry.)

295
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,279
Yu Tu.

296
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,480
Chang'e 1 has been launched.

297
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,159
Someone else

298
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,080
is a step ahead of you.

299
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,159
That's perfect, isn't it?

300
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,879
Perhaps, by the time I graduate,

301
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,679
the moon base would have been built.

302
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,200
I'll use the moon as a starting point

303
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
to conquer Mars

304
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,120
and fly through the solar system.

305
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,279
Come off it.

306
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,840
It doesn't cost me anything

307
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,679
to brag, does it?

308
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,120
Fine.

309
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,480
You're the top student.
So you must be right.

310
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,720
Wait up!

311
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
It turns out that
he didn't give up on his dream.

312
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,919
Yu Tu is in this city too.

313
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,799
(Peipei.)

314
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:00,999
(Show me the purifier advertisement)

315
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,639
(that Yu Tu sent you.)

316
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,960
(It's time to unleash my acting skills.)

317
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,920
(Welcome to the Honor of Kings.
The enemy's army will arrive on the battlefield in five seconds. )

318
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,919
The smog in Shanghai

319
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:29,200
is too serious.

320
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,440
How about your place?

321
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,879
What a coincidence.

322
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,440
Yu Tu and I are in Shanghai too.

323
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,080
The smog in Hangzhou

324
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,200
is pretty serious too.

325
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,799
The situation in Wuhan

326
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,879
is all right.

327
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,080
What brand of purifier

328
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,840
do you use?

329
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,159
I bought

330
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,840
a Jade Rabbit Air Purifier.

331
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,960
But it broke down after a few days.

332
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,519
Yu Tu?

333
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,480
Isn't that your company's product?

334
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:54,919
Is that a product

335
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,279
of Jade Rabbit God's company?

336
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,679
That explains it.

337
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,399
I bought it because it's the same
as your name.

338
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,679
What a coincidence.

339
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,879
It's a product developed by our lab

340
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:02,919
and another company.

341
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,759
Try using another plug.

342
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,200
A classmate of mine bought it

343
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,279
and said it wasn't working either.

344
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:08,519
I took a look

345
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,440
and found out it was the plug.

346
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,159
(Why did this classmate)

347
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:13,159
(steal my idea?)

348
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,879
I tried using another plug,

349
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:15,960
but still, it didn't work.

350
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,880
I called for repair,

351
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,279
but they said it was scheduled

352
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,279
for the day after tomorrow.

353
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,400
But my parents

354
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
are having really bad coughs.

355
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,920
The after-sales service isn't that good.

356
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,799
Yu Tu.

357
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,680
Take a look for Cotton.

358
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,680
(What a good line.)

359
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,799
(I have to send So Panicky)

360
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,880
(a set of skins.)

361
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,759
Jade Rabbit God.

362
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,920
You even know how to do that?

363
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Of course.

364
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,039
He is a part-time
troubleshooting expert.

365
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,000
Well, Jade Rabbit God,

366
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,599
could you

367
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,319
take a look at the purifier at my place?

368
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,559
Send me

369
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,400
your contact details.

370
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,920
(That was easy.)

371
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,000
I'll get the guys at the lab

372
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,839
to go to your place

373
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,400
and take a look.

374
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,680
(I knew it wouldn't be that easy.)

375
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,799
(It was so hard to get him
to add me on QQ back then.)

376
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,960
(Good thing
I have a trick up my sleeve.)

377
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,519
Thank you.

378
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,319
But

379
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:07,920
this is actually

380
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,960
the second repair.

381
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,920
I think there's no point
in asking them to come anyway.

382
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,000
That's so unreliable.

383
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,680
What actually went wrong?

384
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,319
I wanted to buy it.

385
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,440
But I changed my mind now.

386
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,440
That's right, Yu Tu.

387
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,039
Are your products reliable?

388
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:20,720
Jeez.

389
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,519
That's right.

390
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:22,759
I bought it

391
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,200
because it says on the ads

392
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,079
that it's the aerospace tech.

393
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,759
But I never expected this.

394
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
(Sorry.)

395
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,519
(The great aerospace industry
of the motherland.)

396
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,039
(I'll make it up to you next time.)

397
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,319
Didn't the repair guy say

398
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,519
what went wrong?

399
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,920
He seemed to be in a bad spot,

400
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,480
and he didn't say what was the problem.

401
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,000
Yu Tu.

402
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,960
Why don't you go and take a look?

403
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,279
Do you stay with your parents?

404
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,319
That's right.

405
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,440
Are they in now?

406
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,599
Yes.

407
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,720
If it's convenient,

408
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
I'll go over and take a look.

409
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:00,079
My house is in Pudong.

410
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,400
Is it too far?

411
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,839
So sorry to bother you.

412
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,240
It's fine.

413
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:05,759
Send me the address.

414
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,240
You're so lame.

415
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,960
Why do you have to go

416
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,000
when her parents are around?

417
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,279
You're the lame one.

418
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,079
Xiao Zhu.

419
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,000
Xiao Zhu.

420
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
Quickly unpack

421
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,519
this newly bought purifier.

422
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,279
Hurry.

423
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,599
How's my makeup?

424
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,640
It's too thick, isn't it?

425
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,119
I knew it.

426
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,240
It's too thick.

427
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:18,440
Do I look girlie?

428
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,759
Yes.

429
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:20,599
Well.

430
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,400
Jingjing, it's late at night.

431
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,440
What are you doing?

432
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,119
Is this a dress-up game?

433
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,319
Destroy the air purifier.

434
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:53,620
(Infinite romance,
Unleash your infinite brilliance)

435
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,160
Cotton.

436
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,400
No, it's not me.

437
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,960
I'm her assistant.

438
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,640
She sent me down to get you.

439
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,119
Assistant?

440
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,400
It's right in front.

441
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,920
I'm Xiao Zhu.

442
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
We're almost there.

443
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,519
Jingjing, why did you come downstairs?

444
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm worried someone might think

445
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,480
that I'm being a snob.

446
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,039
That's why I came down to welcome him.

447
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:38,759
It's been a while.

448
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,160
It's been a while.

449
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,240
Has it been ten years?

450
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,480
About that.

451
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,319
Let's take a look at the purifier.

452
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:01,799
I've stayed in the house for days

453
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:02,720
and haven't stepped out of it since.

454
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,200
I'm feeling a little light-headed.

455
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,559
Why don't we go for a walk first?

456
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,480
Here's the thing.

457
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,079
I wanted to use the excuse

458
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,279
that the power's off.

459
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,920
But I didn't expect Ding Chaoqun
to have used it.

460
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,720
I couldn't bear the thought

461
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,480
of destroying such a cute purifier.

462
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,160
So it's doing its work right now.

463
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:22,599
It's quite cold out there.

464
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm going back up to get changed.

465
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,920
Wait for me.

466

I don't feel so safe

473
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
walking with you.

474
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,319
Are you kidding me?

475
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,319
I should be the one to say that.

476
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,079
Look.

477
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,880
When I came out with Xiao Zhu,

478
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,799
which is the girl you saw earlier.

479
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,160
There weren't as many people

480
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,079

Don't make me get photographed,

483
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
or I'll hit the headlines.

484
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,000
Why would you play games with me?

485
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,240
Didn't you invite me?

486
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,680
You invited the wrong person.
Have you forgotten?

487
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
But...

488
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:16,559
why would you

489
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,000
be in my QQ friend list?

00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,880
(the product was sold out.)

509
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,559
(I'll post one.)

510
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,359
(I almost didn't get it.)

511
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,559
(You snatched the same product
as my muse.)

512
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,920
(How much did she get paid
for posting this?)

513
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,440
(The Crescent Moon.)

514
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,480
(Isn't your husband)

515
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,839
(working with that company?)

516
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,480
(Ask him.)

517
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:18,680
(I did.)

518
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,640
(He said he didn't pay her.)

519
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,240
(The less popular celebrity)

520
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,519
(charges 300,000 yuan for one post.)

521
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,799
(Let alone Qiao Jingjing.)

522
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,599
(My husband said)

523
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,440
(it was all sold out.)

524
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,559
(There are many more orders)

525
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,359
(with limited stocks.)

526
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,759
(We didn't see this coming.)

527
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:28,799
(Speaking of which,)

528
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,400
(the only publicity)

529
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,039
(is for all employees)

530
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,279
(to post on their Moments.)

531
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,720
(This is so cool!)

532
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,799
Why?

533
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,200
It's not like I'm endorsing
any other similar products.

534
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,000
There's no conflict.

535
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,279
Support the motherland's

536
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,680
aerospace industry.

537
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,960
Thank you.

538
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,599
You are so insincere.

539
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
I thought what was insincere

540
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,480
was lying to me

541
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,119
about taking part

542
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,400
in the Honor of Kings match.

543
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,039
I didn't lie to you.

544
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,519
I'm taking part in the match.

545
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,440
Don't you know I'm the endorser

546
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,799
of the Honor of Kings?

547
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,240
I did see the event of you
giving away runes

548
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,920
when I logged into the game.

549
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,720
A few months ago,

550
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,759
a WeChat friend of mine

551
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,079
recorded a video of me

552
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,000
playing games

553
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,799
and sent it to the marketing account.

554
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,279
You should know

555
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,480
my gaming skills.

556
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,960
So one month later,

557
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,720
I'll be going on the same stage

558
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,559
with professional players

559
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,880
to prove myself.

560
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,480
Thus, everything like that has happened.

561
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,400
Are you playing
with professional players?

562
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,440
Not all.

563
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,680
There are five lucky players.

564
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,039
So there are six of us including me.

565
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,039
Four professional players.

566
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:35,880
Two on each side.

567
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:40,799
What do you think

568
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,400
of my gaming skills

569
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,039
if I were to join the match?

570
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,039
There's no telling if I will win

571
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,640
even with you on the team.

572
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,880
So you want me to teach you?

573
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,119
Can you?

574
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,759
Not the kind

575
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:02,079
through the Internet.

576
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,000
That's too inefficient.

577
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,039
It's best if you could teach me
in person.

578
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,039
You happen to be on a break

579
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,720
right now anyway.

580
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,240
It wouldn't get in the way

581
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
of your work, right?

582
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,960
Here's the thing.

583
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,799
I've never watched a professional game.

584
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:18,720
I don't know much

585
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,920
about their gaming skills.

586
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,400
I don't know if I can teach you.

587
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,960
It's okay.

588
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,039
I won't get anyone else

589
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,039
to teach me anyway.

590
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,359
You should know that.

591
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,440
You trust me?

592
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,160
You're my classmate.

593
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:45,319
Yu Tu.

594
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,799
Teach me Math.

595
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,039
I'll treat you to crispy chicken.

596
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:58,240
Okay.

597
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,400
Really?

598
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,519
Are you doing it willingly?

599
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,640
Enough walking then.

600
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,640
Let's go back and play games.

601
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:06,440
Hold on.

602
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,440
Your parents are at home.

603
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,799
It's not so appropriate.

604
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,480
Who says that my parents are around?

605
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,039
My parents are in their hometown.

606
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,880
The only thing at home
is the Jade Rabbit Purifier.

607
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,680
What day is the game next month?

608
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:30,039
Sunday, the second week of next month.

609
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:30,920
It's on the 10th.

610
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,799
There's not much time left.

611
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,400
Let's get started now.

612
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,000
And do what?

613
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,680
I've just started playing this game
recently

614
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,240
and haven't studied it.

615
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,480
So I'm not so sure

616
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
how I should teach you.

617
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,079
But

618
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,799
you can start by telling me the mistakes
you've made

619
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,680
when you had a match with us

620
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,799
in the last few days.

621
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,000
(That was quick of him)

622
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,400
(to enter the coaching mode.)

623
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,119
(We are going to start
with the errors collection?)

624
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:58,640
Are there a lot?

625
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,160
Not really.

626
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,480
More than ten.
