What kind of job do you want?

15
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,680
I heard

16
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,440
that DF in Beijing

17
00:01:58,839 --> 00:01:59,720
gave you an offer.

18
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,879
DF has been doing well
in the past few years.

19
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:03,839
I know a lot about them.

20
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,559
If you need any help,

21
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,360
I could give you a free inquiry.

22
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,680
Thanks.

23
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,440
I've already turned down the offer.

24
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:13,080
Is that so?

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,240
Look.

26
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,759
It's Qiao Jingjing.

27
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,039
If she thinks

28
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,160
about us now,

29
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,919
will she find us very laughable?

30
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,839
We had the best grades
in school back then.

31
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,600
Now, we can't catch up to her.

32
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:00,720
No.

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,679
You're quite confident.

34
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,839
My flight is in two hours.

35
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,000
I have to go.

36
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,360
I'll take you to the subway station.

37
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,800
I haven't taken the subway in years.

38
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,199
After getting off the plane,

39
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,279
I have to meet a client.

40
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,240
I won't squeeze in with the passengers
in the subway.

41
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,639
Hello.

42
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,199
May I ask if you are

43
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,399
the passenger with the mobile number
ending in 9472?

44
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:47,759
Yes.

45
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,559
You know my intention, right?

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,279
You're only
thinking about your ambition.

47
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,119
Are love and other things

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,559
so insignificant to you

49
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
and not even worth mentioning?

50
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,240
You don't need to mock me.

51
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,119
I'm not mocking you.

52
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:18,360
I'm just expressing my sentiments.

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,559
You shouldn't delay people.

54
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,320
Why are you back?

55
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,119
Didn't you say

56
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,799
that we'd finish at 9 PM?

57
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,600
(It hasn't even taken an hour yet.)

58
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,119
(Did it go too smoothly,)

59
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,160
(or did they not get along)

60
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,079
(and just part ways?)

61
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,200
I just said it randomly.

62
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,519
If you're busy...

63
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:20,239
I'm not busy.

64
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:21,920
Let's continue.

65
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:24,760
(I think they've parted ways.)

66
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,799
After I left,

67
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:26,799
did you practice?

68
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,640
I did.

69
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:29,880
Let me see the results.

70
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,679
You're even checking my results?

71
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,320
Your damage output is quite good.

72
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,640
Of course.

73
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,040
I've improved a lot lately.

74
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,320
Go on.

75
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,359
I'll watch you play.

76
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,600
So Panicky is here too.

77
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,679
Should I ask him to join us?

78
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,079
Sure.

79
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,640
(3v3 Party)

80
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,040
Why are we fighting 3v3?

81
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160
How boring.

82
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm practicing a small-scale
team fight.

83
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,399
You're quite hard-working.

84
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,480
Cotton.

85
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,559
Do you want to consider having me
as your teacher?

86
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,839
Why?

87
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,760
Because Jade Rabbit

88
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,079
will have a girlfriend soon.

89
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,893
(Has a girlfriend?)

90
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,519
He's been leaving early
and coming home late.

91
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,880
I'm not sure what he's been doing.

92
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,967
(Leaving early and going home late)

93
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,519
Later on, I heard from Slimebag

94
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,799
that something's going on with him.

95
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,720
But I can't tell you.

96
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,359
That means

97
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,959
you must hang out with me from now on.

98
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,440
He doesn't have time for you anymore.

99
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,200
Really?

100
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:45,760
Yes.

101
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,959
He's already leaving early,
coming home late,

102
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,959
and feeling restless?

103
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,060
(Start matchmaking)

104
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,900
(Mic is turned off)

105
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,079
Focus.

106
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,079
Cotton, why are you so quiet now?

107
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:38,480
Focus.

108
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,079
How am I not focused?

109
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,519
Stop typing, speak.

110
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,480
Xiao Zhu is bringing dinner over.

111
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,839
I'll get it.

112
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,559
Xiao Zhu.

113
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,480
The yogurt I told you to buy...

114
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,920
I saw that your lights was on
when I passed by,

115
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,040
so...

116
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,519
Excuse me.

117
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:35,079
Don't you need to explain things to him?

118
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,959
We had already broken up two years ago.

119
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:38,959
What's there to explain?

120
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,480
And he's so pretentious.

121
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,039
Jingjing.

122
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,719
Just now, downstairs, why did I see...

123
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,119
Mr. Yu.

124
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,400
How can he come up?

125
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:52,960
Wasn't his biometrics for the elevator

126
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,200
already deleted?

127
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,559
But he still has the pin.

128
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,840
The pin was originally changed too,

129
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,840
but you kept forgetting it,

130
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,719
so I changed it back.

131
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,599
Then go to Property Management for me

132
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:04,320
to change it again.

133
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,400
Change it to 1316.

134
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,159
What's that?

135
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,159
It's my best result so far.

136
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,359
13:1:6.

137
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,280
Don't worry, I won't forget it.

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,679
Isn't it a bit strange today?

139
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,679
What's the matter?

140
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:34,159
Our exes who have lost contact with us

141
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,520
for many years

142
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
appeared at the same time.

143
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:43,679
I was with him for over half a year.

144
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,159
One day, he suddenly told me

145
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:45,760
that his family

146
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,119
didn't like people in my line of work.

147
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,880
He wanted me to retire
from the entertainment industry

148
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,200
before he told his family about me.

149
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,440
So I told him,

150
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,320
"My family doesn't like those

151
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,280
doing business either.

152
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,719
It's very risky,

153
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:56,919
and it's easy to get bankrupt.

154
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,359
Resign first.

155
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,039
Otherwise, my family

156
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,000
won't approve of you either."

157
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,840
Mr. Su is actually very talented.

158
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,200
He has a good reputation.

159
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,479
You know him?

160
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
I studied Finance in university.

161
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,000
I pay attention to news

162
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
in that field.

163
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:14,960
But you must not be aware

164
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,840
that he's very narcissistic.

165
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,559
What about you?

166
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,320
What about me?

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,119
You and Xia Qing.

168
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,320
Why did you break up?

169
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,840
Peipei told me about it.

170
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,440
She said that you got together

171
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,280
in your junior year.

172
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,599
She often tells me stories

173
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,719
about her classmates.

174
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,280
If you can't tell me,

175
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,400
pretend that I didn't ask.

176
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,520
It's fine.

177
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,200
Because of work,

178
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,640
after my graduation,

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,880
I left Beijing

180
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,799
and studies for my master and doctorate
degrees in Aerospace Engineering.

181
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:58,599
So it was because you weren't staying
in the same place.

182
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,919
But I was quite surprised back then

183
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:04,919
that you took Finance as a major.

184
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,799
I've always remembered

185
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,320
that your dream is the galaxy.

186
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,400
Why did you major in Finance?

187
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,359
My parents didn't approve

188
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,719
of the major I chose back then.

189
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,679
But I thought

190
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,239
that I could do both.

191
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,799
I was a bit young and frivolous.

192
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,960
But you really did it.

193
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
You even got your doctorate degree.

194
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:32,119
You're the genius in our class indeed.

195
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,479
But why are you having

196
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:39,719
such a long vacation?

197
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,640
Isn't it very busy doing research?

198
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,599
Because

199
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:55,239
I'm planning to give up on the galaxy.

200
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,559
(Yu Tu.)

201
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,479
(Chang'e 1 has been launched.)

202
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,159
Someone else

203
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,119
is a step ahead of you.

204
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,640
That's perfect, isn't it?

205
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,799
Perhaps, by the time I graduate,

206
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,719
the moon base will have been built.

207
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:36,320
I'll use the moon as a starting point

208
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,239
to conquer Mars

209
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,479
and fly through the solar system.

210
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:11,400
(Because)

211
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,320
(I'm planning to give up on the galaxy.)

212
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,919
When did you come home?

213
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:38,280
I wasn't aware.

214
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,520
I've been back a while now.

215
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,039
You were taking a call outside.

216
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,880
You met with Xia Qing?

217
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:49,880
How did you know?

218
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:51,520
How did I know?

219
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:52,760
Who am I?

220
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,119
How did it go?

221
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:58,440
I really wasn't the one who told her.

222
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,320
Xia Qing went to Hangzhou for a meeting

223
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
and met with Dragon King.

224
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Wasn't it very normal to talk about you?

225
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,000
You have so much free time.

226
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,880
You should go to work
in Shenzhen earlier.

227
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,239
Also,

228
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,400
stop speaking nonsense

229
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,359
in front of Cotton.

230
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,479
Did Cotton

231
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,080
tell on me?

232
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:18,479
I'll go into the game,

233
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,080
and deal with her.

234
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,119
Go ahead.

235
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,320
Forget it.

236
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,960
Cotton's game

237
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,320
has improved a lot lately.

238
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,119
And it's not easy to have

239
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,080
a girl in our team.

240
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,239
By the way,

241
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,960
Qu Ming called me earlier saying

242
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,679
that he wanted to treat us
to a meal tomorrow.

243
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,479
It's in Lujiazui at 6:30 PM.

244
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,640
Let's go together, okay?

245
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,239
Tomorrow, I...

246
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,119
Don't.

247
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,440
Don't keep acting this way.

248
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,440
That stingy guy

249
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,919
is finally treating us to a meal,

250
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:48,200
and it's my send-off party.

251
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,440
Show me some respect, okay?

252
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,840
Let me tell you.

253
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,320
Our classmates in Shanghai University

254
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,159
are all going.

255
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:54,719
Think about it carefully.

256
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,799
Hi, sir.

257
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,760
Do you have a reservation?

258
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,039
It's under Mr. Qu.

259
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,479
All right.

260
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,559
Okay, please follow me.

261
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,840
How many times did I tell you?

262
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,080
You just wouldn't buy it.

263
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,440
Now, you've lost money.

264
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,359
That was silly, right?

265
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,840
You lost the advantage, right?

266
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:36,479
Yu Tu.

267
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,359
Hello.

268
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,320
The great talent

269
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,200
who has a double major is here.

270
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,119
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

271
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:47,000
Welcome.

272
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,119
Everyone's here.

273
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,280
We're not late, right?

274
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:50,719
You are.

275
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:51,799
You both are late.

276
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:52,799
You're late.

277
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,239
Why did you arrive together?

278
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,799
Lujiazui isn't big.

279
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,640
We met along the way.

280
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:57,320
You happened to meet.

281
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,679
Guys.

282
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,840
I'm so happy

283
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,400
that Yu Tu can come today.

284
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,960
I thought you were ignoring us.

285
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,799
Back in school,

286
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,960
if you weren't at the library,

287
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,200
you were hanging out with people
from other departments, right?

288
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,320
You wouldn't hang out with us.

289
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,799
Those who weren't aware

290
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,719
would think that he was from
the Aeronautics Department.

291
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,320
No.

292
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:16,599
In the sports team,

293
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:17,599
Yu Tu was our department's main force.

294
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:18,080
Right.

295
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,799
Which sports team?

296
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,400
Basketball or soccer? Tell us.

297
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,200
Basketball.

298
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,000
That's nonsense.

299
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,159
I was the Basketball Team's captain.

300
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,200
Wouldn't I know that?

301
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,200
I was the center position
in the team before.

302
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,840
Right?

303
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,479
Yu Tu...

304
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,440
(After all these years,)

305
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,840
(why is Qu Ming still so fond
of teasing you?)

306
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,359
(You've already broken up
with Xia Qing.)

307
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,599
(There's no reason for him
to do that anymore.)

308
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,359
Qu Ming.

309
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,799
Didn't you say that Xia Qing
was coming too?

310
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,599
Why isn't she here yet?

311
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,760
Right.

312
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,880
Let me call her.

313
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,559
She should be on her way.

314
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,760
Wait.

315
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,320
Emma.

316
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,400
Why aren't you here yet? Tell me.

317
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:53,760
The restaurant

318
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,039
is so near to your hotel.

319
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,559
It's fine.

320
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:03,479
Do your work first.

321
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,000
It's okay.

322
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,159
Let's meet next time, okay?

323
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,239
All right.

324
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,000
Bye.

325
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:10,840
What's the matter?

326
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,559
The beautiful Ms. Xia isn't coming?

327
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,799
She has urgent matters
to attend to in Beijing.

328
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,439
She's just arrived at the airport.

329
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:17,719
Why didn't

330
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:19,280
she inform you?

331
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,959
No.

332
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
She was about to call me.

333
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,479
That's too bad.

334
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,119
We haven't seen each other for so long.

335
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:25,839
Yes.

336
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,959
Xia Qing is apologizing to us

337
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,000
in our chat group.

338
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,959
(I originally agreed)

339
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,359
(to meet you guys today.)

340
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,079
(I had urgent matters to attend to
yesterday and went back to Beijing.)

341
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,160
(I forgot to inform you.)

342
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,599
Qu Ming, didn't you say

343
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,280
that Xia Qing just went
to Beijing today?

344
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,119
What's going on?

345
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,599
Let's order.

346
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:41,719
Right, let's order.

347
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,760
You guys were so chaotic earlier.

348
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,599
I heard her wrong.

349
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,199
Right.

350
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:45,839
Don't mind her.

351
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,800
Let's order.

352
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,560
Waiter.

353
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,439
He has another motive.

354
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,479
Why did he organize a reunion

355
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:54,239
as a send-off party for me?

356
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,239
What the heck?

357
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,079
He just wanted to meet Xia Qing.

358
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,199
He couldn't get her to meet him,

359
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,479
but he got to meet you.

360
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,119
Isn't he afraid of making himself
look like a dork?

361
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,280
Lafite 1990.

362
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,719
That's a good year.

363
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:10,640
Let's drink to our heart's content.

364
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,280
Right.

365
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,000
By the way, Yu Tu,

366
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:15,959
that day,

367
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,520
I met someone from the class
next to ours.

368
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,560
He said

369
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,160
that you went to apply in their company?

370
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,680
What was the name again?

371
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
I forgot the Chinese name.

372
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,680
Anyway,

373
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,760
it's the state-owned company

374
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,520
under Ren Wang.

375
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,119
Doesn't Yu Tu work

376
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,160
in the Aerospace Research Institute?

377
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,599
Right.

378
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,280
So, Yu Tu,

379
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,920
are you planning to switch jobs?

380
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,319
Let me remind you.

381
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,199
If you switch jobs now,

382
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,880
it'll be like you start over again.

383
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
Guess the salary.

384
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,000
It will be exactly the same
as a fresh graduate.

385
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,560
Why are you even worse than me?

386
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,800
If Mr. Yu

387
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,680
sees my results tomorrow,

388
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,839
he'll surely lecture me.

389
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,400
Hey.

390
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,839
Hey, Jingjing.

391
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,599
You told me to buy a salad.

392
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,040
Guess who I met.

393
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,239
The Chief Coach of 80 Heroes,

394
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,239
Mr. Yu.

395
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,599
You know?

396
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,239
I know that he's going to have dinner there,

397
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:29,599
so I remembered that place's salad.

398
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,359
Come back after buying salad.

399
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,359
Don't go to Edward.

400
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,520
He won't accept a payment again.

401
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,599
I know.

402
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,319
I'm just buying salad.

403
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,280
Why would I go to the owner?

404
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:38,560
I'm just sitting here on the side.

405
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,560
Mr. Yu is sitting right in front of me.

406
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,479
Don't disturb him.

407
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,040
I know.

408
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:44,680
However,

409
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,160
I see someone

410
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:48,599
who's very unfriendly to him.

411
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,479
He keeps mocking him.

412
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:51,640
He's so bad.

413
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,880
I'm so furious.

414
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,119
It's fine if you have some difficulties.

415
00:19:58,199 --> 00:19:58,959
You can find former classmates like us.

416
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:01,160
We'll make some recommendations for you.

417
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,920
He works in a confidential unit.

418
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,719
There's a period of confidentiality
if he resigns.

419
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,400
Do you understand that?

420
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,640
If you don't, don't speak nonsense.

421
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,560
Since Xia Qing

422
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
won't come to meet you,

423
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,199
don't aim at him.

424
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,880
Don't speak nonsense.

425
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,920
Will you only live until 30?

426
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,719
What does that mean?

427
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,520
Why are you in such a hurry?

428
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,439
We have a long way to go.

429
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,880
Let's see what will happen after a while.

430
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:35,880
I forgot.

431
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,119
You're a great scientist.

432
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,400
Of course you're looking down

433
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,839
on people like us in Finance.

434
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,439
First, don't include the others.

435
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:47,839
Qu Ming.

436
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,959
Don't slander Yu Tu.

437
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,560
He doesn't

438
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,400
look down on us.

439
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,000
Those in the field of research

440
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,280
aren't better

441
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,119
than those in Finance,

442
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,160
and vice versa.

443
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,040
But people

444
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,760
can be narrow or open-minded.

445
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,719
What's the matter?

446
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,520
Let's not talk about that.

447
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,880
Aren't we

448
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,439
here today

449
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:07,000
for Zhai Liang's send-off party?

450
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:07,800
Right.

451
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,319
So

452
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:10,040
let's not forget the star of the night.

453
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,599
Right.

454
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,920
No, don't give me a send-off.

455
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,000
Don't say that.

456
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,119
I'm not the star of the night.

457
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,800
Actually Qu Ming is.

458
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,040
I understand Qu Ming's intention today.

459
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,719
It has nothing to do with me.

460
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:19,959
A reunion?

461
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,040
A send-off party for me?

462
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:23,719
He has another motive.

463
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:26,719
When I just resigned,

464
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,920
my annual salary was just a million.

465
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,920
The fund I was managing

466
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,000
was just in the nation's top ten.

467
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,079
I didn't feel

468
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,119
like I was so great.

469
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,839
Everyone's a junior
in front of big shots.

470
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,319
Don't be arrogant.

471
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,520
Don't show off.

472
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,439
But some kind of people

473
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,839
just earned a few bucks

474
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and forgot who he is already.

475
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:44,719
He's arrogant now.

476
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:45,160
No, Zhai Liang.

477
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,280
That's enough.

478
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,400
Zhai Liang, stop it too.

479
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,000
Zhai Liang.

480
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,959
When was your annual salary one million?

481
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:51,640
You didn't

482
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,199
even buy us a drink.

483
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:53,719
Right.

484
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:54,479
You're such a bad friend.

485
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,359
You're a bad friend.

486
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,000
Before leaving,

487
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,119
you must make it up to us.

488
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,119
Fine.

489
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,560
Let's drink to our heart's content
at home.

490
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,000
1989 Lafite.

491
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,079
Our wine is here.

492
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,719
Mr. Yu.

493
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,839
I brought over

494
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,560
the wine that you

495
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,640
and Ms. Qiao stored here.

496
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:16,760
These

497
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,280
are our owner's compliments

498
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,160
to Mr. Yu.

499
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,239
Please enjoy.

500
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,079
Sir.

501
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,760
Your wine will arrive in a while.

502
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,000
Yu Tu, you've been here before?

503
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,599
Romanee-Conti.

504
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,920
Seriously?

505
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,520
Yes, look.

506
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,040
Nice, Yu Tu.

507
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,680
Nice.

508
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,199
Let me see.

509
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,640
I wasn't expecting this from you.

510
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,199
This wine costs at least...

511
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,359
I have to go.

512
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,160
You guys enjoy.

513
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,439
Let's meet another time.

514
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,160
He took the wine too.

515
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,199
Right.

516
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:13,680
Qu Ming.

517
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,880
Eat, it's free.

518
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,680
Eat up, it's free.

519
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,520
Eat.

520
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,640
Let's eat.

521
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,959
Xiao Zhu, you forgot something again?

522
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,800
Why did you come back?

523
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,400
You brought the wine too?

524
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,239
I couldn't bear to let them drink it,

525
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,640
so I brought it back.

526
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,199
I knew where you were going,

527
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,640
so I remembered that restaurant's salad.

528
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,760
I told Xiao Zhu to buy some there.

529
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,760
Then...

530
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,880
Do you think I'm too nosy?

531
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:58,839
Am I the type

532
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,920
who's unable to distinguish between good
and bad?

533
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,479
I think so too.

534
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,199
How was it then?

535
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,560
Did you feel glad and happy?

536
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,640
Like having a successful rocket launch.

537
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,239
To celebrate the rocket launch,

538
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:13,439
do you want to have a drink?

539
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,959
Even if it's just a few hundred bucks,

540
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,280
we can't waste it.

541
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,719
A few hundred bucks?

542
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,479
Right.

543
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:21,959
You think I'm stupid?

544
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,000
Will I treat people I don't know

545
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,920
to such an expensive bottle of wine?

546
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:24,839
I

547
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,040
know the restaurant's owner.

548
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
I filmed there before.

549
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:27,800
That

550
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,119
was an empty bottle

551
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,119
that I used during shooting.

552
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Are we going to drink it or not?

553
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:33,479
Anyway,

554
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,319
I won't be playing games today.

555
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,479
My left thumb

556
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:36,640
already has a bunion.

557
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,239
I'll get some glasses.

558
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,520
It's a bit silly to sit here.

559
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,760
Let's sit where the French windows are.

560
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,920
Yu Tu, come with me.

561
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:03,760
Hurry.

562
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,400
Help me move those things

563
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,439
over there.

564
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:45,839
Candles.

565
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:58,000
Then some fruits.

566
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,640
Even if we have limited resources,

567
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
these would do.

568
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:24,719
This way please, Mr. Yu.

569
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:39,520
Twenty minutes.

570
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,319
What?

571
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,400
Thank you for letting me drink

572
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,079
Romanee-Conti that only costs
a few hundred bucks.

573
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,199
Thank you for teaching me
how to play games.

574
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:17,880
Wait.

575
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,439
Let me check something.

576
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,340
(Red wine calories, search)

577
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,246
(Calories: 96kcal for 100ml)

578
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,439
Good thing the calorie count
isn't too high.

579
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,839
Bottoms up for me

580
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,680
for this glass then.

581
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,640
The rest are yours.

582
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,079
Okay.

583
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,040
Red wine is a bit sour and bitter.

584
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,880
Rice wine still tastes better.

585
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:47,079
The kind that's made

586
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:47,920
back in my hometown.

587
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,160
My mom would make it yearly.

588
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,920
Does your family know how to make that?

589
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:51,199
Yes.

590
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,520
But it's too sweet.

591
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,280
But it tastes good.

592
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,319
The calorie count must be very high too.

593
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,239
That's out of line.

594
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:01,280
It's just a friendly reminder.

595
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,199
Here.

596
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,640
(So, Yu Tu,)

597
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,400
(are you planning to switch jobs?)

598
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,599
(If you switch jobs now,)

599
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,280
(it'll like you start over again.)

600
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,319
(Guess the salary.)

601
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,319
(It will be exactly the same
as a fresh graduate.)

602
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,359
(I've always remembered)

603
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,719
(that your dream is the galaxy.)

604
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,119
(Why did you major in Finance?)

605
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,959
(Dreams and sentiments
don't earn money.)

606
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,560
(If you live your life this way,)

607
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,079
(don't you think you are wasting
your high intelligence?)

608
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,359
Today,

609
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,479
while you were out for dinner,

610
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:20,560
I matchmade with others.

611
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,079
My teammates were all bad.

612
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,959
I chose Wang Zhaojun in one round,

613
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,239
and my teammates

614
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,160
chose Ying Zheng and Daji.

615
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:29,000
The opponents were equipped
with the siren cloak.

616
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,599
You know what?

617
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,040
I charged forward back then.
