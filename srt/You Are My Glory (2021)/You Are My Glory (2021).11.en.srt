(Jade Rabbit Pounding Elixir invites you
to a game of 5v5 Valley of Kings.)

15
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
Are you still mad?

16
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,319
You haven't replied to my message.

17
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,838
So I came to ask

18
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,679
if you still need my guidance.

19
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,838
I said something wrong the other day.

20
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:34,679
Please tell Mr. Zhang that I'm sorry.

21
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,558
I did.

22
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,679
A few days ago,

23
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,838
Mrs. Wang texted me and asked

24
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,240
if my classmate, Jingjing

25
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,360
was the celebrity, Qiao Jingjing.

26
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,960
When I wasn't there,

27
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,159
you did well in the games.

28
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,038
How did you know?

29
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,159
I saw your stats.

30
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,639
So...

31
00:04:06,118 --> 00:04:07,080
Do you still need me?

32
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,159
Those strange-looking machine parts

33
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,479
that you bought

34
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,439
are already here.

35
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,599
My address was written on it

36
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,278
but the phone number was yours.

37
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,879
Good thing that the management
helped to collect them.

38
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,720
Are you just going to
leave them at my place?

39
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,119
Of course not.

40
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,678
Come up and eat something.

41
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,480
You've prepared food for me?

42
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:47,519
I'll come again tomorrow.

43
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,559
I took the night train.

44
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,119
I stink so bad.

45
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,358
You took a night train

46
00:04:55,238 --> 00:04:57,040
and you still came here for the games?

47
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,399
I'm glad I brought a power bank.

48
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:01,079
Or it's going to run out of battery.

49
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,639
I'll ask my chauffeur to send you home.

50
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,040
You can't refuse.

51
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,040
I wouldn't want you

52
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,000
to suffocate people in the subway.

53
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:17,959
All right.

54
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:34,278
You have to keep your word.

55
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,199
For this whole year,

56
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,559
you will stay in Shanghai.

57
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,600
No more business trips.

58
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,559
If you don't keep your promise again,

59
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,838
I will teach you a lesson.

60
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,838
You always go back on your word.

61
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,238
We talked about it last year.

62
00:05:47,238 --> 00:05:49,040
You worked overtime
and went on business trips

63
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,319
for way too many times.

64
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,759
I have been keeping records.

65
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,160
You are going to cook all of these?

66
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,358
Isn't this too much?

67
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:57,439
Of course I'm cooking them.

68
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,119
You always went on an errand.

69
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,319
You barely have any good food.

70
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,199
Come here.

71
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,959
Give me a hand.

72
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,879
Okay.

73
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,399
When our son is back

74
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,399
and see these dishes,

75
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,600
he's going to be so happy.

76
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,199
He's going to ask

77
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,600
if it's a special occasion today.

78
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:24,399
Guan Zai.

79
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:26,238
How about you cook some dishes, too?

80
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,040
Never mind.

81
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,358
You'd better not

82
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,959
waste these ingredients.

83
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:50,879
Shen Jing.

84
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,600
I have something to tell you.

85
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,959
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,838
We...

87
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,358
I...

88
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,798
I have a problem.

89
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,720
But I don't think

90
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,600
it's anything serious.

91
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:14,920
It will

92
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,238
get better eventually.

93
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,278
I'm sure of it.

94
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,798
Don't worry.

95
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,980
(Tianyu City)

96
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,678
Mr. Yu.

97
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,319
You live quite far away.

98
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,040
I've been driving for an hour.

99
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,559
If you take the train as usual

100
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,759
to meet Ms. Qiao,

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,079
it's going to take you two hours.

102
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,119
Not really.

103
00:07:59,238 --> 00:08:00,600
About one hour and a half.

104
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,678
So it takes you three hours
for a round trip.

105
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,959
Mr. Wang.

106
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,920
Don't tell her this.

107
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:09,838
Sure.

108
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:10,639
Don't worry.

109
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,119
When did you come back?

110
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,279
I didn't know.

111
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:43,918
Just a while ago.

112
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,440
You didn't tell me that you're back.

113
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,320
Or I'll make you one of these, too.

114
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,479
It's fine.

115
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,399
Why did you pack your stuff again?

116
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,399
You're leaving again?

117
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,279
I'll be staying

118
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,558
somewhere else for now.

119
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,239
Please continue

120
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,399
to look after the house.

121
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,558
Your work is not done yet?

122
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:09,519
I thought you resigned.

123
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,239
They are still using you

124
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,599
before you go?

125
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,719
Hello?

126
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,479
Yu.

127
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:41,158
It's me, Shen Jing.

128
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,080
I know.

129
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,558
Guan Zai and I

130
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:51,840
are at the hospital.

131
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:55,158
Thank you for what you did

132
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:56,759
in Xi'an.

133
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:01,080
Thank you

134
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,479
for taking care of him for so long.

135
00:11:03,158 --> 00:11:04,200
I should be.

136
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,840
I was going to call you.

137
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:09,038
I'll be with him at night.

138
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,840
I'll cut to the chase then.

139
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,119
I probably

140
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,038
still need your help.

141
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,678
We don't have any relatives

142
00:11:20,918 --> 00:11:22,158
in Shanghai.

143
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,798
During the day,

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,918
my kid

145
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,080
will stay in my friend's house.

146
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,840
But at night,

147
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
I'll have to pick him up.

148
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,359
No problem.

149
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:32,879
I'll pack my stuff

150
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,798
and get there right away.

151
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,678
No rush.

152
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,119
I just have to go there

153
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,640
and pick him up at 7 PM.

154
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,719
Okay.

155
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:44,119
What's his room number?

156
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,239
I'll send it to you.

157
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:49,558
All right.

158
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,000
What's wrong?

159
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:58,519
Your colleague is sick?

160
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Do you still have one?

161
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:10,678
I'm starving.

162
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:13,840
I just had one bite.

163
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:22,279
I'll go and make another one.

164
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:41,780
(In-patient Department)

165
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,840
Shen Jing.

166
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:06,759
I'm sorry for troubling you again.

167
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,558
How is Guan Zai?

168
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,719
He did a checkup this afternoon

169
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,519
so he's not feeling well.

170
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:17,399
He just fell asleep.

171
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,719
Inside the thermos

172
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:21,200
is the porridge I bought for him

173
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,359
from the hospital cafeteria.

174
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,038
He hasn't eaten it.

175
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,599
When he wakes up,

176
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:27,840
try and ask if he feels like eating it.

177
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,639
Okay.

178
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,678
These are the toiletries

179
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,279
that I bought
at the grocery store downstairs.

180
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,279
See if you need anything else.

181
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:35,840
Okay.

182
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,558
It's enough.

183
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,960
I brought some myself.

184
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,279
I'll go and pick up my son.

185
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,399
I'll come here
before the doctor makes rounds.

186
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:49,599
I'll see you off.

187
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:50,558
It's fine.

188
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:51,320
It's okay.

189
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:03,840
I think they are making rounds

190
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,279
at 8 in the morning.

191
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,759
I will come and take over

192
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,798
before 8 AM.

193
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,359
Guan Zai's brother is a photographer.

194
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:12,519
His work is more flexible.

195
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,119
But the day before yesterday,

196
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,239
he went overseas

197
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,239
for work.

198
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,119
He can only come back

199
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,279
after his work is done.

200
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,599
Mr. Hu

201
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,119
introduced us to a doctor.

202
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,359
We contacted him.

203
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,479
But it's not within his specialty.

204
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,558
Still, he helped to reach

205
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,320
the doctor we are seeing now.

206
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,678
Please thank Mr. Hu for me.

207
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,879
Mr. Hu has work in Taiyuan.

208
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,759
He'll come here
right after he's done.

209
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:41,599
All right.

210
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,918
He actually doesn't need to.

211
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,678
Oh, right.

212
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,479
Did he take leave

213
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:48,599
from the research institute?

214
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,399
Mr. Hu told them.

215
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,759
But

216
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,399
not many people know for now.

217
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,678
Guan Zai

218
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,639
doesn't want too many visitors.

219
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,158
That's right.

220
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,279
Right.

221
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,918
We shouldn't trouble them so much.

222
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:03,960
Tomorrow morning,

223
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:05,639
he has a few checkups to do.

224
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,038
The results are only out

225
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:10,519
on Friday or Saturday.

226
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,558
So...

227
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
I'm fine.

228
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,759
I'm sorry.

229
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,840
You should head back.

230
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,558
I'm going to sit here

231
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,678
for a while.

232
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,798
I asked the doctor from Xi'an

233
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:58,840
and did some research.

234
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,440
The recovery rate is high.

235
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,798
Besides, Guan Zai is still young.

236
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,399
He's very likely

237
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,759
to recover.

238
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,399
I know.

239
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,119
I...

240
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:22,879
I have to think of a reason

241
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,200
to tell my son

242
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:29,359
why his father is not home again.

243
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,759
If I say his father has gone on a business trip,

244
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,558
he'll definitely buy it.

245
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,359
After all,

246
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,759
he never keeps his word.

247
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,519
He always lies to me.

248
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,358
Do you still feel uncomfortable?

249
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:36,719
I feel much better.

250
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,039
Do you feel like eating?

251
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,199
Drink some water?

252
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:47,519
Here.

253
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,318
Where's Shen Jing?

254
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,680
She went to pick up your son.

255
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,160
She is probably home now.

256
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:08,920
She didn't cry, did she?

257
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,838
Where is my phone?

258
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,959
(Are you home?)

259
00:18:30,598 --> 00:18:31,559
(I just woke up.)

260
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,118
I have a maths question here.

261
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:35,799
I'll send you the question.

262
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,519
Think of a few more solutions.

263
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:44,279
Your son's schoolwork?

264
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:45,439
Yes.

265
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:48,640
I can't think straight now.

266
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,439
I can only think of three solutions.

267
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,680
After you're done,

268
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,279
I'll take a picture and send him.

269
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,439
If he finds out that

270
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,680
it's not your handwriting,

271
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:33,039
your fatherly image will crumble.

272
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,598
I say,

273
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,199
you should come here less often.

274
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,719
Tomorrow,

275
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:44,598
I'll ask Shen Jing

276
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:46,199
to hire a caregiver.

277
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:49,039
I can manage on my own.

278
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,838
It's not easy
to find a reliable caregiver.

279
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:54,239
Stop making it difficult for her.

280
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,439
Honestly,

281
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,000
the recovery rate is high.

282
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
You have to keep reminding her.

283
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,920
She gets anxious easily.

284
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,039
But she listens to people.

285
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,880
She'll believe it

286
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,000
if you keep telling her that.

287
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,479
She will feel less anxious.

288
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:34,180
(In-patient Department, Emergency)

289
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,118
Careful, it's hot.

290
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:45,880
Yu.

291
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:47,479
I made porridge this morning.

292
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,838
If you don't mind,

293
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:49,759
you can have some.

294
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,078
I just brought this bowl here.

295
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:54,118
Thank you.

296
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:56,279
Stop being so courteous.

297
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,078
Or Guan Zai and I

298
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:59,680
are going to feel so bad.

299
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:03,838
It's hot.

300
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:13,680
What time did you wake up?

301
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,239
You don't have to bring me any food.

302
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:17,838
The hospital provides meals.

303
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:20,318
I was making breakfast for our son

304
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,318
so I cooked up some dishes, too.

305
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,559
Yu is here to take care of you at night.

306
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,680
I have enough time.

307
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,039
Don't worry.

308
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:31,318
Come here.

309
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,039
All right, all right.

310
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:34,759
We'll see

311
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,559
how is the hospital meal today.

312
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,719
Then, we'll decide.

313
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:38,519
All right?

314
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:54,519
You look much better than yesterday.

315
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:56,640
I'm glad you have the appetite.

316
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:01,279
Yesterday night,

317
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,680
I went home and looked up your illness.

318
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:04,439
This illness of yours

319
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:06,160
sounds terrifying.

320
00:23:07,318 --> 00:23:09,078
But the recovery rate
is considerably high.

321
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,039
You need to be confident.

322
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:17,239
Really?

323
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:18,680
You looked it up online?

324
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:19,959
Yes, I did.

325
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:21,719
I even asked the doctor.

326
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,598
He said the same thing, too.

327
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:25,078
It's because

328
00:23:25,078 --> 00:23:26,000
you are still young

329
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,318
and you have no other illness.

330
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:29,439
So please, listen

331
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,118
to the doctor and follow the treatment.

332
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,959
I'll assume that

333
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,118
you are taking a break
to stay home with me.

334
00:23:35,598 --> 00:23:36,039
Otherwise,

335
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,078
you spend almost

336
00:23:37,078 --> 00:23:38,318
half of the year outside working.

337
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,118
Now you can't.

338
00:23:41,358 --> 00:23:42,000
Okay.

339
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:45,078
I feel assured now.

340
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,559
Yu.

341
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:52,959
The porridge

342
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:53,920
won't last you long.

343
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,439
Here.

344
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:56,920
I bought two meat buns.

345
00:23:57,118 --> 00:23:58,559
They are from the stall
in my neighbourhood.

346
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,680
It's really good.

347
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,519
Try it.

348
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:02,000
I'll bring them with me.

349
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:14,880
Here you go.

350
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,500
(Chinese Buns)

351
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:38,479
Look.

352
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:39,719
I lost ten stars.

353
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,220
(Match Scoreboard: Defeat)

354
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:50,719
And you are feeling proud?

355
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:52,279
There will be wins and losses.

356
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:53,318
Besides, in five of the losses,

357
00:24:53,318 --> 00:24:54,479
I was still the MVP.

358
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,318
(Welcome back, Yu...)

359
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:00,479
What's with this round?

360
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,000
Shouyue.

361
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,479
16% damage output.

362
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,880
(He's so strict.)

363
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,519
That's the problem of the Support.

364
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,680
Look.

365
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,078
The mid kept wandering around
somewhere else.

366
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,400
Our middle tower
was destroyed soon after.

367
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,400
And in this round,

368
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,160
the jungler

369
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,598
was unpredictable.

370
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:18,279
He couldn't catch

371
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:18,799
the other side's Marksman at all,

372
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,959
and helped the Marksman to farm.

373
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:23,000
Do we go solo

374
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,199
or duo matchmaking?

375
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,719
I'll carry you.

376
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:26,959
Did something good happen

377
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,000
during your business trip?

378
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,799
I can't believe you are willing
to carry me.

379
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,640
That's kind of you.

380
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:31,799
Where did you go for your business trip?

381
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,598
It was so sudden.

382
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,400
Did something serious happen?

383
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:37,759
Xi'an.

384
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:39,559
I can't tell you the rest.

385
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:40,598
It's confidential.

386
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,799
You can't even tell your family?

387
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:47,439
I don't mean me.

388
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,799
I can't.

389
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,318
That's boring.

390
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,239
There's no topic to talk about then.

391
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,719
Probably.

392
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,759
Let's begin.

393
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,719
I'll have breakfast first.

394
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,759
You bought me meat buns?

395
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:10,358
I'm raising the temperature
for the floor heating.

396
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,199
Why are you idling in the Base?

397
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:11,759
I didn't mean to abandon you.

398
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,680
Trust.

399
00:27:15,118 --> 00:27:15,880
I know.

400
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,006
(Victory)

401
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:20,759
Your gaming style

402
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,199
has changed after you came back.

403
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,318
You are being aggressive.

404
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:24,959
You're not using your usual hero, too.

405
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,680
I'm changing my style.

406
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,920
Get used to it.

407
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:50,519
We reached ten consecutive wins

408
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,039
faster than yesterday.

409
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:56,279
You carry on.

410
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:57,838
I'll go and fix the projector.

411
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,507
(My 10th consecutive win)

412
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,160
(Look.)

413
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,239
(These are the stars
that I've earned for you.)

414
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,559
(Try playing on your own.)

415
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,598
(Don't worry about losing them.)

416
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,479
How long do you need to fix it?

417
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,959
Soon.

418
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:38,000
If it's still not fixed,

419
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,838
let's sneak into the place

420
00:28:38,838 --> 00:28:40,640
to watch the final match.

421
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,039
Do you actually want to go?

422
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,680
That depends on your performance.

423
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,039
Don't drag me down.

424
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,160
I'm matchmaking solo.

425
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,680
I'm getting stunned again.

426
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:09,640
Help...

427
00:29:15,598 --> 00:29:16,680
Try harder.

428
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:18,880
(That Luna)

429
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,479
(ran out of mana.)

430
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:22,400
(Luna, you're so weak.)

431
00:29:22,598 --> 00:29:23,439
(Let's start the next round.)

432
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:24,598
(Hurry up.)

433
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,118
Teach that Su Lie a lesson.

434
00:29:26,118 --> 00:29:27,318
He keeps laughing at me.

435
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,880
We don't have enough money.

436
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,279
We can't defeat him now.

437
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:49,920
But we can tease him.

438
00:29:52,060 --> 00:30:00,913
(Hand-picked Cotton)

439
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,640
Did he think

440
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,920
he could kill you?

441
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:03,799
But

442
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,479
we teased him instead.

443
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,279
(Money is important.)

444
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:15,959
(Don't waste your time)

445
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:17,199
(on unnecessary stuff.)

446
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,239
(If it was before,)

447
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:22,078
(he wouldn't have entertained
these requests.)

448
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,799
(He might even give me a lecture.)

449
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,318
(He seems different
after the business trip.)

450
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:34,479
Yu Tu,

451
00:30:35,838 --> 00:30:37,239
can I use your phone

452
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:39,078
to play these few days?

453
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,279
I have to use

454
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,640
a phone model meant for
the match.

455
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,838
Your phone

456
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:45,838
is the same model.

457
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,838
I'm thinking

458
00:30:46,838 --> 00:30:47,318
if I can

459
00:30:47,318 --> 00:30:48,519
get some practice.

460
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,880
The passcode is 0424.

461
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,358
Go and get it from the living room.
