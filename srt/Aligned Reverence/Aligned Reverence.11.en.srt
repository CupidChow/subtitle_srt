(Propriety between uncle and sister-in-law)

14
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:48,979
Swallow it.

15
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,340
It is an antidote.

16
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,580
Yunxi.

17
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,780
So it really is you.

18
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,250
Since you are still alive,

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,860
why not return home?

20
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,580
One in the light and one in the shadows,
only then can we act freely.

21
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,660
Until the Linchuan case is cleared,

22
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,260
I must remain a dead man to the world.

23
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,980
Go back.

24
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,699
Do not let Grandmother

25
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,500
and Mother worry.

26
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,260
What about her?

27
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,420
Should I tell Sister-in-law

28
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,740
that you are alive?

29
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,340
No need.

30
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,100
Vengeance is not yet taken.

31
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:56,037
How can there be room for affection?

32
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,940
Go.

33
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,299
Someone come quickly.

34
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,620
Sixth Young Master fainted
the moment he entered the manor.

35
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,660
It is fine.

36
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,060
He pulled through.

37
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,739
He took the antidote beforehand.

38
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,460
He is in no real danger now.

39
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,040
But he will likely run a fever
as the poison disperses tonight.

40
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,670
Keep a close watch on him.

41
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,020
Thank you, Physician Xi.

42
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,460
Little lady,

43
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:37,019
you had better

44
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,860
take good care of him.

45
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,460
He is weaker than
a young girl half the time.

46
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,420
Disturbing others in the dead of night.

47
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,380
Yunxi.

48
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,340
Danger.

49
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,020
Why?

50
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,740
Why is it her?

51
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,580
Why Jinyuan?

52
00:04:25,562 --> 00:04:26,857
Yuan.

53
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,020
Yuan.

54
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:34,195
Yuan.

55
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,285
Yuan, do not go.

56
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,460
Do not leave.

57
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,607
Yuan.

58
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,780
Yuan, please do not go.

59
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,020
I am hurt.

60
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,580
Young Master.

61
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,219
Last night,

62
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,739
Young Madam watched over you until dawn.

63
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,379
She prepared
this calming incense for you,

64
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,620
so you may rest well.

65
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,260
Thank you to her.

66
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,460
But I slept quite well.

67
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,820
Slept well?

68
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,380
Young Master, you...

69
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,074
You should

70
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:33,580
fix your sleep-talking habit.

71
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,780
Sleep-talking?

72
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,842
What did I say?

73
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,407
How could you call Young Madam
by her given name?

74
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:45,002
I...

75
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,740
What did I call her?

76
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:48,002
How did I call her?

77
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:49,357
You called her...

78
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,299
Yuan.

79
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,019
Do not go.

80
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,739
Yuan.

81
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,140
I am hurt.

82
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,222
She heard everything?

83
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,780
This...

84
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,660
Yan.

85
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:25,497
Well...

86
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,120
I am preparing the hundred-day memorial
for Father and Brother.

87
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:30,845
I will go to Puji Temple
to pray for them.

88
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,245
I need you to write a memorial eulogy.

89
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,460
Alright.

90
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,011
I...

91
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:47,859
I will write it now.

92
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,619
I will write it.

93
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,582
I will write it.

94
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,619
Young Madam.

95
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,740
Give it to me.

96
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,845
I will go to the storehouse
and prepare the offerings list.

97
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,499
The storehouse

98
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,100
is not even in that direction.

99
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,520
(May my brother, Xiao)

100
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:32,170
(Xiao Yunxi)

101
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:37,970
(May my brother, Xiao Yunxi)

102
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,660
Yunxi.

103
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,945
(Xiao Yunxi)

104
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,220
(Xie Yunyan.)

105
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,460
(How could you have such thoughts?)

106
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,259
(What you should do)

107
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,660
(is uncover the truth.)

108
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,780
Young Master.

109
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:13,945
The eulogy is finished?

110
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:15,075
It is done.

111
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:16,880
Ready the horses.
We are going to the garrison.

112
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,939
Young Master,

113
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,940
shouldn't the eulogy
be given to Young Madam?

114
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,060
You give it to her.

115
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,745
Young Master,

116
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,030
is he avoiding Young Madam?

117
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,180
(Grandmother said,)

118
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,860
(girls)

119
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,580
(should be cherished and cared for.)

120
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,180
When I restore Xiao Manor one day,

121
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,979
I will let all of you

122
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,260
be cherished like that.

123
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,300
Yuan.

124
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,810
Mother.

125
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,259
Yan's appointment as Captain

126
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,740
was thanks to your efforts.

127
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,740
This bracelet

128
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,100
was meant for Yunxi's wife.

129
00:09:20,112 --> 00:09:21,232
Put it on.

130
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,782
It suits you well.

131
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,500
Wear it when you go pray

132
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,220
the day after tomorrow.

133
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,340
Yunxi will be pleased to see it.

134
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:40,755
I will return first.

135
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,460
Yan.

136
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,780
And that one.

137
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,380
Take another bundle of incense.

138
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,780
Thank you.

139
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,700
Is that not the widow
from Xiao Manor going to pay respects?

140
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,219
She will not even acknowledge
her own relatives,

141
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,659
yet she weeps so earnestly

142
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,860
at someone else's grave.

143
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,699
You

144
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,380
call yourselves family?

145
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:28,536
Not quite as eager as you were

146
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:30,049
when scheming to take another's place

147
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,330
and marry into the Xiao family,

148
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,686
though neither my husband
nor Sixth Brother

149
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:36,247
ever wanted you.

150
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,580
Su Jinyuan,

151
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,339
if you had not interfered,

152
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,260
Xie Yunyan would already be mine.

153
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,786
Daydreaming

154
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,507
under the sun again?

155
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,380
Xing'er, let us go.

156
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:58,205
Did I not warn you

157
00:11:58,562 --> 00:12:00,642
to stay away from the Xiao family?

158
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,450
But I like you.

159
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,095
She humiliated me first.

160
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,036
She is only your sister-in-law.

161
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:17,037
Why should she keep you close like that?

162
00:12:19,212 --> 00:12:20,852
Mind your words.

163
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,619
We are in public.

164
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,907
Control yourself.

165
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:43,259
See that?

166
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,420
Young Master Xie blushed just now.

167
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:47,677
It means he still has feelings for me.

168
00:12:48,537 --> 00:12:49,659
You should just stay put

169
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,979
and be the Xiao family's widow.

170
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,300
Stop longing for your brother-in-law.

171
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:58,886
Young Master Xie, your Sixth Brother,

172
00:12:58,887 --> 00:13:00,847
I will have him one day.

173
00:13:03,112 --> 00:13:04,232
Return to the manor.

174
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,020
Where is she going to perform the rites?

175
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,140
I heard Puji Temple.

176
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,900
Xiao Yunxi.

177
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:39,892
Does it look nice?

178
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,450
What looks nice?

179
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,940
The scenery.

180
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,540
The Xiao family is going
to Puji Temple today for blessings.

181
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,432
So,

182
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,380
are you going?

183
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,300
Physician Xi.

184
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,215
I need to trouble you with something.

185
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,300
I cannot meet Yan openly.

186
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,100
Please let him know for me.

187
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,932
Someone is watching him.

188
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,220
I am a physician.

189
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,980
Look at what I
have to deal with every day.

190
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,940
I... Finally dressed like a lady once,
and now I have to change back.

191
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,820

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,049

and set river lanterns,

196
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,286
it feels like just yesterday.

There may be fewer of us this year,

199
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,980
