(Heaven Rewards Diligence)

15
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,780
Young Master Xie.

16
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,860
I made a new set of clothes for you.

17
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,540
The fabric is soft and gentle.

18
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,220
Best for recovery and health.

19
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,020
Come out and take it.

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,539
Alright.

21
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,380
You may leave it outside.

22
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,860
What is wrong?

23
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,259
Nothing.

24
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,820
I was applying medicine.

25
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,219
Young Master Xie.

26
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,460
Young Master Xie.

27
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,820
Are you alright?

28
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,820
Let me help you.

29
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,739
I can do it myself.

30
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,660
It is fine.

31
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,660
The dignified Sixth Young Master Xie,

32
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,820
yet so badly injured,

33
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,300
and still refusing help like this.

34
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,780
Are you embarrassed, or afraid of pain?

35
00:02:47,937 --> 00:02:49,257
If you will not let me apply it,

36
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,340
I will tell Grandmother and Mother.

37
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,780
They can come apply it for you.

38
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,220
No, wait.

39
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,700
Fine.

40
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,250
If it hurts,

41
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,540
call out.

42
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,660
There is no shame in it.

43
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,545
I have yet to ask you,

44
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,157
your injury,

45
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,380
has it healed?

46
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,980
I am fine.

47
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,500
It no longer troubles me.

48
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,660
Here.

49
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,260
You must not do this anymore.

50
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,260
Always enduring injuries in silence,

51
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,980
holding back the pain,

52
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,100
and saying it does not hurt.

53
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,860
But you,

54
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:25,220
are you not the same?

55
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:34,662
I lost my parents at a young age.

56
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,899
I have eaten enough bitterness.

57
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,460
So pain no longer feels like pain.

58
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,620
That was before
my elder brother and I appeared.

59
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,860
From now on, I will protect you.

60
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,995
It is I who has failed the Xiao family.

61
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,620
I am unworthy of such kindness.

62
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,285
I only wish...

63
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,180
Enough.

64
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,260
Let me help you.

65
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,220
I can manage on my own.

66
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,260
I have put it away for you.

67
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,940
Su Jinyuan.

68
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,740
I know you struggle to forgive yourself.

69
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,700
But to me,

70
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,740
you are the one most worthy.

71
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,215
Thank you,

72
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:54,357
Xie Yunyan.

00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:19,877

are blooming beautifully.

74
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,860
Look.

75
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:22,899
Yes.

76
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,140
Grand Madam, Madam.

77
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,060
What is the matter?

78
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,860
The General and the Young General

79
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,980
have fallen in battle for the nation.

80
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,700
Impossible.

81
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,820
Impossible.

82
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,580
Impossible!

87
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,420
Sixth son of the Xiao family,
Xie Yunyan,

88
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,910
brings father and brother home.

89
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:13,005

91
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,020
Jin.

92
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,540
Yunxi.

93
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,420
Yunxin.

94
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:36,607
You are home.

95
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:39,074
Home at last.

96
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:40,619
(Xiao Manor)

97
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,270
Their spirits have not yet dispersed.

98
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,345
Their remains return home.

99
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,899
Welcome the General
and the Young General

100
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,470
back to the manor!

101
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,379
The garrison received a secret order.

102
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,539
It is suspected that the Xiao father
and son may have faked their deaths.

103
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,379
We are ordered to investigate.

104
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,980
Open the coffins for examination.

105
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,179
Today is the day

106
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,145
our departed return home.

107
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,619
His Majesty granted this.

108
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,740
The order you follow,

109
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,539
from whom does it come?

110
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,699
The Xiao father and son
died without cause.

111
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,620
You hinder us at every step.

112
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,059
Clearly something is amiss

113
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,460
within these coffins.

114
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,699
Open them.

115
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,520
Yes.

116
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,540
If you wish to open them,

117
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,620
you must step over my body first.

118
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,220
Any who obstruct

119
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,980
shall be killed without mercy.

120
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,299
The case of Linchuan remains unsettled.

121
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,499
Sir Luo, do you intend to exterminate
the Xiao family on your own authority?

122
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,540
Stand aside.

123
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,940
Xie Yunyan.

124
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,740
Open the coffin.

125
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,339
You wretched dog.

126
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,500
Do you truly think
the Xiao family has no one left?

127
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,120
(To the General of the Northern Cavalry.
A matter of utmost secrecy.)

128
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,220
(They forged a secret letter
accusing the Xiao family of treason.)

129
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,860
The coffin opening is but a pretense.

130
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,060
To frame the Xiao family is the truth.

131
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,870
Even if it costs my life today,

132
00:10:57,975 --> 00:10:59,335
I will kill you.

133
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,299
Xie Yunyan.

134
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,259
Let go.

135
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,620
He is not worth it.

136
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,980
Would you risk your life again

137
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,420
for a villain,
and let the Xiao family lose you too?

138
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,220
Then I will ask His Majesty myself.

139
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,980
In this world,

140
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,260
where lies justice?

141
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:36,632
(Zichen Gate)

142
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,099
The Xiao family
suffers unjust accusations.

143
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,460
Their loyal spirits cannot rest.

144
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,620
We swear to clear our name.

145
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,580
Let heaven and earth bear witness.

146
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,300
I will stand with you.

147
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,260
One strike of the grievance drum

148
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,660
means one must
shed blood to seek justice.

149
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,500
Are you certain?

150
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,374
The Xiao family suffers
unjust accusations.

151
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,895
Their loyal spirits cannot rest.

152
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,180
We swear to clear our name.

153
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,940
