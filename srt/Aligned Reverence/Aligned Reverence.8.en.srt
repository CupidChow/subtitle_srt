(The One in My Dreams)

14
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,460
So you want to die as well?

15
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,357
What do you think you're doing?

16
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:25,974
Aren't you afraid we'll report you?

17
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:27,095
Go on then.

18
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:29,405
If I die,

19
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,330
I'll make sure your whole family
goes down with me.

20
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,886
Right now,

21
00:01:37,887 --> 00:01:39,287
get out of Xiao Manor.

22
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:40,785
Out.

23
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,740
You dare cause trouble here,

24
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,019
in the Xiao household?

25
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,320
What is it you want?

26
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:20,167
Get out. Now.

27
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,282
Xie Yunyan.

28
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,749
One day you'll see

29
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,995
who she really is.

30
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,024
You're still injured.

31
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:38,145
Don't get worked up.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,520
Let me take you back to rest.

33
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,682
All right.

34
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:49,957
(Three days later)

35
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,100
Come here.

36
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,140
Mother.

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,020
Kneel.

38
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,540
Mother.

39
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,980
Did I do something wrong?

40
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,220
Take a good look at this.

41
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:34,827
It's all over the streets and alleys.

42
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:37,200
(Scandal claims the Xiao family)
It's bad enough they mock the Xiao family

43
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,615
(murdered and stole a bride)
for the broken betrothal,

44
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:40,932
now they even accuse us

45
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,336
of killing your lover

46
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:43,977
and stealing his wife.

47
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:45,179
Mother.

48
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,011
The Su family is slinging mud at us.
I'll confront them right away.

49
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:49,020
Stay on your knees.

50
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,232
Do you think you can explain this away?

51
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:54,452
Do you want the Xiao family
shamed even more?

52
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:55,336
But...

53
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:56,777
But what?

54
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,500
In the end,

55
00:03:58,667 --> 00:03:59,786
it is your conduct in question

56
00:03:59,787 --> 00:04:01,787
that brings trouble to our door.

57
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:07,685
My poor Yunxi…

58
00:04:07,862 --> 00:04:09,882
Even in death his name
is dragged through the mud.

59
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
Do not worry, Mother.

60
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:16,325
I will settle this.

61
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:18,542
If I fail,

62
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:21,912
I will leave the Xiao family myself.

63
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,140
Mother was

64
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:55,665
only speaking in anger.

65
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,020
I know.

66
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:00,967
The Su family is targeting me.

67
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:03,295
Even so,

68
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,957
I will not sit here

69
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,060
and let them smear the Xiao name.

70
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:10,612
Do not worry.

71
00:05:11,137 --> 00:05:13,497
I will clear this up.

72
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,790
If worst comes to worst,

73
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:16,385
I'll drag Lu Zhuo out

74
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,660
and face him in court.

75
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:24,045
No need.

76
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,140
I killed him.

77
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,790
The day you came for me,

78
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,300
I killed him.

79
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,942
I burned the body, nothing left to find.

80
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:42,715
The Su family
wants to use this against me.

81
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,700
But I refuse to bow.

82
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:46,875
It was Lu Zhuo

83
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:48,782
who tricked me and ruined me.

84
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:04,999
He owed me his life.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He deserved to die.

86
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,580
It's only one less villain in the world.

87
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,315
I've dealt with villains

88
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:21,692
far more than you ever have.

89
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:23,755
Justice always comes around.

90
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:28,075
You should smile.

91
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,660
Xie Yunyan.

92
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,140
Thank you.

93
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,730
Physician Xi.

94
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,999
Why is Yan

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,640
not recovering at all?

96
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,724
If you ask me,

97
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:25,219
Young Master Xie is probably
heartsore and worn out.

98
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,100
Maybe hoping someone
will look after him.

99
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,532
Watch your tongue.

100
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,849
Physician Xi.

101
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,920
Is Yan running a fever?

102
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,340
His face is so red.

103
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,660
Him?

104
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:44,682
I bet he's thinking of someone.

105
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,499
Stop spouting nonsense.

106
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,260
What I mean is,

107
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,260
you're thinking of your dream girl.

108
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,580
Otherwise why would
his face be red like that?

109
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,670
Good, no fever.

110
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,340
Yan, do you like someone?

111
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,899
Don't listen to her babbling.

112
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,832
I...

113
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,539
If you truly like someone,

114
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,619
you must tell me.

115
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,220
I will help you see if she's worthy.

116
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,590
Rest and heal.

117
00:08:58,075 --> 00:08:59,555
Yan.

118
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,020
Am I the one you dream of?

119
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,900
(Do you care for me?)

120
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:14,927
(Yan.)

121
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,579
Yan.

122
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,779
Are you awake?

123
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,300
It's time for your medicine.

124
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,260
I am coming in.

125
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,020
All right.

126
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,460
Do not forget the medicine.

127
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:44,987
Your wound hurts again?

128
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,507
No.

129
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,390
No.

130
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:03,927
Why are you staring like that?

131
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,060
Am I the one in your dreams?

132
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:18,732
You must be fevered.

133
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:25,145
What is wrong with you now?

134
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,100
Medicine making you delirious?

135
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:36,186
Weren't you giving me medicine?

136
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:37,547
Hand it to me.

137
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,660
Here.

138
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,020
Slow down.

139
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:56,672
Have a candied plum
to ease the bitterness.

140
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,540
It is my favorite. Try one.

141
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,660
Should you not be busy?

142
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,845
Xiang Lei,
remember to change his dressing.

143
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:21,645
Rest well and recover.

144
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,219
Xiang Lei, take good care of him.

145
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,819
I will be stepping out.

146
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,940
Yes.

147
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,620
Young Master.

148
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,380
Leave that for now.

149
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,179
Later,

150
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,740
come with me to see Heir Qi.

151
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,870
Do not tell the Young Madam.

152
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,980
The Young Madam
has just gone to see him herself.

153
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,819
You in women's attire

154
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
is surprisingly refreshing.

155
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,979
Young Lady Su is bold indeed.

156
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,859
The whole city is talking

157
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,019
about the Xiao family
killing for love and stealing a wife.

158
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,660
Yet you dares to step out and secretly meet me,
a man outside her household.

159
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,259
I came to see you

160
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,019
for this very reason.

161
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,432
I will take this before His Majesty
and wash away the slander.

162
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,699
Young Lady Su,
you are fiercer than you look.

163
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,619
Risking everything
just to keep your honor.

164
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,180
I admire that.

165
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,420
You misunderstand.

166
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,240
When Su family made that scene,

167
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:39,405
they humiliated more than me.

168
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,260
They shamed the Xiao family,
already stripped of rank.

169
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,340
I see.

170
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,859
So what you want

171
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,020
is not merely to clear your name,

172
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,740
also get Yan

173
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,980
a position.

174
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,580
Correct.

175
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,336
Luo Yu is dead,

176
00:13:01,337 --> 00:13:04,017
yet traces of his crimes remain.

177
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,380
Yan has long sought
to serve in the Garrison.

178
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,660
When I present my petition,

179
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,780
I hope you will help open the path.

180
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:18,707
(Rook)

181
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,199
I cannot meddle

182
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,661
in military affairs.

183
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:25,745
(Rook)

184
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,539
If Yan joins the Garrison
and the Xiao family rises again,

185
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,220
would that not grant you
influence in the army?

186
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:47,786
You impress me more

187
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:48,936
each time.

188
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:50,417
Do it.

189
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,419
A Captain of the Garrison for Yan,

190
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,540
I will secure the post for you.

191
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,500
Qi Sheng,

192
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:57,739
this matter concerns me.

193
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,700
Why are you doing it for her sake?

194
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,922
Yan.

195
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:08,299
I intend

196
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,260
to work with the Xiao family.

197
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,260
So speak with me,

198
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,140
and leave her out of this.

199
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,700
Go.

200
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,382
(Pawn. Chu River)

201
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,236
Once the pawn crosses the river,

202
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:35,659
(Pawn. Chu River)

203
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,300
there is no turning back.

204
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:43,620
(Pawn)

205
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,282
(Feiwan Pavilion)

206
00:14:52,702 --> 00:14:55,760
So entering the Garrison to investigate
is what you called planning ahead?

207
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,339
The Garrison matters

208
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,940
I will handle myself.

209
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,970
The Xiao family still needs you here.

210
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:03,072
Do not risk yourself again.

211
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:09,552
Very well.

212
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:11,382
I will listen to you.

213
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,699
Physician Xi said

214
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,274
you need more bed rest.

215
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:17,635
Lie down and sleep a while.

216
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,461
It is too warm today.

217
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:29,742
I cannot stand the heat.

218
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,780
Fan me for a bit, will you?

219
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,380
Young Master Xiao,

220
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,100
you do know how to order people around.

221
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:39,524
It is only early spring,

222
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:41,205
and you want someone to fan you?

223
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:45,316
What do you know?

224
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:45,636
I…

225
00:15:45,637 --> 00:15:46,732
Fine.

226
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,011
I will stay right here.

227
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:49,311
Not going anywhere.

228
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:51,672
I will have Xiang Lei
fetch a fan from storage.

229
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:08,827
He fell asleep already?

230
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,980
Of course.

231
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:12,822
I, Xi Junning, never fail.

232
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,780
But you doing all this for the Xiao family,

233
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,100
is it really worth it?

234
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,940
Do not think too highly of me.

235
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,961
Only if the Xiao family stands,

236
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:24,220
do I stand with them.

237
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,857
