=Episode 22=
(I want to stand equal to heaven)

14
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,980
It seems I am not the only one who wants
to interrogate Prince Yu tonight.

15
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,820
I will go find out more.

16
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,340
He is not dead, is he?

17
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,260
I knew what to do.

18
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,900
Yan.

19
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,539
What happened?

20
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,740
Leave quickly.

21
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,095
Pretend you were never here.

22
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:45,992
I am now framed as the killer
who poisoned Prince Yu.

23
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,580
Go now.

24
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,580
Unless you explain everything,
I will not leave.

25
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,300
Yuan,

26
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,500
the one who caused the downfall
of the entire Xiao family

27
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,060
is the Emperor.

28
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,300
Your Majesty.

29
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,579
I knew you

30
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,420
would definitely protect me.

31
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,580
You are wrong.

32
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,500
As of today,

33
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,620
no one can protect you.

34
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:28,847
Do not worry.

35
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,540
The Nanyue poison

36
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,940
will ensure you have a quick death.

37
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:39,799
Your Majesty.

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,139
You cannot kill me.

39
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,339
You must not kill me!

40
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,700
If you kill me, I will...

41
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,860
Your Majesty.

42
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,860
Why?

43
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,100
Have you forgotten

44
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,660
that I was the one who helped you
poison our father back then?

45
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,780
Otherwise, this throne

46
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,620
would have belonged
to Prince Duan long ago.

47
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,700
Therefore,

48
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,980
both you and the Xiao family

49
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,860
must die.

50
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,260
So that is the truth.

51
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,180
It was you

52
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,419
who colluded with Nanyue
to frame the Xiao family,

53
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,499
wasn't it?

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,674
In fact,

55
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,555
you had already colluded
with Nanyue long ago.

56
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,480
No wonder as soon
as our Imperial Father died,

57
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,940
Nanyue launched an attack.

58
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,860
What a meticulous scheme.

59
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,420
First, you used me
to eliminate the Xiao family,

60
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,380
and then you used Xie Yunyan
to eliminate me!

61
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:17,819
Do you think

62
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,260
if I die,

63
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,259
no one will know

64
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,220
about your dirty deeds?

65
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,620
I will be waiting for you
in the afterlife.

66
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,420
The Xiao family's private seal,

67
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,540
the Edict of Succession...

68
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:11,837
The private seal...

69
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:14,682
The Edict...

70
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:46,985
Dare to fight me?

71
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,700
Xie Yunyan

72
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,260
poisoned Prince Yu.

73
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:01,592
Prince Yu retaliated before his death

74
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,260
and wounded Xie Yunyan.

75
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,757
He was captured
on the spot by the guards.

76
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,060
Xie Yunyan,

77
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,700
if you want the elderly, weak,

78
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,780
women, and children
of the Xiao family to live,

79
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,420
confess your crime obediently.

80
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,140
The Xiao family's private seal

81
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,739
is related to the
late Emperor's Edict of Succession.

82
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,900
That is why the Emperor caused the
destruction of the entire Xiao family.

83
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,860
Yuan,

84
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,980
he is the Emperor.

85
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:54,407
The Xiao family cannot defeat him.

86
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,259
Only if I die

87
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,780
will you all be safe.

88
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,779
Protect Grandmother and the others.

89
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,782
Go.

90
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,100
Yan,

91
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,449
hiding and backing down will not help.

92
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,010
As long as the Edict of Succession
remains a threat,

93
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,220
the Emperor will never
let the Xiao family go.

94
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,757
What are you going to do?

95
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,140
Xie Yunyan,

96
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,780
promise me

97
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,940
you will not confess.

98
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,180
Stay alive.

99
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,440
Wait for me to come back
and save you.

100
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,970
Yuan.

101
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,100
(Xie Yunyan.)

102
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,420
(I always thought it was
because you acted so drastically)

103
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,820
(that in the last life)

104
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,870
(you became so cynical)

105
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,260
(and chose to ruin the world.)

106
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,407
Slaughter all
the wicked officials in court

107
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,620
to honor the heroes of my Xiao family.

108
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,140
(Now I understand,)

109
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,380
(it was the Qing Emperor
who twisted right and wrong,)

110
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,900
(allowing monsters and evil spirits
to run rampant in this world,)

111
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,140
(making good people stepping stones
and paving bones.)

112
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,179
(But I insist on justice being served)

113
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,980
(and all grievances settled.)

114
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,060
(Xie Yunyan,)

115
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,260
(I want to set the world right.)

116
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,499
(Xiao Ancestral Hall)

117
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,620
Yuan,

118
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,579
why did you wake us up

119
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,500
in the middle of the night?

120
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,740
Where is Yan?

121
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,220
I remember you two returned together
from the court.

122
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,220
Grandmother, Mother,

123
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,330
tonight you must leave
the capital to avoid disaster.

124
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,570
Heir Qi will help.

125
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,302
Avoid disaster? What disaster
are you talking about?

126
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,020
The Emperor

127
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,820
is the one who murdered the Xiao family.

128
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,161
Tonight,

129
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:03,980
he is framing Yan again

130
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,740
for poisoning Prince Yu.

131
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,374
He is using the lives of everyone
in the Xiao family to force Yan to confess.

132
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,895
What?

133
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,500
Mother.

134
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,019
I will

135
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,299
explain the details after I

136
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,340
rescue Yan.

137
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,500
However, this undertaking is perilous.

138
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,020
I can only act freely

139
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,180
once you have left.

140
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,619
Saving him is urgent.

141
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,259
This is not the time to talk.

142
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,340
Go quickly and prepare to leave.

143
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,900
Alright.

144
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,020
Yuan,

145
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,580
do you already have a plan?

146
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,340
I want to set the world right.

147
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,220
Young Lady Su,

148
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,082
this is indeed shocking.

149
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,620
Tonight,

150
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,340
I was never here.

151
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,220
Is it not a little late

152
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
for Your Lordship to withdraw now?

153
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,420
Are you trying to implicate me?

154
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,020
Did Your Lordship not ask Luo

155
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,660
to seek justice for the Xiao family?

156
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:46,927
Therefore, saving Xie Yunyan

157
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,020
is something you must do.

158
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,300
Su Jinyuan, are you out of your mind?

159
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,792
Tell me how to save him.

160
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,260
Are we to storm the imperial prison
or raid the execution ground?

161
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,960
How many lives do you have to waste?

162
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,899
You know what I mean.

163
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,819
Naive.

164
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,699
Without a just cause,

165
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,100
we will only become rebels scorned
by the entire world.

166
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,820
Tonight, I learned
an earth-shattering secret.

167
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,295
The late Emperor
was killed by Prince Yu.

168
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,900
That is how the current Emperor
seized his opportunity.

169
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,020
In those years,

170
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,379
Prince Duan, as the crown prince,

171
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,020
was nonetheless kept from the throne.

172
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,680
I know you harbor resentment,

173
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,080
and have been secretly plotting
and preparing for a long time.

174
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,700
If we have the late Emperor's Edict,

175
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,259
and in addition,

176
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,300
evidence of his tyrannical
and unworthy actions,

177
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,220
Your Lordship,

178
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,340
will you not have a just cause to act?

179
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,220
Is that true?

180
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,899
I once promised my late husband

181
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,019
(Memorial Tablet of Xiao Jin)

182
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,060
that I would take this secret
with me to my grave.

183
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,660
Back then,

184
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,420
my late husband, Xiao Yingting,
and the late Emperor were like brothers.

185
00:13:24,812 --> 00:13:25,932
At that time,

186
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,980
the late Emperor was worried

187
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,979
that his sons harbored ambitions
for the throne.

188
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,780
So he prepared an Edict of Succession
for the Crown Prince early on.

189
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:38,620
It was locked in the Ancestral Temple,
on the main beam.

190
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,300
The key

191
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,780
was the private seal of Xiao family.

192
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,660
Later, when Nanyue invaded,

193
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:53,619
the Crown Prince led the army to battle,

194
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,660
but the late Emperor
suddenly passed away.

195
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,332
By the time the Crown Prince
and my late husband rushed back,

196
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,940
the current Emperor

197
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,700
had already ascended the throne.

198
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:07,382
To appoint someone else at that moment

199
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,540
would certainly have plunged
the world into chaos.

200
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,780
My late husband had no choice
but to let the matter stand

201
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,086
and warned me

202
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:17,807
to keep the matter of the Edict

203
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,460
secret forever.

204
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,740
Yet, even this could not escape
the Emperor's suspicion.

205
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,940
The Xiao family

206
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,930
was ultimately ruined and destroyed.

207
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:46,632
(Memorial Tablet of Xiao Jin,
Xiao Yunxi, Xiao Yunxin)

208
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,340
May I ask, Grand Madam,

209
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,020
where is the private seal now?

210
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,007
Yuan,

211
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,220
take off your headpiece, the one symbolizing
your authority over the family.

212
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:37,082
No wonder.

213
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,880
They searched everywhere but couldn't
find the Xiao family's private seal.

214
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,780
It was hidden in this hairpin all along.

215
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,540
Your Lordship,

216
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,380
now,

217
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,020
