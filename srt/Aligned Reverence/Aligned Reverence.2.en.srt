(Give everything back to me)

Protect her.

Xie Yunyan.

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,480
(Captain of the Garrison, Luo Yu)
Your death has come.

17
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,740
Garrison Captain Luo arrived here
with your soldiers

18
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,060
in full force.

19
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,140
For what purpose?

20
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,940
His Majesty has decreed,

21
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,539
the Xiao father and son
colluded with the rebels,

22
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,140
causing Linchuan to fall.

23
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,940
All women of the Xiao household
are to be confined,

24
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,660
and every male of the Xiao line
is to be seized and interrogated.

25
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,140
Are you courting death?

26
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,460
(Why is everything different?)

27
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,180
(In my past life the Xiao family
fell three months later,)

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,300
(and Xie Yunyan was never captured.)

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,300
(Could it be because of me?)

30
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,059
My father and brothers
are out defending the nation,

31
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,340
fighting on the battlefield.

32
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,539
How dare a treacherous cur like you

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,900
slander them behind their backs.

34
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,180
You dare defy the imperial edict?

35
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,219
It seems the Xiao family
not only committed treason

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,260
but even harbors thoughts of rebellion.

37
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,220
The matter of the Xiao family
is not yet settled.

38
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,640
If you kill him
in defiance of the decree,

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,740
you will cement
the Xiao family's guilt of treason.

40
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,820
There will be no path left
for redemption.

41
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,339
Am I to stand by and watch him
slander the Xiao family?

42
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,539
Did you not hear?

43
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,659
The garrison came to seize him

44
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,220
by His Majesty's command.

45
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,980
What matters most now is staying alive.

46
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,100
The women of the Xiao family
are still in the capital.

47
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,460
Only by protecting yourself

48
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,180
can you protect them.

49
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,980
And clear your father
and brother's names.

50
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,180
Seize them all.

51
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
Let them go.

52
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,580
This woman is my elder brother's wife,
who fled the marriage.

53
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,620
The divorce letter is here.

54
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,100
Luo Yu.

55
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,980
Do not force my hand.

56
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,540
You know the consequences.

57
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,660
Su Jinyuan.

58
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,820
My elder brother waited for you
and shielded you all this time.

59
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,780
This is the last thing
he can do for you.

60
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,660
Take it.

61
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,900
Leave the Xiao family.

62
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,060
From this moment on,

63
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,260
you have nothing to do
with the Xiao family.

64
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,500
Take them away.

65
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,500
Young Lady Su.

66
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,380
Let's go.

67
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,420
Young lady.

68
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,740
The young master had intended

69
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,500
to bring you back to the manor.

70
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,740
But with the Xiao family like this now...

71
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,260
Please take care of yourself.

72
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,580
I must ride to Linchuan
and report at once.

73
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,820
(Yuan. Your father once did a great kindness
to the Xiao family.)

74
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,700
(Our marriage)

75
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,660
(was formed because of that bond.)

76
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,340
(I know that since your parents passed,
you have lived under another's roof,)

77
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,900
(enduring much hardship.)

78
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,659
(And with me campaigning far
from home year after year,)

79
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,280
(you have waited in vain for so long.)

80
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,100
(I, too, carry guilt in my heart.)

81
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,820
(Now that I can finally marry you,)

82
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,500
(I thought that
once you entered the Xiao family,)

83
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,700
(our household
could shelter you from now on.)

84
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,780
(But I forgot to ask you one thing.)

85
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,140
(Are you willing to marry me?)

86
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,820
(If you should look back someday,)

87
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,220
(when I return victorious,)

88
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,240
(I will welcome you with
a bridal procession that fills the road,)

89
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,520
(and bring you home with honor.)

90
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,340
(If you meet someone worthy,)

91
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,980
(bring him to see me.)

92
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,420
(In the name of your elder brother,)

93
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,900
(I will send you off at your wedding.)

94
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,780
(Take it.)

95
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,780
(Leave the Xiao family.)

96
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,940
(From this moment on,)

97
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,940
(you have nothing to do
with the Xiao family.)

98
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,900
(If in my past life,)

99
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,780
(I had known the Xiao family
would treat me so,)

100
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,820
(I would have...)

101
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,700
(Horse.)

102
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,020
(Do you want
to save the Xiao family too?)

103
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,700
(Xiao Manor)

104
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,940
Liu Zhu, hurry.

105
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,460
Stop.

106
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,520
The old mistress's illness has returned.

107
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,080
The seventh young lady
has caught a chill as well.

108
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,979
Please, let us out

109
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,880
to buy some medicine.

110
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,299
- We will only...
- No one is allowed out.

111
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,700
Letting them die
without aid is against all reason.

112
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,060
Liu Zhu.

113
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,579
Liu Zhu.

114
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,700
If you do not get back inside now,
you will be killed on sight.

115
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,499
(The Xiao family is in crisis.)

116
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,260
(Silver is needed
to smooth matters everywhere.)

117
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,460
(My father
left behind considerable wealth.)

118
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,940
(I will ask my uncle and aunt for it.)

119
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,380
(They will surely help.)

120
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,739
(Su Manor)

121
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,739
Young lady,

122
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,500
why have you returned?

123
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,980
(Yu. Su Xinyue)

124
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,740
Burn away all the bad luck.

125
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,499
The Xiao family refused to let me
marry in as her replacement.

126
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,220
Now this is their retribution.

127
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,420
That coward Su Jinyuan,

128
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,579
she has probably already
been sold off by that rake Lu Zhuo,

129
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,740
and is still counting money for him.

130
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Mother, you truly think of everything.

131
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,420
Bribing Lu Zhuo to help us.

132
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,960
(Spirit Tablet of Beloved Father Su Wansheng)
That cursed orphan

133
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,460
(and Beloved Mother Cheng Wanru)
Su Jinyuan.

134
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,660
After all these years
living off us and taking what's ours,

135
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,620
she even dares to steal your man.

136
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,300
She should have
been thrown out long ago.

137
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,099
My precious daughter,

138
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,139
all these fine things of Su Jinyuan's

139
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,620
now belong to us.

140
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,100
Su Jinyuan?

141
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,860
So Lu Zhuo

142
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,140
was someone my aunt
brought in to harm me.

143
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,100
Su Jinyuan.

144
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,540
Why have you come back?

145
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,380
This jade pendant...

146
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,860
My younger brother never parted with it.

147
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,819
How did you get it?

148
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,420
You...

149
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,699
So what if I took it?

150
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,219
Your brother has been missing for years.

151
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,100
Who knows where he died.

152
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,780
Give it back.

153
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,180
Give it back.

154
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,220
(Spirit Tablet of Beloved Father Su Wansheng
and Beloved Mother Cheng Wanru)

155
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,100
(Spirit Tablet of Beloved Father Su Wansheng
and Beloved Mother Cheng Wanru)

156
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,779
What are you doing?

157
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,979
Where is my brother?

158
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,699
Did you kill him too?

159
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,499
We did not kill him.

160
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,220
We only sold him.

161
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,060
Sold him?

162
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,899
He was only four years old!

163
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,300
How is that any different
from killing him yourselves?

164
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,899
Yue!

165
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,219
Yue!

166
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,019
Mother, save me!

167
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,659
Master, come quickly!

168
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,380
She is going to kill her!

169
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,259
(Su Wanquan)
Su Jinyuan, are you mad?

170
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,700
Pull her away, quickly!

171
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,939
Su Jinyuan,

172
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,339
we raised you.

173
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,019
You cannot be ungrateful!

174
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,939
Exactly.

175
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,620
Ungrateful?

176
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,220
All these years,

177
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,180
no matter how harshly you treated me,

178
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,620
I still regarded you
as my parents reborn.

179
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,139
But you?

180
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,020
What have you ever done?

181
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,540
You seized my parents' estate.

182
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,700
You tried to steal my marriage.

183
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,299
You conspired with Lu Zhuo
to deceive and humiliate me.

184
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,380
And you even sold my younger brother.

185
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,820
The sad thing is

186
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,020
that when I first entered this house,

187
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,020
I actually believed you
would stand by me.

188
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,660
Now

189
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,140
that I've seen your true faces,

190
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,420
I owe this family nothing anymore.

191
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,499
Su Jinyuan!

192
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,579
- Don't move!
- You...

193
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,740
What are you trying to do?

194
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,380
I am taking back what is mine.

195
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,980
My parents' estate,

196
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,059
convert it into banknotes
and hand it to me.

197
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,660
You...

198
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,260
You are dreaming.

199
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,179
Help me!

200
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,780
- Su Jinyuan, how dare you!
- Uncle.

201
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,980
My patience is running thin.

202
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,580
Do you want the money

203
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,779
or her life?

204
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,259
Master!

205
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,059
Stop!

206
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,539
Enough!

207
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,540
I will give it to you!

208
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,660
Wait here.

209
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,140
Yue.

210
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,699
Money.

211
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,659
Here is the money.

212
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,219
You

213
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,580
let Xinyue go.

214
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,900
Quick, release her.

215
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,500
These fifty thousand taels

216
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,859
will sever all ties

217
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,580
between me and the Su family.

218
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,740
From this day on,

219
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,300
all ties between me and the Su family

220
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,740
are severed.

221
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,140
Are you alright, Yue?

222
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,899
You frightened me to death.

223
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,540
You frightened me to death.

224
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,819
(Father and Mother,)

225
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,940
(Luo,)

226
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,940
(one day,)

227
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,060
(what they owed us,)

228
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,900
(I will take all of it back.)

229
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:06,860
