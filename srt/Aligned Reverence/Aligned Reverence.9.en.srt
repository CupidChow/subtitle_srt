(Zichen Gate)

15
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,100
Su Jinyuan.

16
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,900
It was you who brought shame
upon the Xiao family.

17
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,339
And now you dare ask me for justice.

18
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,100
Should I call you shameless,

19
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,580
or simply reckless?

20
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,940
Your Majesty, please discern the truth.

21
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,539
I, Su Jinyuan,

22
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,380
can endure such slander myself,

23
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,860
but the Xiao family cannot.

24
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:52,872
The sons of the Xiao clan
died on the battlefield,

25
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,710
leaving behind widows and orphans.

26
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,579
Yet now,

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,020
they are left
to be bullied and humiliated.

28
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,660
So you mean

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,460
I have neglected and dishonored
those who earned merit?

30
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:11,424
I have come today,

31
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:13,225
only to ask for a clear decree.

32
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:15,342
Let those who insult
the Xiao family know

33
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,620
that even without sons serving at court,

34
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,845
the Xiao clan is still
under Imperial protection.

35
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,140
Why should I grant you favor

36
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,860
and make an exception
for the Xiao family?

37
00:02:42,775 --> 00:02:44,735
The Xiao clan served loyally
for generations.

38
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,136
What I ask today

39
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:48,217
is merely a place to stand.

40
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,259
Your Majesty's legacy
will last for ages.

41
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,300
Though our contribution is small,

42
00:02:52,612 --> 00:02:54,172
it is better than none.

43
00:02:57,787 --> 00:03:01,307
Bold words for a woman
who fears no death.

44
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,780
If I refuse you today,

45
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,780
others may call me cold and unfeeling.

46
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,860
Very well.

47
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,060
Then I shall decree this.

48
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,179
Your name shall be cleared.

49
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,460
Xie Yunyan will be granted
an official post.

50
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,780
Are you satisfied?

51
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:43,819
Thanks Your Majesty
for this great grace.

52
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,180
Long live the Emperor.

53
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,060
This is enough?

54
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,579
Will you return tomorrow

55
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,380
with another request,

56
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,350
beating the grievance drum again?

57
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,624
I know I have offended the throne,

58
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,905
a grave sin indeed.

59
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,750
I accept Your Majesty's punishment.

60
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:14,245
At least you know your place.

61
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,374
Go to the palace gate,

62
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,055

You are awake.

64
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,060
Where is she?

65
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,460
Go meet her at the palace gate.

66
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,300
She struck the grievance drum,

67
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,340

for the Xiao family.

I said before,

72
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,539
I will win it myself.

73
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,259
Let go.

74
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,779

Physician Xi,

140
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,620
you seem unusually attentive
to my Sixth Brother.

141
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,219
Young Lady Su, could it be

142
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,220
that you are jealous?

143
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:29,402
What nonsense are you saying again?

144
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,161
I just thought,

145
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:33,082
Physician Xi is also a woman.

146
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,259
If you like my Sixth Brother,

147
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,980
it is possible.

148
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,340
So you already knew I was a girl.

149
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,300
Enough of that.

150
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,780
Only you treat your Sixth Brother
like a treasure.

151

But I

152
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:52,824

00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:55,065

malicious slander against others

166

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,100
I will discipline
my household well from now on.

What you endured today

171
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,940
is nothing compared to hers.

172

173
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,060

in the future,

180
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,687
they shall share the same punishment.

181
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:44,675
Go back inside.

182
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:46,295
Haven't you
embarrassed yourselves enough?

183
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:52,732
Su Jinyuan,

184
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,580
you humiliated me today.

185
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,995

than Luo Yu did in three years.

189
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:12,482
With fire burning this high,

190
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,739
you'd best beware

191
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,180
of scorching your own family's shrine.

192
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,979
If I do not gain
the soldiers' trust quickly,

193
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,540
how can I uncover
the truth of the Xiao case?

194
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,540
The blood of 30,000 soldiers at Linchuan

195
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:29,847
will have to be paid for
by someone on their knees.

196
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,980
Xie,

197
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:37,849
why not act the carefree wastrel?

198
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,419
Let them think you
no longer pursue the matter.

199
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,860
Perhaps clues

200
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,507
will surface on their own.

201
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,379
Your tactic of retreating
to advance is quite elegant.

202
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,619
But teaching Yan

203
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,660
to feign weakness just to strike later

204
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:53,632
may be harder for him
than fighting on the field.

205
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,420
Young Lady Su is brave and clever.

206
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,100
Sharp-minded and witty.

207
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,780
My manor happens
to lack someone to prepare ink for me.

208
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,740
If Young Lady Su

209
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,700
is willing to come
to Prince Duan's Manor,

210
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,380
your presence would make it
all the more pleasant.

211
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,760
Mind your words, Your Lordship.

212
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,420
The affairs of the Xiao household
need no concern from Your Lordship.

213
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,020
(Qi Sheng hides his intentions well.)

214
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,397
(If I could form an alliance with him,)

215
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,620
(Xiao Manor)

216
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,100
(could rise again.)

217
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,631
If Your Lordship
truly lacks someone to grind ink, then I...

218
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:41,859
However humble our roof may be,

219
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,300
it still has room for you.

220
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,660
Xie,

221
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,899
You sulk just like

222
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,700
Wangcai guarding his bowl back home.

223
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,219
You pining over someone like this looks

224
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,660
just like a piglet fighting
for scraps in my backyard.

225
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,100
I take my leave.

226
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
Su Jinyuan.

227
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,540
