00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,060
I have tolerated
the Xiao family time and again.

15
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,099
Yet you dare
to strike the grievance drum,

16
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,820
and knock upon the palace gates again.

17
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,419
Drag them out.

18
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,460

19
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,099
My Xiao family has served
the nation with loyalty.

20
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,911
Yet we are slandered by treacherous men.

21
00:01:57,912 --> 00:01:59,689
Our coffins shattered,
our bodies disgraced.

22
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,845

23

24
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,845

I, Xie Yunyan,

26
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:18,452

27
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,182

if you cannot clear our name,

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,460

If Luo Yu forged the imperial edict,

39
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:11,811
and the public is unaware of the truth,

40
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:13,699

Luo Yu falsified the imperial decree.

He forged evidence,

dishonored the dead,

45

and framed the Xiao family.

46
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,300
His crimes deserve no pardon.

47
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:30,705
The Xiao family could appeal
through the Three Judicial Offices.

48
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,300
Yet they stirred public sentiment
to pressure Your Majesty.

49
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,099
Your Majesty must not
personally hear this case.

50
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,740

My sister-in-law
is with child and bleeding badly.

131

died on the battlefield.

132

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,670
Please save her.

134
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,100
Very well.

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,460
How is she?

138
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,060
She will live.

139
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,659
But she has already bled.

140
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,980
For the next half month,

141
00:10:08,387 --> 00:10:11,611
I will visit daily to apply needles.
She will also take herbal decoctions.

142
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,175
If she gets through this half month,
she should be safe.

143

The Xiao family
served the nation faithfully.

144

146
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,407
thank Young Lady Su instead.

00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,379
That will be all, I shall take my leave.

00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,340

152
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:41,307
I will have it washed and returned.

153
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:44,167
Then I thank Young Lady Su.

154
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,500
I will do it.

155
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:50,819
She is but a young lady.

156
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,570
She has no men's clothes
for you to change into.

157
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,379
Young Master Xie stands here still.

158
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,520
Do you mean to watch me change?

159
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,380
Or do you perhaps
harbor improper thoughts toward me?

160
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,419
You truly have a filthy mind.

161
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,499
Change your clothes at once.

162
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,660
I will have someone wash them.

163
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,260
Unfortunately,

164
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,341
the fabric of my robe

165
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:30,757
is extremely precious.

166
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,580
It must be washed
by delicate hands like hers.

167
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:37,747
I think,

168
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,624
Young Lady Su would be most suitable.

169
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,699

170
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,059
please show respect.

171
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,060
She is the Young Madam
of the Xiao family.

172
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:49,445
Young Master Xie,

173
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:52,375
so fierce a temper.

174
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:53,774
Anyone would think

175
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:55,882
I was teasing your own wife.

176
00:11:58,287 --> 00:11:59,186
Do not speak nonsense.

177
00:11:59,187 --> 00:12:00,307
All day long...

178
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,070
Why is your face so red?

179
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,105
I see.

180
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,036
Could it be that at your youthful age

181
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:11,637

182
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,780
Shall I examine you?

183
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,490
Are you insane?
If you are ill, hurry and get treated.

184
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,580
(So smug.)

185
00:12:22,762 --> 00:12:23,922

is shameless to the extreme.

188
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,380
He has not a shred
of a proper physician's manner.

189
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,700
Yan.

190
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:24,099
I am fine.

191
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,980
Here.

192
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,430
Has Physician Xi finished changing?

193
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,420
You must not meet him alone again.

194
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,059
Why?

195
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,860
Little Yuan.

196
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,370
I...

197
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:49,632
Then,

198
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,780
I must trouble the Young Madam.

199
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:53,511
Xi Junning is an outside man.

200
00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:54,392
You cannot...

201
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,980
This is my favorite robe.

202
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,749
If a filthy man touches it
I will be in a foul mood.

203
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,449
When I am in a foul mood

204
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,532
I may not wish
to leave home to treat patients.

205
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,700
Are you not a filthy man yourself?

206
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Yan.

207
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:17,311
Rest assured, Physician Xi.

208
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:18,992
I will wash it with my own hands.

209
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,819
Then I must thank Young Lady Su.

210
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,395
Washed personally by you.

211
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:30,806
Are you

212
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:32,807
truly going to wash his clothes?

213
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:38,362
They are not filthy.

214
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:40,227
In fact...

215
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,145
Physician.

216
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,807
(The scent of a lady indeed.)

217
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,020
Why are you smiling?

218
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:54,975
Do not tell me...

219
00:14:56,412 --> 00:14:57,332
Nonsense.

220
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,460
Physician Xi is our family's life saver.

221
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:03,920
Young Master.

222
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,540
A letter from the Heir.

223
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,253
(Truth uncovered.
Proof found in Feng Kui's old residence.)

224
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:10,520
(A wolf-marked chest contained Father
and Brother's campaign map with imperial red seal.)

225
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,470
Feng Kui.

226
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,260
So it was him.

227
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:22,237
He betrayed Father and Brother.

228
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,932
(Qi Sheng)

229
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,895
They treated him as kin.

230
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,980
I will kill him myself.

231
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:41,699
Avenge Father and Brother.

232
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,980
Yan.

233
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:46,574
You are still wounded.

234
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:47,895
How will you fight?

235
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,820
Are we to swallow this hatred?

236
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:56,732
Move aside.

237
00:15:58,037 --> 00:15:59,157
Young Master.

238
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,619
The Young Madam is right.

239
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,779
You must first heal.

240
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,579
Xiang Lei.

241
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,700
Let go.

242
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,961
Xie Yunyan!

243
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:13,539
Young Master.

244
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,700
Hurry, fetch Physician Xi.
