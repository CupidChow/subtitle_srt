(Never Regretted)

14
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,180
Alright.

15
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,090
Ask whatever you need to quickly.

16
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,860
He only has

17
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,500
less than half an hour left.

18
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,020
Wen Zhihu.

19
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,660
You did so much for Prince Yu,

20
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,179
yet he didn't trust you at all.

21
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,060
He killed you without a single question.

22
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,980
Are you still refusing
to testify against him?

23
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,124
I know

24
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,125
what you want.

25
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,180
But I will not give it to you.

26
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:03,511
If it weren't for you

27
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:05,780
scheming to get close to Luo'er,

28
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,720
how would Prince Yu

29
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,700
have come to suspect me?

30
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,220
Xie Yunyan.

31
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:17,977
Our whole family was harmed by you.

32
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:20,259
I will just watch

33
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,980
you and Prince Yu destroy each other.

34
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,619
It was you,

35
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,824
you helped the tyrant
and suffered the backlash.

36
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:29,785
Why blame others for your sins?

37
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,420
You are right.

38
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,900
This is my retribution.

39
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,939
Back then,

40
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,300
Luo'er was frail.

41
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:50,825
To beg for medicine,

42
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:52,899
I was forced

43
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,140
to be controlled by Prince Yu.

44
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:57,982
Now,

45
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:02,674
I have personally

46
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:05,555
caused Luo'er's death.

47
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,980
How are you?

48
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,260
I went to check
the Wen family's warehouse,

49
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,860
but I found the Wen family
had been slaughtered.

50
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,460
I was too late.

51
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,300
I only saved this child.

52
00:03:41,362 --> 00:03:43,002
I'll go clean up.

53
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,980
Brother, Sister...

54
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,180
Luo'er...

55
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,060
Luo'er...

56
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,379
Luo'er, is that you?

57
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,340
Father!

58
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,500
Father!

59
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,970
Luo'er.

60
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:03,617
You yet live.

61
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,220
Are you unharmed?

62
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,620
I am not.

63
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,420
Our entire family

64
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,540
was slain by those villains.

65
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,540
If not for Big Brother saving me,

66
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,180
I would not have seen you again, Father.

67
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:26,297
Those villains said

68
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,260
they were sent by Xie Yunyan.

69
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,660
Father,

70
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:39,312
we must seek out Xie Yunyan

71
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:41,315
and avenge our family.

72
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,820
A fine strategy
to kill two birds with one stone.

73
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,820
Sir Wen,

74
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:49,269
even at this hour,

75
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,682
do you still intend to remain silent?

76
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,260
Very well.

77
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:01,862
I shall speak.

78
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,619
I have long aided Prince Yu
in trafficking illicit salt

79
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,499
and the wrought iron
used to forge weaponry.

80
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,900
Later,

81
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,940
General Xiao learned of the ledger.

82
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,539
Prince Yu

83
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,060
fearing his denouncement,

84
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,705
then seized the chance

85
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:29,685
while the battle
at Linchuan was critical,

86
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,080
and command me to secretly stand idle,

87
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,460
then postpone reinforcements,

88
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:37,274
which led to the great defeat
of the Xiao army.

89
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:38,675
Only a great defeat?

90
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,620
(He did not intend
to utterly destroy the Xiao family.)

91
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,540
Though

92
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,300
Prince Yu is the Emperor's
most favored younger brother,

93
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,379
no matter how audacious he is,

94
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,620
he would not dare to undermine
the foundation of the nation.

95
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,700
The secret correspondence
between Prince Yu and me,

96
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,420
as well as the ledger of smuggled goods,

97
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,900
I hid them

98
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:15,807
in the secret compartment of my study.

99
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,820
Luo'er,

100
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,940
you must live well.

101
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,820
Father!

102
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,220
Father,

103
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,780
don't worry.

104
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,180
I will avenge you.

105
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,700
Are you still thinking about Wen Luo?

106
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,237
Do you remember

107
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:21,782
I told you

108
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,180
I have a lost younger brother?

109
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,420
I remember.

110
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,660
His name is Su Jinle,

111
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,220
and his childhood name is also Luo.

112
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,659
He was only four

113
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,860
when he went missing.

114
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,860
If we calculate it,

115
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,820
he should be about
the same age as Wen Luo.

116
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,300
I wonder

117
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,700
what he looks like now.

118
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,900
Young Master.

119
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:58,270
(Ordered to secretly investigate Su Jinle's whereabouts.
Have confirmed his death.)

120
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,300
Should we tell Young Madam

121
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,220
about Luo's death in Danzhou?

122
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,900
No, let's not.

123
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,060
Yuan,

124
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,700
don't be too sad.

125
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,460
Luo must have

126
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,060
met some good people,

127
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:35,336
and he must

128
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:36,897
be living very well.

129
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,887
Do you still remember

130
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,339
when I wrote to you before,

131
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,540
I promised you

132
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,980
I'd take you to see
the scenery outside the capital?

133
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,060
Before we return to the capital,

134
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,140
let's go relax in Xianyang,

135
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:04,962
just the two of us.

136
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,180
It was clearly supposed to be
just the two of us.

137
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,099
This Xi Junning

138
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,340
is so annoying.

139
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,540
Look at them.

140
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,099
Little Yuan,

141
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,982
I heard that the fried silkworm pupae here
in Xianyang are superb.

142
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,420
I tried them once
when I was practicing medicine here.

143
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:47,405
Let's go eat them.

144
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,700
Xi Junning.

145
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,699
Yuan is a young woman.

146
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,286
How is it appropriate to pull her around

147
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:54,647
on the street?

148
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,957
Actually, Ning...

149
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,220
Young Master Xie,

150
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,660
you couldn't be jealous, could you?

151
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,060
You are not allowed to tell him.
I finally managed to embarrass him.

152
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:09,520
Come on,

153
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,420
let's go.

154
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,340
Go.

155
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,539
Master,

156
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,659
what would you and your wife

157
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,939
like to eat?

158
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,099
I...

159
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,180
They are not husband and wife.

160
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,561
My apologies.

161
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:32,059
I misjudged you two.

162
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,099
I wish you happiness.

163
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Please.

164
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,760
Let's go.

165
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,699
Your Sixth Brother

166
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,700
is quite amusing.

167
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,157
You are not allowed to tell him either.

168
00:10:42,635 --> 00:10:44,074
It's good to tease him a bit,

169
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:45,074
lest he

170
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:46,355
remains burdened by sorrow.

171
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,059
Shopkeeper.

172
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,860
- Fried silkworm pupae.
- Coming right up.

173
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,820
Please enjoy.

174
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,820
It smells delicious.

175
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,140
Here, Little Yuan.

176
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,520
Xi Junning.

177
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,182
What are you doing?

178
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,149
Young Master Xie, you eat.

179
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,140
I...

180
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:17,532
Xiao Yunxi.

181
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,940
Is it good?

182
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,662
It's so beautiful.

183
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,139
Let's go take a look.

184
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,900
Let's go.

185
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,500
Yuan,

186
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,740
after this matter is settled,

187
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,860
I want to tell Grandmother and Mother
about our relationship.

188
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,260
With Yunxi's help,

189
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,180
and having Mother
accept you as a goddaughter,

190
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,536
I will also request a marriage decree

191
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:47,057
from the Emperor.

192
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,620
I know

193
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:51,699
even with all of this,

194
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,979
you will still suffer greatly

195
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,580
by following me.

196
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,120
I don't suffer.

197
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,419
I would only suffer

198
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,780
if you didn't love me.

199
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,140
Being with you,

200
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,895
I hesitated,

201
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,665
but I have never regretted it.

202
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,980
Only after we were together
did I realize

203
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,700
that this life

204
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,540
was not lived in vain.

205
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,340
Heaven has been so kind to me.

206
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,460
