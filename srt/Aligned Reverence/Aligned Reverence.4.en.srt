(We Return Home)

14
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,699
About tonight,

15
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,140
thank you, Sir Yang.

16
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,140
Young Madam,

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,339
I'm lacking in ability.

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,620
I failed to rescue the young master,
but I will do my utmost to keep him alive.

19
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,860
Everything depends on you, Sir Yang.

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,980
Yet, there is one more thing

21
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,820
that troubles me greatly.

22
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,220
While in the prison,

23
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,259
I heard them
mention Prince Duan several times.

24
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,339
Why was that?

25
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,100
There must be a reason behind it.

26
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,340
Sir Yang,

27
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,940
for the sake of the Xiao family,
could you tell me a little?

28
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,680
Years ago, Prince Duan returned
to the capital under a secret decree,

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,760
but was mistaken for a criminal
by Luo Yu, the gate officer,

30
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,180
and was beaten deliberately.

31
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,579
The heir, Qi Sheng,
collided with Luo Yu during the chaos

32
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,979
and almost lost his life.

33
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,540
Fortunately, Eldest Young Master
and Sixth Young Master saved him.

34
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,499
Later, when Luo Yu saw his plot fail,

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,179
he kowtowed more than a hundred times,
and knelt for three whole days,

36
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,000
only then did he
earn the heir's forgiveness.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,980
It is likely that he still
holds a grudge to this day.

38
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,819
Then, regarding the Xiao family today,

39
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,740
could it also be related to Prince Duan?

40
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,580
I do not know.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,419
However, there has long been a rumor

42
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,060
that the Xiao family
assisted Prince Duan's return back then.

43
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,219
Later, during the struggle for
the throne against the Crown Prince,

44
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,780
Prince Duan failed to claim succession.

45
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,100
When the new emperor
ascended the throne,

46
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,060
the Prince Duan Manor
shut its doors to guests,

47
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,379
avoiding court affairs

48
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,460
entirely.

49
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,140
Thank you, Sir Yang.

50
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,140
The Xiao family also thanks you.

51
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,820
The life of Sixth Young Master

52
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,059
will be entrusted to you.

53
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,620
Young Madam, no need to be so polite.

54
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,979
I heard that on your wedding day

55
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,540
you suddenly fell gravely ill.

56
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,300
The marriage was not completed.

57
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,300
When the young general returns,

58
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,740
he will surely marry you properly.

59
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,380
Young Madam,

60
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,540
take this lantern.

61
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,540
You will not fear the dark road ahead.

62
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,260
Thank you, Sir.

63
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,940
Can Yan still hold on?

64
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,700
Young Master Xie

65
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,740
is not in serious danger.

66
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,339
I heard that Young Master Xie

67
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,340
is close with Heir Qi Sheng.

68
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,340
I wish to ask the Heir for help.

69
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,780
How may I request an audience with him?

70
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,020
Do you think we
have not thought of seeking the Heir?

71
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,859
Yet now, every official in court

72
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,980
avoids the Xiao family like a plague.

73
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,779
The Heir fears
bringing trouble upon himself.

74
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,739
I understand,

75
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,540
but I still wish to try.

76
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,620
Perhaps another way exists.

77
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,260
I know what I did in the past

78
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,660
is hard for the Xiao family to forgive.

79
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,100
Grand Madam, please

80
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,820
allow me to try once more.

81
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,260
Although you have not married
into the Xiao family yet,

82
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,580
in spirit, you are most like one of us.

83
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,620
This is the Xiao family heirloom.

84
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,499
Take it with you,

85
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,420
the Heir will grant you an audience.

86
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,620
Mother,

87
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,539
something this precious,

88
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,420
how could you entrust it to an outsider?

89
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,340
I know you resent her.

90
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,540
Yet if she dared risk her life

91
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,100
to enter the Imperial Prison
and see Yan,

92
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,900
she is someone worth trusting.

93
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,020
Risk her life for what?

94
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,140
From the moment she walked in,

95
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,579
I smelled blood on her.

96
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,980
How do you get hurt so badly?

97
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,980
I am fine.

98
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,539
Right now, the most important thing

99
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,140
is to rescue Young Master Xie.

100
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,579
Mother,

101
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,539
are we really letting her
go seek the Heir like this?

102
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,620
What if she...

103
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,620
There is no what if.

104
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,659
A desperate gamble

105
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,660
may be safer.

106
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,260
Do you think

107
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,860
without a private seal,

108
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,099
without treasonous documents,

109
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,579
the charges against the Xiao family

110
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,220
could not be forged?

111
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,499
The one who truly
wants the Xiao family destroyed

112
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,539
is the hidden mastermind
within the court.

113
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,220
Yuan is not wrong.

114
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,059
Only by pulling the Heir into this chaos

115
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,100
will they hesitate to strike further.

116
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,580
Only then do we have a chance
to survive this calamity.

117
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,380
I only hope

118
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,420
Heaven grants
the Xiao family a little mercy.

119
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,659
- The kitchen is calling you.
- I will go.

120
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,540
Fine.

121
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,580
Young Master, please have some tea.

122
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,820
Slowly.

123
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,020
Try this as well.

124
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
Thank you.

125
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,620
Is this better?

126
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,860
Allow me.

127
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,557
(Heir of Prince Duan, Qi Sheng)

128
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,500
(So it really is him.)

129
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,260
(It seems I guessed right.)

130
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,720
(In my previous life,
the man who rebelled with Xie Yunyan)

131
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,600
(was none other than Qi Sheng,
the Heir of Prince Duan.)

132
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,980
(Then he must not be one
to submit to others.)

133
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,419
(He must harbor resentment
toward the current court.)

134
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,860
(He may be
the Xiao family's only chance.)

135
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,819
You, a young woman,

136
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,340
coming to me disguised as a man,

137
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,060
what is it you intend?

138
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,500
Your Highness, please stop.
I am Xiao Yunxi's wife, Su Jinyuan.

139
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,580
Your Highness.

140
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,420
So it is you.

141
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,100
Did you not flee from your marriage?

142
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,659
What is this? Now that trouble
has come to the Xiao Manor,

143
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,020
you claim to be his wife again.

144
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,180
What exactly is your purpose?

145
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,540
I heard that in your youth,

146
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,460
you were close
with my husband's sixth brother.

147
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,340
Now he is imprisoned
under false charges.

148
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,740
The Xiao family
stands accused of treason.

149
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,619
I beg Your Highness

150
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,940
to lend us your aid.

151
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,540
Treason is a grave crime.

152
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,300
It has enraged His Majesty.

153
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,380
If the Prince Duan Manor intervenes now,

154
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,540
would that not invite disaster
upon itself?

155
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,100
It seems I have misjudged Your Highness.

156
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,500
I thought you were a hero of the age.

157
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,459
Yet it turns out you are

158
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,180
no different from the common and timid.

159
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,379
And I thought
you were no ordinary woman.

160
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
You only know
how to provoke people, do you not?

161
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,779
Of course not.

162
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,619
I came here

163
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,540
to offer Prince Duan a way to survive.

164
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,980
Would you like to hear it?

165
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,100
Me, the Prince Duan Manor,

166
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,620
would never need you to save our lives.

167
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,460
Your Highness cannot believe

168
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,099
that this turbulent situation

169
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,859
targets only the Xiao family.

170
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,739
As for the true reason
behind their downfall,

171
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,540
surely Your Highness
has already guessed.

172
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,899
Once they destroy the Xiao family,

173
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,540
who do you think will be next?

174
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,459
Back then,
during the struggle for the throne,

175
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,700
the Xiao family was regarded
as Prince Duan's faction.

176
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,939
And now,

177
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,779
His Majesty has only recently
ascended the throne.

178
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,700
There are already those who cannot wait

179
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,820
to direct suspicion toward Prince Duan.

180
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,379
Yet they fear
the Xiao family's military power

181
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,379
which restrains the Emperor's hand.

182
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,379
Therefore, they must
first destroy the Xiao family

183
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,260
before accusing Prince Duan of treason.

184
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,700
What judgment do you think
His Majesty will give then?

185
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,619
How dare you presume the Emperor's will?

186
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,380
What exactly are you plotting?

187
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,260
It is the Xiao family His Majesty fears,

188
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,100
not the Prince Duan Manor.

189
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,539
Your father, Prince Duan,

190
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,300
can only remain
uninvolved due to his status.

191
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,699
But if Your Highness

192
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,900
also ignore the Xiao family's fall,

193
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,620
then ruin will reach Prince Duan Manor

194
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,220
soon enough.

195
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,340
Only if both our families share fate,

196
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,259
may there be a path to survival.

197
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,740
How do you know
such confidential matters?

198
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,420
I am here

199
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,460
on behalf of the Xiao family

200
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,020
to express our sincerity to Prince Duan.

201
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,620
If we can survive this calamity,

202
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,539
the Xiao family

203
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,620
will never betray him.

204
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,500
But if the Xiao family is abandoned,

205
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,220
Your Highness will also have no way out.

206
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
Very well.

207
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,419
I will investigate the Xiao case.

208
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,780
I will also stir public opinion
through the Imperial Academy.

209
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,939
Then I will lead a petition

210
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,300
in court to clear their name.

211
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,300
However, whether it succeeds

212
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,260
depends on your fortune and timing.

213
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,340
Thank you, Your Highness.

214
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,459
(Zichen Gate)

215
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,460
(The land weeps blood,
sun and moon grow dim.)

216
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,699
(Xiao Manor)
(Grand General Xiao Manor,)

217
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,460
(three generations guarded the borders,
nine great wars secured the realm.)

218
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,659
(Yet traitors slandered them
within the court,)

219
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,699
(accusing them of treason
and collusion with the enemy,)

220
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,260
(a crime conjured from nothing.)

221
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,980
(Thus loyal souls
were to be erased from history.)

222
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:51,132
Grandmother.

223
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,420
Yuan.

224
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,340
Early this morning,

225
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,459
the Imperial Academy students

226
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,040
presented this proclamation
at the palace gates.

227
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,020
Every word sharp and piercing,
each sentence a blade.

228
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,419
Truly the Heir's writing.

229
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,700
Prince Duan Manor
is not to be underestimated.

230
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,400
To calm public outrage,

231
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,080
His Majesty has ordered
a full investigation into the Xiao case.

232
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,200
He decrees the release of Sixth Young Master,
and lifts the seal on Xiao Manor.

233
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,100
We shall await
the General's return to the capital.

234
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,099
Yuan.

235
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,700
Go,

236
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,340
bring Yan home.

237
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,860
Grandmother.

238
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,180
Mother.

239
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,420
I, Yan, am unfilial,

240
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,380
I have made you worry.

241
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,060
Rise quickly.

242
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,939
Yan,

243
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,300
for the sake of the Xiao family,

244
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,540
you have suffered greatly.

245
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,739
If you had not
endured torture in prison,

246
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,340
standing firm against wicked men,

247
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,460
the Xiao family
may have already been destroyed.

248
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,640
The Xiao family's kindness
to me is as great as a mountain.

249
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,480
What I suffered
is nothing in comparison.

250
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,739
Yes.

251
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,379
My mother often tells me

252
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,859
that Jinyuan has suffered

253
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,900
a lot for us.

254
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,539
Mother said she fought so desperately
only because she was determined

255
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,460
to bring Sixth Brother back safely.

256
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,459
As long as the two of you are here,

257
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,219
our Xiao family

258
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,220
will surely remain safe and well.

259
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,420
Then let us all thank Jinyuan together.

260
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,900
Do you agree, Yunxuan?

261
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,059
Jinyuan,

262
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,779
in the future, I will be like you,

263
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,379
and protect our family too.

264
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,139
But Jinyuan,

265
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,020
you must take good care of yourself.

266
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,340
Mother said your health
has never been well.

267
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,099
On the wedding day, you fell ill,

268
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,420
so the marriage could not be completed.

269
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,300
Jinyuan.

270
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,579
These days

271
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,340
you have indeed suffered much.

272
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,140
Come, let us offer incense
to our ancestors.

273
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,659
We shall thank them for watching over

274
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,380
and protecting the Xiao family.

275
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,059
(Ever Lasting in History)

276
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,220
Ancestors of the Xiao family,

277
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,300
I, the unworthy granddaughter-in-law,

278
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,820
Su Jinyuan,

279
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,180
ask forgiveness from the Xiao family.

280
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,660
From this day forward,
we share the same boat in wind and rain.

281
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,300
