of the same name on Qimao Novel)

(I only seek the truth)

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,020
I have a witness.

15
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,260
The Captain of the Garrison,

16
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,060
Xie Yunyan.

17
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,500
A witness?

18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,460
That is merely hearsay.

19
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,290
Then let this so-called witness of yours

20
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,020
come here and speak.

21
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,740
Since Prince Yu demands
that I come forward,

22
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,380
then I shall step out
and say a few words.

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,260
You...

24
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,779
I, Xie Yunyan, Captain of the Garrison,

25
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,660
confirm that Wen Luo's
testimony is true.

26
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,980
This is Wen Zhihu's dying testimony.

27
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,539
Also, the location
where Prince Yu secretly stored

28
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,060
contraband salt and smelted iron.

29
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,539
I also personally witnessed

30
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,059
Tan Xu, Prince Yu's personal guard

31
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,699
murder Wen Zhihu to silence him,

32
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,580
and intending to frame me.

33
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,379
I, Su Jinyuan,

34
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,980
am also a witness.

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,211
You all...

36
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:23,292
You are all in collusion!

37
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:28,257
(Wen Zhihu had been helping Prince Yu smuggle salt
and smelted iron for weapons for many years.)

38
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:29,419
Prince Yu,

39
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,139
as a member of the Imperial Family,

40
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,539
smuggling smelted iron,

41
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,819
murdering a high-ranking official,

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,720
and embezzling vast profits
from maritime transport.

43
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,532
The crimes you have committed,
every single one warrant the death penalty.

44
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,860
Guards!

45
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,380
The Emperor has arrived.

46
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,100
Rise.

47
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,260
Prince Yu.

48
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,780
You truly are my worthy younger brother.

49
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,260
Guards.

50
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,580
Seize him.

51
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,260
Your Majesty, wait.

52
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,900
Your Majesty,

53
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,259
Prince Yu's crimes are all here.

54
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,659
Why not hold a public trial?

55
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,100
You...

56
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,460
According to our Great Qing law,

57
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,700
Prince Yu should first
be imprisoned in the Imperial Prison.

58
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,819
Once his crimes are verified,
he should be immediately executed.

59
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,220
Xie Yunyan!

60
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,020
Since when is it your place
to instruct me?

61
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:01,779
Back then, when Xiao family

62
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,300
was falsely accused of treason,

63
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,974
it was based solely on Feng Kui's word,

64
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:07,655
yet the entire family was condemned.

65
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,860
Today, Prince Yu's crimes
are undeniable.

66
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,419
Why does Your Majesty speak evasively
and refuse a public trial?

67
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,420
Audacious!

68
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,060
Xie Yunyan,

69
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,980
I take into account that you are
the only male of the Xiao family,

70
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,220
and I will not pursue
this matter further this time.

71
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,580
If there is a next time,

72
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,780
I will show no mercy.

73
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,140
Your Majesty.

74
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,811
Prince Yu colluded with Nanyue,

75
00:04:49,812 --> 00:04:51,652
allowing the Nanyue army
to breach the pass,

76
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:54,182
leading to the fall of Linchuan

77
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,780
and the death of tens
of thousands of Xiao family army,

78
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:59,632
yet he framed the Xiao family
for colluding with the enemy.

79
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,859
I have here

80
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,580
a secret letter written
by Prince Yu to my father.

81
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,179
You are lying!

82
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,100
When did I ever collude
with an enemy state?

83
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,820
Your Majesty,

84
00:05:12,337 --> 00:05:13,457
I didn't.

85
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,300
I truly didn't!

86
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:30,179
(I've secretly agreed
with Nanyue to allow their army)

87
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,532
(to breach the pass and seize Linchuan
when the time comes.)

88
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,820
Your Majesty.

89
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,380
I have my own plan.

90
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,020
Come with me.

91
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,139
Prince Yu.

92
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,140
Give me back my father
and brothers' lives!

93
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,900
Yan!

94
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,620
Xie Yunyan!

95
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,260
How dare you commit murder
right in front of me.

96
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,860
Your Majesty,

97
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,619
my father and brothers
were loyal heroes,

98
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,900
yet they died at the hands
of this vile villain.

99
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,700
As a son,

100
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,500
I must seek justice.

101
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,580
If Your Majesty refuses
to right this injustice,

102
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,100
then I will risk my own life

103
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,699
to send him to hell!

104
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,740
Xie Yunyan!

105
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,699
Your Majesty,

106
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,979
all the Xiao family seeks

107
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,859
is the truth
that brings peace to the living

108
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,780
and repose to the dead.

109
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,580
What is Your Majesty truly afraid of?

110
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,459
Your Majesty,

111
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,699
I know you cherish your fraternal bond,

112
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,740
but Prince Yu's guilt is irrefutable.

113
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,460
Take Prince Yu

114
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:13,112
to the Imperial Prison.

115
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,860
Once the evidence is verified,

116
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,700
execute him immediately.

117
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,100
Your Majesty!

118
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,619
Your Majesty, I've been framed!

119
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,660
Your Majesty!

120
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,019
You've ruined me!

121
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,220
You are the ones who ruined me!

122
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,980
Your Majesty!

123
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,980
I've been wronged!

124
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,140
You ruined me!

125
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,300
Prince Yu certainly deserved to die,

126
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,232
but Young Master Xie,

127
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,340
do not let your hatred
be exploited by others.

128
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,140
Young Master Wen,

129
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,700
your father clearly told me
before he died

130
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,760
that in the battle of Linchuan,

131
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,420
Prince Yu did not intend
to destroy the Xiao family.

132
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,300
Where exactly did you obtain

133
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,940
that secret letter?

134
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,100
I...

135
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,000
If the court proceedings
take an unexpected turn,

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,260
present this secret letter

137
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,179
and speak as I instructed you.

138
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,257
Prince Yu

139
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,700
will surely die.

140
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,340
But...

141
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,020
This is false evidence.

142
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,499
If you want to avenge Wen family,

143
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,020
just do as I say.

144
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,220
Do not tell anyone.

145
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,340
I was not lying.

146
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,420
Then your father must have been lying.

147
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,660
No.

148
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,820
I just wanted to avenge my father,

149
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,100
and avenge Wen family.

150
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,670
What did I do wrong?

151
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,900
Luo,

152
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,140
I understand your desire
to avenge your father,

153
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,460
but if you simply
push this onto Prince Yu,

154
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:45,819
the Xiao family case

155
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,740
will truly never see the light of day.

156
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,260
Didn't you want to be my own sister?

157
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,020
Didn't you want to be my only family?

158
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,900
Why are you pressuring me too?

159
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,340
Yan.

160
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,860
Speak!

161
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,220
Yan,

162
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,700
give him some time.

163
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,390
I will find out the truth myself.

164
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,660
Yan!

165
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,220
Xie Yunyan.

166
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,420
Someone help me.

167
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,407
Young Master Xie.

168
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,060
Tell me everything you know

169
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,219
about the Linchuan case.

170
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,419
Otherwise,

171
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,339
I will make you realize

172
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,382
what it means to wish for death.

173
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,986
Young Master Xie,

174
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:00,999
listen to me!

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Young Master Xie!

176
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:07,499
Young Madam,

177
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,859
everyone has been dismissed.

178
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,580
That scoundrel, Prince Yu,

179
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,345
the Xiao family's injustice
is finally going to be revealed.

180
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:14,757
Thank you.

181
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,300
I hope so.

182
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,059
Xie Yunyan,

183
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,060
listen to me!

184
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,500
Xie Yunyan,

185
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,900
regarding the Linchuan case,

186
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,220
I truly

187
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,780
only wanted to see General Xiao
suffer a crushing defeat.

188
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,339
That way, he wouldn't be able
to return to the capital

189
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,220
and accuse me of smuggling salt.

190
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:49,979
But I never imagined

191
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,460
that overnight,

192
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,259
the tide of battle
in Linchuan would turn so sharply,

193
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,020
and the city would actually fall!

194
00:11:56,775 --> 00:11:58,095
The Xiao army

195
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,180
was completely annihilated.

196
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,620
Then why did you still
slander my father and brothers

197
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,200
for colluding with the enemy and treason?

198
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,739
With the defeat at Linchuan, His Majesty would
be furious and certainly seek the true culprit.

199
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,339
I...

200
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,260
I would definitely
not be able to escape blame.

201
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,699
But the real traitor was someone else.

202
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,357
So I had no choice but to

203
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,740
strike first.

204
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,420
You contemptible villain!

205
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,695
My death is insignificant,

206
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:23,927
but if I take the blame
for the Xiao family's crime,

207
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,140
you will be letting the real culprit go!

208
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:31,045
You must protect me.

209
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:32,967
If you catch the real culprit,

210
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:35,307
I can testify for you!

211
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:38,459
Who is the true culprit?

212
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,540
Speak!

213
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,500
Yan!

214
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,059
Yang Hong was suddenly called away.

215
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,432
We must leave quickly.

216
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,140
Xie Yunyan!

217
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,299
Xie Yunyan, you have to save me!

218
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,140
Xie...
