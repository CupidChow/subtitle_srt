(I Care)

14
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,419
Jinyuan.

15
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,539
Grandmother said

16
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,939
the weather is wonderful this year,

17
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,939
so the harvest should be great.

18
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,939
The flowers I planted

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,660
will bloom beautifully as well.

20
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,579
Jinyuan, everything was fine.

21
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,940
Why did it suddenly thunder?

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,259
What is chastity worth compared to a life?
Look outside.

23
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,595
People starve to death every day.

24
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,886
If you sleep with
the landlord's foolish son,

25
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:58,447
you could at least earn a meal.

26
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,824
I won't.

27
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:00,665
Move!

28
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,260
Go!

29
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:04,660
- I don't want to!
- Hurry!

30
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,220
Quick!

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,819
(In the previous life,
it was not a good harvest year.)

32
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,659
(Two months later,)

33
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,020
(Liangzhou suffered severe drought.)

34
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,979
(Merchants raised prices viciously.)

35
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,640
(The land was filled
with famine corpses.)

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,699
Looks like it may rain.

37
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,940
Let's head back first.

38
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,740
How can it thunder on a clear day?

39
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:31,765
Did it startle you?

40
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:36,274
I heard the elders say
that when the heavens show signs,

41
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:37,682
a great disaster follows.

42
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,099
If the northwest

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,619
really suffers drought,

44
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,839
and with the treasury strained
by the Linchuan war,

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,599
the court

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,819
might not have funds
or grain for relief.

47
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,882
Mind your words.

48
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,311
Such reckless talk of state affairs

49
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:51,099
must never come from the Xiao family.

50
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,340
I understand.

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,599
We could ask someone
to inquire in secret

52
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,040
about the situation in the northwest,

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,739
and quietly stockpile grain.

54
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,939
If drought really happens,

55
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,295
this grain could ease the urgent need.

56
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,739
If it doesn't,

57
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,859
we'll think of another way

58
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,645
and resell the grain elsewhere.

59
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,770
The loss won't be too much.

60
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:12,027
As for gathering information,

61
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,640
I'll find a way.

62
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:17,049
But the silver needed
for stockpiling grain

63
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,770
is no small amount.

64
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,180
I'll persuade Grandmother.

65
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:29,842
Sometimes I feel

66
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:31,224
you seem as if you know

67
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:33,105
what will happen in the future.

68
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,865
Just like back then,

69
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:39,945
when you foresaw

70
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:42,635
the disaster
that befell the Xiao family.

71
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,387
It was only a guess.

72
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,180
I didn't mean anything else.

73
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,900
(If the military grain ledger
Feng Kui mentioned)

74
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,500
(is actually a private salt ledger,)

75
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,040
(and now that Father is dead,)

76
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,640
(the one behind all this
still hasn't let the Xiao family go,)

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,020
(then this ledger)

78
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,825
(should have been hidden
by Father in Liangzhou.)

79
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,980
Investigate agricultural affairs
in Liangzhou.

80
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,295
(Out on business,
will return within ten days. Xi)

81
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,939
Leaving without a word.

82
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,500
Couldn't you at least tell me?

83
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,580
Do you not know how worried I was?

84
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:18,095
(Xiao Manor)

85
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,739
Since the new year,

86
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,100
Liangzhou hasn't had a drop of rain.

87
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,059
The newly-appointed Prefect
loves to show off.

88
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,900
He hardly cares about the drought.

89
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,749
I reviewed the records
of former Prefects

90
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,030
and their reports on famine years.

91
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,300
Your suspicion

92
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,020
is very likely true.

93
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,420
Then I'll begin stockpiling grain now.

94
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:39,165
Grandmother has already
prepared all the documents.

95
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,820
If this succeeds,

96
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,859
it will help relieve the drought crisis

97
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,700
and aid in the revival
of the Xiao family.

98
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,699
(If Yan rises one step further,)

99
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,700
(perhaps,)

100
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,940
(there may be hope
in restoring the Xiao family's glory.)

101
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,860
Slow down.

102
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,100
Put it here.

103
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,540
Place this sack over there.

104
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,380
Careful now.

105
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,180
Set it on that side.

106
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,339
Weren't you on duty?

107
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,700
Why are you back?

108
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:33,024
The first batch arrived tonight.

109
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,586
I worried you'd be too tired,

110
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:36,307
so I came early to help.

111
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,700
It's you.

112
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,749
Heir Qi.

113
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,670
Why sneak into my Xiao Manor?

114
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,339
I heard

115
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,700
someone has been secretly
buying up grain.

116
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,540
Though through many channels,

117
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:31,155
they all lead back to one place.

118
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,420
Why are you hoarding grain in secret?

119
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,980
Because I want to.

120
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,220
Because I like it.

121
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,220
Is that not allowed?

122
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,820
Such large-scale hoarding
is a serious crime.

123
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,740
Yan.

124
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,780
You'd better tell me the truth.

125
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,499
Otherwise

126
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,380
I'll report you to His Majesty.

127
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,059
I'm the one hoarding grain,

128
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,380
he has nothing to do with it.

129
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,139
(Storage Room)

130
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,139
What did you say?

131
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,700
There will be drought in the northwest?

132
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,911
How dare you hide such news.

133
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,552
There will be drought.

134
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,819
If I report it now,

135
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,340
they'll say I'm spreading rumors.

136
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,300
I know others less,

137
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,020
but I know you.

138
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,699
If you weren't certain
drought was coming,

139
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,900
would you do this?

140
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,180
You could have reported it openly.

141
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,300
Yet you chose to hoard grain in private.

142
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,460
I suppose

143
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,860
this was your idea?

144
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,660
Are you planning to profit
from the nation's crisis?

145
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,020
Heir Qi.

146
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,659
Have you considered

147
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,859
this could also stabilize grain prices?

148
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,540
Not everyone
has a mind as deep as yours.

149
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,237
I believe that's what you think.

150
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,940
But you,

151
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,420
is she truly doing this
for relief efforts

152
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,500
and nothing more?

153
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,540
What do you mean by that?

154
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:20,259
Of course it's for disaster relief.

155
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,736
If I wanted money,

156
00:09:21,737 --> 00:09:23,817
why would I go through all this trouble?

157
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,540
So then,

158
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,580
I suspect Young Lady Su has other aims.

159
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,939
For example, when disaster strikes,

160
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,300
you could use the grain as leverage.

161
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,260
And help Yan rise swiftly to success.

162
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,100
Young Lady Su,

163
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,140
am I wrong?

164
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:53,724
We hoard grain

165
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,085
for the nation and the people.

166
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,470
I seek a little benefit
for the Xiao family,

167
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,820
it harms no greater cause.

168
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,260
Why shouldn't I?

169
00:10:02,197 --> 00:10:04,036
You speak of profit
with such righteousness.

170
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,357
Why not?

171
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,374
Even if Your Lordship knows

172
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,935
the Xiao family was wronged,

173
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,024
you weighed the risks

174
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:11,385
and protected yourself.

175
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,180
Now you ask why I do this?

176
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,419
I do it

177
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,860
for the women and children
of the Xiao family.

178
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,859
When we have no power or influence,

179
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,860
we won't be trampled beneath others.

180
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,300
Su Jinyuan.

181
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,099
Isn't your goal simply
to help Xie Yunyan rise?

182
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,860
Is it?

183
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,900
Yes.

184
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,220
Good.

185
00:10:39,512 --> 00:10:41,082
Do you dare make a wager with me?

186
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,139
Qi Sheng. Why must you
make things difficult for her?

187
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,300
What wager?

188
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,459
I won't stop you from stockpiling grain.

189
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,060
I can even help.

190
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,459
But once disaster strikes,

191
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,700
the grain must be delivered.

192
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,082
I will see to it

193
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,975
that Xie Yunyan is appointed
Imperial Envoy for disaster relief.

194
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,940
Giving him a chance to soar.

195
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,660
All right.

196
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,940
I agree.

197
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:15,505
But on one condition.

198
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:17,402
You are certain

199
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,280
drought will come.

200
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,432
Sure.

201
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:22,997
If not,

202
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,259
I, Su Jinyuan,

203
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,220
will accept any punishment
from Your Lordship.

204
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:28,582
Very well.

205
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:30,245
It's a deal.

206
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,582
A deal.

207
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,740
Heir Qi.

208
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,059
It's late.

209
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,220
Night has fallen.

210
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,660
Please take your leave.

211
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:47,249
Otherwise, if others see

212
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,220
you visiting Xiao Manor too often,

213
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,700
be careful that the debauched persona
you worked so hard to uphold

214
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,900
just crumbles away.

215
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,540
This heir...

216
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,700
He does care for the people somewhat.

217
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,500
In the future, perhaps

218
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,100
he may accomplish great things.

219
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,180
In your eyes,

220
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,060
am I that incapable?

221
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,732
Would you have me sacrifice you

222
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,060
in exchange for my own success?

223
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,660
Of course not.

224
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,449
I just don't want you to work so hard.

225
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,450
But you shouldn't let Qi Sheng
pull the strings.

226
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,361
How do you know what he wants?
What if he asks...

227
00:12:28,362 --> 00:12:30,320
At worst, I can serve as his slave or maid.

228
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,499
I don't mind.

229
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,820
