(I want to marry you honorably)

14
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:30,702
Xie Yunyan is completely reckless.

15
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,660
Prince Yu had not even
been formally convicted,

16
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:36,905
yet he dared to poison the Prince Yu.

17
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,980
Your Majesty,

18
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:41,525
I believe there are doubts
about this case.

19
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,140
Caught with the evidence
and the culprit,

20
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,139
what more is there to question?

21
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,380
There is a great deal to question!

22
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,860
You...

23
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,860
Are you trying to start a rebellion?

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,187
What is the real truth
behind the Xiao family's Linchuan case?

25
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,220
Xie Yunyan did not
poison Prince Yu at all.

26
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,340
Prince Yu is indeed dead,

27
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,961
but his loyal subordinate,

28
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:31,402
Tan Xu, is still here.

29
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,660
I treated Prince Yu generously.

30
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,020
Do not make reckless accusations.

31
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,819
Your Majesty was generous to my master,

32
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,795
but only because my master

33
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,690
carried out many foul deeds for you!

34
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,380
Poisoning the late Emperor,

35
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,137
usurping the throne,

36
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,700
and poisoning old General Xiao!

37
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,180
And you?

38
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,659
The moment things went wrong,

39
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,220
you immediately poisoned
my master without hesitation!

40
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,420
Unfortunately, my master

41
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:05,837
had foreseen this outcome.

42
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,460
(For Prince Yu)
These

43
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,340
are all the evidence.

44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,700
This

45
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,379
is the Edict of Succession
from the late Emperor.

46
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,120
(Prince Duan is fit
to inherit the throne and carry on my will.)

47
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,179
My father, Prince Duan,

48
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,780
is the one who should be
the current Emperor!

49
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,300
You...

50
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:46,252
Since the late Emperor's Edict
has been clearly revealed,

51
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,779
I ask all officials

52
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,299
to join me

53
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,049
in restoring the legitimate line
and correcting the imperial government.

54
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,899
Your Lordship is righting the wrongs.

55
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,900
We await Your Lordship's command!

56
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,220
We await Your Lordship's command!

57
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,020
Xiao Yingting.

58
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,357
You promised me

59
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,740
that this Edict would never
see the light of day.

60
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,660
My leniency

61
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,260
allowed Xiao family to linger on.

62
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:22,505
I should never have agreed
to spare them.

63
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,740
I should have

64
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,699
exterminated the Xiao family

65
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,060
entirely!

66
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,980
Take him away!

67
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,500
Investigate the Linchuan case thoroughly!

68
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,460
Release me!

Xie Yunyan?

73
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,700
Too bad.

74
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,260
He is already dead.

75
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,860

00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,220
Let us go.

131
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,560
I will take him to detoxify him.

132
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,260
Let us go.

133
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,980
