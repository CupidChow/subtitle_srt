Daonuea.

3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:33,920
Yes?

4
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll buy you ice cream.

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:36,960
Okay.

6
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,060
Hey, kiddo.

7
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,690
Why are you sitting here alone?

8
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,240
I'm waiting for my mother.

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,320
Look at you. Mosquitoes bite you.

10
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,990
Where is your home?

11
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,160
I'll take you to your home.

12
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,450
Daonuea.

13
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,260
Talk to me, please.

14
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,690
Daonuea.

15
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,980
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,100
Daonuea.

17
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,229
Just tell what you want to say.

18
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,150
I can't take it any longer.

19
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,150
Daonuea.

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,250
I'm sorry for lying to you about everything.

21
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,380
I don't know how I should feel about it.

22
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,950
Should I be glad

23
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,830
you gave me money and the company

24
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,780
or should I be disappointed that you lied to me?

25
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,430
Why does being with you, it's make me so confused?

26
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,130
What should I do?

27
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,010
Daonuea.

28
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,450
I don't have secrets to hide from you anymore.

29
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,880
Don't leave me.

30
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,550
I can't live without you.

31
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,200
Umm.

32
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,340
Do you have any secrets?

33
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,710
Nothing.

34
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,640
I really told you everything.

35
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:17,459
Okay.

36
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,100
I'll assume you have good intentions.

37
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,839
In addition,

38
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,730
it's your money.

39
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,780
However,

40
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,960
it still circulates in the company.

41
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,740
You still haven't forgiven me?

42
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,690
I still haven't forgiven you.

43
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,880
Tomorrow,

44
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,690
you must apologize to everyone

45
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,830
in the office.

46
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,810
If not, I won't speak to you any more.

47
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,620
Okay.

48
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,170
Please come with me, Daonuea.

49
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,300
I definitely have to go with you.

50
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
What will happen at the office?

51
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,010
I can handle it.

52
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,270
You don't have to worry, Daonuea.

53
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,760
I'm not referring to you.

54
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,580
I mean everyone.

55
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,070
What will Tee and the others think

56
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,300
about what you're doing?

57
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:39,700
Huh?

58
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:43,850
Umm.

59
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,820
Tomorrow

60
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,240
I will definitely apologize to everyone.

61
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,810
Good.

62
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,659
Get back if you have nothing.

63
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,600
Don't pretend to want to sleep here.

64
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,670
I'm so tried.

65
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,760
I will rest here.

66
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,330
Hold on, Nine.

67
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,840
Hey.

68
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,300
Stop using this way.

69
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,630
I'm so sleepy.

70
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,730
Nine!

71
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,000
Huh?

72
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,890
You're... really...

73
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,600
[Lodestar Production]

74
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,070
Tee.

75
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,000
If you stay like this,

76
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,420
we probably won't be able to know

77
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,230
what we should to do next.

78
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,290
Yes.

79
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,710
You are the best boss here.

80
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,800
You have to make a decision now.

81
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,230
Alright.

82
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,930
I would like to ask your opinions,

83
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,930
what do you guys think about this?

84
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,980
For me,

85
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,750
Nine isn't that bad.

86
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:19,970
Why?

87
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,490
He gave me a chance to approach

88
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,140
Candy.

89
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,140
For me, actually...

90
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,720
Nine taught me a lot about how to use a camera.

91
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,840
He also knows how much I love to take pictures.

92
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,730
Ice.

93
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,970
If you want your pictures to look better,

94
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,430
you must change the lens.

95
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,380
Now you're using a normal lens,

96
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,950
change it to telephoto lens.

97
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,840
The telephoto lens will give your photos a more dimensional look.

98
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,490
The front is clear and the back is blurred.

99
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,660
It makes the product stand out more.

100
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,610
Ice.

101
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,820
Don't hesitate to start doing something

102
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:18,970
or fixing something.

103
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,730
Just trust your instincts.

104
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,430
Otherwise,

105
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,320
you'll stop loving your work one day.

106
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,520
Do you get it?

107
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,620
Have you ever thought

108
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,419
that what Nine did

109
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,159
was because he was deceiving us?

110
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,860
Uh...

111
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,510
If you think so,

112
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,840
it might be possible.

113
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,010
After this, he won't lie to Daonuea?

114
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,400
All that Nine did,

115
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,590
he just wanted to help you

116
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,000
and Daonuea.

117
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,250
Why

118
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,670
can good intentions

119
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,820
turn into deception?

120
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:18,980
Hey.

121
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:19,970
Nine.

122
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,080
Where have you been?

123
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,230
It's been several days.

124
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm having some trouble.

125
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,600
Oh.

126
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,120
The other day I prepared a present for him,

127
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,050
have you brought it to him yet?

128
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,950
Yeah.

129
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:36,800
I already gave it to him.

130
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,020
Did he say anything?

131
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
I thought I would never receive a gift from anyone.

132
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,080
My name is Daonuea.

133
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,680
I'm Tee.

134
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,920
Please look after me.

135
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,560
Let's exchange contacts?

136
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:05,960
No.

137
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,730
He didn't say anything.

138
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:09,730
Really?

139
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,260
It's okay.

140
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm just surprised.

141
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,280
So,

142
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,670
how does he look?

143
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,400
His face was nothing special.

144
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,050
I think you should focus on studying.

145
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,620
Be careful that you don't graduate.

146
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,560
Okay.

147
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,760
What part of your body will you exercise today?

148
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,850
I think I'll work out my shoulders.

149
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, okay.

150
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,300
[Are you really getting home with me? >_<]

151
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,870
I don't know either.

152
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,860
Are you guy meeting?

153
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:24,930
Oh.

154
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,720
Just about work.

155
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,980
Do you have anything to tell us?

156
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,530
Someone...

157
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,990
wants to apologize to you guys.

158
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:40,600
Come here.

159
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,280
I apologize to you all

160
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,260
for messed up the problem.

161
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,140
I apologize that I didn't tell you before, Tee.

162
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,570
I'm willing to take any punishment.

163
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,170
You can fire me.

164
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,520
It's alright.

165
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,990
Just you come to apologize, I'm fine now.

166
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,360
Nine sincerely apologize, Tee.

167
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,610
You don't have to bow that much.

168
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,450
If you get fired, who will help us?

169
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,950
We have a lot of work to do now.

170
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,560
Gosh...

171

The sky is beautiful.

172
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:52,970
Yes.

173
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,740
It's beautiful.

174
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,120
I mean the sky!

175
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,030
So

176
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,120
when will you accept my request?

177
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:21,920
Nine.

178
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,640
Let me ask you something.

179
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,810
Will we be lovers

180
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,170
or not,

181
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,700
is it that different?

182
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,260
Of course.

183
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,580
How is it?

184
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,320
If I were your lover,

185
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,550
I would be able to get jealous

186
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,850
when I saw you with someone else.

187
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,400
Including Tee.

188
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,100
And I can get mad

189
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,400
Ouch!

190
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,120
when you don't let me kiss your cheek.

191
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,940
Hey.

192
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,360
Please get more serious.

193
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,920
I'm sorry.

194
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,280
If we were lovers,

195
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,360
it would be a confirmation

196
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,480
that you will be with me forever.

197
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
Forever...

198
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,620
it doesn't exist.

199
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,880
So let's make it come true.

200
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,030
Huh?

201
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,940
It's evening now,

202
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,730
let's go downstairs.

203
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:57,650
Let's go.

204
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,200
[Lodestar Production]

205
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,120
Are you really going home?

206
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,600
Why are you so serious about how you look these days?

207
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,620
Are you okay, right?

208
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,240
Are you crazy? Ice.

209
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,040
You ask if I'm okay.

210
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,050
Why can't I dress nicely?

211
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,300
It looks good,

212
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,350
but before you dated Candy,

213
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,880
you never cared this much about yourself.

214
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,540
Ice.

215
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,730
This is the promotion period.

216
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,730
I need to dedicate myself to it.

217
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,570
Does dating someone

218
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,940
take this much effort?

219
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,570
Baby, I'm here.

220
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,570
Candy.

221
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,570
Wait a moment.

222
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,990
Just talk to Ice.

223
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,160
He's free now.

224
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,600
By the way, if you want to travel,

225
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,510
you can book through AirAsia Super App.

226
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,330
You can look up the places you wish to go.

227
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,530
You can choose them all.

228
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,780
I'll pay for you.

229
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:47,760
Huh?

230
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,270
Oh.

231
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,290
I forgot to shave.

232
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:50,940
I'll be back.

233
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,390
What happened to him?

234
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,280
I don't know either, Candy.

235
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,120
AirAsia Super App.

236
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:03,990
Hey.

237
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,130
AirAsia Super App can book flights,

238
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,890
or can book flights with hotels.

239
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,530
They have a food delivery service too!

240
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,099
They have messenger service too.

241
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,010
It's also cheap!

242
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,069
Wow.

243
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,800
Where should I go?

244
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,000
Candy.

245
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,180
Can you book a flight for me too?

246
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,390
Let Boat pay for it.

247
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,369
Okay.

248
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,619
Ice.

249
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,240
I can hear you.

250
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,290
Stop it.

251
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,030
I'll pay only for Candy.

252
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,030
If you want to travel, pay for it yourself.

253
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,670
Now you and Boat...

254
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:43,690
Yeah.

255
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,300
We are now in a relationship.

256
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,300
Oh, okay.

257
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,120
I never thought that you guys were dating.

258
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,640
Why? Ice.

259
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,640
Do you feel regret about me?

260
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,770
I'll tell you that the door to my heart is now closed.

261
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,550
I'm sorry, Ice.

262
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,460
Uh...

263
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,450
It isn't.

264
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,450
I'm just going to say that

265
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,240
it would be a good destiny

266
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,630
that you guys were dating.

267
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,380
You don't regret me?

268
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,700
You're so mean.

269
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,080
Candy.

270
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,700
I'm here.

271
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,200
Where are we going today?

272
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,410
I haven't eaten anything today, baby.

273
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,800
Can you take me out to dinner?

274
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:32,880
Sure.

275
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:33,500
Let's go.

276
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,000
What about you? Ice.

277
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,640
Do you want to join us?

278
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,600
Uh...

279
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,900
It's okay.

280
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,290
I'll back home soon.

281
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,080
Okay.

282
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,980
Then I'm leaving now.

283
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,830
Bye bye.

284
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,420
Don't regret me later.

285
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,100
This way, please. Baby.

286
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,450
Let's go.

287
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,900
Great!

288
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,030
I'm leaving now.

289
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,170
When can I have a date like this?

290
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,560
Tee.

291
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,630
Are you okay?

292
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,690
You can talk to me about anything.

293
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,680
It's nothing.

294
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,210
I just can't get over

295
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,760
to have a brotherly relationship with him again.

296
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,860
Also,

297
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,180
Daonuea is not working here anymore.

298
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,880
How can we stay together without being awkward?

299
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,260
It's good,

300
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,080
so that you can give up on Daonuea.

301
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,400
Umm.

302
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,590
I couldn't stand to see

303
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,260
Daonuea with Nine every day.

304
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,280
You will be able to forget Daonuea on your own

305
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,030
as time goes by.

306
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:38,890
Oh!

307
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,690
But I have another way.

308
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,200
You need to find a new love

309
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,180
so that you can forget Daonuea.

310
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,890
It's like focusing on things.

311
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,140
Let's say Daonuea is this pen

312
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,230
and you focus on it.

313
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,430
It's like you focus on Daonuea.

314
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,260
But if you focus the lamp over there,

315
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,270
the pen will get blurry.

316
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,080
What does it mean?

317
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,400
It means...

318
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,530
just finding a new love.

319
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm old, who's interested in me?

320
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,580
Hey.

321
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,360
You're handsome, Tee.

322
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,480
Is there anyone who doesn't want to date you?

323
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,420
It has me, one person.

324
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,490
If I knew you were single, I would stand in line to flirt with you.

325
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,720
What did you say?

326
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,660
Nothing.

327
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,730
Nothing, I'm just saying that I've never dated before.

328
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,150
But you don't have to listen to me everything.

329
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,900
I'm just saying.

330
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,100
Hey.

331
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,980
It isn't.

332
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,610
I mean just saying goodbye here.

333
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,610
If you enter my room,

334
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,730
it will be as hectic as last night.

335
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,520
No.

336
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,070
What would happen if you were kidnapped?

337
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,010
Hey.

338
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,390
About 10 more steps, it will reach my house.

339
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,080
That's it.

340
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,890
This is another reason.

341
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,370
If you accept my request,

342
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,910
I will be able to enter your home.

343
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,640
It's not relevant at all.

344
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,440
Whether we are lovers or not,

345
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,890
I decide who I will let inside the home.

346
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,530
Alright.

347
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,150
If you say so.

348
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:15,920
What?

00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,400
What did you say?

525
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,350
Ouch!

526
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,150
Be careful.

527
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,130
Ouch...

528
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,150
Are you okay?

529
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:49,900
Ouch...

530
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,100
I'm hurt.

531
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:51,679
Which leg?

532
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,239
Right here.

533
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,940
I think you sprained ankle.

534
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,190
Let's go to the hospital?

535
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,280
I'll take you there.

536
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:57,880
Are you okay?

537
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:58,980
Thank you.

538
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,560
Ouch...

539
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:01,660
Calm down.

540
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,600
Hold my neck.

541
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,310
Ouch...

542
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,330
I forgot my jacket, please stay here.

543
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,470
What is this? Boat.

544
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,440
What does it mean?

545
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,380
I can't take it anymore.

546
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:19,650
Ouch...

547
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,480
I can't take it.

548
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,490
Baby, let's...

549
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,030
let's talk later.

550
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,650
Ouch...

551
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,440
Just go wherever you want!

552
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:29,920
I really can't take it.

553
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,310
Just do anything you want!

554
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,050
Ouch...

555
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:33,950
Are you okay?

556
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,240
Can you come on my motorcycle?

557
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,160
Ouch...

558
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:40,940
Really?

559
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:42,240
Yes.

560
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,510
Here.

561
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,400
Boat sent me a picture.

562
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,130
Why didn't you tell me earlier? Darling.

563
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,050
You blocked my number and Line in every contact.

564
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,850
How can I contact you?

565
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,810
You must tell me earlier, Darling.

566
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,480
I'm very sad.

567
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,530
Gosh... my baby.

568
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:11,970
Let's get back together.

569
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,320
Uh.

570
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,900
What happened?

571
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,020
This is your resignation letter.

572
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,870
You can sign it.

573
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,370
But I want to reassure you

574
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,190
that you won't really change your mind, right?

575
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:22,750
Yes.

576
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:24,860
I think

577
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,400
I wouldn't change my mind.

578
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,240
At least,

579
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,300
to make this company better

580
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,620
and to make you better.

581
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,960
For me, I have more time to myself.

582
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,360
Yeah.

583
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,010
I don't force you.

584
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,120
How is your relationship with Nine?

585
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:53,710
So...

586
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,790
it's okay.

587
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,010
It doesn't change.

588
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,190
Nine didn't disappoint you, right?

589
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,690
Tee.

590
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,930
Don't worry about me.

591
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,530
I think it might be me

592
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,040
that disappoints Nine.

593
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,850
But,

594
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,450
it's good that we're back in a brotherly relationship.

595
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,920
Tee.

596
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,160
Anyway, you're the one brother that I love the most.

597
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:26,740
Come on.

598
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,460
Let's hug.

599
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,680
Thank you.

600
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,570
Uh.

601
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:36,890
Excuse me.

602
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,490
I didn't mean to bother you guys.

603
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:39,980
Tee.

604
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,400
Please check the picture together,

605
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,130
I have to send the picture to the client now.

606
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,260
I will follow you.

607
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,370
See you again, Daonuea.

608
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,570
If you have some time,

609
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,430
I would like to invite you to the farewell party.

610
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,240
Sure.

611
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,590
Please contact me again.

612
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,300
I think our client have been waiting a long time.

613
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:07,950
Yeah.

614
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,830
I'm going now.

615
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,880
What is that?

616
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,700
[Impact Lake Front]

617
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,000
Wow.

618
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,810
This...

619
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,280
Nine.

620
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,140
What meal is this?

621
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,750
Why does everything look so expensive?

622
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,610
Just think it's the beginning of a new life after your resignation

623
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,900
after your resignation.

624
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,100
A new life?

625
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,720
Everything is the same.

626
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,590
I didn't even submit a job application anywhere.

627
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,350
You don't need to hurry.

628
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,570
You can rest first.

629
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,760
Or do you want me to take you on a trip?

630
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,080
It's okay, Nine.

631
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,020
The company is busy these days.

632
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,940
If we travel

633
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,350
and personal is missing one person,

634
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,100
it will make other people work harder.

635
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,860
Somehow other people can handle it.

636
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,170
It's not true.

637
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,040
Even after I resigned for a few days,

638
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,930
Ice still sent me a message for help.

639
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,280
So

640
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,430
when

641
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,520
can we start the new beginning again?

642
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,410
You have to keep waiting

643
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,790
for what will happen in the future.

644
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:09,550
Nine.

645
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,700
I also apologize to you

646
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:14,670
for my stupidity.

647
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,120
Actually,

648
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,270
I don't want you to be uncomfortable like this.

649
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,270
I'm not uncomfortable.

650
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,840
I just want to say that

651
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,290
you can tell me

652
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,050
if you are ready.

653
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:32,980
Okay.

654
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,440
Actually,

655
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,910
I can

656
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,680
be ready.

657
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:46,960
What did

658
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:48,730
you just say?

659
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,530
I'm ready.

660
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,580
Really?

661
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:55,770
Yeah.

662
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,360
Close your eyes now.

663
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,290
Close my eyes?

664
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,990
Close your eyes.

665
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,310
Hurry up.

666
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:08,650
Yeah.

667
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,770
Are you happy now?

668
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,000
Hey!

669
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,230
Don't move.

670
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,690
What are you doing?

671
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:27,620
Just stay still

672
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,370
and follow me.

673
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:30,560
Huh?

674
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,360
Yes.

675
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:32,640
Get up.

676
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,040
I'm scared.

677
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,690
Don't be afraid.

678
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,360
Well, walk up.

679
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,630
Watch out for me.

680
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,550
Go straight ahead.

681
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,690
Nine.

682
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,780
I'm scared.

683
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,950
Don't tease me, Nine.

684
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:56,850
I'm not teasing you.

685
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,340
Are you ready?

686
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:21,960
Huh?

687
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,760
It's so beautiful, Nine.

688
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,990
Do you need to overact like this?

689
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,970
Just show that

690
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,750
you're engaged now.

691
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,480
If someone sees it,

692
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,210
they will stop approaching you.

693
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,860
It means...

694
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,030
Please give me your hand.

695
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,820
Then...

696
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,750
What about you?

697
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,440
So no one will approach you either.

698
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,640
For fairness.

699
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:19,690

877
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,240
You can see the opposite of feelings

878
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:04,820
with someone who has just been in love.

879
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,390
Why?

880
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:08,350
Nothing.

881
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:09,880
I'm just saying.

882
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:13,650
But if you say the opposite of feeling for a long time,

883
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,070
it's sad.

884
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:17,900
Why?

885
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,730
You're probably missing out on a lot of things you want to do.

886
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:26,730
Hey.

887
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,130
What do you mean?

888
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,760
You want me to invite you to my room?

889
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:32,970
No.

890
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,160
I really didn't mean that.

891
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:37,770
Swear with me.

892
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,010
No.

893
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:40,630
If heaven punishes me,

894
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:41,840
we won't be able to be together.

895
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,450
You're crazy.

896
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:51,710
Did you see?

897
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,400
It's thundering.

898
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:06,640
I'm

899
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,080
leaving now for today.

900
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,000
Yeah.

901
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,380
Nine.

902
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,980
Don't you accompany me into the house?

903
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:23,680
Okay.

904
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,770
Actually,

905
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:27,610
I'm willing.

906
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,040
It was true.

907
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,400
(People's life time)

908
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,110
(are getting shorter every day)

909
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,580
(If so,)

910
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:03,280
(I should choose to live with Nine)

911
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:11,930
Is the ring beautiful?

912
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:13,660
Yeah.

913
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,560
Uh...

914
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,280
Why don't you put on your clothes before you leave the bathroom?

915
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:25,500
Because

916
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,620
my shirt is here.

917
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:32,930
Oh.

918
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:34,790
Then

919
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:36,850
I'll clean it up first.

920
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,280
(It feels like my heart is going to burst)

921
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,590
Didn't you say you going to clean?

922
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:01,630
I'm pulling myself together.

923
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:01,920
Hey.

924
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:03,800
It isn't.

925
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:12,650
Uh...

926
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:16,380
After taking a shower and getting dressed,

927
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:17,440
you

928
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:19,040
can back home.

929
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:30,090
You really want me to leave?

930
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:33,720
We are together like this.

931
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:37,440
Yeah.

932
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:39,790
Getting back.
