00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,000
My brother is the best.

177
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,800
No matter what.

178
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,290
(Even if I don't believe in myself,)

179
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,480
(why do strangers believe in me?)

180
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,740
I'm so lucky that you are my buddy.

181
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,300
Please let me know if you know what the exam is about.

182
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:03,660
Okay.

183
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,910
(Why do I want to take care of him?)

184
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,720
It's messed up.

185
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,730
Thank you so much.

186
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,040
My buddy.

187
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,440
From the now on, you can call me Tee.

188
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,330
Yes.

189
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,420
Tee.

190
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,240
Ouch...

191
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,470
I apologize for bothering you late at night.

192
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,240
Oh? You're a guest who has stayed here before.

193
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,840
Can you remember him?

194
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,250
The person who was with you the last time

195
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,080
has just arrived.

196
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,450
What a coincidence.

197
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,690
Yes?

198
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,890
Did Daonuea come here?

199
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:47,620
Huh?

200
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,620
I think you guys came together.

201
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,360
Do you still have any rooms available?

202
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,010
There was only one room left.

203
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,790
It's the same room you stayed in last time.

204
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,520
Here, your key.

205
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,600
Excuse me?

206
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,010
Do you have anything with him?

207
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,890
Nothing.

208
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,080
You can always ask me for help.

209
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,360
But don't be too often, it's hard to get up.

210
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,020
Thank you so much.

211
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,150
I'll go now.

212
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,540
You're moving again.

213
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,450
You can't resist when you see a handsome man.

214
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,940
Fortunately, he is more handsome than the previous one,

215
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,040
I can forgive you.

216
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,210
(It can really help me, right?)

217
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,080
(I'm in the same place)

218
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,420
(to get used to my feelings,)

219
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,480
(but why...)

220
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,440
(do I miss him more?)

221
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,020
Am...

222
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,580
Am I drunk?

223
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,380
I don't want to be associated with you anymore.

224
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:40,980
Don't come to see me again.

225
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,100
Don't be nosy!

226
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,460
I can open it my myself.

227
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,560
Please get out of my life.

228
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,080
I don't want to miss you anymore.

229
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,200
Why do I have to miss you?

230
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,790
You're so bad.

231
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,670
I apologize

232
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,560
for keeping you waiting so long.

233
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,840
What happened last night?

234
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:41,670
Daonuea!

235
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,210
(I didn't see the illusion, right?)

236
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:51,920
Daonuea.

237
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:55,580
Why?

238
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,390
I would like to explain about...

239
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,780
You don't need to explain it.

240
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,150
I think our relationship

241
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,100
is not possible.

242
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,750
But you're misunderstanding.

243
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,440
What do you want me to understand?

244
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,640
You want me to think that
you don't have anyone else behind me while dating me?

245
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,370
Yes.

246
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,600
I used to do that before,

247
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,130
but now it's not.

248
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,290
In the past,

249
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,320
what can I trust you?

250
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,090
The more we get to know each other,

251
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,120
the more we are like strangers.

252
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,840
From now on,

253
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,080
please stop contacting me.

254
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,270
I have to stop these feeling.

255
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,640
I told you, that I don't want to see you.

256
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,660
Why are you following me?

257
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,980
You finally spoke to me?

258
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:14,880
Nine.

259
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,620
Why are you following me?

260
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,160
I'm not following you.

261
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,600
It's the way back to my room.

262
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,160
You can ride with me.

263
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,460
I can walk by myself.

264
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:29,860
Thank you.

265
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:31,540
(Well)

266
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,080
(You want to do this, right?)

267
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,330
Ouch!

268
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,220
Ouch...

269
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,600
Nine!

270
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,000
Why can't I move my legs?

271
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,130
Nine.

272
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,440
What are you hurting?

273
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,170
Don't tease me!

274
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,170
I didn't tease you.

275
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,200
I'm really hurt.

276
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,390
My legs are numb.

277
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,220
Nine.

278
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,710
What's wrong with you?

279
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,280
Get out of the bike first.

280
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,000
Slowly, please.

281
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,560
Nine, please stay here.

282
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,200
Please wait right here for a moment.

283
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,680
Hello.

284
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,730
Are you a resort employee?

285
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:33,880
Please help me.

286
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,560
There were people injured at the goat farm.

287
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,730
Please come here.

288
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:39,540
Thank you so much.

289
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,530
I apologize

290
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,160
for what just happened.

291
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,600
It's okay.

292
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,750
The vehicle will arrive soon.

293
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,110
You can be patient, right?

294
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:01,920
Sure.

295
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,450
I assumed I was just cramping.

296
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,510
Daonuea.

297
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,070
I'm sorry.

298
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,920
I didn't tell you everything.

299
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,220
I'm worried that if I tell you,

300
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,110
you'll leave me.

301
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,770
You don't need to explain.

302
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,600
I'll give up on you anyway.

303
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,400
Can you please don't give up on me?

304
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,140
If that day we met,

305
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,030
it wouldn't end up like this.

306
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,720
Do you remember that day?

307
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,570
Hey! Right here.

308
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,090
Please wait right here.

309
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:01,960
How are you?

310
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,980
Are you okay?

311
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,980
You can get on the vehicle.

312
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,490
Oh.

313
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,130
Yes.

314
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,720
My senior tripped the bike.

315
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,300
So, his legs were cramped.

316
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,800
Oh, it's okay.

317
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,320
My husband will help you.

318
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,080
But I think you guys can suspensory.

319
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,170
Oh.

320
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,080
Get on here!

321
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,470
Yes.

322
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:22,990
Nine.

323
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,340
Please hug my neck.

324
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,200
1,2,3.

325
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:28,870
Hurry up.

326
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,200
Be careful.

327
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:31,840
Please take care of him for a moment.

328
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,640
Please be cautious my baby.

329
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,730
Okay.

330
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:35,720
Are you ready?

331
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,280
Are you okay?

332
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,500
Nine, catch it here.

333
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,920
Please drive.

334
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,850
[Lodestar Production]

335
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:06,990
Boat.

336
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,989
Are Tee okay?

337
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:11,600
I think he's in a bad mood.

338
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:13,420
If you look at his condition.

339
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,310
Will we not help him?

340
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,199
What can we help him? Ice.

341
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,260
Look at the radiation he radiates.

342
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,920
I wasn't brave enough to approach it.

343
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:38,929
Tee.

344
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,060
Are you okay?

345
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,520
Tee.

346
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,199
I have something to tell you.

347
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,870
Everyone.

348
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,040
Now I know where Daonuea is.

Where? Candy.

You really don't want to go to the hospital, do you?

What do you want me to understand?

362
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,910
You want me to think that
you don't have anyone else behind me while dating me?

363

Yes.

I used to do that before,

I didn't tell you everything.

I don't know what happened.

But I can use my head as a guarantee

383
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,700
that he really loves you.

Please make him stop being lonely.

Sorry, Nine.

I'm too impatient.

393

Who came with you?

394
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,120
Oh, yeah.

400
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,950
reconciled with Daonuea yet?

401

But if it's wasn't possible,

405
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,960
I would have to give up on him.

406
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,240
Why do you give up so easily?

hadn't gone to meet his mother that day,

- Come here.

523
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:48,720
Come here.

524
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,210
Open your mouth.

525
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:52,840
Look up.

526
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:55,210
What are you doing?

527
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,650
Hey, darling. How could you do that to him?

528
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:58,630
Boat.

529
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,760
Don't tease him.

530
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,540
He's not willing.

531
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,470
Yes, Tee.

532
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,380
I'm sorry.

533
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,940
You're a badass.

534
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:11,820
Ice.

535
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,360
That's your glass, right?

536
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,430
I'll bring you soda.

537
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,000
Yes.

538
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,080
You... Ice.

539
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,580
Why do you play guitar all night?

540
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,840
You don't even drink.

541
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,150
Do you need my help? Honey.

542
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,010
Stop it.

543
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,330
How can you force him to drink?

544
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,650
Nine.

545
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:18,700
Why are you still not drunk?

546
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,760
Who told me

547
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,560
that you are alcohol-tolerant?

548
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:28,120
It's not true.

549
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:30,920
Yeah.

550
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,340
It's not true.

551
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,340
Daonuea.

552
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:49,380
From now on

553
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,740
I promise that

554
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,960
I will take care of you.

555
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,470
I will take good care of you.

556
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,830
All you do is just words.

557
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:47,930
Tee.

558
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,400
I think you're drunk.

559
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:54,950
Shall we go back to our room?

560
00:50:59,190 --> 00:50:59,690
No.

561
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,770
I'm not drunk.

562
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:13,080
Tee.

563
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,760
I think I have to tell you something important.

564
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,640
In what regard?

565
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I'm...

566
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:28,760
I probably won't be able to work with you anymore.

567
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,220
I received a scholarship for a workshop abroad.

568
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,760
Don't leave me, Ice.

569
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:00,190
Tee.

570
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:01,870
It's my dream.

571
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:08,280
You'll really be another one to leave me again?

572
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,160
(Where did Nine go?)

573
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,720
Darling. You have to take a video.

574
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:09,660
Nine.

575
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:12,150
If I really don't love you, I'm not here.

576
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,200
It's freaking hot.

577
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,600
Candy, you're good at complaining.

578
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,970
It won't take long.

579
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,780
Please be patient a little more.

580
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,400
Yeah.

581
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,260
I can handle it.

582
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:19,740
Are you ready?

583
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:20,640
Yes.

584
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:21,860
Thank you so much.

585
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,880
Okay?

586
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:23,760
Yes.

587
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,440
I'm ready.

588
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,640
Daonuea is coming!

589
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,080
Nine.

590
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,850
What happened?

591
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:43,890
Please come here, Daonuea.

592
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,900
You probably still didn't trust what I said yesterday, right?

593
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:11,690
That if you can trust my words.

594
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,020
But today

595
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:19,520
I want everyone here to witness,

596
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:22,780
that I will be by Daonuea's side

597
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:24,160
from the now on

598
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,360
and forever.

599
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,360
Can you wear this ring again?

600
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,920
Wear it! Wear it! Wear it!

601
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:50,800
Wear it.

602
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,820
Wear it, Daonuea.

603
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,820
Wear it!

604
00:55:54,010 --> 00:56:01,720
Wear it! Wear it! Wear it!

605
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,610
Wear it, Daonuea.

606
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:06,650
Nine.

607
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:07,340
Huh?

608
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,390
Why you always overacting?

609
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,100
We're engaged now.

610
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:43,800
Baby.

611
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,160
When can we do this?

612
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,280
Shall we begin?

613
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,970
I want simplicity like this.

614
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:50,930
No.

615
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:52,760
I've decided.

616
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,330
We'll get married at the racetrack.

617
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,220
The racetrack?

618
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:56,680
Yes.

619
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,020
Where is the romance? Darling.

620
00:56:59,160 --> 00:56:59,930
Vroom vroom.

621
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,500
You are riding on the back of my motorbike.

622
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,410
Let's vroom vroom.

623
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:04,520
Vroom vroom.

624
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:18,710
Will I have a chance to get married like this?

625
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,840
I have flowers too.

626
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,520
Let's sprinkle some flowers.

627
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:29,900
Have you taken a video yet?

628
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,170
Darling.

629
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,480
They're so cute.

630
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,510
Yes, auntie.

631
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,250
Ouch!

632
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,630
Ouch...

633
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,200
What's going on with you? Auntie.

634
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,320
Ouch...

635
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,000
My amniotic sac is going to burst.

636
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,780
- Ouch!
- What?

637
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:50,740
Your amniotic sac is going to burst!?

638
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,400
I'm about to calve!

639
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,120
Darling, take a video.

640
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:56,060
Tee, please call an ambulance.

641
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,100
Calm down, auntie.

642
00:57:59,010 --> 00:57:59,560
Oh, bugger!

643
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,190
Hurry up.

644
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,600
Just call an ambulance.

645
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,440
Hurry up.

646
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,760
Darling, take a video.

647
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,290
- Please call an ambulance, Tee.
- Hello.

648
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:11,620
Why is it so messy?

649
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,400
The amniotic sac burst!

650
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,280
Guys! The amniotic sac burst!

651
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:27,060
Wow.

652
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:27,920
Wow.

653
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,900
I didn't think she would calve that day.

654
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,000
Yes.

655
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,400
It turned out that there were more than a hundred witnesses.

656
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,400
It's good.

657
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:44,050
So that you can't cheat on me.

658
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,270
Yeah.

659
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:49,250
I don't have any thoughts of cheating on you.

660
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:54,530
Hey.

661
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,350
Hold on.

662
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:58,240
Nine.

663
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:02,740
It seems they've accepted my job application!

664
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,010
Hey!

665
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:06,540
You're right.

666
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,910
You're the best, Daonuea.

667
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:13,860
Nine.

668
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,170
Stop.

669
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:17,020
Are my cheeks bruised?

670
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:18,580
I don't see any bruising. Let me see.

671
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,210
You're the best.

672
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:24,620
Stop that.

673
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,110
Please sign it here.

674
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,360
Where?

675
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,010
Here and here, right?

676
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:37,440
Yes.

677
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:39,060
Okay.

678
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:39,890
Thank you.

679
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:04,080
Wear it! Wear it! Wear it!

680
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,570
Wear it, Daonuea!

681
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:09,290
Why you always overacting?

682
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:23,690
Oh, gosh.

683
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,460
Congratulations, Nine.

684
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:32,000
I wish you're happiness.

685
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,800
Everything is ready.

686
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:51,530
Oh, okay.

687
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:51,920
Let's go.

688
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,520
Let's go.

[Lodestar Production]

690
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,790
What is this?

691
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,380
(I have to go to study abroad)

692
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,560
(I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance)

(and be happy in your life, Tee)

Tee.

699
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,080
Ice has entered the camp?

700
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,160
You also know about it?

701
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:54,900
Yeah.

702
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,480
I know that he wants to go.

Uh, Nine.

705
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,200
Please look after the office on my behalf.

706
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:21,820
Look after?

707
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,070
What do you mean? Tee.

708
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:27,410
Where will you go?

709
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:29,600
I'll go to Singapore.

710
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,080
Singapore?

711
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:41,450
And...

712
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,490
leave me alone.

713
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:46,600
Okay.

[One month later]

715
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,370
Oh.

716
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,470
Are you back?

717
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:31,630
Sit here, please.

718

What are you cooking? Daonuea.

719
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,810
Soup and bualoy.

720
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:41,800
Why do you make so many dishes?

721
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:46,440
I want you to taste delicious food from me

722
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:47,810
before you work at the studio all day.

723
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:52,700
There is a lot of food in the studio.

724
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,500
It's true.

725
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,530
I just want to cook for you.

726
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:05,350
Come here.

727
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:09,500
What are you cooking?

728
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:11,640
Let me taste it.

729
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:12,670
Okay.

730
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:13,750
Let's start with this dish.

731
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:18,540
Calm down.

732
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,320
I know.

733
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:27,300
How was it?

734
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:29,400
It's tasty?

735
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:35,880
Yes.

736
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:40,140
Let's continue to taste bualoy?

737
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,370
Okay.

738
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,360
Here.

739
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,320
Eat it.

740
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:52,790
Huh?

741
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:55,780
Can I be

742
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:57,780
a dessert chef now?

743
01:04:59,360 --> 01:04:59,920
No.

744
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:02,370
Daonuea.

745
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:03,030
Huh?

746
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:03,940
I'm sorry.

747
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,000
But I think

748
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,880
this dish tastes weird.

749
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:10,340
Huh?

750
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:12,590
Why?

751
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:15,120
I execute the recipe.

752
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,770
Why are you not encouraging me?

753
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,320
Come here.

754
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:26,580
Huh?

755
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:28,400
I'm here for you now.

756
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:29,410
Huh?

757
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:33,670
Thank you

758
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,950
for telling me honestly.

759
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:39,080
So

760
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:42,080
will you have any reward for me

761
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:43,790
before going to work?

762
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:46,490
Hey.

You'll late.

Then, let's me taste bualoy.

766
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,120
Oh.
