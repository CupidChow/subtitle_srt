2
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,500
Wow.

3
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,180
It's so huge.

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,830
If you want to take my picture,

5
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:45,990
just tell me.

6
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,810
I'm not taking your picture.

7
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,710
I just took this room

8
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,920
for decorating the room design.

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,710
Let me see.

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,390
What kind of room would you like to decorate?

11
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,200
Here.

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,379
I want to put the desk there.

13
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,930
One of them is for the editor.

14
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,360
And another one...

15
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,370
is my desk here!

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,460
Because it's a corner's good exposure to sunlight.

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,900
What about my seat?

18
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,210
Umm...

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,500
Right there!

20
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,380
Why would you want my seat over there?

21
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,210
Because if something happens to me,

22
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,320
you can help me in time.

23
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,009
What will happen to you?

24
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,770
Someday

25
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,060
I might get old and die.

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,740
Get old and die.

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,680
What do you mean?

28
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,590
I don't know.

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,530
But, Tee...

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,940
Is it a good idea

31
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,870
to run a production house?

32
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,080
What if

33
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,050
we argue one day?

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,320
How can we argue?

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,220
When you're so cute.

36
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,260
I don't want you to be exhausted with other work.

37
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:24,750
Hey.

38
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,160
I didn't feel exhausted at all.

39
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,190
It was you who wanted me to be near you every day.

40
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,250
Because I want us to be together

41
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,300
to keep our love.

42
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,100
What if...

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,340
one day...

44
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,790
I don't have feeling for you anymore?

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,850
Whatever happens,

46
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,270
what we create together won't vanish.

47
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:05,730
Yeah.

48
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,310
You're good at being cute.

49
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,750
You're good at that.

50
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,490
Why hasn't Daonuea been here yet?

51
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,400
Tee?

52
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:28,920
Uh...

53
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,660
I have something to tell you.

54
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,110
You told me to keep an eye on Nine and Daonuea,

55
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,930
I just...

56
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:39,760
You don't have to tell me.

57
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,240
I already know.

58
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:44,600
Yes.

59
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,440
But I trust Daonuea.

60
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,329
No matter what,

61
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,270
Daonuea would never do something like that.

62
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,510
Right?

63
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,530
Daonuea.

64
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,190
You don't have any feelings for Tee.

65
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,210
Don't fool yourself.

66
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

67
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,209
Uh...

68
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:18,940
That's right.

69
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:20,779
Uh...

70
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,510
You didn't tell something to Nine?

71
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,860
Nine?

72
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,280
He won't ever listen to what we say.

73
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,040
Tee.

74
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:33,970
Uh...

75
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:34,990
When

76
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,600
Daonuea traveled to Khao Yai

77
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,210
3 months ago

78
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,290
and you told me to find out who that person was...

79
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,460
I think I knew who he was.

80
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,170
Uh...

81
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,580
It's...

82
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:48,950
Nine, right?

83
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,909
Yeah.

84
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,740
It really must be Nine.

85
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,230
Otherwise,

86
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,710
when will they become close?

87
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,430
Even if everything happened,

88
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,670
are you still with Nine?

89
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,520
Because I trust him.

90
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,690
I think I should meet Daonuea downstairs.

91
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,890
Thank you, Boat.

92
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,680
For helping me.

93
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,310
Yes, Tee.

94
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:42,850
Don't touch me!

95
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,840
Daonuea.

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,190
Don't touch me!

97
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,890
Do you feel better now?

98
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,260
Does Nine make you feel bad more?

99
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,280
No.

100
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,040
It wasn't Nine's fault.

101
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,470
It's my fault.

102
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,170
I don't know why.

103
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,140
If you have any worries,

104
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,630
I can listen to you.

105
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,170
Thank you.

106
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,780
Tee.

107
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,100
Can you get back your home?

108
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,600
I want to be alone.

109
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:44,850
Sure.

110
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,480
If anything happens, call me.

111
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,260
Do you want to eat anything this evening?

112
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,690
I'll bring it to you.

113
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,010
It's okay.

114
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,510
See you later.

115
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,940
If you're not ready,

116
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,450
you can rest tomorrow.

117
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,180
Or...

118
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,070
should I clear everything up with Nine about it?

119
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,520
Is it because of Daonuea?

120
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,110
Yes.

121
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,870
Because of Daonuea.

122
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,630
Since when?

123
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,570
Since when I was in Khao Yai

124
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:02,980
at The Air Resort.

125
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,600
Nine.

126
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,600
We shouldn't even break up.

127
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,810
It's ridiculous.

128
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,070
Can I apologize to you?

129
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,880
Please?

130
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,480
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,420
Praew.

132
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,690
That's how it is.

133
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:23,740
That's how it really is.

134
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,630
I can't have any feeling for you.

135
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,400
Please, Praew.

136
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,490
For loving you again,

137
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,180
I can't do it.

138
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,200
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,490
I'm sorry.

140
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,270
Actually,

141
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,770
I've always known this.

142
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,430
It's okay, Nine.

143
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,030
No matter who you love,

144
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,000
love is always beautiful.

145
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,600
Go.

146
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,160
Nine.

147
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,870
Trust your heart.

148
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,040
(I'm crazy)

149
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,420
(Why am I still thinking about it?)

150
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,040
Nine...

151
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,360
Why are you coming here?

152
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,260
Are you okay?

153
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,230
I think...

154
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,120
I'm now aware

155
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,710
of what would happen

156
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,430
if nothing is cleared.

157
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,420
It's alright, Nine.

158
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,060
Humans can make a mistake.

159
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,230
I was wrong too.

160
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,000
Even I knew everything

161
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,280
but I didn't tell Praew anything.

162
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:53,640
Candy.

163
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,370
You have no bad intentions.

164
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,670
You don't want Praew to be sad.

165
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,730
Praew came to me

166
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,850
and told me not to meet her again.

167
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,180
I think we should

168
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,770
stay away from Praew for a while

169
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,300
and wait for her to be ready and meet her later.

170
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,380
Okay.

171
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,170
Praew

172
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,920
doesn't hate you.

173
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:46,940
In the end,

174
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,130
however, she comes back to you.

175
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,340
Huh?

176
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,690
I want to comfort you

525
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,630
If I'm disappointed,

526
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,490
it will hurt.

527
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,240
It's like a lottery.

528
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,560
If you think you won the lottery,

529
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,360
but it isn't.

530
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,520
It's will hurt.

531
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,010
It might be.

532
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,720
You're depressed...

533
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,520
because of Nine, right?

534
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:10,990
Hey.

535
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,630
What are you saying?

536
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,330
How could it be Nine's fault?

537
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,760
I really asked you.

538
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,930
If you have such feelings for Nine,

539
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,100
why did you come back to talk with Tee?

540
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,000
If it was me,

541
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,850
I would approach the person I love.

542
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,850
So don't waste your time.

543
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,190
Yeah.

544
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,740
Many things

545
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,980
still confuse me.

546
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,450
How can you be happy?

547
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:45,740
Yeah.

548
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,550
My life is not as easy as your life

549
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,660
that it's simple

550
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,660
and don't expect anything.

551
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,150
What about you?

552
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,070
Aren't you bored?

553
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,240
It's boring

554
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,460
but I probably don't know what to do.

555
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,650
Then...

556
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,900
You should make a wish to something

557
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,340
to make your life

558
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,160
more exciting.

559
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,350
Make a wish?

560
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,960
It's all in your head.

561
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,800
Alright.

562
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,720
Just give it a try.

563
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:23,850
Alright.

564
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,090
Which item should I wish for?

565
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,630
That pool float.

566
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,810
Duck pool float?

567
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,100
Seriously?

568
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,090
Yeah.

569
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,920
Give it a try.

570
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,010
Alright.

571
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,170
Okay.

572
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,110
(I hope to meet my true love soon)

573
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,660
Boat.

574
00:37:59,210 --> 00:37:59,690
Yes, Daonuea.

575
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,780
Did you order delivery?

576
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,180
Uh...

577
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,060
It might be.

578
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,550
Let me check.

579
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,360
Hi~

580
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,370
Please come in.

581
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,480
Oh, Tee.

582
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,510
This is your snack.

583
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,490
I bought it for you.

584
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,890
I heard from Nine that

585
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,130
people in this office like Chao Sua.

586
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,580
So I bought it for you guys.

587
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:41,660
Let's say

588
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,230
it's an apology

589
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,100
that I took my friend to cause trouble in your office that day.

590
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,750
Oh, it's alright.

591
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,460
I can understand you.

592
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:52,560
Daonuea.

593
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,400
I'll bring your belongings to your room.

594
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,180
You can continue to talk.

595
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:09,250
Oh.

596
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,560
I heard

597
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,950
you invited me to come with Nine.

598
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,650
Thank you so much.

599
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,760
Let's say

600
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,770
it's a new opportunity to get to know each other again

601
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,180
other as Candy who is Candy,

602
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,700
not Nine's girlfriend.

603
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,290
Feel free to be here, Candy.

604
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,930
I want to talk something with your friend.

605
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:29,860
Oh.

606
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,590
I should carry my belongings to my room.

607
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,290
Boat! Daonuea!

608
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,160
Wait for me!

609
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,190
Come here.

610
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,950
Do you have a party and keep it a secret?

611
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,260
How did you get here?

612
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:51,770
Ice.

613
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,990
If you want your pictures to look better,

614
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,450
you must change lenses.

615
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,510
Now you're using a normal lens,

616
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:01,990
change it to telephoto lens.

617
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,870
The telephoto lens will give your photos a more dimensional look.

618
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,450
The front is clear and the back is blurred.

619
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,650
It makes the product

620
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,760
more clear.

621
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,010
Here.

622
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,070
Just change it.

623
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:58,900
How was it?

624
00:41:59,170 --> 00:41:59,630
Check the picture.

625
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,620
Wow.

626
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,340
It's better, Nine!

627
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,960
The object stands out.

628
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,520
The product is more attractive.

629
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:12,810
Oh.

630
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,890
Do you know

631
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,900
where the people

632
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:18,710
at this office go?

633
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,100
Uh...

634
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,320
I think I can't tell you about it.

635
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:27,810
Why?

636
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,650
Tee said

637
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,210
he wants to have a private trip with Daonuea.

638
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,530
He doesn't want you to go there.

639
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:37,860
Huh?

640
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,780
Tee really say that?

641
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:49,860
In summary,

642
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:50,940
where are they going?

643
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,900
I might get fired after telling you.

644
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:58,970
If you don't tell me,

645
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,440
Tee will be informed

646
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,610
that you use the studio arbitrarily.

647
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:04,990
And in your hand

648
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:06,440
is my camera.

649
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,030
I won't tell you.

650
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,050
I just know.

651
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:20,830
If you don't like it,

652
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,090
I can take Candy back.

653
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:25,420
It's alright.

654
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,000
Just stay here.

655
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,290
But I'm begging you,

656
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,240
can you stop approaching Daonuea?

657
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,150
Yeah.

658
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:40,430
I can feel you.

659
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,070
Just let me know

660
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,640
if you need some help this evening.

661
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:51,800
But...

662
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,250
how do you know about it?

663
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:54,770
Boat told it to you, right?

664
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,280
You know very well

665
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,920
that I have a sense of it.

666
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,060
I know everything

667
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,160
with just one look.

668
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,320
Are you okay with it?

669
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,800
Of course!

670
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,250
You

671
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,210
should be honest with him.

672
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,210
At least

673
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,270
if Daonuea is happy,

674
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,520
I'll feel better

675
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,650
that a good person like you takes care of him.

676
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:31,360
Thank you.

677
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,110
This is snacks and drinks for you.

678
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,800
Here you are.

679
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:11,790
Where are you looking at?

680
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:12,940
Nothing.

681
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,260
It's alright.

682
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,760
You came at the right time.

683
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,240
Please put sunblock on me.

684
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,160
I can't apply it.

685
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:20,680
Please?

686
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:22,210
Okay.

687
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,160
Sure.

688
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,340
This side too.

689
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,950
Neck and everything.

690
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,130
(Thank you, a little duck)

691
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,920
(You're so powerful)

692
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:18,290
Are you okay?

693
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,250
Are you shocked?

694
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,120
Oh.

695
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:23,270
Nothing.

696
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:24,710
I'm just...

697
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:25,870
cold.

698
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,140
Nine just changed his mind.

699
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:31,470
If there are more people,

Okay.

Oh.

Candy wants to apologize to you.

705
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,440
Back then, she lied because

706
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,680
she was worried she wouldn't be allowed to get into the office.

707

I'm not even mad at her.

You're so romantic, Tee.

It's not frequently.

you can find a better man than I am.

I'd tell Tee something.
