2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,400
Yes, I'm in photopia right now.

3
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,700
Okay.

4
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,700
See you later.

5
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,800
Thank you.

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,600
What are you looking at?

7
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:14,900
Oh!

8
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,600
Why don't you tell me you're here?

9
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,200
You didn't call the client?

10
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,100
No.

11
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,500
I went to buy this lollipop.

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,100
We've been here for a while.

13
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,500
Why can't you contact the client?

14
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
I mean...

15
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,900
they canceled it just now.

16
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
What did you just say?

17
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,200
They canceled it.

18
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,200
Why are you just telling me now?

19
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,200
I have a lot of work to do.

20
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,100
I just assigned a work to Ice.

21
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,400
What will he think of me?

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Anyway, they canceled it.

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,500
Shall we continue to play rides?

24
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,800
I just told you

25
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,200
that I have a lot of work to do.

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,100
Did you listen to it?

27
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,600
Why are you so childish?

28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,700
It's true.

29
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,700
Don't you think we sometimes have childhood moments?

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,900
Let's play some rides.

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
I'll drive you to the office later.

32
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,300
I think it might be just in time for your dinner with Tee.

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,400
How was it?

34
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,200
Will you go with me?

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,800
No.

36
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,400
I'll back home.

37
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,700
[Lodestar Production]

38
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,400
Put the paper in.

39
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,100
Hurry up.

40
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,500
Softly.

41
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Set to black and white, Ice.

42
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,700
Yes, press it.

43
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,700
Boat.

44
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,200
I think it's wrong, right?

45
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,900
Yes.

46
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Why did it turn out like this?

47
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,300
What should we do?

48
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,300
Keep doing it, Ice.

49
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,400
Continuously.

50
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,200
Tee.

51
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,100
Come here!

52
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay.

53
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,000
Come here.

54
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,500
Tee.

55
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,000
You really want me to go there with Nine?

56
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,000
I think if we were together

57
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,400
we would fight more than work.

58
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,000
Aren't you telling me

59
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,000
it might be a problem in the office?

60
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,300
But it's not for every situation.

61
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,600
Don't you think

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,100
it's too much?

63
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,100
No.

64
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,200
It's good.

65
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,300
If Nine has a problem,

66
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,300
you can help him.

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,800
Then...

68
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,700
Let Ice go there instead of me.

69
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,800
He had just arrived here.

70
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,400
That's it.

71
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,400
I think he can do it.

72
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,800
Why do you think so?

73
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,800
That.

74
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,000
He can print the document.

75
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,900
Daonuea.

76
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,600
Just follow Nine there.

77
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,200
Why do you have to act like it's a big deal?

78
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,700
Are you guys ready?

79
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,400
Nine, I can't go with you now.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,200
Can Daonuea go with you?

81
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,200
You really can't go there?

82
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,100
Yes.

83
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,500
But it's alright.

84
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,500
Daonuea can handle everything.

85
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Tee.

86
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,600
This evening.

87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,300
If I'm back home late.

88
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,200
is there still our dinner?

89
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,200
It didn't take long.

90
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,000
I'll drive you here.

91
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,700
Are you okay?

92
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,000
Yes.

93
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,000
Maybe.

94
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,100
Just think,

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,700
bad luck disappeared before leaving.

96
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,200
Be careful next time.

97
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Will you go now?

98
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,100
Let's go.

99
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,600
Boat.

100
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,200
I think they have something, right?

101
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,300
Yes.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,400
It's one thing I've been wondering for a long time.

103
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,900
Since I work here.

104
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,300
Hey!

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,100
Focus your work!

106
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,700
Yes.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,200
I'll tell Tee.

108
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,500
Argh!!

109
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,299
Argh!!! I'm scared!!!

110
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh... Praew.

111
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,600
I think you are a ghost.

112
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,300
Phew!

113
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,300
Candy.

114
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,000
Are you watching TV at our home?

115
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,900
Ah.

116
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,400
I think you are filming a drama.

117
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,600
Did you see me sitting here?

118
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,600
How did you get into my house?

119
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,800
I didn't pay internet charges.

120
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,900
So I asked permission from Nine.

121
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,800
But I got permission from Nine.

122
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,500
So I can come in here.

123
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,800
Do you think this is the time or place for that?

124
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,500
You watch TV at other people's houses.

125
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,800
Whose house is it?

126
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
It's Nine's house!

127
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,600
Oh...

128
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay.

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,300
Let me watch this to the end.

130
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,100
And let's talk later...

131
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,600
No!

132
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,400
I don't think you are upset.

133
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
You even slept in my room before.

134
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,700
It's the past.

135
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,000
Okay, I'm sorry.

136
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,100
If you don't like it, I'll back home.

137
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,800
Wait.

138
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,300
Help me something.

139
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,000
And I won't get mad at you.

140
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,400
What do you want me to help with?

141
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,800
Tee.

142
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,300
Don't forget to eat.

143
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,000
Bye.

144
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,400
Hey.

145
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,400
We just stayed together for a few hours.

146
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,000
You are overacting.

147
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,300
People who have never been in love like you

148
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,600
don't understand it.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Among all the people I've met,

150
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,600
no one is overacting like you.

151
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,000
Really?

152
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,700
Good!

153
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,900
You should meet someone who is overacting like me

154
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,700
so your life doesn't get boring.

155
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,700
I really made the right decision

156
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,100
to take you with me, right?

157
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
I am not willing to come with you.

158
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,700
But Tee said that for peace in our office.

159
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,200
Here.

160
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,800
Car key.

161
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Alright.

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,400
Hurry up.

163
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,300
Why are you standing here?

164
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,200
Yeah.

165
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,600
Alright.

166
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,300
You command me.

167
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,400
What about when you late?

168
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,100
Open it!

169
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,100
(Everyone, today I'm Kapper has a song to recommend to you)

170
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,000
(If you hesitate about love or can't decide,)

171
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,100
(listen to this song)

172
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,500
Did you listen to it too?

173
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,500
Yes.

174
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,800
Why?

175
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,200
It doesn't suit me?

176
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,200

00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,100
But actually, she's a good person.

525
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,199
It's okay.

526
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,300
I'm just surprised.

527
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,100
I think...

528
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,100
you are the girlfriend of...

529
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,700
Oh.

530
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,100
That's not true.

531
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,300
Actually, we're just friends.

532
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,100
But Praew told me to keep an eye on Nine.

533
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
And I'm free

534
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,800
so I do it.

535
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,600
Then Nine said that I was his girlfriend.

536
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
I'm confused.

537
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,400
I don't have any questions about this anymore.

538
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,400
I totally get it.

539
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
I'm sorry.

540
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,100
Do I have to keep this back to its original place?

541
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,500
Umm...

542
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,700
So good.

543
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,200
I loved it.

544
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,000
Yes.

545
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,400
The work is good,

546
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,200
including you.

547
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,700
It's all good.

548
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,100
But I think,

549
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
I need you to revise some points.

550
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,400
But we need some time to consider it.

551
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:17,700
Okay?

552
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,000
Okay.

553
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I will contact you back again.

554
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,200
I see.

555
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,200
Thank you so much.

556
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,700
Tee.

557
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,900
Tee.

558
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,400
Yes?

559
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,900
Are you busy?

560
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,900
I'd like to have some dessert with you.

561
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,300
It's okay.

562
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,700
Can you?

563
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,700
I don't want to bother you.

564
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,700
I see.

565
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,500
I have got a few things to do.

566
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,500
Thank you so much.

567
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,100
Don't go.

568
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,800
If you don't like dessert, we can have food.

569
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,300
Please?

570
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,400
But I like it.

571
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,600
I know you like cockles.

572
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,600
Will you go with me?

573
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,400
I don't like seafood.

574
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,700
I like hot dogs.

575
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,900
Excuse me.

576
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,200
You like hot dogs...

577
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,000
Why does he like hot dogs?

578
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,200
I have hot dogs too!

579
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,100
Why don't you eat it?

580
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,800
Why can't I contact anyone?

581
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,100
Good.

582
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,700
Can he do it?

583
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,100
Damn!

584
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,300
Tee.

585
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,400
Hello, Tee.

586
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
What's the matter?

587
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Boat.

588
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,700
I can't contact Daonuea.

589
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,900
I want to ask you, has he returned to the office yet?

590
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,000
Uh...

591
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,200
He hasn't returned yet.

592
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,500
Have you finished the meeting?

593
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:41,800
Umm.

594
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,700
Yes.

595
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,600
Is everything there okay?

596
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,300
Oh, yes.

597
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Ice can solve problems in the office.

598
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,300
What did you say?

599
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Problems in the office?

600
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:52,900
Uh...

601
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,100
It's nothing.

602
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,300
I was just teaching about working for him.

603
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,600
So it has some problems.

604
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,200
What is he doing now?

605
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,200
Oh...

606
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,400
Yeah.

607
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,400
He was just taking pictures.

608
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,600
But I think I have to take care of it now.

609
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,700
Before it got any more problems.

610
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,700
Ice.

611
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,100
I'll shoot it myself.

612
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,900
Set the light over there.

613
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,000
Did you see it?

614
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
She is so beautiful.

615
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,800
But the light...

616
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,100
I'll shoot it myself.

617
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,200
Yes, Boat.

618
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,200
Ice, look at me.

619
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,900
Look at my posture.

620
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,100
Make your legs 45 degrees.

621
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Set, shoot!

622
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,400
Click!

623
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,800
You don't smile?

624
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,600
Yes, good.

625
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,700
Hold the pose in the hair-styling position.

626
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,200
Right leg too, Ice.

627
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,700
Yes, that's right.

628
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:40,900
Smile more.

629
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,100
Good.

630
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,500
Or...

631
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,300
is he still at Dream World?

632
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:56,300
[Dream World]

633
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
It's cold.

634
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,800
Here.

635
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,000
This is your plastic bag.

636
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,800
Why did you give it to me?

637
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,800
If you vomit again,

638
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,900
I can grab a plastic bag in time.

639
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,900
Keep it away from me.

640
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,900
I was about to puke when I saw it.

641
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,700
In case you feel nauseous again.

642
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,600
No.

643
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,400
Keep it back.

644
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,100
It has stopped.

645
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,400
Oh, really?

646
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:01,900
Yes.

647
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:03,800
Hey.

648
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,500
Damn it!

649
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:11,900
Huh?

650
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,500
Come here, Daonuea.

651
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,800
Calm down, please.

652
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Let's play it.

653
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,200
Let's go.

654
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,000
Hey.

655
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
I can walk by myself.

656
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,400
This rides is better.

657
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,900
I might die if I play more extreme rides.

658
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,900
Daonuea.

659
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,800
I'm sorry,

660
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,800
I didn't reply to your message at that time.

661
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,500
Hey.

662
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,700
Why are you talking about it again?

663
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,200
I don't have any problems with you.

664
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,700
I just wanted to tell you

665
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,200
because at that time I reconciled with my girlfriend.

666
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,200
She asked me to reconcile.

667
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,400
But in the end, I don't think it's right for me.

668
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,300
How can you say that?

669
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,900
You don't care about Candy's feelings?

670
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,700
I don't want to hear anything from you anymore.

671
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
You are always spoiling the mood.

672
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,900
If Tee doesn't have a meeting,

673
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,500
I wouldn't want to come here with you.

674
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,000
You know? Me and Tee just talked about coming here.

675
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,900
How sad would he be when I came to the amusement park with you?

676
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,500
Why?

677
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,300
I'm here with you, and what's next?

678
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I don't know.

679
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,900
I don't feel safe when I'm with you.

680
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,900
But I help you every time.

681
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,700
In what matter?

682
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,800
Let's go.

683
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,000
Let's play that one.

684
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,000
Hey, Nine!

685
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,400
It's not on our list.

686
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,400
And it looks scary.

687
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,000
Didn't you say you would play every rides?

688
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,000
Are you scared?

689
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Alright.

690
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,700
Okay.

691
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,300
Daonuea!

692
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,700
Oh, Tee?

693
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,900
Oh, they canceled?

694
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,500
Yeah, Tee.

695
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,700
My phone got wet

696
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,300
and the battery ran out.

697
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,200
Someone won't let me borrow his phone.

00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,400
Huh?

699
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,100
Why do you say that?

700
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,000
I don't have much battery left either.

701
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,900
What will you do if they contact me back?

702

That's it, Tee.

As the birds around here said.

704
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,800
Shall we play rides together?

705
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,800
We were at the amusement park together.

706
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,500
We should play to be worth it.

707
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,400
Okay.

708
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,800
What rides do you want to play?

709
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,400
Shoot a gun?

710
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,100
No.

711
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,700
I don't like it.

712
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,000
Huh?

713
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,500
In the past, you liked it.

714
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,700
In the past I liked it.

715
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,500
But now it's not.

716
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,200
Do you guys have to be this serious?

717
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,400
Nine.

718
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,000
What happened to you?

719
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,000
Didn't you like it before?

720
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,000
I told you, I don't want to play.

721
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,500
Why are you nagging on me?

722
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,300
Can't you play with me for a moment?

723
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,000
You can play it alone.

724
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,900
I'll take a picture and wait for you here.

725

Can't you play with me for a moment?

726

I already told you that I don't want to.

727
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,100
Just play it yourself.

728
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,100
- Let's play with me.
- No!

729

What's wrong with you?

730
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,400
You played it with me before.

731
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,600
It's been a long time.

732
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,500
I don't like it anymore.

733

I don't want to play it!

734

No, I'll be right here.

Alright.

740
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,300
Up to you.

741

Your headboard.

I like playing paintball more than it.

He has talent.

I can't believe he's an apprentice.

Wow!

I don't know.

I always feel tensed in front of the camera.

You?

779
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,800
On that day, you looked confidently.

Paapare.

873
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,900
Why didn't Nine call me?

874
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,100
Why hasn't he gotten back?

875
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yes, Paapare.

876
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,200
Huh?

877
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,700
Now?

878
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,300
Uh...

879
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,000
Yes.

880
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,400
Okay.

Yes.

882
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,500
I'll prepare and see you later.

883
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,400
Okay.

884
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,100
Yes.

Okay, bye.

Hey?

887
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,600
Where are you going?

888
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,800
Director.

889
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,700
He told Paapare that he had to use this location.

890
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,700
He wanted to change to this location.

891
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,600
It should be this time.

892
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,400
Just only now and this moment.

893
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,300
Otherwise, the flower will wither or something.

894

Suddenly?

895
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:30,900
Yes.

896
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,100
I have to go there for several days.

897
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,200
Have you

898
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,600
told it to Nine?

899
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,900
Did you see me tell him yet?

900
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,000
I haven't told him yet.

901
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,400
Please tell it to Nine.

902
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,000
Okay, sure.

903
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,700
Uh.

904
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,900
One more thing.

905
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,600
Be sure to ask Nine

906
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,200
about Nine's sexual orientation

907
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,200
if it's true.

908
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,100
Yeah.

909
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,200
I'll ask him.

910
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,400
I'm serious, Candy.

911
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,100
You have to promise me.

912
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,100
I know.

913
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,500
I'll ask him.

914
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,500
Hurry up.

915
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,500
If it's true.

916
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,600
I'll have to use the last plan.

917
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,000
I already planned it.

918
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,800
I have to go now.

919
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,500
Please take care of it.

920
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,300
Okay, Praew.

921
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:27,800
Bye bye.
