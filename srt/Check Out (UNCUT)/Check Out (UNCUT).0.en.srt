00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,000
Hello, welcome to The Air Khao yai

2
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,900
I’d like to check in, please.

3
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,500
You first.

4
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,000
Thank you

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,400
I thought the two of you came together because you checked in together.

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,400
Oh no, I didn't come with him.

7
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
Please give me your ID card.

8
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,200
This is your room key.

9
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,900
Thank you

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is your room key.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,100
Excuse me?

12
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,900
This is your room key.

13
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,800
You look at him and it makes me think you're sharing the same room with him.

14
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Sorry

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,000
I feel something

16
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,100
There seems to be a loud noise in the room.

17
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
Hello, mom!

18
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,500
I was taking a shower just now

19
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,900
You're there already, right?

20
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,500
Is everything okay?

21
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
It's very good, mom.

22
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,700
The resort is so beautiful.

23
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,900
The atmosphere is good too.

24
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,600
Where are your other friends?

25
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Why does your surroundings seem silent?

26
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,700
Oh! My other friends are in different rooms.

27
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,000
There are many people.

28
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,100
You don't have to worry about me.

29
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,600
Okay

30
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,400
Bye

31
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,200
You lied to your mom.

32
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,300
Be careful, your mother will know about it.

33
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,800
Hey! You!

34
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,900
Oh?

35
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,900
You know me so fast.

36
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,100
Huh?

37
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,100
My name is Nine

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
When you say 'You' it's right. (Homophones)

39
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,500
'Hey, you'

40
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,500
And you?

41
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,800
What's your name?

42
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,500
Do I need to tell you?

43
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,800
You're not my friend

44
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
It's up to you

45
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,400
If your mom calls you again, don't ask me for help.

46
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,400
Be careful, your mother knows that you lied.

47
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,900
My name is Daonuea

48
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,000
Goat, eat this.

49
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,400
Strange guy, he can talk to goats.

50
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
What a strange person

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,300
Hello, my name is Nine.

52
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,200
I am a goat caretaker at this resort.

53
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,300
I really like talking to goats!

54
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,000
Because the goats say 'baa~'

55
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,900
baa!

56
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,700
Hello~

57
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,200
Now we are at The Air Resort @ Khao Yai.

58
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,800
I want to say that the atmosphere and location here are good

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,100
and the staff are very helpful too!

60
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,100
They are famous for this!

61
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,700
But now we live in Moroc @ The Air.

62
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,800
Here

63
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,500
So let's go check out.

64
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,300
Bye bye!

65
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,500
I told you that our love was impossible.

66
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,200
I don't love you anymore, Praew.

67
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,000
Please Praew, can you leave me alone?

68
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,600
Hello, mom!

69
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,700
How are you? Is the weather good at Khao Yai?

70
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,700
Yes, mom!

71
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,700
You don't have to worry about me.

72
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,900
But where are your friends?

73
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,900
I can't hear your friend talking.

74
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,900
You didn't send me a photo too.

75
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,700
Nine!

76
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,800
My mother called me.

77
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,500
Please talk to my mother.

78
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,400
Otherwise my mom wouldn't believe me that I was actually on a trip with friends.

79
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
Hello, mom

80
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,800
I'm Nine

81
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,900
Nine...

82
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,900
Who's Nine?

83
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,000
Daonuea has a friend named Nine?

84
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,800
Why don't I know you?

85
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,500
I feel offended to you, mom

86
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Why can't you remember me?

87
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,900
I just didn't come to see you at home.

88
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,500
So you don't remember me?

89
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,500
It's okay

90
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,700
I might forget you because I'm old.

91
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,700
Please take care of Daonuea.

92
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
He's Allergic Rhinitis.

93
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,200
Don't forget to bring him an antihistamine.

94
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,200
Oh, I have one more thing to say.

95
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,300
Daonuea, he is not good with cold weather.

96
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,800
Don't turn on the air conditioner too cold.

97
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,300
Please take care of each other because both of you are in the same room.

98
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,400
Don't steal Daonuea's blanket.

99
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,700
Same room!?

100
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
Yes, mom

101
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,900
We are in the same room.

102
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,500
Don't worry, mom.

103
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,400
I'll take special care of Daonuea.

104
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,700
I will cover him with a blanket to warm himself.

105
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
Bye, mom

106
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,500
Bye

107
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,300
You talk like you're close to my mother.

108
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
You should say thank you to me first.

109
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,600
For helping you.

110
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,000
You ask for a debt of gratitude to me so well.

111
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,100
Okay

112
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,900
Thanks

113
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,000
But...

114
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,100
Why are you swimming alone?

115
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,600
Because I came alone.

116
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,900
So, why are you taking pictures up here?

117
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,400
I like to take pictures.

118
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,300
I like to keep memories

119
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,100
of happy times.

120
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Happiness?

121
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,100
Yes, happiness

122
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,600
Why?

123
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,600
Oh

124
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,700
No

125
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,700
Nothing

126
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,800
It's good that you're happy.

127
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,600
Why should we want to suffer?

128
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,700
Yes

129
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,600
Nine

130
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Let's swim together

131
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,600
Oh my god!

132
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,400
He took off his shirt and swam together.

133
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh!

134
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,600
Excuse me?

135
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,900
Can I order 4 cans of beer?

136
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,800
With pleasure, our guest

137
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,800
I ordered a beer

138
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,100
You want 4 cans of beer, right?

139
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,100
Yes

140
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,100
You want 4 cans of beer, right?

141
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,800
About 4, right?

142
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,600
Yes

143
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
About 4?

144
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,800
What is wrong with you?

145
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,000
Why do you look tensed?

146
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,500
Oh

147
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,600
I'm...

148
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,600
This water is cold.

149
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,600
It's cold.

150
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,700
So I tensed.

151
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,000
Do you think it would be better

152
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,400
if the sun would always shine?

153
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,600
Yeah

154
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Daonuea

155
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,300
Have you ever thought

156
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:50,300
that we can't always get what we want?

157
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,500
How is it?

158
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,000
It's like...

159
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,100
it's impossible for the good times to stay with us forever.

160
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,200
Just like the sun

161
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,700
which it has at sunrise

162
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
and sunset.

163
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Just like now

164
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
But actually,

165
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,600
it's beautiful at night.

166
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,000
Because there are stars in the sky

167
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,500
and moon light.

168
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,500
If you don't believe it,

169
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,200
you can see it tonight.

170
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
It won't be long.

171
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,100
There are no stars in the sky today.

172
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,200
That's disappointing.

173
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
But...

174
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,200
Why are you traveling alone?

175
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
I just broke up with my girlfriend,

176
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,300
so I need some time to relax myself.

177
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
What about you? Daonuea

178
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,900
Why are you traveling alone?

179
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,300
I'm...

180
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,300
I've just been disappointed with something.

181
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,900
It must be similar to you.

182
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,600
That's love

183
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,700
When we are happy,

184
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
we are happy.

185
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,500
When we are suffering,

186
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,500
it hurts.

187
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,300
Hey, you're shivering cold.

188
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,100
We should just stop here.

189
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
You'll be sick.

190
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,900
Yes?

191
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,300
Can I take a shower here?

192
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,200
The water in my bathroom is not working.

193
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,200
I called the front of the resort and no one answered.

194
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,100
Okay

195
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,100
but...

196
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,400
Let me take a shower before you.

197
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,400
Why can't we shower together?

198
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,600
So that it doesn't waste your time.

199
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Are you crazy?

200
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,600
Why do we have to shower together?

201
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,500
We're not that close.

202
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,600
What are you embarrassed about?

203
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,200
Or are you...?

204
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
you...

205
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,100
Okay!

206
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,300
I'm not embarrassed by you.

207
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,100
Please come in.

208
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,300
But...

209
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,900
why did you lie your mom about the trip?

210
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,700
Umm...

211
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,800
Actually, I don't want to lie to my mother.

212
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,200
I just don't want to stress my mom.

213
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,000
Maybe you don't want your mom to know

214
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,400
that you're heartbroken?

215
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,600
You know me so well.

216
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,500
You have a clairvoyant?

217
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,600
No

218
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,900
I can know, just by looking at you.

219
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,800
Your facial expressions are obvious.

220
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,600
Would you like to drink more beer?

221
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
If you don't drink it, I'm going to bed.

222
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,400
It's up to you.

223
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
I’m fine with either.

224
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
So...

225
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,000
That's enough for today.

226
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,800
Tomorrow I have to wake up to shoot video content.

227
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,100
Okay

228
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,100
I have no problem.

229
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,900
For tonight...

230
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,400
Good night

231
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
You just turn on the air conditioner at this temperature, that's enough.

232
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,800
It shouldn't be too cold.

233
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,900
Otherwise you might be sick.

234
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,000
Don't forget to take your antihistamine before you go to bed.

235
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,500
Are you ready?

236
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,400
What do you mean?

237
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,500
What?

238
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,800
You didn't say you were going to shoot a video?

239
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,300
Me

240
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
I'll go with you,

241
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
so you won't be lonely.

242
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,400
I didn't tell you that I was lonely.

243
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,400
Why did you wake up early today?

244
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,400
I usually wake up early.

245
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,600
Aren't you going to take your picture today?

246
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,400
I don't know what to shoot.

247
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,700
I don't know what I'm going to shoot.

248
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,800
Or... will you be my model?

249
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,100
My wages are expensive.

250
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,700
Do you know this?

251
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,100
You should hold me tight

252
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,300
If you're not careful, you'll get hurt.

253
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,800
Hello, today you guys meet Daonuea again.

254
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,600
Today we are still at The Air Resort.

255
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,400
This is a goat farm.

256
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Let's go to see it!

257
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,100
The goats here are said to be very cute.

258
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
We can easily feed them,

259
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,200
and they are so tame.

260
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,400
I recommend that if anyone comes to the Air Resort, you can play with goats.

261
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You can watch me play with them.

262
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,000
Hey, goat!

263
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:23,700
Oh

264
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,700
This way!

265
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,000
Here's your food, goat!

266
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,200
Goat!

267
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,000
Hey! Goat!

268
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,000
They're not tame at all.

269
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,700
I'll roast them all.

270
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,400
You can talk to goats too?

271
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,900
What?

272
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,900
You talk to goats too!

273
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,200
How do you know that I've talked to goats?

274
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,200
I'm...

275
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,200
That's day!

276
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,900
I happened to be riding a bicycle

277
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,100
and heard you were talking to a goat.

278
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,500
Are you sure you're just a coincidence?

279
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,500
We should go back.

280
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,300
It's raining now.

281
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,000
Hello, my guest!

282
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,400
There's a BBQ party tonight.

283
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,100
It's free, free, and free!

284
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,500
I invite you both.

285
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,000
Okay!

286
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,400
You guys look good together.

287
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,500
Oh, I'm so pleased

288
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,900
Bye bye~!

289
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,900
Let's go

290
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,000
Have you finished dressing yet?

291
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,000
We go to dinner,

292
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
not a fashion walk.

293
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,500
No, I'm afraid I'm not handsome.

294
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,000
It's a special occasion,

295
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,100
I should honor the resort.

296
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,200
It's up to you.

297
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,100
I'm sorry

298
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,600
I didn't mean to do it.

299
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,600
Let's go

300
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
I'm ready now.

301
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,100
Is he bipolar?

302
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,400
What did you say?

303
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,200
Oh, no

304
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Nothing

305
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,500
I would say that your perfume...

306
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,100
smells good.

307
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Do you like this scent?

308
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,200
You can smell it,

309
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,300
in case you can't smell it clearly.

310
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,200
We have to go now.

311
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,100
If we go late, there will be no food left.

312
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,300
Have you finished yet?

313
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,300
They've been waiting for a long time.

314
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,400
I feel embarrassed.

315
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,400
Go

316
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,300
What are you embarrassed about?

317
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,900
Hey! Our guest!

318
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,000
Hey, do you think our guests are handsome?

319
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,900
Welcome

320
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,600
The party has just begun.

321
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
Welcome

322
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,100
I will introduce you to your neighbors.

323
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,900
Please come this way.

324
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,400
They are your neighbors.

325
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,100
Hey guys, are my guests handsome?

326
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,800
Yes

327
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Hey, his head is red,

328
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,000
is it blood?

329
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Excuse me.

330
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,800
Please come to this way.

331
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,800
Please sit here.

332
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,600
Please take care of them.

333
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,300
My pleasure

334
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,300
I'll be serving drinks in a moment.

335
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,400
Yeah, thank you

336
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,400
Hello

337
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,500
Well

338
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,000
What zone are you guys in?

339
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,400
Today I'm in Morocco 2.

340
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,800
Did the two of you come together?

341
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:50,900
Oh

342
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,000
We didn't come together.

343
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah

344
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,400
Our tents are next to each other.

345
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,200
Let's eat

346
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,000
