I want to get back together with him.

Please, Daonuea.

6
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,100
We should go back to being friends.

7
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,400
We can be partners as before.

8
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,300
So we don't have an uncomfortable relationship like this.

I'm sorry.

My problem was not solved,

At least it's good for both of us.

you're just a selfish person

Last time, it took you a long time to complete the work.

It takes time to find inspiration, you know?

171
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,000
Last time, you almost didn't make it in time.

172

You did it on the last day.

I will continue to work.

348
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,300
Let me check the picture.

349
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,300
Wait, Nine.

350
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,000
Here.

351
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,100
It's not bad.

352
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,100
I think we should add a little more light.

353
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,700
More light?

354
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,500
I think it's okay now.

355
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,500
I think we should stop here.

356
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,300
Let's eat.

357
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,100
Please.

358
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,100
Hey.

359
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,900
Why are you hungry when you just sit?

360
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,900
The food smells good...

361
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,400
My papaya salad.

362
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Can you bear it?

363
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,600
Well.

364
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
You can take a break.

365
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,800
Really?

366
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,800
I'll do it later.

367
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,800
I'll eat first.

368
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,800
Ouch!

369
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,100
Sorry, bro.

370
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,000
I'll eat now.

371
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,600
Wow.

372
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,100
Come here, Boat.

373
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,100
I prepared all for you.

374
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,900
It's all my favorites, Tee.

375
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,800
Sausage.

376
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,100
Hey.

377
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Yeah, Nine.

378
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Please.

379
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,300
Are you done?

380
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,800
Yeah.

381
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,600
Here.

382
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Eat well, dude.

383
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,500
They say this restaurant is really delicious.

384
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,200
Thank you.

385
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,700
It's Boat's favorite restaurant.

386
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,500
Uh...

387
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,000
Is there anything that isn't spicy?

388
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It seemed only to contain spicy food.

389
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,000
Oh.

390
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I totally forgot.

391
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,700
You don't eat spicy food, right?

392
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,800
What?

393
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,800
Why didn't you tell me that you can't eat spicy food?

394
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,500
Send it to me, I'll change the plate for you.

395
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,000
It's alright.

396
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,600
I can eat it.

397
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,600
It's not a big deal.

398
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,900
I don't want someone telling me I'm picky.

399
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,100
Hey!

400
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,900
I don't mean that.

401
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,300
Well then, thank you

402
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,800
for your good wishes.

403
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,300
Why do you have to speak sarcastically to me?

404
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,700
I just want to help you.

405
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,500
Oh.

406
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,100
Hey!

407
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,000
Is it what I think?

408
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,300
Am I right?

409
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,400
Or not?

410
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,100
Right?

411
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,000
Not?

412
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,100
'Not' what?, Boat?

413
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Uh...

414
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,500
Is this a papaya salad?

415
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,700
Or is it grapefruit?

416
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,300
Eggplant, cucumber,

417
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,300
kaffir lime, lime, coconut, grapefruit.

418
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Let's continue to eat.

419
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,800
It's all delicious.

420
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,700
Let's eat sausage.

421
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,500
Come on, I'll feed you.

422
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,500
Hurry up.

423
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,200
Eat it.

424
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,600
Candy!

425
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Candy!

426
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,300
Yeah.

427
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Are you wondering if Nine is cheating on me?

428
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,500
I don't know.

429
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,400
You should trust Nine, shouldn't you?

430
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,200
Don't you feel something strange?

431
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,100
He's not answering my calls lately.

432
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,200
He didn't reply to my messages at all.

433
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,700
Yesterday, he was annoyed with something when he returned home.

434
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,300
I think you know that working on set is busy.

435
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,500
You know I work on the set,

436
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,000
you think I have time for Nine?

437
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,300
Huh?

438
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,400
The situation is not the same.

439
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,800
You are an actress and Nine is a photographer.

440
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
He may not have as much free time as you.

441
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,100
Candy.

442
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,000
Whose team are you on?

443
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That's right!

444
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,900
Of course, I'm on the same team as my best friend like you.

445
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,700
He must definitely cheat on you!

446
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,500
He must be secretly dating someone behind your back!

447
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,100
If I knew who it was,

448
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,000
I would slap her.

449
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,700
Hey.

450
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,300
Don't do it, you'll break the law of bodily harm.

451
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,400
Whose team are you on?

452
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,900
Whose hashtag team are you using?

453
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,000
Oh.

454
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,600
I will slap her with you.

455
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,300
I will slap her like this.

456
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,800
How do I know who Nine is talking to?

457
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
Ouch!

458
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,699
Just ask him directly,

459
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:11,400
he will definitely answer you.

460
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,600
I asked you a third time.

461
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,400
Okay.

462
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,100
I'll find out for you.

463
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,000
Hey.

464
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,400
Please find that person for me.

465
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
I want to know.

466
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,900
I knew it!

467
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,500
Otherwise, she wouldn't have chosen me.

468
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,000
She wants to use me to spy for her.

469
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,100
What do you say?

470
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,199
Nothing!

471
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,300
I am watching a movie.

472
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,000
This is a detective film.

473
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,800
I'm preparing to investigate.

474
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,199
Where is Nine?

475
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,000
Are you cheating on your girlfriend?

476
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,900
I will slap you!

477
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,600
How is it?

478
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,900
I'm always screwed.

479
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,600
I suddenly became a detective.

480
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,300
It's been driving me crazy.

481
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,700
I didn't look, but I heard you.

482
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,900
I practiced as a detective.

483
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,400
Are you cheating on her?

484
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,400
Where is Nine?

485
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:22,700
[Lodestar Production]

486
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,500
It's here.

487
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,000
The pajamas...

488
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,700
you gave me from the beginning when we started working.

489
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,900
I haven't used it yet.

490
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,700
I think I'll be working overnight here.

491
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,800
But I back home every time.

492
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,200
Here.

493
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,500
Why did you send it to me?

494
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,500
Huh?

495
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,300
You messed up Nine's shirts.

496
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,600
You should be responsible for your actions.

497
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,900
But, Tee!

498
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I'm not the one who messed up his shirt!

499
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,600
The dish was spilled on him.

500
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,600
Daonuea.

501
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,500
I love you, Daonuea.

502
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,800
But you should take it to Nine.

503
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,600
You want him to wear a shirt that smells of fermented fish?

504
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,500
It doesn't stink at all.

505
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,800
You, me and Boat like it.

506
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,800
But when working, won't we stink?

507
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,500
But it's the pajamas I gave you.

508
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
I don't want other people to use it.

509
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,000
But now there are no other clothes.

510
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,300
Do you want him to wear my shirt?

511
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,600
Alright.

512
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,300
Okay.

513
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,500
But I won't bring it to him.

514
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,100
Can you bring it to him instead of me?

515
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,100
Please apologize to him on my behalf.

516
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,800
I know, you hate Nine.

517
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,200
But at least

518
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,700
he helped work

519
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,800
and find customers for us.

520
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,300
So...

521
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,200
please bring it to Nine.

522
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
My beloved.

523
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,100
Hey.

524
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,700
Why are you taking off all your clothes?

525
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,500
So what?

526
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,400
Hey!

527
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,500
Are you not used to it yet?

528
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,700
Huh?

529
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,900
What do you mean?

530
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,200
I think you will get used to it.

531
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
No way.

532
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,000
You've been teasing me all day.

533
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,900
Aren't you going to apologize to me?

534
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,300
What do you mean?

535
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,100
You told me to arrange the props to make me feel confused too.

536
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,200
It's all because of you.

537
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,800
And papaya salad too.

538
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,200
You intentionally spilled it, right?

539
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,400
If you don't apologize to me,

540
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,700
I'll have to use force.

541
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,000
Stop, Nine.

542
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,800
I'm sorry.

543
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,600
Isn't this the necklace that Tee gave you?

544
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,300
What does it mean?

545
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,500
I get back together with Tee now.

546
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,100
Since when?

547
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,700
Yesterday.

548
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,900
I don't believe you.

549
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,700
You are not like people who have feelings for each other.

550
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,700
Huh?

551
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,900
Why do we have to make you believe?

552
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,200
(Sound of knocking on the door)

553
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,000
Nine!

554
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,000
Nine!

555
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,200
I'm almost done! Wait a minute!

556
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,400
Nine!

557
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,400
I want to use the bathroom now!

558
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:43,900
Ouch!

559
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,300
Ouch!

560
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,300
Have you finished your shower yet?

561
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,000
I can't take it anymore.

562
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,900
I don't want it to happen again.

563
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,300
Nine!

564
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,900
I know.

565
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,600
I'm almost done, wait a minute.

566
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,800
Nine!

567
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,500
Nine!

568
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,000
Nine!

569
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,600
Nine!

570
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,400
I can't take it anymore.

571
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,100
I really can't take it anymore.

572
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,500
Nine!

573
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,500
Ouch!

574
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,300
Please.

575
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,100
Okay.

576
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,200
I'm done.

577
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,500
How are the pictures I took?

578
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,900
It's good.

579
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,500
You are good.

580
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,200
You too.

581
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,800
This is another set.

582
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,700
Tee.

583
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,000
What are you taking?

584
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,300
Nothing.

585
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,500
I'm just taking pictures of the working atmosphere.

586
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,200
For the company profile.

587
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,100
For the credibility of the company.

588
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,800
How does it look believable?

589
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,700
I'm wearing pajamas.

590
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,100
Look at this.

591
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,300
It's too cute.

592
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,700
It looks unprofessional.

593
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,300
Come on!

594
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,300
I think your look isn't bad.

595
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,800
Hey.

596
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,400
I told you to stop.

597
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,800
If you don't stop, I won't work.

598
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,200
Alright.

599
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,500
I'm not taking pictures anymore.

600
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Dude.

601
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,300
I'm not taking pictures now.

602
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,300
I will delete it.

603
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,600
What are you taking? Daonuea.

604
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,600
Yeah.

605
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,400
What are you taking?

606
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,700
Uh...

607
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,500
I'm filming the behind the scenes of the two of you.

608
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,400
Handle it.

609
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,300
Stop it.

610
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,900
If this picture was published,

611
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,600
I would definitely be teased by my friends.

612
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,600
Send it to me.

613
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,900
Daonuea.

614
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,900
I should have posted it on Instagram.

615
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,700
Stop!

616
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,100
Behind the scenes of Nine and Tee.

617
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,100
Lodestar's lover.

618
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,900
Share it!

619
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,900
Let's go, bro!

620
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,100
Stop.

621
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,700
Let's continue work now.

622
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,400
Uh...

623
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Yes.

624
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,100
Stop and continue working.

625
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,800
You talking to me, right?

626
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,000
Sorry, bro.

627
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,100
This bastard.

628
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,600
Tee! My phone!

629
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,400
(Aren't we like people who have feelings for each other?)

630
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,900
(So...)

631
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,700
(others don't believe in our relationship)

632
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
(Ouch!)

633
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,200
(I've never stressed about this before)

634
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,200
Tee.

635
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,400
I'll back home now.

636
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,600
I will continue to work at home.

637
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,500
Okay.

638
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,000
Good bye.

639
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,700
Ouch!

640
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,000
Ouch!

641
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,800
Daonuea.

642
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,800
Go back to your home!

643
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,200
What do you do?

644
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'll back now. Bye.

645
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,700
Good bye.

646
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,300
Nine.

647
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,500
What's wrong with him?

648
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,000
Why was he suddenly depressed?

649
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
You didn't let him work too hard today, right?

650
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,500
Hey.

651
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,600
I didn't give him too much work.

652
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,500
I just had him retouch the picture.

653
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,300
Okay.

654
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,400
Please be patient if he says he's tired.

655
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,200
He's a talented but he needs a little improvement.

656
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,200
Okay.

657
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,400
We have to wait.

658
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,800
Uh...

659
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,000
Do I have to give you pajamas back?

660
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,600
I can take my shirt home.

661
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,600
It's okay.

662
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,000
You can wash it back to me later.

663
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,900
It was the pajamas that Daonuea bought for me.

664
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,300
You're very lucky

665
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,400
to be wearing new pajamas.

666
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,500
Tee.

667
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,600
I don't think

668
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,300
you need to bring it back to me.

669
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,900
I can give you this pajamas.

670
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,200
This pajamas...

671
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,100
looks perfect on you.

672
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,000
Okay.

673
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,400
Thank you so much.

674
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,300
Tee.

675
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,200
Should we back home now?

676
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,100
I finished work.

677
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,000
If nothing else, I'll work a little longer and be back.

678
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,400
Then...you can go back first.

679
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,600
It's fine.

680
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,200
You can go back first.

681
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,300
I'll turn off the lights.

682
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,300
No, you can back home now.

683
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,400
Okay.

684
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,900
I've changed my mind.

685
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,500
I will be here for a long time.

686
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,300
What's wrong with you?

687
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,600
You speak unreliably.

688
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,800
Calm down.

689
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,200
Don't be fight.

690
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,200
What's going on? Candy.

691
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,000
[Retro Bar & Café]

692
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,800
I ordered alcohol for you.

693
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,500
Why are you drinking alone these days?

694
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,900
Aren't you bringing your boyfriend with you?

695
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,400
Oh?

696
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,900
You really hit the spot.

697
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,100
If I had a boyfriend, I would stay at my boyfriend's house now.

698
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,800
Why are you calling me?

699
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,100
Or you just lonely?

700
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Of course!

701
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,000
Do you know what your girlfriend did to me today?

702
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,100
Huh?

703
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,000
What did Praew do to you?

704
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,800
Calm down.

705
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,800
It's not a big deal.

706
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,900
She just wants me to monitor you 24 hours a day

707
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,200
and report it to her.

708
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,800
Monitor me 24 hours?

709
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,000
What's wrong with her?

710
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,300
She wasn't like this before.

711
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,100
Exactly.

712
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,800
You must have caused some trouble for sure.

713
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,600
Otherwise, she wouldn't be this stressed out.

714
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,900
Fortunately, today she has a drama filming.

715
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,300
Otherwise, she's definitely coming with me.

716
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,100
I don't know.

717
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,200
Or maybe I could do it.

718
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,900
Why do you do that?

719
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,500
I'm just...

720
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,300
meeting someone I have good feelings for.

721
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Well.

722
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,000
Your life is yours.

723
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,600
You can do whatever you want.

724
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,000
But you should care about the feelings of those around you.

725
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,300
Otherwise, the person who feels regret is the people around you.

726
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:31,800
It's true.

727
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,000
Yeah.

728
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,400
There's no one like you.

729
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,200
Even if Praew behaves badly to you, you still forgive her.

730
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,700
I respect your kindness.

731
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,600
If she doesn't have me

732
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,500
and you leave her,

733
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,100
who else is beside her?

734
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,400
I can't leave her.

735
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,200
Hey!

736
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,000
It's not the time for us to be sad.

737
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,700
Let's cheers.

738
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,400
Bottoms up!

739
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,400
Drink it all.

740
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,900
One shot.

741
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:15,400
It's bitter.

742
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,500
I'll eat it.

743
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,100
Tee.

744
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,900
Let's just stop here today.

745
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,200
I'm not ready.

746
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,000
After work done, okay?

747
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,600
It's okay.

748
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,100
Okay, next time.

749
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,000
Open the file.

750
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,000
File?

751
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Wait a moment.

752
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:10,900
Here.

753
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,300
Why the tone of this image is yellow?

754
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,700
Did you see that the product is silver?

755
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,700
Okay, bro.

756
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,200
I'll check one more set.

757
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,300
Here.

758
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:23,800
Umm.

759
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,100
It's better.

760
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,800
Okay, bro.

761
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,400
Then, let's check one more picture.

762
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,400
I think this composition is okay.

763
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,900
Tee.

764
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,700
I think this font is cuter.

765
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,400
Really?

766
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,300
Yes.

767
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,300
But I think...

768
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,500
Daonuea is cuter.

769
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,900
Focus on your work!

770
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,600
Okay.

771
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,500
Honestly, I think this font is too weird.

772
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,100
It's like you're telling a ghost story.

773
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,700
Where is it weird?

774
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,000
It's so weird.

775
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,400
Its color is like blood.

776
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,300
It's cute.

777
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:22,700
Hey.

778
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,300
I won't work if you don't focus on work.

779
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,300
Okay.

780
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,200
This one?

781
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,400
Yeah.

782
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,100
The colors look a bit contrasting.

783
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,400
I think it looks okay.

784
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,700
If so, I'd choose this one.

785
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,200
Okay.

786

Excuse me.

788

Here is an example of a brand poster based on the mood and tone you want.

789
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,700
Excuse me.

This is a 15 second vertical and 30 second horizontal video we shot.

791
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,200
More importantly,

792
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:35,400
if you post photos and videos on Instagram and target teenagers

793
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,200
it will quite increase your sales.

794
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,700
Okay.

795
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:41,800

From the pack shots and videos you guys made,

797

Sure.

805
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,300
Nine, you should use the golden formulations.

806
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,200
It suits you very well.

807
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,100
It's the same formula, right?

808
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,500
Yes, it's anti-aging formulas.

809
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,100
For Tee, you should use the silver formulations.

810
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:12,600
Yes.

811
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,200

00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,300
Sure.

870
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,000
Let's drink alcohol this evening.

871
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,000
al?

872
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,500
Alcohol wow alcohol.

873
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,300
Why?

874
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,700
I've only been sitting around for many days.

875
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,500
I want to unlock it.

876
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:46,700
Huh?

877
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:47,900
You guys don't want to have fun with me?

878
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,500
I'll wait and see.

879
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,500
You can keep an eye on me.

880
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,000
One more.

881
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,100
Wow, everybody!

882
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,900
Soju is here!

883
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,700
Tee.

884
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,600
Those three bottles are all gone?

885
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,900
Yes.

886
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,200
Fortunately, I brought a lot of it.

887
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,700
It's already enough.

888
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It's not enough, bro.

889
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,600
Come on.

890
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,300
Here.

891
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,100
Okay.

892
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,000
Daonuea.

893
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,400
No.

894
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,200
I don't want it.

895
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,300
Don't you want some?

896
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,600
No.

897
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,700
I'll get some more BBQ.

898
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,200
Boat.

899
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,200
You do it.

900
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,800
May I toast it with you?

901
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,400
What are you doing here?

902
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,400
I will do it for you.

903
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,400
Send it to me.

904
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,300
You should drink soju with other.

905
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,400
I'll bring it to you.

906
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,500
Can't you see that it's hot?

907
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,900
I'll bring it to you.

908
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,100
Hey.

909
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,100
It's alright.

910
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:15,300
If you're near me, your shirt might get dirty like papaya salad.

911
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,500
So, go sit there.

912
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,000
Okay.

913
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,900
I'll help you pick up.

914
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,200
Hey.

915
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,200
Why do you want to be near me?

916
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,700
I know.

917
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,300
You like me.

918
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,400
But sorry,

919
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,600
I already have someone.

920
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,000
And he sat there.

921
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,100
Who wants to be near you?

922
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,700
I'm afraid the barbecue will burn.

923
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,600
You're so stubborn.

924
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,500
Really?

925
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,400
Who is the real stubborn one?

926
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:00,900
Huh?

927
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,400
Huh?

928
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,300
Where?

929
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,600
Here.

930
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,400
Did something happen?

931
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,500
Nothing.

932
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,700
I'm afraid the barbecue will burn.

933
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,700
I'm also afraid someone will make a fire.

934
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,500
Tee.

935
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,000
I didn't make any fires.

936
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:24,000
Someone is too paranoid.

937
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,200
Alright.

938
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,400
Wait a minute, I'll help you.

939
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,000
Take it all.

940
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,100
Alright, I'll help you hold the plate.

941
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:34,900
Alright.

942
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,000
This one too.

943
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,000
Okay.

944
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:39,500
Okay.

945
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:40,400
Hey.

946
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:41,800
We got all.

947
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,900
Let's eat.

948
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,100
Okay.

949
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,600
Leave someone toasting alone.

950
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,000
Let's go.

951
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:50,600
Go.

952
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,400
Let's cheers.

953
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,500
Cheers!

954
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:51,100
Cheers!

955
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,300
I'll drink the whole bottle.

956
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:55,900
Hey?

957
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,900
Why are you drinking so much?

958
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,900
You may die!

959
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,100
Hey.

960
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,800
How am I?

961
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,800
I'm the real one.

962
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,500
I have given up.

963
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,600
I can't take it anymore.

964
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,500
Hey!

965
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,400
As expected.

966
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,700
Stop!

967
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,700
- I'll...
- I'll help you.

968
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,400
You go there.

969
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:29,700
- Stop.
- I'll help him.

970
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Stop!

971
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,500
I'll help him.

972
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:35,900
You can rest.

973
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:42,600
Boat.

974
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,100
Put your arms around my neck.

975
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:47,900
Daonuea.

976
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,200
1,2,3.

977
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,500
Bye.

978
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,400
Uh.

979
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,100
Huh?

980
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,300
Can I ask you something?

981
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,400
How are you these days?

982
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,300
Are you okay with my company?

983
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,900
It's not bad.

984
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:20,200
I'm glad that I can took a picture.

985
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,200
It's too boring to be at home.

986
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:27,700
Great.

987
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,300
I will be close to you again.

988
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,300
After graduating, where did you go?

989
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,800
I can't contact you.

990
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,700
You didn't even come to our reunion.

991
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,800
I just keep traveling.

992
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,700
I'm resting.

993
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,700
I look at nature.

994
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,800
I keep looking for something.

995
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,900
But I don't have any goals.

996
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,300
I just live life day by day.

997
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,900
It's great.

998
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,400
You have seen the wide world.

999
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,000
Hey.

1000
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:19,200
But I'm alone everywhere.

1001
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,100
Sometimes I go on trips with friends.

1002
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,900
Sometimes I travel with someone I'm seeing.

1003
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:30,900
I still haven't been able to find someone who is compatible with me.

1004
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:37,200
Someday you will meet that person.

1005
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,100
You just open up to love.

1006
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,500
That's right.

1007
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,600
I have something to tell you.

1008
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,500
I'm afraid you feel like a third wheel.

1009
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,900
Me and Daonuea are getting back together.

1010
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,100
Yeah.

1011
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,100
I know.

1012
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,100
I knew from the moment I saw the two of you together.

1013
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:06,900
Hold on.

1014
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,500
You always knew?

1015
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,000
Yes.

1016
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,800
I think I have a little sense.

1017
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,300
Are you okay with it?

1018
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:23,800
With this situation.

1019
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,700
I'm okay with everything.

1020
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:35,600
But don't let the person in your care irritate me.

1021
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,300
How long is your relationship with you and Daonuea?

1022
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,000
Actually, we've had feelings for each other before.

1023
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,700
But it's over.

1024
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,600
Because of my badness.

1025
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,700
Now I only look at him sincerely.

1026
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,100
I was afraid that someone would take him away from me.

1027
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,100
But, well.

1028
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,600
I feel that he is not the same.

1029
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:18,900
Hey.

1030
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,900
Of course, humans can change.

1031
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,200
Humans have to grow every day.

1032
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,300
Yeah.

1033
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,000
You're right.

1034
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,700
That's right!

1035
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,400
My friend.

1036
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,900
If you're annoyed Daonuea,

1037
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,100
just tell me.

1038
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,100
Don't respond to him.

1039
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,800
I beg you.

1040
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,000
For the peace of our company.

1041
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,300
Please?

1042
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,600
What?

1043
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Pinky swear?

1044
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Yes!

1045
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,200
A promise.

1046
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:15,100
See?

1047
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,200
Huh?

1048
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:23,800
Hey.

1049
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,100
Why are you so easily drunk without change?

1050
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,200
Tee!

1051
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,000
Hey!

1052
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:32,800
Tee!

1053
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,000
Hey.

1054
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,300
You bastard.

1055
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:52,600
Hey!

1056
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:54,700
Ouch!

1057
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,100
I want to say something to you.

1058
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,600
What's wrong with you?

1059
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,100
You can talk to me nicely.

1060
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,100
Why do you have to bring me here?

1061
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:04,800
I don't know.

1062
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,800
I just wanted to ask to be sure.

1063
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,800
What?

1064
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,300
You don't have any feelings for me, right?

1065
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,200
I don't understand what you mean.

1066
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,000
But I don't have any feelings for you anymore.

1067
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,300
Are you sure?

1068
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,100
How can I believe you?

1069
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,000
Ouch!

1070
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,300
What the hell are you doing?

1071
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,300
I'm getting back together with Tee now.

1072
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,100
It was a substitute for his feelings that he gave me.

1073
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:40,600
Yes!

1074
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:41,800
I know.

1075
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,500
Let's separate lives.

1076
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:52,400
You already have your girlfriend.

1077
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,300
Why do you have to do this to me?

1078
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,000
You don't have feelings for Tee.

1079
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,300
Don't fool yourself.
