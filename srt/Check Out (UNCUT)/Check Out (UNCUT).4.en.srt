00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,400
Let's cheers!

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,200
Cheers!

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,400
Cheers!

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,100
I'll drink the whole bottle.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,900
Hey?

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,900
Why are you drinking so much?

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,100
You may die!

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,100
Oh...

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,900
How am I?

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,900
I'm the real one.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,500
I have given up.

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,600
I can't take it anymore.

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,300
Hey!

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,400
As expected.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,700
Stop!

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,600
- Stop.
- I'll help him.

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,500
Stop!

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll help him.

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
You can rest.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,200
Boat.

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,700
Put your arms around my neck.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,500
Daonuea.

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,900
1,2,3.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,100
Bye.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,700
Ouch!

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,400
You can go in first.

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,700
I'm not drunk, bro.

29
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,400
Step up.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,300
What do you mean? Not drunk.

31
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,900
I'm not drunk.

32
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,600
Walk properly, please!

33
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,500
Be careful. Step up.

34
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,300
Be careful of tripping.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,600
Here?

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,200
Yes!

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,400
Sit here.

38
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,400
Hey!

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,700
You slither like a snake.

40
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,200
I saw you, today.

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,200
You and Nine are together in the bathroom...

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,100
Stop!

43
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,600
You're too drunk.

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,900
Huh?

45
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,300
I said what I saw.

46
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,600
Everyone thinks that way

47
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,300
when they see you guys together.

48
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
It's not true.

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,300
I feel sorry for Tee.

50
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,900
Nine didn't know

51
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,900
that you

52
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,900
and Tee

53
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,900
were back together?

54
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,800
You should make it more clear.

55
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
More clear.

56
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,700
I really

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,900
didn't make it as clear as he said.

58
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,000
You're always drunk.

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,600
I have to take care of you every time.

60
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,400
But...

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,399
thank you.

62
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,700
Hey!

63
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,300
Who are you?

64
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't tell me...

65
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,000
You!

66
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,300
Nine!

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,700
Are you teasing me?

68
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,800
Just now, I accidentally bumped into the light switch.

69
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,500
- Ouch!
- Hey!

70
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,800
What are you doing?

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,700
Ouch...

72
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,400
Oh.

73
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,800
Your arm is bruised.

74
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,700
Just stand here.

75
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,300
Come here.

76
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,600
Move to the left.

77
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,600
Rearward.

78
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,200
Sit here.

79
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,400
Just wait for me here.

80
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,100
I'll bring an ice pack for you.

81
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,200
Okay.

82
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,900
Hey.

83
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,400
Don't move!

84
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,200
Otherwise your arm will be even more bruised.

85
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,200
It's cold.

86
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,200
It's really cold.

87
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
Would you like to try it?

88
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,200
Ouch!

89
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,000
Hey!

90
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,700
Stop, Nine.

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,000
If you're okay and pretend to hurt,

92
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,800
I'm going to be with Tee now.

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
I don't know if he's drunk and fell asleep.

94
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,900
That's right.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,600
Huh?

96
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,500
What is this?

97
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,200
Then...

98
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,600
if you're okay,

99
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,500
I'll go now.

100
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,200
Ouch...

101
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,900
Do you know that you are drunk?

102
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,700
Let me go!

103
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,200
You don't let me back home?

104
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,700
Daonuea.

105
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,400
Please don't date with Tee, can you?

106
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,700
What the hell are you saying?

107
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,200
Please.

108
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,900
Don't date with Tee, please.

109
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,200
Why?

110
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,500
Why can't I date with him?

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Please give me a chance.

112
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,700
I

113
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,000
don't want to wait for you anymore.

114
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,100
It took too long for me.

115
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,100
In the past,

116
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
the person who didn't contact me was you.

117
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,600
You didn't even reply to my messages.

118
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,200
You make me wonder what happened to you.

119
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,500
What you did

120
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
was fair to me?

121
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,900
You approach me when you want

122
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
and leave me when you want too.

123
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I wouldn't dare to put my life in your hands.

124
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,500
Well.

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,100
From now on,

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,500
I will prove to you

127
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,700
that what you think about me is wrong.

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,200
Why don't you drink in moderation? Huh?

129
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,600
[Lodestar Production]

130
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,000
Watch your step.

131
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,800
I called a taxicab already.

132
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
I think they have arrived.

133
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,400
Nine.

134
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,900
Huh?

135
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,100
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,200
Usually, it's Boat's duty.

137
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,700
I didn't know he slept deeply when he was drunk.

138
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,100
It's okay.

139
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
Daonuea.

140
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,600
For that...

141
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,100
are you okay with it, right?

142
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,700
For me to...

143
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,700
I don't want to endure with the confusion.

144
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,900
It's...

145
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,300
very painful...

146
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,400
I think we should stop it.

147
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,200
Aren't you giving me any chance?

148
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,200
Please don't think I'm mean to you,

149
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,700
but I've decided.

150
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,800
I will not change this decision again.

151
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,600
No matter what happens.

152
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
And you...

153
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,800
can let Tee go.

154
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,100
The car has arrived.

155
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,700
I can walk to the car, it's not far.

156
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,000
Let him go.

157
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,000
Are you sure?

158
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,900
Yes!

159
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,500
I'll go now.

160
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
See you tomorrow.

161
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,500
Tee.

162
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,900
Hold yourself properly.

163
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,200
Ouch...

164
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,500
Ouch!

165
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:15,900
Ouch!

166
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,800
Hold on.

167
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,200
Lower your head.

168
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,600
Ouch!

169
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,700
Go inside!

170
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,000
Ouch...

171
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,000
Good bye, Nine.

172
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Drive, please!

173
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,900
Ouch...

174
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,500
Ouch...

175
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,600
Hey, be careful.

176
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,500
You're in bed now, Tee.

177
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Be careful.

178
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500

00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,100
Let's do this, Boat.

353
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,100
Okay, bro.

354
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,200
Okay? Tee.

355
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,700
Hello, Nine.

356
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
You've been missing for several days.

357
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,300
Are you hangover?

358
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,500
Oh, Nine.

359
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,200
Why are you missing so many days?

360
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,600
Are you busy these days?

361
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,300
Then I'll bring you coffee.

362
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,700
Nothing.

363
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,600
I've cleared something up.

364
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,500
What are you guys doing?

365
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,400
Oh!

366
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,300
A brand contacted us to do a promotional advertisement.

367
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,600
They are a cosmetic brand.

368
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,200
Now we have finalized the concept for them.

369
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,600
I think we'll start shooting right away.

370
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:19,800
Okay.

371
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,700
I will help you tomorrow.

372
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,100
Uh...

373
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,100
I'm not sure about that.

374
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,600
I think Daonuea has contacted the camera team.

375
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,500
Wait.

376
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,900
Didn't anyone tell me anything?

377
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,500
You didn't come to the office at all.

378
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,500
What do you want me to do?

379
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,700
I don't want to bother you.

380
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,600
So I contacted another team.

381
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,000
At least,

382
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,000
you should call me.

383
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,000
For group chats,

384
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,400
why did you create them?

385
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,200
No one told me anything.

386
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm...

387
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
in a hurry.

388
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,200
I have to quickly confirm many things.

389
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So I didn't tell you.

390
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
I'm sorry.

391
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,400
You can wait for the next project.

392
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,300
Okay.

393
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,500
I'm an outsider.

394
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,700
You can tell me on the last day.

395
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,300
Gosh...

396
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,700
We have a problem.

397
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,300
It's okay.

398
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,200
Why is he so sensitive?

399
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,600
Wouldn't he feel sad?

400
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,400
He helped our company in many ways.

401
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
We should consult with him.

402
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,000
But we should trust our thoughts.

403
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,600
Not only him.

404
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,100
You treat like Nine is everything for you.

405
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,000
Nine sincerely wants to help us.

406
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,700
He made it work harder.

407
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,000
Come on.

408
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,600
I'm going to tell Nine that you've apologized to him.

409
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,100
Hey.

410
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,100
Stop!

411
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,200
I don't want to apologize to him.

412
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,100
Daonuea.

413
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,200
In the future, we have to work together.

414
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,800
If this work has problems,

415
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,700
what about future work?

416
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,800
The quarrel

417
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,600
made us feel awkward.

418
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,300
You're right.

419
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,500
Okay.

420
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,500
So

421
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
I'll make coffee for him.

422
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,700
Okay.

423
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,300
What are you waiting for?

424
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,700
You can go now!

425
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,300
Okay.

426
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,000
I'll make coffee now.

427
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,700
Okay.

428
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
Why? Tee.

429
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,699
Today's weather is so hot that it makes us feel irritated,

430
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,400
don't you think so?

431
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,400
Here.

432
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,400
Daonuea gave this as an apology.

433
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,699
He didn't want to mean that.

434
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Thank you.

435
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,300
For this work, you just watch it.

436

If anything happens, you can help us.

437
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,000
It's also my fault

438
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,000
for not asking you.

439
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,900
I'm busy with work.

440
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,000
Yeah.

441
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,300
I'm okay now.

442
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
It's tasty.

443
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,000
It made me forget about the previous one.

444
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,800
That's right! My friend.

445
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,400
Congratulations.

446
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,200
What do you mean?

447
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,300
It's...

448
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,700
because you were dating Daonuea.

449
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,900
Oh...

450
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,600
I didn't expect it at all.

451
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,300
It is what love is.

452
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,900
It will come when you don't expect it.

Are you giving me tips?

What do you mean? Tee.

455
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:43,100
You gave me some love tips in the old days.

456
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,900
But I think now I have to give you some tips.

457

You're extraordinary now.

458

Huh?

459
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,100
What?

460
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,200
Don't worry, dude.

What are you doing?

464
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,600
Just stay still.

Daonuea.

466
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,200
I just washed my face.

467
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,300
How can I apply it?

468
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,100
It says it can be used both day and night.

469
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,500
So I applied for you.

470
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,500
Will it really be okay?

471
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,800
It's fine.

00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,800
Look at their branding.

It's from Asoke Skin Hospital.

It's not a typical OEM factory.

It guarantees in terms of quality.

In the meantime, apply it while waiting for the customer.

It's not time to start the meeting.

Please take a seat.

She saw it all.

495
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,900
Why don't you hide under the table?

496
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,100
so that she doesn't see it.

00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
Could you apply it to your face again?

525

Oh, right on our faces?

In conclusion, we really have to be models, right?

00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,300
Hey.

701
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,500
What happened to them?

702
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,500
I don't know.

703
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,900
Don't give them attention.

704
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,800
Why?

705
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,400
She is my friend's girlfriend.

706
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,900
Do your work, Tee.

707
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,200
Customers are looking at us.

708
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,200
Oh, Golf!

709
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:12,700
Yes?

710
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,100
Can I use more props?

711
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,500
They want the props to be bigger.

712
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,500
Sure.

713
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,700
Thank you so much.

714
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,900
Boat.

715
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,200
Yes.

716
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,200
Please hold the camera for me.

717
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,200
Are you okay?

718
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,100
I can't take it anymore.

719
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:57,900
Aom!

720
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,100
What do I have to do?

721
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,500
Stop asking me!

722
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,300
Aom!

723
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,500
What should I do next?

724
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,100
You can go now.

725
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:12,600
Let's go.

726
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:13,800
Oh!

727
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,900
Wait a minute.

728
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,800
You can go in first.

729
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,600
I'll follow you after this.

730
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:23,990
Okay.

731
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,500
Okay.

732
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,500
What should I do next?

733
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,800
We're ready for the shoot now.

734
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,500
Tee.

735
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,700
I don't know what happened to the cameraman.

736
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,500
He had diarrhea and ran over there.

737
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,200
What should we do?

738
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,800
Boat.

739
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,300
Can you take pictures?

740
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,000
Our customers are waiting.

741
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,100
I can't.

742
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,400
I can't use the camera.

743
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,400
Let Nine take a photo.

744
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,800
Daonuea.

745
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,400
What should we do?

746
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,500
I can take pictures.

747
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,500
Boat.

748
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,400
Send me the camera.

749
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,400
Okay.

750
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,200
Do you know how difficult it is for me to come to Nine's office?

751
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:37,800
(Yeah)

752
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,100
(Do you know anything?)

753
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,000
Umm...

754
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,500
It's nothing.

755
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,400
It's normal.

756
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,900
You don't need to worry.

757
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,500
When will you come back?

758
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,800
(It won't be long)

759
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,700
(I'll be back soon)

760
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:48,800
Okay.

761
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,000
I have to hang up.

762
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,100
See you, bestie.

763
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,500
What the hell is going on with me?

764
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,500
It's very messy.

765
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:07,600
Huh?

766
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,100
Why is he there?

767
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,600
Candy.

768
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,900
I have to say sorry.

769
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,300
May I take your boyfriend's time?

770
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,700
The cameraman suddenly had diarrhea.

771
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:33,500
Candy?

772
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,500
Candy?

773
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,800
Are you okay?

774
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,400
Oh...

775
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:41,600
Nothing.

776
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,500
I'm okay.

777
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,400
I'm praising my boyfriend.

778
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:50,000
Everything he does is cool.

779
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,700
Tee.

780
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,700
Customers are okay with it.

781
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,100
I think everything is done.

782
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,700
Really?

783
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,300
So I tell them to back home?

784
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,500
[Daonuea and Tee don't forget to take a picture with the product]

785
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,100
Hold on.

786
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,500
Tee!

787
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,100
She said don't forget to take pictures with the product.

788
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,700
Another set of photos and products that we have to take together!

789
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,600
You're right!

790
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,300
Who will check the monitor for us?

791
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,100
Gosh...

792
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,100
Excuse me.

793
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,200
This way, please

794
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,500
My pleasure.

795
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,000
Here, please.

796
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,600
Well.

797
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,600
Oh...

798
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,100
Oh, you guys are so cute.

799
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,200
They are like lovers, don't you think?

800
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,700
Oh.

801
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,800
They're just like in the boy love series.

802
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,100
It's like we're taking a pre-wedding photo right?

803
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:30,900
Wait a minute.

804
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,400
Do we really have to shoot it?

805
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,000
Why am I embarrassed?

806
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,200
It is the brief of our customers.

807
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,300
Umm.

808
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,000
Okay.

809
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,000
But actually,

810
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,600
we haven't even taken a couple picture properly.

811
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,600
This is an opportunity!

812
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,200
Let's take this opportunity.

813
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,000
Hey!

814
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,000
What are you guys talking about?

815
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,900
Focus on it.

816
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,400
What?

817
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,400
I am expressing myself naturally.

818
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,400
The picture came out funny.

819
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,400
You talk while taking pictures.

820
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,400
One has no light and one is too bright.

821
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,200
Can you just pose?

822
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,500
How do I know?

823
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,200
You didn't tell me anything.

824
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,200
Stop, both of you.

825
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,600
Hurry up and finish shooting.

826
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,600
So we can hurry back our home.

827
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,500
Well.

828
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,200
Keep posing.

829
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,500
I will continue to take pictures.

830
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,400
Hold on, Nine.

831
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,000
Are you going to take pictures like this?

832
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,000
Why?

833
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,800
What's the problem?

834
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,200
It's the most beautiful.

835
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,200
It's a work of art.

836
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,000
Uh...

837
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,500
Hold on...

838
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,700
Is the picture weird?

839
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,300
Hey, Nine!

840
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,900
You should focus more!

841
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,000
You see? You only took Daonuea picture.

842
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,000
The head and body parts are missing.

843
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,000
What's wrong with you?

844
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,800
What are you doing, honey?

845
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,500
Focus more.

846
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,500
Keep fighting!

847
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,300
I know, Darling.

848
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,900
Why are they apart?

849
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:29,900
It has a mark point.

850
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:30,800
You didn't see it?

851
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:31,900
What?

852
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,700
You didn't tell us to be near each other.

853
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,800
I'm telling you now.

854
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,000
Did you hear it?

855
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:40,900
Hurry up!

856
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,500
It's a work of art, right?

857
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,500
Yes.

858
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,400
Uh... maybe.

859

Oh, Candy.

864
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,100
Are you waiting for Nine?

865
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Yes.

Oh, Tee!

867

Yes.

Today I thank you for helping me with my work.

870

If there's a chance, can I have a treat for your dinner?

Sure.

Just kidding.

873
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,400
I'm glad your work went well.

874
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,000
Don't say that.

875
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,000
If Candy isn't here we must be in trouble.

876
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,400
What's going on?

877
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,200
Huh?

878
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,700
If everything is fine, I'll go now.

879
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:14,700
Okay.

880
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,300
See you later.

881
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:16,900
Okay.

882
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,600
Thank you for today, Nine.

883
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,200
Yeah.

884
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,000
Uh.

885
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,200
Did you see Daonuea?

886
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,500
No.

887
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,600
I think he's with you.

888
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:35,600
Well.

889
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
It's okay.

890
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,700
Back home safely, Nine.

891
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,600
Back home safely, Candy.

892
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,600
Yes, Tee.

893
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,700
Good bye.

894
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:48,400
Bye.

895
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,400
Oh, Aom?

896
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,400
Sorry.

897
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,300
Wow.

898
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I changed my clothes after the photoshoot.

899
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,700
Oh!

900
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,700
How are you now?

901
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,700
Do you feel better?

902
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,900
Next time, if you have a stomachache or something like that,

903
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,200
don't be patient.

904
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,900
I'm really sorry today.

905
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,900
I don't think I'm going to have severe diarrhea.

906
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:22,500
No problem.

907
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,700
Can you put this stuff in my car?

908
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,500
It's parked right there.

909
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,200
Sure, bro.

910
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,500
If you have any other symptoms, call me.

911
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:37,900
Do you understand?

912
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,500
Okay.

913
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,200
Oh?

914
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,600
Bye, Daonuea!

915
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,400
Get well soon, Aom!

916
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,400
See you, bye.

917
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,600
Do you think that if you bring your girlfriend to the office

918
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,000
and I'll be jealous?

919
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,200
Ha!

920
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,800
No way!

921
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,200
You bastard!

922
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,700
Damn it!

923
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,700
Oh...

924
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,500
Aom!

925
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,500
I'll go get my stuff first.

926
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,000
Take care yourself.

927
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,100
From your actions...

928
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,500
I think you're jealous.

929
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,200
I'm also jealous.

930
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:24,500
Oh...

931
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,500
Oh...

932
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,500
But now I feel colic.

933
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,700
How can I get up?

934
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:35,500
I’m screwed.

935
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,000
It's even worse.

936
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,400
Gosh... my life...

937
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,400
[Breeze Café & Bar]

938
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,300
I want to order now.

939
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,700
Salmon pizza, please.

940
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,700
Pork ribs with miso sauce, please.

941
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,400
Rainbow sushi, please.

942
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,300
Fried river prawns with garlic and pepper, please.

943
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,400
And fried chicken wings, please.

944
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,400
Do you want anything more? Daonuea.

945
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,700
It's okay.

946
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,600
Okay, that's it.

947
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,400
Yes.

948
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,700
This restaurant has a good vibe.

949
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:36,700
Yes.

950
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,200
Look, there's a light too.

951
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,600
They decorate the lights very beautifully.

952
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,600
I think so.

953
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,300
Oh?

954
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,100
Tee! Daonuea!

955
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,900
Are you guys dating?

956
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,400
Did you come with Nine? Candy.

957
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,700
Yes.

958
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,000
Am I interfering with your dating?

959
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,000
No.

960
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,800
Do you guys want to have dinner with us?

961
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,800
I don't know if we will eat them all.

962
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,800
It's okay, I don't want to bother you.

963
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:10,700
It's great!

964
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,400
It's like a double date too, right?

965
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,700
Please take a seat.

966
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,000
Oh...

967
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,300
Oh...

968
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,500
May I take a group photo?

969
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,500
Sure.

970
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:46,800
Huh?

971
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,000
Tee doesn't show up.

972
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,800
This angle Daonuea doesn't show up too.

973
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,900
Sigh... my arms are too short.

974
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:52,900
I have given up.

975
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,600
It's new.

976
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,400
I don't think I'll be having dinner with your girlfriend.

977
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,400
Yeah.

978
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,400
Me too.

979
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,400
Since when did you date with Candy?

980
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,500
You didn't tell me you had a girlfriend.

981
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,600
I'm...

982
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,600
I've been dating her for a while.

983
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,600
Oh.

984
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,800
He didn't really want to talk about it.

985
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,000
I don't want too many people to know.

986
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,500
I think all the dishes have been served.

987
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,100
Let's eat now?

988
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,700
Okay, let's get started.

989
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,700
I want to eat this one.

990
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:44,900
Uh...

991
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Candy.

992
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,000
I haven't thanked for helping us to you.

993
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,000
Thank you so much.

994
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,000
Oh.

995
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,200
It's fine.

996
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,600
It's so fun!

997
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,500
I got to know about working on the set too.

998
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,300
I like it.

999
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,100
Really?

1000
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,800
If you are interested, we welcome new employees.

1001
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,100
It's okay.

1002
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,600
I'm busy these days.

1003
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,000
But fortunately, Nine helped manage all the mess.

1004
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,600
It's great.

1005
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,200
Uh...

1006
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Candy.

1007
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,800
Do you come here often? Candy.

1008
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,200
I come to this restaurant very often.

1009
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,900
But I've never met you before.

1010
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,900
I came to this restaurant on a special day.

1011
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,500
Oh...

1012
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,900
I come here with Tee every time.

1013
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,200
When we started having feelings for each other...

1014
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,100
until now.

1015
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,400
Am I right? Tee.

1016
01:03:58,900 --> 01:03:59,400
Yes.

1017
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,000
Wow...

1018
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,200
You guys are so sweet.

1019
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,300
No!

1020
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,700
I won't give up.

1021
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:10,200
I had to fight them with a romantic scene.

1022
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,700
Right? Honey.

1023
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,600
Honey.

1024
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:14,500
Right?

1025
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,300
Oh.

1026
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,800
Yes.

1027
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:22,100
I will be more romantic.

1028
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,000
Here.

1029
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,100
I know it's your favourite.

1030
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,600
Eat well.

1031
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:35,200
Be careful, someone will steal it from you.

1032
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,000
Why do you say that?

1033
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,000
Who will steal your food?

1034
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,700
Do you see?

1035
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,200
Candy hasn't eaten anything yet.

1036
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:44,700
Oh.

1037
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,300
It's okay.

1038
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,300
I don't really like to eat that much.

1039
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,700
Usually, I'm an anti-vegetarian.

1040
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,000
I don't eat it.

1041
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:55,900
Uh...

1042
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,600
Are you vegetarian?

1043
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,000
I...

1044
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,000
I eat everything.

1045
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:11,900
It's a shrimp.

1046
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,600
I didn't mention anyone.

1047
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,000
Then why are you worried?

1048
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,300
Candy.

1049
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,000
You exercise hard during this time.

1050
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,600
Eat a lot of protein.

1051
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:34,500
Oh.

1052
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,900
You're so cute, honey.

1053
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,900
Thank you so much.

1054
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:41,900
Oh!

1055
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:42,900
Tee.

1056
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,800
Why do you always mess up?

1057
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:45,500
Huh?

1058
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:46,900
It's okay.

1059
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,400
I can wipe it myself.

1060
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,500
It's okay, I'll wipe it for you.

1061
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,600
Wow.

1062
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,900
They're so sweet.

1063
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,100
Right?

1064
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,600
Here, Candy.

1065
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,500
Your protein.

1066
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:03,800
Hmm!

1067
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,000
Wow.

1068
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,900
You fed me even though I didn't say anything.

1069
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,700
You're so cute.

1070
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,200
Hmm.

1071
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,200
It's tasty?

1072
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,000
Yes!

1073
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,200
It's pizza.

1074
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:36,900
Oh!

1075
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,500
Let's cheers?

1076
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,400
This one is also vegetarian.

1077
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,600
It's alcohol.

1078
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,800
I feel better now.

1079
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,400
Why?

1080
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,600
Is there something on my face?

1081
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,600
Nothing.

1082
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:20,500
I'm just thinking that Daonuea might be having feelings for you.

1083
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,600
What do you mean? Have feelings for me?

1084
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,500
Can't you see their sweetness?

1085
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:29,500
I think Daonuea has feelings for you.

1086
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,500
But he had no confidence.

1087
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,000
I think he just doesn't believe in me.

1088
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,400
I don't contact him.

1089
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,300
I don't reply to his messages.

1090
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,400
Because I think at that time I will reconcile with Praew.

1091
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,300
It might be related.

1092
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,100
But believe me

1093
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,400
it's because of him too.

1094
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,800
It's not because of you that affects him.

1095
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:51,900
Candy.

1096
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:53,900
Why do you know?

1097
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,900
Because of this!

1098
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:03,700
It is the cards of the devil and the lover.

1099
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,600
Hey.

1100
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,900
The cards tell you to be confident in your thoughts and do it.

1101
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,700
But I think he doesn't want to see me anymore.

1102
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,500
I don't know.

1103
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,500
Oh.

1104
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,100
How about your relationship with Praew?

1105
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,800
I think I'll tell her honestly when I'm ready.

1106
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,200
I'm afraid it will be the same as before.

1107
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,899
She was like that

1108
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,000
when I broke up with her.

1109
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,200
But this is your life.

1110
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,500
How can you be with someone you don't love?

1111
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:54,300
You should be happy.

1112
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,399
Alright.

1113
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:04,200
It's okay.

1114
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,200
It will get better soon.

1115
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,899
I'll give you a massage.

1116
01:09:10,899 --> 01:09:12,000
You worry too much.

1117
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,100
Praew...

1118
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,500
Are you still my friend?

1119
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:23,200
Praew.

1120
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,700
You're misunderstanding me.

1121
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:26,800
Praew, please.
