2
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,400
Thank you.

3
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,000
Here, please.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,700
Hey.

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
It's my treat this time.

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,800
It's okay, I'll pay myself.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,300
I'm the one who invites you.

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,700
I should pay for this meal.

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,400
It seems that you are stuck in your wallet.

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,500
Here it is, it's all there.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,300
It's okay, I'll pay for this meal.

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,900
No.

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,900
You help us a lot.

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,100
Just let me pay for this meal.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,600
Well, I will pay for today.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,500
For the barbecue the other day.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,200
You guys manage here first.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll going out with Daonuea in front of the restaurant.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,500
Shall we go?

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,400
Well, okay.

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,500
You should have let me pay in the first place.

23
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,600
I know.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,400
Next time I'll pay it, okay?

25
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,600
[Breeze Café & Bar]

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,100
This is Nine's normal personality?

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,900
Usually, he pays for the meals.

28
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,200
He always pays especially to the people he has feelings for.

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,100
Oh...

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,200
You are such a lucky woman, Candy.

31
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,200
No, I'm not.

32
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,700
If I were his actual girlfriend, it might be.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,600
Huh?

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,900
'Actual girlfriend?'

35
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,600
What do you mean?

36
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,200
Oh? Uh...

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,300
What did I just say?

38
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,100
When I'm shocked, I'll forget for a moment.

39
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,700
My memory is fuzzy.

40
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,600
It's nothing.

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,700
What did I just say?

42
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,400
Oh, okay.

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,700
Daonuea and Nine have known each other before?

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,200
You guys seem particularly close.

45
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,000
Uh...

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,700
Oh, we know each other.

47
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,900
But we're not that close.

48
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,600
Okay.

49
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,100
We have been working together for almost a month now.

50
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,800
It's alright.

51
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,900
I'll pay for the next meal.

52
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,700
Okay.

53
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,200
Darling.

54
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,700
Let's go home.

55
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
I'm sleepy after I'm full.

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,600
I almost fell asleep.

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,800
Let me check the receipt.

58
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,400
Why?

59
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,500
You don't need to pay for it.

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,300
Daonuea.

61
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,700
I want to share the bill when eating.

62
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,000
Hey.

63
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,000
Nine said he wanted to treat us.

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,700
It's my belief.

65
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,600
Tee.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,800
Let's back home.

67
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,900
Okay, let's back home

68
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
We'll be holding hands elsewhere.

69
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,600
Bye bye.

70
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,900
Wow~

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,300
Hey~

72
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,800
I know you're jealous.

73
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,000
So what?

74
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,000
You scolded me again.

75
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,800
Let's go.

76
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,400
Nine, just now I accidentally said it.

77
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
I've heard it all.

78
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm so sorry.

79
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,700
(It's weird. He usually picks up my calls)

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,200
But this is your life.

81
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,500
How can you be with someone you don't love?

82
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,600
You should be happy.

83
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,600
Alright.

84
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,500
It's okay.

85
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
It will get better soon.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,200
Let's hug.

87
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,900
Praew...

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Are you still my friend?

89
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Praew.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
You're misunderstanding me.

91
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,800
Praew.

92
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Why?

93
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Are you still my friend? Candy.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Are you still my friend?

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,300
Why are you betraying me?

96
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,800
Huh?

97
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,100
How can you do it?

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,400
Stop! Praew.

99
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,700
I'll let her know.

100
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,700
My true self.

101
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,200
How many years have you been my friend?

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
Why do you really think I did that?

103
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,200
What do you want me to think?

104
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,700
I told you to keep an eye on my boyfriend

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,300
but you betrayed me.

106
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,800
There is nothing between me and Nine.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,300
How can I believe you?

108
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,000
Huh?

109
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,200
You've even had feelings for my ex.

110
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,000
You've told me that you're not worried about that, haven't you?

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,800
You betrayed me, how could I forget it?

112
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,000
But then you broke up with him.

113
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,500
And you already had Nine at that time.

114
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,500
Stop!

115
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,600
Both of you!

116
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,100
Candy.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,100
Can you give us some time?

118
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,400
Where are you going?

119
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,500
Let's sleep in each room tonight.

120
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't want to talk about it.

121
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,900
What happened to you, Nine?

122
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,200
Why do you have to make it such a big deal?

123
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,000
Should it be me?

124
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,500
It should be me who has to ask you.

125
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,700
Why have you never taken my side once?

126
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,100
What do you want me to take?

127
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,000
I think you've stopped your bad behavior.

128
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,000
Why?

129
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,200
Why do I have to be tolerant of something you do?

130
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,200
I just want you to take my side.

131
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,300
But she is your friend.

132
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,700
She is my friend too.

133
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,200
Do you want her to be troubled by you again?

134
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,200
What do other people think when they see that?

135
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,100
Even me, I'm on your side.

136
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,700
On my side?

137
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,300
What do you mean?

138
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,100
Praew...

139
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,300
What happened?

140
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,600
What did Nine do to you?

141
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,700
Praew.

142
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,900
You can slap or hit me.

143
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,700
Slap me!

144
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,400
But don't be like this.

145
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,000
Can you stop being like this?

146
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
How can I live without you?

147
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,600
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm sorry, Praew.

149
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,600
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,900
Do you know? Your behavior today is not cute.

151
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,900
What do you mean?

152
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,500
I didn't even know what I was doing.

153
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
I don't know

154
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,400
why you are inharmonious with Nine.

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But at least,

156
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,800
can't you be kind to him?

157
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,900
We are workmates in the same office.

158
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,500
Huh?

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What bad thing have I done to Nine?

160
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,700
You are always exaggerating.

161
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,500
Did you know that when I was in high school there was always a problem with family arguments?

162
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,300
He even walked out while we were working.

163
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,400
Nine!

164
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,600
Hey?

165
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
Are you okay?

166
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,400
Nine!

167
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
What's wrong with him?

168
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,200
I don't know.

169
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,000
He made a stressed expression.

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,100
Let's continue our work.

171
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,600
And he gradually backed away from his friends.

172
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,700
What do you want me to do?

173
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,200

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,800
Nothing.

348
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,700
You want to eat it?

349
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
You can eat it.

350
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,500
Eat?

351
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,500
Who was talking about 'eat' just now?

352
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Is it a snack?

353
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,200
Will you eat it?

354
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,000
Cookies, I heard it.

355
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,200
I missed it.

356
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,900
I will continue to work.

357
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,240
[Lodestar Production]

358
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,600
(Why does he look weird today?)

359
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,400
(Usually he doesn't act like this)

360
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,100
(Or...)

361
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,700
(Was he annoyed that I ignored him?)

362
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
(Or was he angry because I stole his food yesterday?)

363
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,500
Why are you standing there?

364
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,300
Why?

365
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,100
It should be me to asking what you are doing.

366
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,000
Why are you using the studio?

367
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Don't tell me that you do other work.

368
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,900
Hey.

369
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,000
If you do other work you have to pay the studio rent.

370
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,000
Now!

371
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,800
No.

372
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,300
I'm just taking pictures in general.

373
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,300
Really?

374
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,300
I think it's not.

375
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,900
You arrange the elements beautifully.

376
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,400
Thank you for the compliment.

377
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,000
What do you mean?

378
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,600
Who said I complimented you? Huh?

379
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,700
Daonuea.

380
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,100
Move over, please.

381
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,700
I will continue to take pictures.

382
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,700
Here.

383
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,400
Is it mine?

384
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,300
Yes.

385
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,300
Take it.

386
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,600
I give you reluctantly.

387
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,700
For peace in our office.

388
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,100
Here.

389
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,900
Take it there.

390
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,000
Hurry up.

391
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,600
What are you shooting?

392
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,700
Do you usually take this adorable style?

393
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,700
I'm just trying to change my style,

394
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,300
can't I?

395
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,300
Didn't Candy come to you today?

396
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,600
Why are you curious about me today?

397
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,600
The other day you didn't pay attention to me that much.

398
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,900
I don't know.

399
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,500
I'm probably worried that you'll be bored.

400
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,300
So I talked to you.

401
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,000
Don't move.

402
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,200
Hey.

403
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,400
If you don't want me to wipe it, wipe it yourself.

404
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,500
No.

405
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,400
Aren't you going to see Tee today?

406
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,700
You guys are always together.

407
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,400
Tee went to a meeting today.

408
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,000
Maybe he'll be back here in the evening.

409
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,200
If your eyes hurt, go back to the office.

410
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,100
I'm okay.

411
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,300
I want to be here because I'm bored.

412
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,000
Or will you be a model?

413
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,500
No.

414
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,900
I don't want to be a model.

415
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,100
So what do you want to do?

416
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Umm...

417
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,700
Maybe go on a trip somewhere.

418
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,500
Why?

419
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,300
Why? I just want to travel.

420
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,500
Huh?

421
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,700
Where do you want to travel?

422
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,000
An amusement park like Dream World.

423
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,500
You're an adult, but you want to go to an amusement park?

424
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,300
What?

425
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,300
There's no age limit, isn't it?

426
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,100
Huh?

427
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,100
Are you back?

428
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,100
Why did you get off work so early today?

429
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,000
Sometimes I get confused.

430
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,000
Is this your home? Candy.

431
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,700
You were mean to me as soon as you got home.

432
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,500
I probably won't be here soon.

433
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,100
What's wrong with you? Huh?

434
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,200
Nine.

435
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,900
I seriously ask you.

436
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,400
Have you decided what you will do next?

437
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,900
I don't know.

438
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,800
I tried to give up on him.

439
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,000
But he approached me.

440
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,800
You know, right?

441
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,100
If you take a long time to make a decision,

442
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,200
the person in pain isn't just you.

443
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,700
You should reconcile with Praew.

444
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,400
Huh?

445
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,600
You haven't talked to Praew yet?

446
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,500
No, I'm not.

447
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,600
You went to meet Praew, didn't you?

448
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,900
How was it?

449
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,100
I think you should apologize to Praew.

450
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,400
If I encountered the same situation as Praew, I would regret as well.

451
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:41,100
[For apologies that I ate your shrimp. -Daonuea-]

452
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,000
Are you still listening to me?

453
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,900
Yes, I am.

454
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,199
I'm going to reconcile her later.

455
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,199
No!

456
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,400
Tonight and now!

457
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,000
Daonuea.

458
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,500
You already gave Nine cookies, right?

459
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
You didn't eat it all, right?

460
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,700
I already gave it to him.

461
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,100
He already has received it.

462
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,000
Good.

463
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,500
Why is Daonuea so cute?

464
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,500
Oh!

465
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,600
How was today's meeting?

466
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,300
The same client, they haven't confirmed anything.

467
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,000
They plan many new projects.

468
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,500
I'm afraid in the end

469
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,200
if it was canceled it would be bad.

470
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,700
It probably won't be like that, Tee.

471
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,300
Oh!

472
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,400
Then I will pray for you.

473
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,700
Will it really work?

474
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,100
Tee.

475
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,200
If you don't give it a try, how will you know?

476
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,500
Tee.

477
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,600
I am going to sleep now.

478
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,400
Okay.

479
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
Please turn off the lights.

480
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,600
[For apologies that I ate your shrimp. -Daonuea-]

481
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,200
Nine.

482
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,700
Let's have breakfast.

483
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,600
You don't need to prepare me breakfast.

484
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,200
It's alright.

485
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,200
I'm having free time.

486
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,000
I want to do it for you.

487
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,000
Praew...

488
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,200
I'm sorry

489
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,500
that I didn't listen to you.

490
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,700
It's okay, Nine.

491
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,000
I have to apologize to you as well.

492
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:56,000
After this, I promise that I will be more calm.

493
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,800
Okay?

494
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,500
Okay!

495
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,500
Let's eat.

496
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,700
It's your favorite.

497
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,600
When you keep an eye on Nine,

498
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,100
did he cheat on me?

499
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,200
Actually, I think it might be someone in his office.

500
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,200
Maybe.

501
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,900
(Who is that someone?)

502
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,600
(Or should I go to his office?)

503
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,100
Praew.

504
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,600
Do you have any drama filming today?

505
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,900
Do you want me to drive you?

506
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,700
It's okay.

507
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,400
The staff will pick me up.

508
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,500
No.

509
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,600
I was determined that I would drive you.

510
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,800
What if someone knew of our relationship?

511
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,500
You don't need to worry.

512
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,800
I have applied opaque film to the windshield.

513
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,500
There's no way they'll see us.

514
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,700
Okay.

515
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,900
Hurry up and eat it.

516
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,000
Okay.

517
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,700
Open the file.

518
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,400
Sure, bro.

519
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,100
Hold on.

520
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,800
Here.

521
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
Keep scrolling.

522
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,400
Stop here.

523
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
Let's choose this picture.

524
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:04,900
This picture?

525
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,400
Yes.

526
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,600
Okay.

527
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,100
The next picture.

528
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,800
Hold on.

529
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
Stop here.

530
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,600
It's weird.

531
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,900
I can't remember this picture.

532
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,000
That day I saw you taking pictures around the studio.

533
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,800
I don't think it's from my camera.

534
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,300
Can I check the file?

535
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,400
Sure.

536
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,800
I'll check it myself.

537
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,100
Gosh...

538
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,000
See?

539
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
It's not from my camera.

540
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,300
It could be a behind-the-scenes picture.

541
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,200
Behind.

542
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,000
Why is it in here?

543
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,200
Did you really check it?

544
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:05,900
Huh?

545
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,900
Or...

546
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,700
Nine!

547
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,700
It's nothing.

548
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,800
I have no feelings for your girlfriend.

549
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,300
What do you mean?

550
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,000
I'm just telling you to select a picture first.

551
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,000
So you don't have to select photos later.

552
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,200
Yeah.

553
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,100
Okay.

554
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,200
Oh.

555
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,300
Send me a Candy's picture.

556
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,800
She would be happy to know that someone took her picture.

557
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,600
Why?

558
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,700
Do your work.

559
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,600
Oh...

560
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,300
Aren't you going to tell me?

561
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,300
Hurry up.

562
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,200
Okay.

563
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,700
Oh! Daonuea?

564
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,900
Hello!

565
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,500
Why are you sleeping here?

566
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,500
The person who fell asleep here was you.

567
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,600
If it wasn't for my shoulder,

568
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,800
your head would have hit the ground.

569
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,100
Keep doing your work.

570
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,100
I'll back home now.

571
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,900
(Why did this happen?)

572
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,900
(Why am I lying on Nine's shoulder?)

573
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,900
(Ouch!)

574
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,900
I want to go to the bathroom.

575
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,200
Please wait for me a moment.

576
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,300
I'll be back.

577
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,600
Nine.

578
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,200
Hey?

579
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,200
Nine.

580
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,800
Why are you here?

581
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,300
If you want indemnity that I lay on your shoulder yesterday,

582
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,200
I don't have it.

583
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:14,900
No.

584
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,700
I just want to say thank you to you.

585
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,300
The cookies you gave me are yummy.

586
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,800
Oh.

587
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,600
Tell it to Tee.

588
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,200
Tee knows you well.

589
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,700
Where is Tee?

590
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,800
He's rarely in the office these days.

591
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,200
Tee went to a meeting during these days.

592
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,200
What about you?

593
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,600
Can you find a client?

594
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,600
I can find... maybe?

595
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,800
Good.

596
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,700
Send me the picture you took yesterday too.

597
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,000
I'll put it in the website portfolio.

598
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,500
Would you like to have lunch with me?

599
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,200
[Breeze Café & Bar]

600
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,500
Hey.

601
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,500
Are you going to eat until your stomach bursting?

602
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,500
No.

603
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,200
I just want to eat something delicious.

604
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,600
Because last time someone took all my food.

605
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:03,900
Who?

606
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,000
Someone...

607
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,800
I haven't seen one.

608
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:09,800
Hey.

609
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,700
If I knew you brought me here to tease me,

610
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,400
I wouldn't be here.

611
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,100
I saw you alone.

612
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,600
So I thought you might want to come outside.

613
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,000
Are you psycho?

614
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,700
Why are you staring at me?

615
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,900
Aren't you talking about good relationships in the company?

616
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,800
Isn't it?

617
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,800
I am expanding good relationship in the company.

618
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,800
Stop retorting me.

619
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,100
It's Tee's idea.

620
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,000
I even objected to him.

621
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,100
I know I have to deal with people like you.

622
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,400
Well.

623
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,400
I have recorded your voice.

624
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,400
I'll send it to Tee.

625
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,900
What are you doing?

626
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,100
If Tee knew, Tee would regret it.

627
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,900
What the hell are you doing?

628
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,500
If I had known, I wouldn't have come with you.

629
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,300
What a pity.

630
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,700
Here.

631
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,500
I can eat by myself.

632
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,100
I was surprised until today.

633
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,700
Why do you have to work here?

634
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,800
I saw your announcement.

635
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,100
Recruitment announcement.

636
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,100
That's all?

637
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,400
Yes.

638
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,300
What reason do you want it to be?

639
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,800
Maybe it's because of me.

640
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,600
Just thinking about it,

641
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,700
I'm quite attractive.

642
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,700
Hey.

643
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,300
Why are you so confident?

644
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,600
Huh?

645
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,300
Daonuea.

646
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,400
Why?

647
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,800
Get up.

648
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
What are you doing?

649
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:17,800
Don't move.

650
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,500
It didn't take long.

651
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,400
It's better, right?

652
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,700
Sit here.

653
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,100
Eat slowly.

654
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,700
You eat too much.

655
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,200
Sit down.

656
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,700
Do you need any help?

657
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,900
It's okay.

658
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,700
Thank you.

659
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,100
Do you want to eat more?

660
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,800
Hurry and eat it.

661
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
Hurry up!

662
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,800
Cut it into small pieces.

663
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,000
Send it to me.

664
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,000
I'll cut it for you.

665
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:26,900
Here.

666
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,600
Hurry up and eat.

667
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,900
Hurry up!

668
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,500
Come here.

669
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,600
Your mouth is messed up.

670
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,500
I'm full now.

671
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,000
Bill, please.

672
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,300
I'm so embarrassed.

673
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,200
Will I be able to come to this cafe again?

674
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,600
Why are you embarrassing me?

675
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,600
This is my regular cafe.

676
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:49,800
Huh?

677
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,700
If I didn't help you,

678
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,900
you'd probably be dead.

679
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,400
It would be better.

680
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,100
If I had to be embarrassed like this.

681
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,600
Well.

682
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,400
I shouldn't help you.

683
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,100
I even hurt my wrist.

684
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,700
Thank you

685
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,700
for helping me.

686
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,700
(Why do I always argue with him?)

687
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:40,800
Then tomorrow you can treat me to the same cafe as a thank you.

688
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,700
Are you crazy?

689
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,900
Are you telling me to come back here again?

690
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,100
No way!

691
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,200
What's wrong with him?

692
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,500
