2
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,630
Daonuea.

3
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,400
Get up now

4
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,310
The ship will soon depart.

5
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,010
Tee.

6
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,660
Why did you

7
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,660
wake up so early today?

8
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,630
Hurry up and get up.

9
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,530
You're late now.

10
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,350
I prepared some clothes for you.

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,840
The toothbrush is on the table as usual.

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,210
Thank you, Tee.

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,570
But next time

14
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:22,980
you don't need to do it.

15
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,810
Just talk about the next time later.

16
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,490
I can do it.

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,380
Oh.

18
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,850
I'm going to continue working.

19
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,259
Don't be late.

20
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,110
Everyone is waiting for you at the car.

21
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,150
Hold on.

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,360
Did you not join us?

23
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,530
It's alright.

24
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:53,370
Just enjoy it.

25
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,789
I have a work to do.

26
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:58,310
Another thing,

27
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,250
the sea has no signals.

28
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:03,910
See you later.

29
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:29,870
I'm screwed.

30
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,990
Will I be on time?

31
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,260
See you later, Tee.

32
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,770
Hey.

33
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,260
Are you awake?

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,200
Yesterday, Boat said you were drunk.

35
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:37,890
Yeah.

36
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:38,770
Just a little bit.

37
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,360
Are you okay?

38
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:49,920
I'm okay.

39
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,600
I understand Daonuea well.

40
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,000
If Daonuea is not ready,

41
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,290
I must accept the reality.

42
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,110
Tee.

43
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,860
Do you want to take a yacht with me?

44
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,170
Enjoy with everyone.

45
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,730
It's okay.

46
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,089
Just enjoy it.

47
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,600
I have a lot of work to do.

48
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,460
Okay.

49
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,970
Please take good care of Daonuea.

50
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,140
(Or is it really time for me)

51
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,350
(to give Daonuea up?)

52
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,210
Nine!

53
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,160
Nine!

54
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,050
Wait for me!

55
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,100
Do you see?

56
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,640
I told you, he must come here.

57
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,090
Who'll know?

58
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,440
Let's go.

59
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,710
The van is waiting for us.

60
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,710
Yea~ let's go to the sea.

61
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,190
Thank you.

62
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,370
Come on.

63
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,640
Let's cheers?

64
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,850
Sure, Nine.

65
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,159
Come on.

66
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,170
Cheers!

67
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,210
Nine.

68
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,520
A yacht so beautiful.

69
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,520
Food and beverages are ready.

70
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,980
It's worth it for me because you guys mean with me.

71
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,140
Of course.

72
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,520
When travelling,

73
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,270
we have to choose the greatest yacht.

74
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,040
Once Yachting.

75
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,990
Fortunately, I got with you,

76
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,880
I would be angry with you if you only come together.

77
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,100
Alright.

78
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,010
Who wants to descend to the water first?

79
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,180
Me!

80
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:29,930
Me.

81
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,780
Stop there.

82
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,570
Let's...

83
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,060
lady first.

84
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,450
Candy.

85
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,610
You go first.

86
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,850
It's okay, you first.

87
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,920
It's alright.

88
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,409
You can go first, Candy.

89
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,560
And don't have to hurry back,

90
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,570
I want to spend time with Daonuea.

91
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,570
Oh...

92
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,530
Okay.

93
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,470
Sure, my friend.

94
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:52,740
Boat.

95
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,820
Let's descend to the water with me.

96
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,610
Because now my friend doesn't have time to take care of me.

97
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,040
Please take care me.

98
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:00,700
Sure.

99
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,190
Let's go.

100
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,800
Just hurry to dive.

101
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,590
Okay, Daonuea.

102
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,350
I'm leaving now.

103
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,840
I'm going now.

104
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:08,900
You want to hurt again?

105
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:09,930
I'm going now.

106
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,790
Wait for me, Candy.

107
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,100
[Once Yachting]

108
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,600
Thank you.

109
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,860
Do you enjoying it?

110
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:37,860
Yeah.

111
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,120
Of course.

112
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,760
The weather is clear.

113
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,590
Actually,

114
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,020
I've never traveled like this before.

115
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,420
I used to think that I wanted to come here once,

116
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,360
but I didn't dare to come here once.

117
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,410
I dare when I went to Khao Yai.

118
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,690
Daonuea.

119
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,740
Thank you for coming with me.

120
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:12,870
Yeah.

121
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,670
You don't have to thank me

122
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,480
You act like I'm a benefactor.

123
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,000
Maybe it is.

124
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,300
Enough said.

125
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,970
I'm sorry to hear about Praew.

126
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,640
Are you okay, right?

127
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,560
Yeah.

128
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,940
We are still friends, anyway.

129
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,040
It's good.

130
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,630
Being together for a long time,

131
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,760
cutting the relationship in one day

132
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,400
is too cruel.

133
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,020
Tee, is he okay?

134
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,230
Umm...

135
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,480
Actually,

136
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,280
Tee seems to comprehend me better than I do.

137
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,650
I apologized to him for the last night.

138
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,210
I'm not interested in dating him anymore.

139
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,310
Over time,

140
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,160
the human mind has to change.

141
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,720
Will we change

142
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,300
one day?

143
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,060
What do you mean?

144
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,100
What the hell are you saying?

145
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,700
I'm leaving now.

146
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
I'd want to take a picture.

147
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,560
Just pose properly.

148
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,570
Hurry up.

149
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,880
Ouch...

150
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,310
Nine.

151
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,390
Look at your results.

152
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,630
Why you can't pose properly?

153
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,620
Let me see.

154
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,230
Daonuea.

155
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,440
Why did you take my pictures out of the head and legs like this?

156
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,070
Your model is high and handsome.

157
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,400
Is this what you can do?

158
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:20,800
Huh?

159
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,720
Hey.

160
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,140
If you don't pose properly,

161
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,370
this is a good picture.

162
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,340
It's funny.

163
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,280
You don't need to use handsome face,

164
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,440
just focus on your laugh.

165
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,100
You cheat.

166
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,240
Every picture I take for you is beautiful.

167
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,300
It's because I was standing properly,

168
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,160
but you changed pose many times.

169
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,030
Huh?

170
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:36,840
Let's stop here.

171
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,180
Let's take a selfie.

172
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,210
Okay.

173
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,670
Okay.

174
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,560
I'll hold the camera for you.

175
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:47,690
Alright.

176
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,250
1,2,3.

177
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,160

Will you flirt with me?

Nine cared more about the feelings of others than his own.

Sometimes he almost forgot how he felt.

How is it?

649
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:38,300
For example when he was dating Praew,

650
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:39,620
he was very patient.

651
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,450
He dated her even though he didn't have any feelings for her.

652
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:48,080
He only reconciled because he was worried that Praew would commit suicide.

653
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:49,710

654
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:51,680

00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,740
No way.

659
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,530

00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:23,470
is...

706
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:24,790
Boat.

707
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,630
Boat.

708
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:27,120
Oh.

709
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:28,570
It's me, Boat.

710
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,320
Boat?

711
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:34,110
Why you...

712
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,540
How was it?

713
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,390
You're shocked at my coolness, right?

714
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,020
And this is my new boyfriend.

715
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,140
Hold on.

716
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:47,540
Have you accepted my girlfriend's request?

717
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:48,930
Let's be lovers.

718
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,730
Life is short.

719
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:52,430
The world will end very soon.

720
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,560
Let's be lovers.

721
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:54,330
Right?

722
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:54,870
Let's go.

723
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,680
Bye bye.

724
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,740
Get home safely.

725
00:49:59,070 --> 00:49:59,980
Of course!

726
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,370
My girlfriend is a bit boastful.

727
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:02,860
Bye bye.

728
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,960
Bye bye.

729
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,010
Are you drunk?

730
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:27,600
Nine.

731
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,430
Hey?

732
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:29,920
Nine.

733
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:31,840
What are you doing here?

734
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,070
Candy posted pictures on social media.

735
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,180
So I had to pick up someone

736
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,500
who was drunk.

737
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,220
Huh?

738
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:42,370
Here.

739
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,580
I'm not that drunk.

740
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:50,640
I can go back by myself.

741
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,640
Just back your home.

742
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,680
It's late now.

743
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:55,680
No.

744
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:59,540
Until I drive you home.

745
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,510
What do you mean?

746
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,600
I can call a car to get home by myself.

747
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,130
Just release me.

748
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,790
Will you obey me

749
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,100
or let me carry you?

750
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,410
Umm...

751
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,390
Carry me.

752
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:22,890
Hey?

753
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:24,950
I will obey you.

754
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:27,710
Let's go.

755
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,860
Just walk properly.

756
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,510
You said you weren't drunk, didn't you?

757
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:37,920
I'm

758
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,240
not drunk.

759
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,650
We have arrived.

760
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,420
Daonuea.

761
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,770
It's cute

762
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:12,340
when you're just sleeping.

763
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,830
Nine.

764
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,240
How did you come to me?

765
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:35,660
Hey.

766
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:37,840
I didn't come to you.

767
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,170
I drove to take you home.

768
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,750
Why did you drive me home?

769
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,180
Look at you.

770
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:49,000
You're drunk.

771
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:52,330
Who's drunk?

772
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,080
You're crazy.

773
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,350
See you tomorrow.

774
00:52:58,780 --> 00:52:59,150
Huh?

775
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:14,950
Hey.

776
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,200
What just happened?

777
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,120
He really didn't remember anything?

778
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,660
Is he okay?

779
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,220
Why am I here?

780
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,640
I was with Candy last night, wasn't I?

781
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,000
Are you drunk?

782
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:25,440
Nine.

783
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:26,420
Hey?

784
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:27,920
Nine.

785
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,360
Will you obey me

786
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:32,540
or let me carry you?

787
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,240
Carry me.

788
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:35,940
Hey?

789
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:37,990
I will obey you.

790
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:40,670
Let's go.

791
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:46,900
Just walk properly.

792
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,580
You said you weren't drunk, didn't you?

793
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,310
Hey!

794
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,130
Why does Nine have to see me in that way?

795
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,610
I'm embarrassed!

796
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:09,300
[Lodestar Production]

797
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,350
Oh.

798
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,020
Why does your desk have so many paperwork?

799
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:37,590
Huh?

800
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,110
It is an expense bill for each project.

801
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,010
I don't know if I will finish today.

802
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,010
Nine,

803
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:48,750
are you interested in taking it?

804
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:50,750
It's okay.

805
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:53,120
You can do it.

806
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:54,960
Okay?

807
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:56,530
Okay.

808
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,150
Okay.

809
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:15,880
I will prepare the documents for you.

810
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:18,880
Okay.

811
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:25,320
Ice.

812
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,130
Please print a resignation form for me.

813
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,840
Will Daonuea really resign, Tee?

814
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:36,800
Please take care of it.

815
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:07,750
Marut Prasertsil.

816
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,350
Why is this name familiar?

817
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,040
Nine.

818
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,290
I have something to talk with you.

819
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:05,530
Boat.

820
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:06,250
Ice.

821
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,490
Where have Tee and Nine gone?

822
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,520
Tee and Nine may be at the studio.

823
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:21,830
So I signed my resignation form and I'll leaving.

824
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:24,870
Then...

825
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:26,900
Wait a moment, Daonuea.

826
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,430
I will help with your documents.

827
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,030
Oh.

828
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:31,040
Okay.

829
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:49,090
Do you miss me?

830
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:49,990
Huh?

831
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:52,540
It has some nostalgia.

832
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,200
But it's good without you.

833
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,680
So that my head is not hurt.

834
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,300
Do you want

835
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,240
something to hit your head before I go?

836
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:03,950
Huh?

837
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,550
So

838
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,350
do you want something to hit your head before you go?

839
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,440
You're so bad.

840
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:17,760
I'll continue my work.

841
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:07,940
Here.

842
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,730
When will you tell me the truth?

843
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,180
Why did you do it?

844
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,070
I told you yesterday

845
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,300
that I will finish this matter.

846
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:30,870
I called the client to check.

847
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,450
Wasn't it you

848
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:35,080
who hired them?

849
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,660
I just want to find a project for the company.

850
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,490
What are you doing that for?

851
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,500
I don't know either.

852
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:52,900
Daonuea.

853
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:56,190
This...

854
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,600
What does that mean, Tee?

855
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:02,110
Why does Nine pay to client?

856
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:05,230
It means

857
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,850
that nothing real, right?

858
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,430
Why are you lying everything to me?

859
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,370
You think we have no money?

860
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:20,020
Daonuea.

861
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:25,760
I didn't mean for it to happen.

862
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:33,090
Don't touch me.

863
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,040
Just tell me, Nine.

864
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,320
Why did you fake everything up?

865
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,440
What's real

866
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:47,840
in your life?

867
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:50,590
Daonuea, listen to me.

868
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:52,840
Nine.

869
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,060
Now I understand.

870
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,600
Actually, you came here

871
01:01:58,960 --> 01:01:59,910
because of Daonuea, right?

872
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:03,700
Yes.

873
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:05,770
I'm here because of Daonuea.

874
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:07,700
Are you happy now?

875
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:16,460
Tee.

876
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,430
Are you okay?

877
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:20,810
Yes.

878
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:21,880
I'm okay.

879
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:25,920
I'm not the cause of your argument, am I?

880
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:29,410
Yeah.

881
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,460
