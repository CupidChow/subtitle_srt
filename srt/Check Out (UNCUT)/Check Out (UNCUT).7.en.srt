What happened?

181
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:57,650
Tell me the truth.

182
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,130
You even misrepresented to me that

183
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,750
Candy was your girlfriend.

184
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,080
What?

185
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,440
Because we are lovers.

It's not your matter either.

You don't need to intervene about it.

please don't think I'm interfering with you.

Praew came to our office yesterday.

196
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,600
She came to see you at the office.

197

I don't know what she's angry about.

I don't know, you have to

201
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,420
give me the indemnity.

202
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,260
What does it mean

203
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,870
when you tell Tee

204
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,200
that everything is fine?

205
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,430
If Tee knew everything,

206
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,850
he wouldn't be comfortable

207
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:52,640

209
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,350
It means

210

no one knows about it right now, right?

211
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,280
I didn't tell it to anyone.

212
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,960
When you lied to me

213
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,550
about your relationship with Candy...

214
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,600
I didn't mean to lie to you.

215
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,690
At that time I just...

216

I don't know how to bring her to our office.

So I said she was my girlfriend.

I'm worried that she won't be able to come here

if I tell you that she is my friend.

It's not because

223
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,800
you want to be sarcastic, right?

00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,270
can you help me?

Yes.

He's actually not good at photography.

238
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,890
He wasn't confident about his photography skills.

But he wants to give it to you.

that Praew was causing problems at the office.

I've decided that

I might break up with Praew.

00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:31,770
Please keep it a secret.

354
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,010
Okay.

355
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,900
I'll keep it a secret.

356
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,900
But you have to come with me.

357
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,840
Where?

358
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,640
I have to complete my work.

359
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:45,940
Just choose,

360
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,190
will you continue this work

361
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,170
or

362
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,050
you want to learn photography with me.

363
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:26,790
Or they...?

364
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,380
Go ahead!

365
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:14,280
Daonuea!

366
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,440
Why are you peeking here?

367
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,040
Ouch!

368
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,320
Quiet!

369
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:20,940
You're

370
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,650
ruining the plan.

371
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,480
What's your plan?

372
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,950
Why are you behaving weirdly in here?

373
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,890
Just look at them.

374
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,610
Everything is fine.

375
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,640
They just work.

376
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,030
It's not.

377
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,100
It looked like they were doing something bad.

378
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,530
Are you being too negative?

379
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,690
It's you

380
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,010
who doesn't know anything.

381
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,240
I'll go now.

382
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,220
Next step,

383
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,330
take pictures in any way to make it look good

384
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,250
and set the light up again.

385
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,200
You want me to set the lights?

386
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,340
Yes.

387
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,430
Hurry up.

388
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,040
Uh...

389
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,530
But I'm not good at that.

390
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,190
Ice.

391
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,450
Don't hesitate to start doing something

392
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,660
or fixing something.

393
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,340
Just trust your instincts.

394
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,110
Otherwise,

395
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,940
you'll stop loving your work one day.

396
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,100
Do you get it?

397
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:38,940
Yes.

398
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,240
Keep doing it.

399
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,200
Hey, they're about to kiss.

400
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,220
They're about to kiss!

401
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,720
How crazy is that?

402
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,410
Oh.

403
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,520
Daonuea.

404
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:04,860
Uh...

405
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,940
Hi.

406
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,400
What are you guys doing?

407
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,860
Uh...

408
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,290
Nine is teaching me photography.

409
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:12,880
Oh...

410
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:15,420
Uh...

411
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,220
That's great.

412
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,680
Have you completed the work I assigned you yet?

413
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,160
I totally forgot about it.

414
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,480
I‘ve got to go now.

415
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,440
Thank you so much.

416
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,290
I had a great time today.

417
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:48,890
You

418
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,970
don't know anything about timing.

419
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,090
Timing?

420
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,300
Who makes interruptions during photography tutorials?

421
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,300
Uh...

422
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:05,970
You should know that I have assigned several tasks to Ice.

423
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,330
He hasn't finished his work

424
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,210
because he is with you.

425
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,520
Why did you let him do your work?

426
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,120
What?

427
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,200
He was the one

428
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,200
who said he needed an internship.

429
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,260
So I assign him many tasks

430
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,480
to make it worthwhile.

431
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,800
Have you asked about his preferences?

432
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,740
Forcing him to do something he doesn't like

433
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,410
is useless.

434
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,890
But he should be responsible for his duties.

435
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,200
He shouldn't just follow his preferences.

436
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,290
You know how it feels

437
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,740
to do something

438
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,820
you don't like.

439
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,420
What do you mean?

440
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,140
I don't know.

441
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,260
I'm just saying.

442
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,040
You're...

443
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,300
narcissistic.

444
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,970
Is it okay?

445
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,480
Okay, this one

446
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,540
and this one too.

447
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:25,560
Okay.

448
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,020
Keep doing you work.

449
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,920
Okay.

450
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,200
(Why is it always like this?)

451
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,460
(I just want to thank him)

452
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,730
(It became a problem)

453
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,080
(Why did he have such strong self-centeredness?)

454
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,650
(He was always narcissistic)

455
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:49,580
(Ha)

456
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,290
(You think you're handsome, rich and you can get everything?)

457
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,460
(Take on a job you love?)

458
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:57,770
(You crazy)

459
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,530
Let's take here?

460
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,210
Yes.

461
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:02,520
Let's go.

462
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,320
Okay.

463
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,130
This one passed.

464
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,460
This one too.

465
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,660
Hey, Nine.

466
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,730
Where do you go after work?

467
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,080
It's none of your business.

468
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,360
You are hurting me.

469
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,370
I'm just looking for something to eat.

470
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,380
Will you accompany me?

471
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,370
Everyone,

472
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,660
let's eat dinner together tonight.

473
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,730
Nine will pay for us.

474
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,660
Alright.

475
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,220
I'll pay for you all.

476
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,930
Which restaurant will you guys go?

477
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,720
Same cafe, near our office.

478
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,080
Get up.

479
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,380
What are you doing?

480
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,100
Don't move.

481
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,100
It didn't take long.

482
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,489
I think

483
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,679
you have a discount from last time.

484
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,179
No!

485
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,340
I have many work.

486
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,940
Isn't it better to order food delivery?

487
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,889
I have many work.

488
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,080
Then...

489
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,080
Okay.

490
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,540
Let's order fried chicken.

491
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:51,940
Are you okay?

492
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,449
I'm okay with everything.

493
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,560
You generally love taking pictures, right?

494
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,080
Just sometimes.

495
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,940
But I shoot mostly nature, and landscape.

496
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,540
I'm not used to shooting commercials.

497
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,490
I heard from Tee that you are good at photography.

498
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,160
So I want to learn from you.

499
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:29,880
Sure.

500
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,100
Why are you still working on the paperwork?

501
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,930
Why not tell him about your favorite work directly?

502
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:45,200
I was worried that he would ignore it.

503
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:46,260
Hey.

504
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,200
Everyone here has no such idea.

505
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,050
If he really is interested in you,

506
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,890
no matter how you are,

507
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,970
he will eventually choose you.

508
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,140
Thank you.

509
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,300
Eat it.

510
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,690
Why are you sitting alone?

511
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,300
So...

512
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,450
where did the others go?

513
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,200
Huh?

514
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,090
I'm just contemplating something.

515
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,050
You?

516
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,970
You are?

517
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,890
What business do you have?

518
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,400
I just saw you sitting alone.

519
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,380
I think you will suffer from heatstroke and convulsions.

520
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:00,850
It's weird.

521
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,840
You usually don't follow me out like this.

522
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,410
Actually,

523
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,240
I want to talk about another matter.

524
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,900
Actually,

525
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,020
I shouldn't force him to work.

526
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,840
When he's with you

527
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,180

So I decided to reconcile with my ex.

At that time, she needed an opportunity to improve herself.

Why do you only make one cup?

Yeah, take it.
