2
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,800
Here.

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,680
Thank you.

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,080
Aren't you dressed too well?

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,080
Do you want to be handsome for your customers?

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,600
No.

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,200
I want to dress for you.

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,080
So you can see that I also have a handsome side.

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,680
Yeah.

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,800
Hey.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,800
When will you stop holding my hand?

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,880
If customers see it, they will misunderstand.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,680
I don't want to.

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
No one saw us.

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,680
Oh, hey?

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,800
Nine.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,800
I don't remember because your name was Mr. N.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Welcome.

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,680
Three months later, after The Air.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,200
It's been three months...

21
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,680
since he hasn't contacted me.

22
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,800
When can I give up on you?

23
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,880
For those who can't move on from your love,

24
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,200
we have a solution for you.

25
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Sometimes you have to delete all your memories with them

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,200
to create new memories.

27
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,800
It's hard to forget, isn't it?

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,680
He suddenly stopped contacting me.

29
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,480
He didn't reply to my messages.

30
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,400
Damn, he's really suck.

31
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,200
He didn't tell me his Facebook.

32
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,079
He didn't even tell me his Instagram.

33
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Why am I so unlucky?

34
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,880
Hello.

35
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,800
Hello. Daonuea.

36
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,480
Hey.

37
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,079
It's not work time.

38
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,880
Calm down, Daonuea.

39
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,080
Tee wants a meeting tomorrow about the company.

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,400
Why didn't you tell me on Line?

41
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,480
Yeah.

42
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,200
I don't understand either.

43
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,280
Why don't you guys talk?

44
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
Why did he let me tell you?

45
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,480
No!

46
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,800
I mean you.

47
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,800
Oh, really?

48
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,480
Sorry, bro.

49
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,000
See you at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,880
Bye bye.

51
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,280
What's wrong with him?

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,800
[Have you slept yet?]

53
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,680
He read it, but he didn't answer me.

54
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Maybe he's busy.

55
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,200
Daonuea.

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,480
Stop thinking about it.

57
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,880
He stopped contacting you for a long time.

58
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,280
For Pisces, your love is passive.

59
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,600
You still won't get what you hoped for.

60
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,200
You should care more about the people around you than the person.

61
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Because the people around you may want to reconcile with you.

62
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,000
Are you coming?

63
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,280
Let's start the meeting?

64
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,200
Have you eaten? Daonuea.

65
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,600
Uh... not yet.

66
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,880
But it's okay.

67
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,800
I heard you have an urgent matter.

68
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,080
Yeah.

69
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,080
But I already bought some porridge.

70
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,480
Let's eat together.

71
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's have a meeting after this.

72
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,080
So that we can come up with creative ideas.

73
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,800
Here.

74
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,800
Thank you.

75
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
Let's eat porridge.

76
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Tee.

77
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,679
I forgot to tell you that I don't like eggs like this.

78
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,400
Really?

79
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,800
I'll boil another egg for you.

80
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,200
Aw...

81
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,480
Next time if you buy it, you should ask me.

82
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,480
So you don't have to boil it.

83
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Okay.

84
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,000
Next time I'll ask you in detail.

85
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,080
Tee.

86
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,800
I like to eat a lot of ginger.

87
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,800
Next time, bring some ginger.

88
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,680
Okay.

89
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,280
Wait a minute.

90
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,880
Calm down.

91
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,800
I thought you'd forget about it.

92
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,480
Forget what?

93
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Nothing.

94
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,480
Hurry up and eat it.

95
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,480
The porridge will cool down.

96
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,200
Do you have anything else to do today?

97
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,800
I want to buy something for the office this evening.

98
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,800
If you have time, you can come with me.

99
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,600
Umm...

100
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,080
Okay.

101
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,680
I'll go with you because you bought me a porridge.

102
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,280
Eh...?

103
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,000
Or... the reason you bought me some porridge is...

104
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,800
because you need someone to go shopping with you, right?

105
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,800
Oh...

106
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,680
You're so cunning.

107
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's not.

108
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,600
I bought it because you haven't eaten.

109
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
I think it's right.

110
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,680
That's nonsense.

111
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,480
Why do you know better than me?

112
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,000
Am I wrong?

113
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,000
You're absolutely cunning.

114
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,800
You're like Loki in Marvel.

115
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,600
Sometimes I wonder,

116
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,600
if I wasn't here,

117
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,880
who would I be with

118
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,000
and what would I be doing?

119
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,080
Thank you.

120
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,480
Why are you thanking me?

121
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Nothing.

122
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,880
I just want to thank you.

123
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,080
Umm...

124
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,080
If you want to thank me,

125
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,080
I want...

126
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,480
What the hell are you doing?

127
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,400
Aren't we promised that we're not dating?

128
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,880
Why don't you invite me to eat too?

129
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
What?

130
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,680
You are late.

131
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,480
Even if your home is not far from the company.

132
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm not late, Tee.

133
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,800
Look at this.

134
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,280
Now 9 a.m.

135
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,800
Well.

136
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,080
I told you to find new employees, have you found them yet?

137
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,480
I didn't forget.

138
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,280
I think you forgot so I didn't find a new employee.

139
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,200
I'll find a new employee later.

140
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,200
But the porridge...

141
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,800
can I eat it?

142
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
It's right there. You can eat it.

143
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Over there?

144
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,200
Then I'll eat it now.

145
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,600
I'll go now.

146
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,600
I don't want to interrupt you guys.

147
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
I'm going to eat now.

148
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,400
Please eat a lot.

149
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Yeah.

150
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,280
I have to tell you that

151
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
after finishing the work last month.

152
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,880
There is almost no new work.

153
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,400
Now our company is almost unprofitable.

154
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,080
Of course.

155
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,880
Look at how bad the government of our country is.

156
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,280
Otherwise we would be able to continue working.

157
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,880
Who?

158
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
You want me to tell?

159
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,800
Yeah.

160
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,480
Why?

161
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
(I ask) because I don't know.

162
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,280
Let's continue the meeting.

163
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,080
Yes, let's continue the meeting.

164
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,200
We can't shoot a set that is far away.

165
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
We can't film if there are many people.

166
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,800
So we have to change our strategy.

167
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,280
Oh, Tee.

168
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,280
What about our old customers?

169
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,480
Now their old customers are all resting.

170
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,000
But...

171
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,800
You need to prepare a profile of our company

172
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,680
to prepare new client presentations.

173
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,480
Otherwise our company's finances will be bad.

174
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,000
Umm...

175
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,800
I think we should do an online profile?

176
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,200
In order to get more people to see our company profile.

177
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,400
Well.

178
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
Okay, good. Boat.

179
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,800
It's a good idea.

180
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,080
Then you are responsible for this work.

181
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,680
What?

182
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,080
Why me?

183
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,000
Why you not tell Daonuea to do it?

184
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,680
Boat.

185
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,400
It's your idea.

186
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,680
You should be responsible for it.

187
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,200
That's right.

188
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,200
Okay.

189
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,800
Daonuea, please contact the customer

190
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,480
and finish the work of the remaining old customers as well.

191
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,880
Sure.

192
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,280
I'll do it.

193
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,080
Don't forget our appointment this evening.

194
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,000
Okay.

195
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,480
Why do you guys have an appointment?

196
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,400
Don't tell me...

197
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,600
I go to work!

198
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,080
It's just working.

199
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,000
I have to clear the work.

200
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,600
Work, work, work.

201
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,880
I'm really annoyed with you.

202
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Work...

203
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Oh, okay.

204
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,480
Oh! Tee.

205
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,800
Do I have to do a profile?

206
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
It's okay if you won't do it,

207
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,280
but you won't get the bonus.

208
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,480
I don't have a choice, right?

209
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,280
Now we are at Breeze Cafe.

210
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,880
They say if you eat it, you want to come back here again!

211
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,080
With the person you came with?

212
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,080
What are you talking about?

213
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,280
It's all messed up.

214
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,400
I don't want to edit it.

215
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,600
Okay, sorry.

216
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,480
I'm not teasing you anymore.

217
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,400
Most importantly,

218
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,480
everyone look at this, it's very tasty.

219
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,800
It looks so soft and tasty.

220
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,680
You mean that dish or me?

221
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,280
I'll stop shooting videos.

222
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Why are you being mean to me?

223
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,880
You came to this cafe because you're going to tease me, right?

224
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
No.

225
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
I'm sorry.

226
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
I didn't mean that.

227
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,080
I just want you to eat something delicious.

228
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,880
Be careful of the ice cream melting.

229
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,600
Yeah.

230
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,680
Okay.

231
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,880
I'll eat it.

232
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,480
Even though he was the same as before,

233
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,000
why didn't I have any feelings for him?

234
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,080
But I thought,

235
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,200
if that was him,

236
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,480
what would it be?

237
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,800
Daonuea.

238
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,800
Bring the dish closer to your face.

239
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,880
Hurry up.

240
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,280
Closer.

241
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay.

242
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Smile.

243
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,680
I'll take now.

244
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,480
1,2...

245
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,599
One more.

246
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,800
1,2...

247
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,680
Closer?

248
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,480
How close do I have to be to hold it?

249
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,680
A little bit.

250
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
Okay.

251
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,680
Does it work?

252
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Will it fall?

253
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
It messes up your face.

254
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,480
Let me see.

255
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,000
Who are you missing?

256
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,480
You're not usually like this, are you?

257
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Nothing.

258
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,880
Nothing at all.

259
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,400
Just...

260
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm just space out.

261
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,480
What did you just say?

262
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,880
Oh, nothing.

263
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
I didn't say anything.

264
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,880
Do you want me to take you home?

265
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
It's okay.

266
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,600
I can go home by myself.

267
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,880
Anyway, I have a place I want to go after this.

268
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,400
Then...

269
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,080
Do you want me to go with you?

270
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,280
It's okay.

271
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,480
We are not dating.

272
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
If you do this,

273
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,080
people will think you took care of your boyfriend.

274
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,480
Be careful, you won't have a lover.

275
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,400
I don't think about other lovers.

276
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,680
So,

277
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,280
I'm leaving now.

278
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,680
Thank you for this meal.

279
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,280
I'll pay for the next meal.

280
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,600
Okay.

281
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,880
I think my friend has arrived.

282
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,000
I'll go now.

283
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,280
If you're home, please tell me.

284
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
What's wrong with him?

285
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,480
Why does he always act like this?

286
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,400
Boat.

287
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,600
We need to talk.

288
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Daonuea.

289
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,480
Why did you take out my airpods?

290
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,080
What do you want to say?

291
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,680
Let's talk outside.

292
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,280
I have something to ask you.

293
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,280
About what?

294
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,280
I have to work.

295
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,200
You have to send it to the customer later.

296
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,800
I also had to promote in the evening.

297
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Do you really need to speak now?

298
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,000
Really?

299
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,480
Are you working?

300
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,080
Yes.

301
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,800
I am working.

302
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,240
I see you dancing.

303
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,000
Well.

304
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,400
It might...

305
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,560
be necessary.

306
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,880
Be necessary...

307
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,840
However,

308
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,480
if I'm late for the work,

309
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,200
you're responsible for it.

310
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,440
Okay.

311
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,880
Let's go.

312
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,400
You promised.

313
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,200
I will help you.

314
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,280
Come with me.

315
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,000
Hey, Daonuea.

316
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,640
Calm down, I have to put the chair.

317
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,680
Hurry up.

318
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,000
Daonuea.

319
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,480
Calm down.

320
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,040
Boat.

321
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,400
Is it true that Tee will flirt with me again?

322
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Please tell him to stop.

323
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,960
It's about both of you.

324
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,640
I'm not involved.

325
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
I don't want to be involved.

326
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,960
It doesn't matter.

327
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,160
Please tell him to me.

328
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,640
I don't want to be awkward like this.

329
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,240
Awkward?

330
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,240
I see you like it, isn't it?

331
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,760
I didn't like it.

332
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,080
Not at all.

333
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,960
He pushed me too much.

334
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,960
He also made that facial expression.

335
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,200
Is this a good idea?

336
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,240
You should date him.

337
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
No.

338
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,080
Now I don't want to date anyone.

339
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,520
Don't tell me

340
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,400
the reason you don't want to date anyone

341
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
is because you still missing of the person you met at The Air

342
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,600
as the person you used to…

343
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Like that.

344
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,160
It's hurt.

345
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,960
Yeah.

346
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,000
As you said.

347
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,200
I won't tell you anything.

348
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,360
Do you know his name, surname, address, place of work?

349
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,640
No.

350
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,080
What?

351
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,680
How did you fall in love with him?

352
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,280
Or...

353
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,480
About...

354
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,960
It's hurt, Daonuea.

355
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,880
I didn't mean that.

356
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah.

357
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,600
It is a human right to fall in love with someone.

358
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,600
Actually,

359
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,560
if you can't give up on your love,

360
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,960
you should contact him.

361
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,280
You should ask him for a meal

362
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,520
or tell him exactly how you feel.

363
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,560
You don't have to think alone.

364
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,960
Be careful, you're going crazy.

365
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,680
I text him every day.

366
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,440
He didn't answer me.

367
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,880
As for finding out about him...

368
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,560
I searched for pictures of him

369
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,480
or searched on Instagram

370
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,560
but I couldn't find anything.

371
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,080
Did you fall in love with a ghost?

372
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,600
I got goosebumps.

373
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,680
It's not, Boat.

374
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,400
If it's impossible

375
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,720
or too difficult,

376
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,600
you should give up.

377
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,720
If you miss him like this,

378
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,720
when can you start a new relationship?

379
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,240
But...

380
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,880
Stop saying 'but'.

381
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Do you know?

382
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,480
He texts me 24 hours a day where you go.

383
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,800
It's not right.

384
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,120
Wait.

385
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,880
What do you mean?

386
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,600
You and Tee have a secret plan about me?

387
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,920
No.

388
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,040
I didn't mean that.

389
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,840
No, not at all.

390
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,400
Don't make excuses!

391
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,320
You!

392
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,000
What?

393
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,400
I told the facts that I saw.

394
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,080
You don't see it?

395
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,080
He always asks you what you want to eat or where to go.

396
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,360
You're the one who keeps running away.

397
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,760
What if in the end the relationship ended the same again?

398
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,000
Daonuea.

399
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,200
I'm really sorry.

400
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,080
I didn't mean to do that to you.

401
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,200
Umm.

402
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,160
Actually,

403
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,800
I know you're talking to that person behind my back.

404
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,280
But actually...

405
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,360
We are in a talking stage.

406
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,200
You're not wrong.

407
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,360
That you talking to other people.

408
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,360
I really love you.

409
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,040
Otherwise ,

410
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,160
I don't produce,

411
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,920
don't do production here

412
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,280
and don't indulge you like this.

413
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,560
You can say it.

414
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,680
So should I talk to other people too?

415
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,120
Please, Daonuea.

416
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,400
We should go back to being friends.

417
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,960
We can be partners as before.

418
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,960
So we don't have an uncomfortable relationship like this.

419
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,480
Please.

420
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,640
Wait, Daonuea.

421
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,760
Listen to me.

422
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,880
You should give him a chance.

423
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,240
No one would want to make the same mistake a second time.

424
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,040
Yesterday you picked up the wrong bag for my shirt.

425
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,520
What?

426
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,200
Why don't you tell me?

427
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,680
I fell asleep as soon as I got home.

428
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,000
You can send me a Line message

429
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,040
if I pick up something wrong again.

430
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,560
It's okay.

431
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,560
It doesn't matter.

432
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,760
It's just a shirt.

433
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,920
No.

434
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,120
If you do this

435
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,880
I will...

436
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,960
Tee!

437
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,240
You know I don't like it.

438
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,520
If you do this, I won't be with you anymore.

439
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,000
Daonuea.

440
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm sorry.

441
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,200
I didn't mean to tease you.

442
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,880
I just want to surprise you.

443
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,000
What's the surprise?

444
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,800
They don't usually give cakes at night?

445
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,800
It's noon.

446
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
What about candles?

447
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,360
Where is the candle?

448
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,360
I don't want to do like the others.

449
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,000
You're crazy.

450
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,080
Come on.

451
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,440
If there are no candles, you can blow fakes.

452
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,480
Here.

453
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,640
Yea~

454
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,200
Are you funny?

455
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,560
Huh?

456
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,000
If you want to blow out the candles,

457
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,120
would you like to blow out my candles?

458
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,320
You're cunning.

459
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,920
I'm just kidding.

460
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:39,800
Here.

461
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,400
Let's eat cake.

462
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,200
Okay.

463
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
I forgive you.

464
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,880
I will...

465
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,720
I'll call you to take it back.

466
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,920
Take you?

467
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,880
A shirt!

468
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,160
Are you thinking about obscene?

469
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,920
No.

470
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,680
I really didn't think that way.

471
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,760
I swear.

472
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,920
I not believe you.

473
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,560
Or...

474
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,480
Should I give him a chance?

475
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,640
Or should I just give it up?

476
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,600
Hello, for anyone who wants to give up on love, you should listen to me.

477
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,720
Don't miss out on the (not) secret tips from Kapper.

478
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,000
Don't wait anymore.

479
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,680
Can I believe him?

480
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,520
Hey.

481
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,880
My tips are 100% reliable.

482
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,920
Fu*k.

483
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,320
Does he know I'm listening to him?

484
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,560
Hey, listen.

485
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,000
The first step, don't let it last longer,

486
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
get rid of anything close to you

487
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,720
that reminds you of them first.

488
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,480
Not only is it good for you,

489
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,400
but you can quickly forget your old love.

490
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,240
The important thing...

491
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,480
You have to burn it!

492
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,680
Burn it!

493
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,040
Huh?

494
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,360
Burn?

495
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,080
That's right! You have to burn everything.

496
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,920
You will be able to forget them.

497
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,440
It's way too cruel.

498
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,840
So...

499
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,400
I'll keep it in the locker.

500
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,000
Okay.

501
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,360
I've done it.

502
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,480
The next step,

503
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,600
old surroundings remind you of old memories.

504
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,679
Why don't you try changing the atmosphere to make your room look fresher?

505
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,199
You can use exercise equipment as your loneliness companion.

506
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,760
It works.

507
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,239
The next step,

508
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:58,280
They say that changing yourself into a new person will make you remember who you are,

509
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,440
more than you think about that person.

510
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,520
New styles can help you too.

511
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,520
Wow.

512
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,480
Wow, Daonuea.

513
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,600
Why are you so cool today?

514
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,600
So cool.

515
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,920
Your hair is cool too.

516
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,080
Your pants are beautiful too.

517
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
Your shoes too.

518
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,600
Look at your hair.

519
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,080
Hey.

520
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,840
Continue your work.

521
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,680
You're so cool.

522
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,080
Okay, I'll continue to work.

523
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,200
Oh, right. Tee!

524
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,640
It's your bag.

525
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,000
Next time you'll have to call me

526
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,360
if I picked up something wrong.

527
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,360
Okay.

528
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,440
Did you change your dressing style?

529
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,200
It's not your usual style.

530
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,240
Yeah.

531
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,400
I just thought I should change something.

532
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,320
How do I look?

533
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,960
Do you like it?

534
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,080
I...

535
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,680
like it.

536
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
I've never seen you dress like this before.

537
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,200
You really like it?

538
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,400
If it's not good, you can tell me.

539
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,720
I'm not angry with you.

540
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,000
Hey.

541
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,040
I really like it.

542
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,880
Thank you.

543
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,600
What's wrong, Tee?

544
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,440
Uh...

545
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,320
Boat made a profile of our company

546
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,000
so I want you to check if it works.

547
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,680
Yeah. Okay.

548
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,200
Wait a minute.

549
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,040
Umm... okay.

550
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,880
Hey! He's very good at editing.

551
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,400
I remember this job because the client wanted the actor's face to be brighter

552
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,280
so we had to reshoot.

553
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,800
The last one.

554
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,640
Sometimes, being open to new relationships with the people around you,

555
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,280
may find someone who loves you.

556
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,000
And most importantly, it will help you forget your old love.

557
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,520
Tee.

558
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,520
Would you like to watch with me?

559
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,360
Yeah.

560
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,520
Okay.

561
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,160
How was it? Do you like it?

562
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,800
Yeah.

563
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,280
The editor is very skilled.

564
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,800
I think he's good at bragging.

565
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,840
Ahem.

566
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,880
I heard it.

567
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,840
If you will gossip about me, please lower your voice.

568
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,120
I complimented you.

569
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,920
I didn't gossip you.

570
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,320
Yeah, okay. You compliment me.

571
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Have you uploaded it yet?

572
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,880
Oh, yes.

573
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,760
I uploaded it before you arrived.

574
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,840
Then I will send it to the customer.

575
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,520
I should update with them.

576
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,840
Okay.

577
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,200
Tee, are you not working?

578
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,200
Oh.

579
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,520
Do you have time today? Daonuea.

580
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,560
Do you want to eat together?

581
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,080
Or...

582
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,560
You can order delivery here.

583
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,040
It depends on your convenience.

584
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,320
Umm. I'm okay with all of it.

585
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,400
Okay.

586
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,800
So...

587
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm going to continue my work.

588
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,240
Yeah.

589
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,320
Let's work.

590
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,880
You're good at other people's business.

591
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,320
I'm just worried about you.

592
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,720
Would you like to drink water?

593
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,560
I have a hand,

594
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,800
I can pick it up myself.

595
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,880
You are mean to me.

596
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,000
Your favorite brand of fried chicken has arrived.

597
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,760
It's delicious.

598
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,560
Where is Boat?

599
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,880
Did he not eat it?

600
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,320
Normally, if he knew we were ordering food, he would have run like lightning.

601
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,080
It's good, he should go home.

602
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,320
I can't pay him every meal.

603
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,040
Hey, Tee.

604
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,560
If you say so,

605
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,120
he will sulky.

606
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,120
After that, you reconcile him.

607
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,120
Aren't you going live?

608
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,800
Usually you always live.

609
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,080
I don't know.

610
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,720
I want a social detox.

611
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,720
Using social media for a long time is causing headaches.

612
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,840
Oh...

613
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,680
You're like a new person.

614
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,720
What?

615
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,920
I am the same person as before.

616
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,320
Please say it right.

617
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,800
Yeah.

618
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,400
Let's eat some chicken, it's getting cold.

619
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,760
Here.

620
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,320
I have a hand.

621
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,120
Oh.

622
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,520
Oh, it's hot.

623
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,840
You said you had hands, didn't you?

624
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,360
Take it.

625
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,840
You don't need to do this to me.

626
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,920
It's okay.

627
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,360
I'm willing.

628
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,160
If I don't do it,

629
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,960
will you eat chicken with me?

630
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,360
If you tell me, I have to eat it anyway.

631
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,120
You didn't tell me.

632
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:40,920
Hey.

633
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,160
What do you do?

634
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,480
Do you use your hand to hold the fried chicken?

635
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,680
You know? It takes me a long time to set my hair to find a look that works for me.

636
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,680
My hands are not stained.

637
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,360
Look at my hands. Is it stained?

638
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,200
Your hands are full of oil, hey!

639
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
Tee!

640
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,800
I'm just going to style your hair.

641
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,440
- I'm just going to style your hair.
- It's all messed up.

642
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,040
Tee! Stop!

643
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,960
I will take revenge!

644
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,360
Boat.

645
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,480
Yeah.

646
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,720
Come here.

647
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,240
Umm...

648
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,400
I want to scale up here.

649
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,040
- This file?
- Yes.

650
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,520
I think you have to fix 2 places here.

651
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,120
I think it's better than this one.

652
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,480
Ok, I'll fix it in the evening.

653
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,480
No problem.

654
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,880
Tee, do customers contact you?

655
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,320
Not yet.

656
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,680
We have to keep waiting.

657
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,400
Besides,

658
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,280
the economy is bad right now.

659
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,320
Not many people want to invest.

660
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:00,840
Fighting.

661
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,640
It's okay.

662
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,760
We will definitely have customers soon.

663
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,960
Our work is excellent.

664
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,960
Yeah. I think so.

665
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,040
You're awesome.

666
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,280
And...

667
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,680
Hey!

668
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,840
Someone contacted me by email.

669
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,680
Really?

670
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,680
Here.

671
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,840
Wow, really?

672
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,720
We have customers?

673
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,080
Umm...

674
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,200
Mister N... Are you sure?

675
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,640
Isn't it a scammer?

676
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,760
I think it's weird.

677
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,760
Umm...

678
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,480
Yes.

679
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,320
Notice from the way he writes,

680
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,760
I think it comes from a real person.

681
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,720
Umm... but I think...

682
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,720
He doesn't seem trustworthy.

683
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,680
Why does he have to ask for more information about our company

684
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,480
when we have a portfolio?

685
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,600
Moreover, his first and last name

686
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,920
was not written at all.

687
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,560
Wow.

688
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,320
But they say they will support our ad production.

689
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,840
But what does this mean?

690
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,360
They want to invest with us?

691
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,960
Okay,

692
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,440
we must meet with him

693
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,800
to be more confident and understand.

694
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,440
Okay.

695
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,880
Hey.

696
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,800
I want to high five with you.

697
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,760
Hang in there.

698
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,000
Daonuea.

699
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,800
Are you sleeping, right?

700
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,080
I'll blackmail you.

701
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,480
Black and white.

702
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,600
I'll print it.

703
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,240
Wow.

704
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,280
It's very similar to him.

705
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,400
The picture is very obvious.

706
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,640
Should I paste it here?

707
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,080
Here? No.

708
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,440
Here?

709
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,680
No.

710
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,800
Let's work.

711
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:49,920
What?

712
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,080
Where has Tee gone? Boat.

713
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,480
Tee... He went to do business.

714
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,800
I think he came back late at night.

715
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,880
And...

716
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,880
Have you reconciled?

717
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,600
Look at you!

718
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,720
Daonuea!

719
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,920
Why did you hit me?

720
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,280
Hey.

721
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,200
Why are you curious about other businesses?

722
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,160
Hey, hey.

723
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,560
When you guys are in love,

724
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,360
are you suddenly leaving me alone?

725
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,200
Leaving what?

726
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,880
That's nonsense.

727
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,520
I'll go home.

728
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,840
Oh.

729
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,880
Remember to turn off the lights and everything.

730
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,080
Last time, you didn't turn off the lights.

731
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,400
I will tell Tee.

732
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,360
Yeah.

733
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,160
Telltale...

734
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,680
I mean brothers, you and I are brothers.

735
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,240
You heard wrong.

736
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,280
I just forgot to turn off the light, why do you have to tell him?

737
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,520
He said he would eat with me today, didn't he?

738
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,240
I'll leaving now.

739
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,280
Let's continue work.

740
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,560
Hey.

741
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,840
Why are you in my house?

742
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,680
Wait.

743
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,320
Will you light candles and blow balloons?

744
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,560
The balloon will explode! Don't blow it.

745
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,640
Tell me what you will do.

746
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,680
Are you planning with Boat? Huh?

747
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,240
No.

748
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,040
I didn't do that.

749
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,840
I do it all alone.

750
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,680
If it caught on fire,

751
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,560
wouldn't my house burn?

752
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,600
What if you die?

753
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,440
I'm sorry.

754
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,680
I've made a mistake.

755
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,880
I say because I'm worried about you.

756
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,200
Don't do this again.

757
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,640
Okay, I'm not mad anymore.

758
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,120
Get up now.

759
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,560
What do you want?

760
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,240
I just...

761
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,800
want to have a relationship with you.

762
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,280
Are you okay with it? Daonuea.

763
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,240
Can we be the same as before?

764
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,960
When we weren't friends like now.

765
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,080
Okay.

766
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,320
What relationship status do you want?

767
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,120
Can I be your boyfriend?

768
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,680
Did you skip the relationship status?

769
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,000
Huh?

770
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,960
I don't want to waste my time with other people.

771
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,800
If I'm okay,

772
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,240
can I be your lover later?

773
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,480
Okay.

774
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,360
According to your comfortable.

775
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,120
Then...

776
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,160
Are we back in the relationship as before?

777
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:50,760
Yeah.

778
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:21,640
Here.

779
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,120
Keep fighting.

780
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,280
Don't worry.

781
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,800
I'll help you.

782
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,480
Thank you.

783
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,080
Oh!

784
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,760
Is he coming?

785
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,760
Mr...

786
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,880
Mr. N or something.

787
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:39,840
Oh.

788
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,680
He's probably on his way.

789
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,120
Then...

790
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,320
I'll make coffee for you.

791
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:50,840
Okay.

792
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,800
Keep fighting!

793
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,000
Okay.

794
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,000
Hey, when will you stop holding my hand?

795
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,720
No.

796
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,200
No one saw us.

797
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,960
Hey, Nine.

798
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,680
I don't remember because your name was Mr. N.

799
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,280
Welcome.

800
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,600
How are you? Tee.

801
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,720
I haven't seen you in a long time.

802
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,680
Since when?

803
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,680
3 years ago?

804
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,280
When we were still studying.

805
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,520
Yes.

806
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,640
My friend and I can't contact you.

807
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,720
You don't use social media too.

808
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,800
You just post pictures of views when using social media.

809
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,760
So I don't know how you are.

810
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,000
For me it doesn't change.

811
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,760
I just want to find something to do lately.

812
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,400
Let's go inside and talk.

813
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,040
I forgot to introduce him.

814
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,640
This is Daonuea. He is...

815
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,240
Tee's partner.

816
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,760
Hey, Nine.

817
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,200
Did you know him before?
