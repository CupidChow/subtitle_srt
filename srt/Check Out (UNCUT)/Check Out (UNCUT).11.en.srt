Before you go back.

3
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,880
Let's play some game?

4
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,520
What game?

5
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,670
You haven't slept yet?

6
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,850
I can't sleep.

7
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,120
Are you still not tired?

8
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,390
I'm tired.

9
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,680
But I'm...

10
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,600
Nine.

11
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:33,610
What?

12
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:35,870
Nothing.

13
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,060
I'm just calling you.

14
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,260
You don't want to call me something else?

15
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,800
Umm...

16
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,970
What would you like me to call you?

17
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:50,960
Daddy?

18
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,920
Daonuea.

19
00:05:59,480 --> 00:05:59,800
Huh?

20
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:01,920
Nothing.

21
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,320
I just wanted to call you too.

22
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,620
You crazy.

23
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,810
Come here.

24
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,860
Do you want me to make you some warm milk?

25
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,260
So that you can sleep well.

26
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,580
So, what should I do

27
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:34,770
to make you sleep well?

28
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,570
Just keep still.

29
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,880
(Last night,)

30
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,450
(it felt like a dream)

31
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,659
Hey.

32
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,380
Nine.

33
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,760
What are you doing?

34
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,320
Our breakfast.

35
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,059
Hmm?

36
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,250
What are you preparing?

37
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,170
A sandwich.

38
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,540
We need to recharge.

39
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,730
Last night,

40
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,660
you made me exhausted.

41
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,160
Huh?

42
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,480
Why are you bringing it up again?

43
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,770
I'll cook for you.

44
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:07,730
You only have to wait.

45
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,040
No.

46
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,130
Just stay here.

47
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,690
I'll cook for you.

48
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,290
Okay.

49
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,300
What?

50
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,720
Hey? What is this?

51
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,300
It's ham.

52
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,880
But it's already become yellow like bacon.

53
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,410
Is it burning?

54
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,280
Look at this.

55
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,380
It doesn't burn.

56
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,880
Are you teasing me?

57
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,320
Huh?

58
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,510
Is it tasty?

59
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,000
What are you doing? Daonuea.

60
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,400
Nothing.

61
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,010
What have I done to you?

62
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,450
I'm late.

63
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,630
I have to go now.

64
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,010
Okay.

65
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,480
Let me know when you get home.

66
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,860
Bye.

67
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,630
(How would Nine characterize me?)

68
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,370
(Ouch...)

69
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,120
(I don't want to think about it)

70
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,000
[Lodestar Production]

71
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,180
(Whose boyfriend is sleeping in the office?)

72
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,440
(It's a rare picture)

73
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,180
What are you doing? Boat.

74
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,590
Nothing.

75
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,150
I didn't do anything.

76
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,210
It's you.

77
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,810
What have you done?

78
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,550
You didn't sleep?

79
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,410
I didn't do anything.

80
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,570
I guess you spent all night.

81
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,180
What are you saying?

82
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:38,540
Stop.

83
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,070
Calm down.

84
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,880
Calm down.

85
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,540
Don't do anything to me.

86
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,970
Don't be afraid of being incriminated.

87
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,920
I'll keep working.

88
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,330
(I don't concentrate)

89
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,600
(Or should I take some pictures today?)

90
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,500
Boat.

91
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,490
Has anyone seen my camera?

92
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,950
Oh, Nine.

93
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,380
There is no one else.

94
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,340
Him.

95
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,380
It's him.

96
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:00,840
Hey?

97
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,400
Why did the camera turn dark?

98
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,660
Oh.

99
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,359
Nine.

100
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,480
I'm sorry.

101
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,410
I'm contemplating bringing you a camera.

102
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,700
But I want to take a few more pictures.

103
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,510
I don't think it's 'few'.

104
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,369
You are using it well.

105
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,930
Why don't you tell Tee to buy your personal camera?

106
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,319
Your camera is easy to use.

107
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,200
Also, I've used a camera like this before.

108
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,370
Oh.

109
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,860
Have you entered the contest with your picture?

110
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,120
Yes.

111
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,100
Oh.

112
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,370
How do you know?

113
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,770
I saw an application on your desk the other day.

114
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,140
Oh...

115
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:48,790
Yeah.

116
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,260
Actually,

117
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,850
it's close to the announcement date.

118
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,290
Anyway, please update me.

119
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,980
If you ever need help, you can always tell me.

120
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,040
Thank you, Nine.

121
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,300
What are you guys doing?

122
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,980
Oh.

123
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,010
Tee.

124
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,940
I think you're on leave today.

125
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,770
Why am I taking leave?

126
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,360
Do you know?

127
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,230
I have now appointed Ice as a full-time employee.

128
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,780
How was it?

129
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,570
It looks good, right?

130
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,570
You have to wear it too, Nine.

131
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:24,850
Hold on.

132
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,020
Do I really have to wear it?

133
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,840
It's humorous, Tee.

134
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,440
Yeah.

135
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,980
So that others know what we do.

136
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,200
Then

137
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,900
I'll wear it for you, Ice.

138
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,180
It's done.

139
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,570
Nine.

140
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,580
You too.

141
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,850
No.

142
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,820
I don't wear it.

143
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:09,810
Keep it with you.

144
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,560
Huh?

145
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,500
You...

146
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,850
If so, you won't get your salary.

147
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,330
Yes, you don't have to pay it to me.

148
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,510
It's better to take my salary and buy a camera for Ice.

149
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,150
I'll take this.

150
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
Thank you, Tee.

151
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,520
Yes.

152
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:47,970
Congratulations.

153
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,060
Oh?

154
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,000
Have you eaten?

155
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,340
Do you want me to make you something?

156
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,340
It's okay.

157
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,060
I already ate.

158
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,140
Who are you eating with?

159
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,320
I ordered food delivery to the office

160
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,300
with

161
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,010
everyone.

162
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,110
Oh.

163
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,990
How's the office today?

164
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,870
Umm...

165
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:41,990
It's good.

166
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,060
It has more clients.

167
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:50,620
But it seems your farewell party has to be postponed.

168
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,570
But I'm telling everyone it's going to happen this week.

169
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,400
Actually, it's okay if there's no party.

170
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,300
This office is always overacting.

171
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:06,970
Let me see.

172
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,140
How is your job application?

173
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,100
Oh.

174
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,220
Well.

175
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,620
Look at this.

176
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,980
Actually,

177
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,030
I've checked and submitted the application.

I'm free right now.

I didn't have to work hard,

00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,400
I'll keep doing my work.

355
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,750
Uh, Ice.

356
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,840
I want to ask you something.

357
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,650
Yes.

358
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,320
Are you satisfied working here?

359
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,490
l like here.

360
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,080
So,

361
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,370
would you mind

362
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,200
if I made you a full-time employee here?

363
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,840
But...

364
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,630
Tee.

365
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,920
I haven't graduated yet.

366
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,090
Not right now.

367
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,650
I mean the remaining two months.

368
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,650
Of course, Tee.

369
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,400
Thank you so much.

370
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,220
Uh.

371
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,880
Did you see Boat?

372
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,930
He suddenly disappeared.

373
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,300
I think he's definitely with Candy.

374
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,150
There can only be one cause.

375
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,280
Boat, you're...

376
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,120
Which one would you like to watch?

377
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,280
This one. It's funny.

378
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,370
Oh?

379
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,370
Are you sick? Honey.

380
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,870
Here.

381
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,090
No.

382
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,140
Because someone misses me?

383
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,200
It must be your workplace.

384
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,200
You leave the office without informing anybody.

385
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,120
You should inform Tee.

386
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,200
He might be worried about you.

387
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,990
I have finished all my work.

388
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,420
Today

389
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,210
I want to be with my baby.

390
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,600
You are so sweet. So cute.

391
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,240
Really?

392
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,550
Whose boyfriend is he?

393
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,820
So cute.

394
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,600
I should get a reward.

395
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,240
Oh?

396
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,160
Hey!

397
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,880
Honey, it's nothing.

398
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,720
What are you shocked about?

399
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,400
Can you protect me if something happens to me?

400
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,080
Usually, I'm not that easily shocked.

401
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,800
But it's Nine's house.

402
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,840
If Nine saw us together,

403
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,070
he wouldn't say anything?

404
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,790
Nine's house is like my home.

405
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,800
Besides, if he came,

406
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,010
he would have came back a long time ago.

407
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,810
It's been 3 days now.

408
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,800
Nine might be with Daonuea right now.

409
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,920
Okay.

410
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,170
I won't be scared anymore.

411
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:44,940
Yeah.

412
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,690
I'll protect my baby.

413
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,800
What are you doing? You crazy.

414
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,650
What should be done about an obstinate child?

415
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,880
Don't do it, Boat.

416
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,360
Do I have to punish you?

417
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,350
Don't do it.

418
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,410
Hey.

419
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,820
What are you doing in my house?

420
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,330
You're misunderstanding.

421
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,740
I just eat popcorn.

422
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,910
Why does Nine look so angry?

423
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,070
I don't know.

424
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:34,810
How?

425
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:35,890
Well.

426
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,800
Who can speak up about what happened?

427
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:45,880
Alright.

428
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,380
I'll tell you.

429
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,750
Because you weren't home for several days

430
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,530
and I was lonely staying at home alone,

431
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,920
so I called Boat to watch a movie with me.

432
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,150
Why is my sofa so crumpled?

433
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,150
I took a nap for a while.

434
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,870
And we're not doing what you're thinking.

435
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,430
You can't think about it. Because it's nothing, right?

436
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,320
Yes, we only watch movies.

437
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,110
My house is in a mess.

438
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:18,250
Okay, I'll call the maid for you.

439
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:19,960
Hurry up.

440
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:23,840
Get your belongings out of my home as soon as possible, Candy.

441
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,620
Hey, Nine.

442
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,020
You kicked me out of the house?

443
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,600
I can't come here again?

444
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,720
Candy.

445
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:33,730
Calm down.

446
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,160
Daonuea will come to my house.

447
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,970
Do you think he'd want to come back

448
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,540
after seeing this mess?

449
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,070
Okay, sure.

450
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,150
I'll clean it up for you.

451
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,670
I'll clean it up.

452
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,380
Help me.

453
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,550
Hurry up.

454
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,520
You didn't really kick me out, did you?

455
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,720
I kicked you out. You must take your baggage away.

456
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,870
After this, where can I watch it?

457
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,750
Contact me first.

458
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,160
I'll also bring Boat here?

459
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:05,700
See you later.

460
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,700
I'll take my belongings back first.

461
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,260
Do you want some cookie?

462
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,000
Wow.

463
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,650
Your house is so beautiful.

464
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,240
Of course.

465
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,770
Tonight...

466
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:02,870
Huh?

467
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,580
Please stay here.

468
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,200
Yeah.

469
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,100
This is...

470
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,050
your mother?

471
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:33,520
Yes.

472
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,980
My name is Daonuea.

473
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,800
Please look after me.

474
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,360
From now on, I will take good care of Nine.

475
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,830
I think

476
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,360
my mother already knew it.

477
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,470
I will make your Nine no longer lonely.

478
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,280
Usually,

479
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,290
I'm not lonely.

480
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:11,270
Huh?

481
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,060
Really?

482
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,550
Yes.

483
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,870
We're

484
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,520
the same in every way.

485
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,240
Where?

486
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:28,720
Huh?

487
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,420
What are you doing?

488
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:34,880
I look for the point where we are similar.

489
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,020
It isn't.

490
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,950
Umm...

491
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,630
In the past,

492
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,880
I didn't live with my mother either.

493
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,220
My mother left me since I was a child.

494
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:53,370
Now I only have my adoptive mother.

495
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,990
My condolences to you.

496
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,680
It's okay.

497
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,160
From now on,

498
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,170
Huh?

499
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,090
you don't have to be lonely anymore.

500
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:33,880
What do you mean?

501
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,840
I was never lonely from the first.

502
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,930
It's you who are lonely.

503
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:46,740
It's true.

504
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:49,690
I'm so lonely.

505
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:52,960
If I could exchange it,

506
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,200
I would exchange my money

507
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,370
and everything I had,

508
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,300
bring my mother back.

509
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,330
It's alright.

510
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:14,810
However, we must continue to live in the present.

511
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:16,400
No matter what.

512
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,130
Is that right?

513
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:18,980
Huh?

514
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:20,400
Hmm?

515
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,320
Huh?

516
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,260
Huh?

517
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,360
Hey, Nine!

518
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,300
Your mother is watching.

519
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,190
Will you kiss me in front of your mother?

520
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,620
Please be considerate of her.

521
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:39,920
So...

522
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,600
Would you like to see the stars in my room?

523
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,080
Yeah.

524
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:50,800
Nine.

525
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:52,690
Calm down.

526
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,910
I'm ticklish.

527
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,090
Hey!

528

00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:31,820
Punish him.

705
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,120
Come on.

706
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,830
I can't believe that

707
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,800
in the end,

708
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,520
we'll stay together this long.

709
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,840
I don't want Daonuea to leave us.

710
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,240
Alright, Tee.

711
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,850
Aren't humans live to leave?

712
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,440
Someday I might have to move as well.

713
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,060
Where will you move? Boat.

714
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:01,420
Yes, where will you move? Baby.

715
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,400
I'm going to move...

716
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:05,610
to live with my baby.

717
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,510
My boyfriend is so cute!

718
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:16,540
Is it ripe yet?

719
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,800
Yes.

720
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:19,800
Baby.

721
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,550
Please taste the dipping sauce here.

722
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,520
Okay, hold on.

723
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:23,940
Okay.

724
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,160
Tee.

725
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,620
I'll be back.

726
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:27,210
Yes.

727
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:29,950
I'm here, baby.

728
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:30,940
Taste it.

729
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:31,700
Which one?

730
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:32,370
This one.

731
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,110
Can I taste it too?

732
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:34,650
Sure!

733
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:45,140
Oh!

734
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:46,040
Tee.

735
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,150
The person you're dating, isn't he here today?

736
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:50,820
Yes.

737
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,770
But I invited him as a matter of courtesy.

738
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,120
Oh.

739
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,120
You won't be lonely, right?

740
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:57,900
What do you mean?

741
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,120
Many of us are gathered here.

742
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:06,630
Tee.

743
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:08,680
I have something to tell you.

744
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:09,580
Oh, Ice.

745
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:10,840
Please help me something.

746
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:13,450
Please pick up the phone for me.

747
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:15,980
It's in my pocket.

748
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:17,840
Sure, Tee.

749
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:23,730
From Daonuea.

750
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:24,590
Okay.

751
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:29,300
Hi, Daonuea.

752
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,120
Suddenly, I couldn't go there.

753
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,720
Please move to another day?

754
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,040
Oh?

755
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,160
But we prepared a lot of food for you.

756
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:41,410
Aren't you really come here?

757
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:43,730
I'm really sorry, Tee.

758
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:46,150
Where are you now?

759
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:49,240
I'm about to get home.

760
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,150
Are you okay, right?

761
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,510
If anything happens to you, you can tell me.

762
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,270
Thank you, Tee.

763
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,440
Yeah.

764
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,250
Tee, is Daonuea okay?

765
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,700
I don't think so.

766
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,730
He suddenly didn't come.

767
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:11,320
Uh...

768
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,060
Tee.

769
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,820
I have to leave now.

770
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:17,440
I forgot something.

771
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:21,150
Nine, are you really going back?

772
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,100
I'll be back.

773
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,200
Huh?

774
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:28,670
Ice.

775
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:30,240
Please roast it for me.

776
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,720
Oh, Tee. You too?

777
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:39,900
Oh, they're all gone.

778
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,150
There was just the three of us.

779
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:42,890
What should we do next?

780
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,080
You ask what should we do next?

781
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:47,480
Just party! Baby.

782
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,560
Oh, it's true.

783
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,880
It's nice because if there are fewer people, we can eat more.

784
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,520
Yes.

785
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:05,430
Top.

786
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,690
How did you get into my house?

787
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,740
I'm just here to say farewell

788
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,010
and...

789
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:21,130
I'll have last wonderful night with you

790
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:22,950
before I go to study abroad.

791
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:31,210
I'm sorry.

792
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:33,730
I have a boyfriend now.

793
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:40,170
Is he a guy with a cute face?

794
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:42,820
Yes.

795
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:46,400
Where is he now?

796
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:49,880
I'm screwed.

797
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:04,610
Here, your water.

798
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,670
Thank you.

799
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:35,360
Uh...

800
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,200
You...

801
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,000
What is your relationship with Nine?

802
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,370
I'm his friend.

803
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:47,260
Oh, yes.

804
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,960
Umm, I think Nine will be back soon.

805
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:52,800
Oh.

806
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:53,630
Yes.

807
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:01,840
But...

808
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:03,970
What is your relationship with Nine?

809
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,170
Oh...

810
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,760
I'm...

811
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:11,860
his...

812
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:13,880
friend.

813
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,070
Oh.

814
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,630
Are you a friend like me?

815
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,050
How is it?

816
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,430
It's... like that.

817
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:29,560
Like...

818
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:37,850
Let me...

819
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,470
use the phone for a moment.

820
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:30,080
Hey, you.

821
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:32,760
Please answer me.

822
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,520
What is your real relationship with Nine?

823
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,560
I'm FWB just like you.

824
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:40,200
Friend with benefits.

825
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:52,480
Why is your facial expression like that?

826
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,750
Aren't you the same as me?

827
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,240
Damn it!

828
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,280
What is this?

829
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,570
Damn.

830
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:07,720
What does it mean?

831
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:09,450
What happened?

832
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:50,000
[The Air @ Khaoyai]

833
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:38,930
Hello.

834
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:40,520
Uh...

835
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,640
I want to check in here.

836
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:47,100
Yes, I used to be a guest here.

837
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:49,390
Okay.

838
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,030
Now I'm in front of the tent.

839
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:53,850
Okay.

840
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:54,840
Thank you so much.

841
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:25,180
Oh.

842
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:25,779
Oh?

843
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:28,439
Are you that guest?

844
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:30,250
Yes.

845
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,029
I used to be a guest here.

846
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:34,100
Uh...

847
01:08:34,939 --> 01:08:36,640
Are you pregnant?

848
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:41,620
Can you tell me how many months pregnant are you?

849
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,520
It's been seven months already.

850
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:46,000
I think I will give birth within the next two weeks.

851
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:47,950
My child is moving.

852
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:50,830
She woke me up to tell that you were waiting for me.

853
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,399
Oh, yes.

854
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,710
Then...

855
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:58,090
can I stay here?

856
01:08:58,450 --> 01:08:59,390
Sure.

857
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,020
Now there are only two rooms left.

858
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:05,450
There are many guests these days.

859
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:08,000
Since there is a BL series

860
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,700
that the director often goes to court.

861
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:12,560
Justice comes first.

862
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:14,590
How long will you be staying here?

863
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:16,700
Oh...

864
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:19,439
I don't know.

865
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,399
Are you arguing with your boyfriend?

866
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:24,910
No.

867
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:26,960
I just

868
01:09:28,069 --> 01:09:29,560
have something to think about.

869
01:09:30,109 --> 01:09:31,100
Hey, kiddo.

870
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,279
Do you believe in destiny?

871
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:38,189
In the end, soulmates will never be apart.

872
01:09:40,529 --> 01:09:40,859
Yes.

873
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,160
I think so.

874
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,620
Here, your key.

875
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:45,819
Please take it.

876
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,180
I can't walk to you.

877
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:48,060
Oh, yes.

878
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:49,800
Thank you so much.

879
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:50,680
