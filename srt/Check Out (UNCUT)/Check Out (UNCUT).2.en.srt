How have you been? I haven't seen you in a long time.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,500
Since when?

5

3 years ago?

Yes.

Me and my friends can't contact you.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,900
You don't use social media too.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,000
You just post pictures of views when using social media.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,000
So I don't know how you are.

12

For me it doesn't change.

I forgot to introduce him.

17

This is Daonuea. He is...

You guys should get to know each other.

Okay, let's get started.

34
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,600
This is our statistics after working with many clients

from 2019-2021.

Aside from the commercials, music videos and the project you guys just presented to me,

51
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,500
have you guys done a bigger project before?

52
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,200
Like filming a movie or a series.

53
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,700
We haven't had a chance to do a big project like a movie.

54

The economic situation is so bad that it cannot be done.

00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,500
Oh!

174
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,700
Let me see.

175
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,900
Which runway are you going to?

176
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,400
A gala event contacted me.

177
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,000
I had to practice walking because I was afraid it wouldn't turn out well.

178
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,000
Umm...

179
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,200
I think you don't want to walk after you grumble to me.

180
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,100
Now I want to do it.

181
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,000
I have encouragement to support me.

182
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,600
Encouragement?

183
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,300
From whom?

184
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,000
Huh?

185
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,300
I don't know.

186
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,300
Who?

187
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
- I'm not telling you.
- Tell me.

188
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,800
What?

189
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Move away!

190
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,000
I need to practice walking.

191
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,500
Encouragement from whom?

192
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,300
I'm not telling you.

193
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,100
Tell me.

194
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,400
No.

195
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,900
I already told you.

196
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,800
How?

197
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,000
Why did you wake up early today?

198
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,100
I can't sleep.

199
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
Aren't you sleeping more?

200
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,100
Today I will make breakfast for you.

201
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
It's okay, we can cook together.

202
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,900
You can continue to sleep.

203
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,500
Don't you have to be a model today?

204
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I'm Praew, I can do it.

205
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,700
Nine.

206
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,700
We have been dating for three months.

207
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
When will you let me move here?

208
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,100
Sure.

209
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,400
Let's live together like before.

210
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,800
Thank you.

211
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,900
Hey, Nine.

212
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,200
Don't you think my outfit is too pretty to carry the stuff?

213
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,600
Ouch!

214
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,900
And you!

215
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,100
Why did you reconcile with her so quickly?

216
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,900
Aren't you tired of dating and breaking up over and over again?

217
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,600
At least, you should feel sorry for me for having to carry all stuff for you every time!

218
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,300
Hey, Candy.

219
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,200
But am I not rewarding you with free meals every time?

220
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
You can't find a friend who spoils you like me.

221
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,300
Because of this, I have to help you every time.

222
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,300
Umm.

223
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,300
You don't need to help me.

224
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,500
I hope you are telling the truth.

225
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,100
Here.

226
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,100
Ouch! I'm so tired.

227
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,300
Aren't you doing anything else?

228
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,800
You travel, stay home and take pictures.

229
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,300
Isn't it too boring?

230
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,200
You've also traveled everywhere.

231
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,300
I don't want to do anything else during this time.

232
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,700
I want to eat, travel and chill like today.

233
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,400
Are you okay?

234
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,100
Why do I think you're not okay?

235
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,000
Why am I not okay?

236
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,000
Oho.

237
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,700
Don't let me use a pen to write a circle where you're not okay.

238
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,400
Your girlfriend will move in with you, can you make your face happier?

239
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,900
Smile.

240
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,200
Please answer me honestly.

241
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,100
Is my face really that obvious?

242
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,500
Yeah.

243
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,700
It's pretty obvious.

244
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,900
Have you been in love with someone else?

245
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,000
No.

246
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,700
I'm not in love with other.

247
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,000
I just...

248
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,900
have feelings for him a little bit.

249
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,900
Snatched!

250
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,600
You like him!

251
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,800
I'm not!

252
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,800
How long have I been your friend?

253
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,100
You are always like this, when you are in love.

254
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,900
Have you told him your feelings yet?

255
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,100
Just tell him your feelings!

256
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,200
Tell him.

257
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
What about Praew?

258
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,700
Focus on your happiness first.

259
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,200
Otherwise, it will feel stuck in your heart forever.

260
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,200
Think again.

261
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,200
Oh! Don't tell Praew what I said to you today.

262
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,100
Just helping you today I'm risking enough.

263
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,600
Don't tell her!

264
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,500
Yeah.

265
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,700
I don't need to tell her anyway.

266
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,100
Okay.

267
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,200
If you don't need help then I'll go now.

268
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,800
I have an appointment to have lunch with Praew.

269
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,000
Do you want to come with me?

270
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's okay.

271
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,000
Go ahead.

272
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,400
Praew should spend time with her 'friends'.

273
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,400
I definitely have to move her stuff out again!

274
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,300
My help is worthless again.

275
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,900
Should I carry it with me?

276
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,700
I'll go now. Bye!

277
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,700
Take it with you.

278
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,700
No, today I dressed up pretty.

279
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,300
I am tired.

280

[Lodestar Production]
[Contact : Daonuea]

281
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,200
Why are you smiling?

282
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,300
Do you like cookies?

283
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,700
No, nothing.

284
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,000
Do you want it?

285
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,100
Here.

286
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,500
I have good news to tell you.

287
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,500
Huh?

288
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,100
Today, a drama production team contacted me

289
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,100
because of the picture you took.

290
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:15,200
After this, you have to prepare yourself to be the most enviable man.

291
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Because you have a girlfriend who is female lead.

292
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,900
You exaggerate.

293
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,300
You haven't started filming yet, have you?

294
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,300
I'm telling the fact!

295
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Nine.

296
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,400
What about our relationship?

297
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
What should we do?

298
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,500
Do you want me to reveal it or not do anything about it?

299
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,900
Why don't you contact me?

300
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,400
I'm just traveling, relaxing

301
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,400
and taking pictures.

302
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,900
What about you? Daonuea.

303
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,600
I'm just working here.

304
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,100
I don't travel like you.

305
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,900
I didn't know you were close with Tee.

306
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,900
He was my friend from college.

307
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,600
We were separated after graduating.

308
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,300
I rarely go to reunion parties.

309
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,500
Are you always with Tee?

310
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,300
Not that much.

311
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,000
Has he told you all?

312
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
About the company.

313
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,000
Not yet.

314
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,000
Huh?

315
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,100
Why don't you continue to listen to him?

316
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,900
I'd like to know more about you.

317
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,200
How should I feel...

318
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,300
that you want to know about me?

319
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,300
Do you miss me? Daonuea.

320
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,100
Why do I have to miss you?

321
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,400
We are not dating.

322
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
Besides,

323
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,700
you're the one who doesn't reply to my messages.

324
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
And now me and Tee, we...

325
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,900
Are you guys dating?

326
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,900
Yeah.

327
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,900
We are starting.

328
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,000
But it's not your business.

329
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,600
Just focus on your business.

330
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,100
Ouch!

331
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,700
Yes.

332
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Okay.

333
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,700
Ouch!

334
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,700
Daonuea! Are you okay?

335
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,500
Daonuea! Are you okay?

336
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Nothing.

337
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,500
I just wanted to go to the bathroom

338
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,800
so I asked for directions.

339
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,300
I saw Daonuea making coffee

340
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
so I helped him.

341
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,200
The bathroom is that way.

342
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
For this, I'll handle it myself.

343
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,400
What is up with you?

344
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,100
Oh, nothing.

345
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Just now, hot water scalds my hand.

346
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,100
It's okay.

347
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,200
This is the total statistics of our company's projects.

348
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,100
That's all.

349
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,000
Are you satisfied? Mr. Nine.

350
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,700
Are you interested in bringing your project to work with us?

351
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,200
Our company can do everything.

352
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,700
You should just call me Nine.

353
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,300
The project you presented is interesting.

354
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,500
I know someone who wants to promote as well.

355
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,400
It's good.

356
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,800
Then they can work with us.

357
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,600
But...

358
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,600
Can I ask you something?

359
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,800
If I want to invest with you

360
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,400
and grow the company,

361
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,200
will you be okay with it?

362
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
You mean...

363
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,100
shareholder?

364
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,000
Yes.

365
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,900
Are you okay with it?

366
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,200
So that your company will expand in other parts.

367
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,100
Then,

368
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
I have to consult with the people in my company.

369
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,700
I'm fine with everything.

370
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,600
But if I am a shareholder of your company,

371
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
you can be sure that

372
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,800
your customers will definitely increase.

373
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,500
What do you mean?

374
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Will you allow him to be a shareholder of our company?

375
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,700
Aren't you looking for investors to invest with us?

376
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,100
Yes.

377
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,600
But Nine was interested in it.

378
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,600
I think from his personality,

379
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,200
he might help our company get through this situation.

380
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,200
But, Tee!

381
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,600
We don't know if he joins our company, he will make our company worse or not.

382
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,900
Also, he's an independent photographer, isn't he?

383
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,300
How would he have knowledge of management?

384
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,200
Huh?

385
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,700
Did you know that he is a photographer?

386
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,500
Oh, no.

387
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,400
During your meeting, I need to find out about him.

388
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
What will happen if he cheats our company?

389
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,400
You don't need to worry about it.

390
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,100
He is my best friend.

391
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,500
He definitely won't cheat on me.

392
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,600
If he's cheating on me,

393
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,000
he'll talk to me honestly.

394
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,100
But, Tee.

395
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,000
There are many friends who cheat about money.

396
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,900
Daonuea.

397
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,100
But I can guarantee that my friend won't cheat on us.

398
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,100
Besides,

399
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,100
he's rich.

400
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,100
He definitely wouldn't cheat like this.

401
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,800
Okay.

402
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,000
If you want your friends to join the company.

403
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,500
If you're uncomfortable,

404
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,500
I can look for someone else.

405
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,400
So that you will feel more comfortable.

406
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,000
It's not, Tee.

407
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,500
I may not be used to it.

408
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,800
Usually, the employees of our company have never changed before.

409
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,100
Do you see?

410
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,200
The companies we have made together are growing even more.

411
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:34,300
Congratulations to my friend who has already become the female lead!

412
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,500
Wow~

413
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,300
You're overreacting, Candy.

414
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,000
Am I?

415
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I just started filming, the drama hasn't aired yet.

416
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,700
But you got the role of the female lead.

417
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,700
Soon, you will be a female celebrity.

418
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,900
Nine.

419
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,800
You should take good care of Praew.

420
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Don't take her on hiking or trekking.

421
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,800
I already know about taking care of her.

422
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,700
You don't need to tell it.

423
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,100
Oh?

424
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,500
Are you ignoring me?

425
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,400
Are you ignoring me? Huh?

426
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,700
I won't let you eat it if you ignore me.

427
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,700
Be careful.

428
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,200
What does the company say, Nine?

429
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,800
Huh?

430
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,000
What did you say?

431
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,800
Mr. Nine seriously contact the company?

432
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,800
Did I hear wrong?

433
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,000
You can just call me Nine.

434
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,200
No need to add Mr.

435
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,100
I went to contact with the company.

436
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,300
I thought I would be a shareholder of House Productions.

437
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,000
Really?

438
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,600
Why when I was working at that time you said you didn't like it?

439
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,600
Why did you suddenly want to work in this profession?

440
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,700
Maybe because you are an actress, I want to learn this career path.

441
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,500
so I want to learn this career.

442
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,800
Wow wow wow wow.

443
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,100
You called me to see a romantic drama?

444
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,700
Stop! It's disgusting!

445
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,300
I want to puke!

446
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,100
Here, if you want to puke.

447
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,200
You should drink it.

448
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,500
You must drink one shot.

449
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,700
One shot?

450
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,600
You must show the glass after you've finished drinking.

451
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,500
It should just take a sip.

452
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,300
Be careful, I'll get drunk and take off my dress.

453
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,500
When do you have to go to the company again?

454
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,500
I have to keep talking to the company.

455
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,200
I have to wait for the company to contact me back.

456
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,700
You can talk while waiting for me.

457
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,700
Hello.

458
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,500
Hey, Nine.

459
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,200
I'm Tee.

460
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,100
If you're free, you can sign a contract with me tomorrow.

461
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,400
We decided that you can be a shareholder of the company.

462
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,400
Sure, okay.

463
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,000
Cheers!

464
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Okay, come on!

465
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
For my friend who is an actress.

466
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,300
Do you want to take a photo?

467
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,000
She will be famous soon.

468
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,900
What does he mean?

469
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,000
He acted like he didn't know me and became a shareholder of the company.

470
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,500
Or is he actually observing me all the time?

471
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,300
But why didn't he reply to my message at that time?

472
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,400
Ouch!

473
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,400
I'm going crazy.

474
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Should I text him to clear things up?

475
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,300
[Why don't you reply to my messages? I keep thinking about you]

476
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,600
Ouch!

477
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Did I accidentally send it to him?

478
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Ouch! Boat!

479
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,000
Why are you calling me?

480
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,200
Huh?

481
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,700
Huh?

482
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,800
Please repeat it.

483
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,800
Huh!?

484
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,900
I think he's already part of our company.

485
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,900
We should have a party to welcome him.

486
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,900
It's a good idea.

487
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,300
Is it too much?

488
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It wastes the company's budget.

489
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,000
Daonuea.

490
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,100
You even had a welcome party for me when I was a new employee.

491
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,000
Yes.

492
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,300
It's welcome to him, please think in that way.

493
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yes.

494
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,700
Think of it as a new beginning.

495
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,700
During this time, our company has free time as well.

496
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,100
Let's do this.

497
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,300
We should ask him what his favorite food is without him knowing.

498
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,300
We'll bring it to the welcome party.

499
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,700
It's a very good idea, Tee.

500
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,400
Awesome!

501
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,600
You don't even need to ask him.

502
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,200
You have to know your friend's favorite food.

503
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,200
I don't know.

504
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,200
What?

505
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,500
So, should we do this?

506
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,200
Let's ask him without letting him know.

507
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,800
Okay.

508
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,000
Don't let him know, Boat.

509
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,000
Sure.

510
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I won't let him know.

511
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,600
Hello, Nine.

512
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,800
I'm Boat.

513
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,699
I'm here to introduce myself officially.

514
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,400
Boat?

515
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,000
Yes, Boat.

516
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,100
Uh... there's one document asking about your favorite food.

517
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,100
Did you forget to fill out this information?

518
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,100
Hold on.

519
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,699
I never fill out the information.

520
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,699
Oh.

521
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,400
Heh.

522
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
That's right.

523
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,699
I forgot about it too.

524
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,500
Fill out the information...

525
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,600
But can you fill out this information for me?

526
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
About your favorite food.

527
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,530
Umm...

528
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,780
I can eat them all.

529
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,490
You can choose your favorite food.

530
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:09,840
Are you okay with everything?

531
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,770
My favorite food?

532
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,950
Oh, okay.

533
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,790
Yes.

534
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,830
Did you receive my email?

535
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,290
Are you interested in any project?

536
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,080
If you need more information, you can contact me at this number.

537
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,860
Thank you.

538
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,010
Hey.

539
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,790
Where are you going?

540
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,400
I'm helping you contact customers.

541
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,230
So that our company can start work this month.

542
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,910
If you have nothing to say then I'm leaving now.

543
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,750
Wait.

544
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,720
Can I ask you something?

545
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,990
Usually, what's your favorite color?

546
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,800
I don't know.

547
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:08,880
Why do you ask?

548
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,260
Nothing, I'm just asking nonsense.

549
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,290
If you go to contact customers,

550
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,760
take good care of yourself.

551
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,640
Yeah.

552
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,610
Thank you.

553
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,900
Can I go now?

554
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,500
Or what more do you want to ask me?

555
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:31,730
Mr. Tee.

556
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,060
Well.

557
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,760
You usually like black and white, right?

558
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,370
Because its color is simple.

559
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,900
Since I met you at that time

560
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,260
and your photos.

561
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,380
Yeah.

562
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,140
I like things that are simple and not overpowering.

563
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,680
Most of my style.

564
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:53,820
Okay.

565
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,280
Great!

566
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,670
Then, do your best.

567
00:36:59,220 --> 00:36:59,870
Mr. Nine.

568
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,780
'Nine'

569
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,610
You don't need to add Mr.

570
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,440
Here.

571
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,250
I don't know your favorite food.

572
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,770
So I brought many things.

573
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,840
Let's eat together.

574
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,400
Hmm?

575
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,020
I can eat by myself.

576
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,870
You can eat it.

577
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,570
Can I ask you something?

578
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,700
What is the working style of this company?

579
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,370
How is the employee's office time?

580
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,510
Based on appointments?

581
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,730
Oh,

582
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,600
You can enter or leave the office at any time.

583
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,580
We don't have any projects to contact us.

584
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,820
So we don't set a time.

585
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,870
So...

586
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,680
are you busy?

587
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,890
Why?

588
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,950
I just...

589
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,520
want to take a walk with you.

590
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,210
In case you have free time.

591
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,090
And I want to...

592
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:05,760
Oh!

593
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,050
It's okay.

594
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,620
I have to clear my previous work.

595
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,500
I just wanted to ask about my colleagues here.

596
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,550
Today everyone looks very strange.

597
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,080
They suddenly asked me something strange.

598
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,320
Oh, they're usually like that.

599
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,410
Oh, but...

600
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,720
Do you have any allergy?

601
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,300
Allergies?

602
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,860
How?

603
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,830
You mean food allergy?

604
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,160
Umm, that's right.

605
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,290
Nothing.

606
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,330
Then, good.

607
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,280
If you don't have any doubts,

608
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,820
I'll continue my work now.

609
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,560
[Don't forget to have dinner at our house]

610
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,620
[Lodestar Production]

611
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,950
Are you all ready?

612
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,700
Yeah.

613
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,230
He has arrived!

614
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,020
Yea!

615
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,360
Woo~

616
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,980
Welcome to Lodestar Production.

617
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,890
I saw you dealing with customers,

618
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,890
after this please look after me.

619
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Daonuea!

620
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:43,970
Go!

621
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,240
Welcome.

622
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,570
Please raise your arms.

623
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,370
It suits you well, Nine.

624
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,810
Welcome to our company officially.

625
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,380
Shall we start the party now?

626
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,650
Let's party!

627
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,820
Yea~

628
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,900
Wow, Tee.

629
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,800
Today we have a lot of snacks.

630
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,210
Eat it all.

631
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,720
Sure.

632
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,200
I would like to thank you guys for making a welcome party for me.

633
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:06,080
I have something to surprise you as well.

634
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,920
Surprise?

635
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,900
What's the surprise, Nine?

636
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,100
I'm so excited!

637
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,950
I contacted one customer successfully.

638
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,990
They are my friends.

639
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,310
They want us to make advertisements for them.

640
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,700
What kind of advertisements do they want?

641
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,280
Actually, they make face mask products.

642
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,580
The brand owner is a fashionista.

643
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,780
They want us to do social media ads,

644
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,640
images, ads and everything

645
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,680
to promote this product.

646
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,310
Uh...

647
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,310
In this situation,

648
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,310
we need to shoot only at the studio.

649
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,150
Good.

650
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,470
You can respond to them.

651
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:49,240
Okay.

652
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,920
If this project is no problem,

653
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,370
can I be a photographer?

654
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:55,490
So the work can be completed faster.

655
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,340
And no need to contact other photographers more.

656
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,210
Pardon?

657
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,520
We have our photography team.

658
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,300
Yes.

659
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,210
You don't need to do anything.

660
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,370
It's fine.

661
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,220
I don't want to take risks.

662
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,410
I'm in the deal for this project.

663
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,460
I want to contribute to the quality of the work.

664
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,600
You can be responsible for other parts.

665
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,570
What's wrong with you?

666
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,780
I'll be bothering you.

667
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,390
Come on.

668
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,750
Let's cheers.

669
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:29,900
Come on.

670
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,600
Come on.

671
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,840
Let's cheers~

672
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,350
Are you going back?

673
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,190
Yeah.

674
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,200
What are you doing?

675
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:14,730
What are you going to do with me?

676
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,980
You don't believe me?

677
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,330
No.

678
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,910
I just don't think you would do it yourself.

679
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,780
You don't want me to do it myself

680
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:28,740
or you don't want to see my face?

681
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,440
Both of them.

682
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:34,410
The reason I allow you to work here

683
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:35,870
is because of Tee.

684
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,980
Please remember his kindness.

685
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,460
And...

686
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,260
does he know about us?

687
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,510
About us?

688
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,530
What do you mean?

689
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,780
If you mean at The Air, Khao Yai,

690
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:05,900
I totally forgot about it.

691
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,080
But I think you forgot it before me.

692
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,220
But I haven't forgotten it.

693
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,340
Our night.

694
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,580
Why do you say it again?

695
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:26,720
That day I was drunk

696
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,730
and you were drunk.

697
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,880
Just think of it as an accident.

698
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,090
Let it end just that night.

699
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,660
But I didn't do it because I was drunk.

700
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,890
I was very conscious back then.

701
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,840
You don't remember it, Daonuea?

702
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,090
If you weren't drunk, you would...

703
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,400
I don't know.

704
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:58,970
I'll back now.

705
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,910
(What happened to me?)

706
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,460
(Why am I so annoyed?)

707
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,400
(Tee...)

708
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,530
(You should not accept him into the company)

709

[Lodestar Production]
This is a reference of our new project.

710
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,230
It is a Shield’s mask product.

711
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,180
They want promotional images that are fashionable,

712
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,940
vivid and have glitter

713
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,270
but don't want it to look too formal.

714
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,130
As for the color scheme,

715
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:40,220
you can use the color scheme of the product.

716
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,610
It has 3 colors in total.

717
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,720
Gold, Silver and Cherry Pink.

718
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,270
Daonuea.

719
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,160
Please find someone to prepare this set.

720
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:53,050
Boat, help me retouch the photo.

721
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,030
Okay.

722
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,940
For the photographer, I will do it.

723
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,710
I will manage this project budget.

724
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,010
You can pass it on to me.

725
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:03,850
It's okay, Tee.

726
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,120
I'm done with the deal.

727
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,200
Please provide other support.

728
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:07,970
Okay.

729
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,960
Then...

730
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,970
how can I request a budget from the company?

731
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,060
Well.

732
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,010
I have transferred the money to the company's account.

733
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:25,150
You can continue with it.

734
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:27,500
Hold on.

735
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,560
Is the advertising budget that much?

736
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,560
Yeah.

737
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,680
My clients are rich.

738
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,650
I don't like dealing with small businesses

739
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,170
because it's a waste of time.

740
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,660
Let's do the best together.

741
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:01,140
Yeah.

742
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,300
You guys can continue to work.

743
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,880
For good quality of work.

744
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:54,860
Oh, Nine?

745
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,580
Do you usually smoke too?

746
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,510
Good.

747
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,340
If I want to smoke,

748
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,100
I will come with you.

749
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:05,800
Hey.

750
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:07,850
Can I ask you something?

751
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,780
How long have you been working here?

752
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,830
It's been quite a long time.

753
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,800
I've been working here since the beginning of the company.

754
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,200
I think about 3 years.

755
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,210
When you talk about it,

756
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:24,140
time flies by quickly.

757
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,640
And how is Tee's relationship with Daonuea?

758
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:39,520
Actually, I don't like talking about other people.

759
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,460
But forget about it.

760
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,250
Now I don't know their relationship.

761
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:50,440
Three months ago they broke up.

762
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,650
Now they're back talking as usual.

763
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,650
I don't know if they are dating yet.

764
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,200
But I think Daonuea he doesn't have feelings for Tee anymore.

765
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:00,680
Do you think it's weird?

766
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,530
Yeah.

767
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,470
Tee.

768
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,460
Tee.

769
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,410
Why do I feel distrusted?

770
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,480
We haven't met a customer yet.

771
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,360
But they will start shooting when they arrived.

772
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,770
Don't you think it's weird?

773
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:36,280
Hey, are you still thinking about that?

774
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,000
At least he intends to help our company.

775
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:42,110
That's right.

776
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,460
It's true.

777
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,330
But I don't know why I didn't want to believe it.

778
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,180
Are you okay?

779
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:57,730
I'm fine.

780
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,720
I just felt something strange.

781
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:02,720
I don't know.

782
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:04,580
It might be better in the future.

783
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:07,300
Alright,

784
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,750
you don't need to worry.

785
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,120
I hope tomorrow's work goes well.

786
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,310
Tee.

787
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:24,160
After work, shall we go to dinner together?

788
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:27,950
No.

789
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,730
I should cook your favorite food.

790
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:32,840
Hey.

791
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,130
Will you ruin my kitchen this time?

792
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:40,980
I promise not to ruin your kitchen.

793
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,400
Here.

794
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,070
You promised me.

795
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:48,570
Good.

796
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,720
Okay, let's go back.

797
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,060
Don't worry.

798
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,700
Okay.

799

[Lodestar Production]

800
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,660
How was it? Is it okay?

801
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:19,950
Hey.

802
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,770
I think it's okay.

803
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:29,570
I want the picture to convey that the Shield’s hydrogel mask like the gold formula is anti-aging.

804
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,920
and help reduce wrinkles on the face.

805
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,020
As for the silver formula, it helps skin glow, reduce freckles and dark spots.

806
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,360
And the last one.

807
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,180
Cherry Pink formula helps detox the skin.

808
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,350
This formula can be used by people with acne.

809
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:45,600
All 3 formulas can be used by people with sensitive skin.

810
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,400
Oh.

811
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,260
Are you selling it to me?

812
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,960
No, I'm not promoting the product.

813
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,600
There are many properties of your product,

814
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,450
why don't you put text in the picture?

815
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:56,280
Oh, it might be a good idea.

816
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,360
Does the concept of this image work?

817
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,200
Okay.

818
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:01,760
Are you okay with it?

819
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,770
Yeah.

00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,400
I don't have any problems.

822
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,050
I want to fix only the light issue.

Can you please add more light?

Hey, Nine.

Give me a second, please take care of this.

832
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:45,710
Please take care of this.

833
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,700
Wow.

834
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,180

00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:55,700
Yeah.

Before, he was the top of the class.

00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,860
He is good at shooting products.

838
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,360
But that's it.

839
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,740
He didn't want to shoot it.

840
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:06,560
So he took pictures of nature.

841
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,170
Please bring it to him.

Oh?

00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,940
Why don't you bring it to him yourself?

Here.

I can't hold a glass.

00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,590
There is no one here.

858
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:53,640
Daonuea.

859
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,190
I'm busy, feed me.

860
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,150
Hey it's not, I'm Nine.

861
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,460
Yeah, good.

862
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,250
Boat!

863
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,280
Control the light!

864
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:31,540
This set is fine.

865
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,790
I want the lights to dim.

866
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,280
Okay.

867
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,080
Okay?

868
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,240
Okay.

869
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:55,550
Stop.

870
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,900
Continue your work.

871
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:04,780
Hey.

872
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,150
I told you to stop.

873
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,400
So...

874
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:11,720
do you have a boyfriend now?

875
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,590
Why are you messing with my business?

876
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:16,900
No.

877
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,900
I'm not messing with you.

878
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,930
I just don't think you'll be Tee's boyfriend.

879
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:24,840
Where did you know this from?

880
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,130
I don't have any relationship with Tee.

881
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,850
Oh, are you done?

882
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,480
One more set left.

883
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,760
It's almost done.

884
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,490
About what time is it finished?

885
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,360
I think no later than 7:30 p.m.

886
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,860
I'll hurry up and shoot.

887
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:56,100
Do you have a place to go after this?

888
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,810
Yeah.

889
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,020
Goodness!

890
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,900
It's definitely fun.

891
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,050
What do you say?

892
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:05,050
Have you finished retouching photos yet?

893
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:06,590
Almost done, Nine.

894
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,360
What is your usual taste?

895
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,850
You should finish retouching the photo before asking me.

896
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:13,770
Yeah.

897
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,290
Hey, Nine.

898
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:18,110
I have to go up and get my suit.

899
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,360
Tee!

900
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,230
You have to hurry out?

901
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:50,490
Yes, the customer called me.

902
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:51,600
I think it might not be late.

903
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,050
Okay.

904
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:55,880
I'll be here.

905
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:57,930
Please take care of it.

906
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,810
Can I go to your room tonight?

907
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,170
I'll cook dinner for you.

908
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,550
Okay.

909
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,040
See you at my house.

910
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,040
Okay.

911
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,270
Hey.

912
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,330
Wait.

913
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:18,460
This.

914
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,600
Why don't you dress properly?

915
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,320
Huh?

916
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,630
Who would trust you if you dress like this?

917
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,560
It's my plan.

918
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,300
I want you to help me get dressed.

919
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:46,670
Stop saying it's a plan.

920
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,550
You always dress like this.

921
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,300
Next time, bring your shirt and let me iron it.

922
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,590
It's easier.

923
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,770
I'll go now.

924
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:58,030
Okay.

925
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:05,530
[Lodestar Production]
Boat

926
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,150
Yes.

927
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:08,180
Turn on the light.

928
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:09,850
Okay.

929
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,530
Daonuea.

930
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:15,800
Thank you very much for today.

931
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,500
Your work is very nice.

932
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,590
Oh, yeah.

933
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:24,780
If we finish editing the picture, we will send the picture for you to choose.

934
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:25,600
Good.

935
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:29,780
For expenses, I will contact a lawyer.

936
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,500
For today I have to go back.

937
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,490
Okay.

938
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:33,600
See you.

939
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,200
Please make it come out well.

940
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:35,850
- Okay
- Thank you.

941
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:37,290
Return home safely.

942
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,990
(It's really not strange, is it?)

943
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:46,500
(He suddenly came back after he stopped contacting me)

944
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,860
(and didn't reply to messages)

945
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:10,200
Daonuea!

946
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:10,600
Oh!

947
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,570
I'm going home now.

948
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:15,520
Yeah!

949
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,280
You don't need to speak loudly.

950
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:21,530
If your work is done, you can back home.

951
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:31,040
Don't worry.

952
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,560
I'll take care of the rest.

953
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,680
The rest...

954
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,380
Who do you mean?

955
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:40,640
Him?

956
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:42,570
Right?

957
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,280
Am I right?

958
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,820
What are you thinking?

959
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,640
There was only him in this room.

960
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,840
Who else will it be?

961
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:00,300
Yeah, did you bring your hard back home with you?

962
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:03,560
You always forget it and don't do it.

963
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,200
I definitely have to bring it back.

964
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:10,530
You know how much responsibility I have.

965
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:11,050
Right?

966
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:13,540
Are you sure?

967
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:14,500
Yes!

968
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,210
I'm not lying.

969
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,150
I'm telling the truth!

970
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:18,990
Good.

971
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,610
You can back home now.

972
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,130
Okay, see you tomorrow.

973
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:24,200
Yeah, you can go now!

974
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:24,910
Bye.

975
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:27,050
Eh, is there something?

976
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,250
See you.

977
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:30,350
Bye.

978
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:32,680
Nine.

979
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,190
Don't move.

980
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,580
What are you doing?

981
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:45,290
I'm tying your shoelaces.

982
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:49,870
It's okay.

983
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:52,770
I can tie my shoelaces myself.

984
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,370
You don't need to help me.

985
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:58,520
What will happen if you fall?

986
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:08,320
If you're done, you can back home.

987
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:10,650
I'll turn off the lights.

988
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:14,350
Why are you rushing home?

989
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:17,570
Are you worried that Tee will have to wait a long time?

990
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,480
Yes.

991
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:22,590
How does it relate to you?

992
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,610
You should hurry home now.

993
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:27,960
I'll back home as well.

994
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:30,570
Be careful,

995
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:32,730
the light will turn off.

996
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:35,520
It's good.

997
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:39,440
Then we...

998
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,940
What are you thinking?

999
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:35,980
Everything is closed. Okay.

1000
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:43,310
Finally the job was finished.

1001
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:52,420
Oh!

1002
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:55,550
You scare me.

1003
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:57,300
Did you...

1004
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,200
turn off all the lights?

1005
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,130
Yeah.

1006
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,330
Good.

1007
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,690
So I don't have to check again.

1008
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:15,870
If you don't have anything else,

1009
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:19,380
I'll back home now.

1010
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,210
Thank you for today.

1011
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,960
You are very talented.

1012
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,570
Sorry.

1013
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:36,800
Why do you say sorry to me?

1014
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,930
I appreciate you.

1015
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,570
For that I don't contact you,

1016
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:44,810
I didn't greet you.

1017
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,390
and don't reply to your messages.

1018
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:51,630
But now I'm back.

1019
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,050
Why are you talking about it again?

1020
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,140
I don't have feelings for you anymore.

1021
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:03,330
Please talk to me comfortably.

1022
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,880
For you said I was drunk,

1023
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:10,180
I wasn't drunk.

1024
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,980
I remember everything.

1025
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,540
Everything.

1026
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:19,880
I feel good about it.

1027
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:20,970
Stop it.

1028
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:23,740
I'm done with you.

1029
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,000
Please let that night be over.

01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:32,030
Have you really forgotten about that night?

1031
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,320
Our night.

1032
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,650
But I can't forget you.

1033
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:54,370
I don't want to endure the confusion anymore.

1034
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,210
I'm tired.

1035
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:16,340
What did you do!?
