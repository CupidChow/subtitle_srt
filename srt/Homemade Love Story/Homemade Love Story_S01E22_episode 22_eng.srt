1
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,370
     

2
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,730
  My favorite song is  

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,750
  'Dragonfly.'  

4
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:33,170
♫   I guess I'm still young   ♫

5
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,270
James! What's wrong?

6
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,020
Are you okay?

7
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,670
James!

8
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,670
  Soon Jung! Soon Jung!  

9
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,370
Soon Jung..?

10
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,170
James!

11
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,960
  Is anybody home?  

12
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,870
Young lady Min Jae.

13
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,440
Oh, Yoo Jae Hee's mother, how are you?

14
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,570
Hello.

15
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,160
Welcome, young lady.

16
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,930
Oh, that's right.

17
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,730
When you feel anxious, cleaning is the best.

18
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,970
  When you feel anxious, cleaning is the best. It makes you feel refreshed.  

19
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:03,560
I think I should take Jae Hee's father with me.

20
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:10,020
I don't know if you already figured this out, but we just got divorced recently.

21
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,660
Oh, is that so.

22
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,650
I didn't want to talk something like this to you, Soon Jung.

23
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,260
You also know about this.

24
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:29,670
Jung Hoo oppa, I mean Jae Hee's father. I liked him more than he liked me.

25
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,440
That's not true, young lady.

26
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,470
Mr. Woo's father liked you a lot as well.

27
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,980
That's not true! I knew all about it.

28
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,290
He said if I get married to him, it'll be a thorny path, a shitty path.

29
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,340
That's what he said before we were getting married.

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,180
I should've realized at that time.

31
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,490
You know how gently grew up I am.

32
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,360
Of course, I know that.

33
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,470
But then, after I got married,

34
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,280
I lived a life that was less than a maid's life.

35
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,920
Young lady...

36
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,150
No, that's all fine.

37
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,320
Strict parents-in-law, he's older sisters, and he's younger siblings.

38
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,830
I can put up with harsh in-laws.

39
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,900
But Jae Hee's father's indifference.

40
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:40,080
The way he thinks of me less than dirt underneath his toe.

41
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,810
I was really...

42
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,920
I didn't know about this, young lady.

43
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,590
I didn't know you were going through a lot of trouble.

44
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,310
That's why I got divorced.

45
00:03:53,350 --> 00:04:00,090
I thought I wouldn't be able to die in peace if I lived like that.

46
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,980
I made the decision after thinking about it for a long time.

47
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,750
I even got a manic-depressive disorder, but I  made the decision.

48
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:17,720
But why! How can he become like that?

49
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,190
Young lady.

50
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,540
I'm saying too many things in front of you.

51
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:32,700
But if you are in that situation,  I think it's not a good idea to take James,

52
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,770
no, I mean Mr. Woo's father.

53
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,590
I know. I thought about it a lot.

54
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,280
But I can't ignore and let him be like that.

55
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,730
I think recovering his memory is the most urgent thing.

56
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,760
Also, either it was a living hell or not, it's my loyalty from 30 years of our marriage.

57
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,470
- Did you have a good conversation? 
 - Yes...

58
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,430
I was waiting for you. I was going to say goodbye before I go out for my part-time job.

59
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,570
Then, I'll see you again later.

60
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,670
Oh, wait.

61
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,770
Mr.Woo's mother has something to talk about with you.

62
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,380
With me?

63
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,350
Then, you two should have a conversation.

64
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,150
M-Ms. Lee...

65
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:04,370
I'm going to tell you an important fact. Don't be surprised and listen carefully.

66
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,310
Are you ready?

67
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,420
Please, tell me.

68
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:20,070
In fact, in fact, we are,

69
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,270
we were a married couple--

70
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,970
  No, it might be more confusing to understand too much information at once.  

71
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,250
We are a married couple.

72
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,120
Did you not understand me? We are in a married relationship!

73
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,140
I guess Yoo Jae Hee asked you to do that, didn't he?

74
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,950
I'm sorry?

75
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:55,330
I know that I look very similar to Yoo Jae Hee's father, your husband.

76
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,160
R-Role acting! Yes, acting!

77
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,710
He said he needs me to do a part-time job of acting for the company's work.

78
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,420
Then, do I have to do something for you, beauty, oh...

79
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,670
I meant should I pretend to be your husband and attend somewhere?

80
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,400
No, it's not like that. That's not what I'm talking about.

81
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:27,940
You're really my husband! We are a real couple!

82
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:33,970
Then why didn't you act as you know me the whole time?

83
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,850
I did. Don't you remember?

84
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,070
  Why are you here? Mr. Woo Jung Hoo!  

85
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,400
  Woo Jung Hoo..?  

86
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,070
  Are you making fun of me?  

87
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,330
Ah...

88
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,110
Then, those times...

89
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:03,670
But then, I heard that Yoo Jae Hee's father left far away.

90
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,260
That's because we got divorced--

91
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:16,870
I mean like this... You lost your memory, so you left far away! Like this!

92
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:28,830
So, let's go to our home. Shall we?

93
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:38,070
- Then, is Yoo Jae Hee my son? 
 - Yes!

94
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,470
My goodness...

95
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,190
- Then that big company is... 
 - It's your company!

96
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,810
- Then, is my name Yoo James..? 
 - No, no!

97
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,090
It's not Yoo Jae Hee, but Woo Jae Hee. And your name is Woo Jung Hoo.

98
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,510
Repeat after me! Woo Jung Hoo!

99
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,860
Woo Jung Hoo.

100
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,030
I feel like I never heard that name before.

101
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:13,180
What about the name James? Are you familiar with that name?

102
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,890
I don't know.

103
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,610
Everyone in this house calls me by that name, so it feels like my name now.

104
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,730
Where the hell did you get that name James?

105
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,300
I don't know about that as well.

106
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,610
What about me? Do you feel unfamiliar with me, too?

107
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,780
  I can't believe this beautiful woman is my wife..!  

108
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,220
No, no, no...

109
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,350
- What was that? 
 - I can't believe it.

110
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:53,180
That a wonderful woman like you is my wife, and the kind guy like him is my son, I can't believe it.

111
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,490
My goodness, you did lose your memory.

112
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,600
You never said that kind of thing before.

113
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,340
Anyway, let's go home together.

114
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,670
You have stuff on the second floor, right? Let's pack it and go. Let's go.

115
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,870
I can't trust that.

116
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,740
You are doing this because you need me, aren't you?

117
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,550
You need me for the company and other places to be attended!

118
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,090
- I'm not leaving. 
 - What?

119
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,330
  I don't want to leave!  

120
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,640
  - I just, just want to--   
 - James..!

121
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,970
I just want to stay here. I don't want to leave this place!

122
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,040
What if I get caught by debt collectors when I walk around?

123
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,530
Honey, there's no more debt! We already paid back everything a long time ago!

124
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,470
James! I mean, president.

125
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,390
President?

126
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,300
Why are you like this, Ms. Lee!

127
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,440
You two planned this together, right? You talked about this in the room to take me away!

128
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,420
No, that's not true.

129
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:01,870
Young lady Min Jae, your wife's telling the truth. So, don't be afraid!

130
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,550
Ms. Lee, I tried my best not to be a burden to you.

131
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,850
I know that I owe you a lot, but I don't want to leave here!

132
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:19,400
I want to stay in Samgwang villa. Please let me stay here! Don't kick me out, Ms. Lee!

133
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,490
- It's not like that! Don't be scared! 
 - I don't want to leave. I don't want to leave.

134
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,870
- Hwak Se! 
   - President!  

135
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:34,030
My god! Honey! What the hell is wrong with you!

136
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,400
Honey, why are you acting like this!

137
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:50,240
You are the most stoic person, the smartest person, you weren't afraid of anything!

138
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,770
But what happened to you! Why are you like this!

139
00:11:53,770 --> 00:12:00,770
  Oppa, you are so mean! You don't know how I feel!  

140
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,180
What should I do now!

141
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,310
Young lady...

142
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,060
  Is it real? Is that beautiful woman is my wife?  

143
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,950
President.

144
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,220
You trust my words, right?

145
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,830
Yes...

146
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,910
What she's telling you is the truth.

147
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,640
I also met you a long time ago.

148
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:46,500
But time passed so much, so I wasn't sure if it was you when I first saw you again.

149
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,360
But I saw your wife again, and I realized it, too.

150
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,960
But Yoo Jae Hee pretended that he didn't know me.

151
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,220
It was all for you.

152
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,800
Because you were very confused.

153
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:09,570
Then, am I really...

154
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,070
Yes, that's right.

155
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,670
You are Woo Jung Hoo.

156
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,540
Can you believe it now?

157
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,070
If you can't trust it, then forget about it. Just live here!

158
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,770
Live here forever! I'm leaving now. Sorry to disturb you.

159
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,430
- Young lady, young lady! 
 - I'll come with you!

160
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,810
I'm sorry that I made you suffer.

161
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:53,970
Maybe because I lost my memories, I'm afraid of lots of things. I'm sorry.

162
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,370
I'll pack my stuff right now.

163
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,800
That's a relief.

164
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,480
That's a bit annoying.

165
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,330
When I was trying to convince him that hard, he didn't believe me, but when Soon Jung said it, he trusts it right away.

166
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,870
Nevermind. Jung Min Jae!

167
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,970
I'm here to take him with me, so I should take him.

168
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,370
Why are you doing the work as well?

169
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:52,670
I'm just helping you because I'm here. I wanted to move my body, so it's perfect!

170
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:57,670
You're a born hard worker. You have tons of energy overflowing!

171
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,680
Energy!

172
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,540
You were eating a lot earlier. Maybe that's why you're extra energetic right now.

173
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,440
But I can't pay you for today's work because you just came by suddenly.

174
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,210
You're stingy!

175
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,270
I wasn't expecting anyway! I'm volunteering this.

176
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,760
Why? Because you moved away in secret to me?

177
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,510
Because you made Koala sad? Of course! You should pay for what you did.

178
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:24,260
You can think as you want! I'm paying for what I did, or it's volunteer work.

179
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,270
Wow, there's a good thing about you moving away.

180
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,930
My Moong-i became so kind like this, and we become more affectionate with each other.

181
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,870
Come close to me.

182
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,180
- People are watching us! 
 - Nobody's watching us! Come close to me.

183
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,870
My god, that dude...

184
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,190
Then, your work is going to be like that?

185
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,880
That's great. LX is the company that you really wanted to go into.

186
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:58,400
I felt bad that you were giving up your work because of this incident, but I'm happy it all worked out.

187
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,690
Moong-i, if you go back to the company and work amazingly, then I'll be more than happy!

188
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,400
But if I start working again, I can't come to your site this often.

189
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,570
There are tons of ways to see you, like extra work, overtime work, fill in a spot, and SOS.

190
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,000
- When did I say I'll come and help you? 
 - I don't think you can't resist me.

191
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,190
- Stop it! 
 - Come here.

192
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,510
Why are you keep asking me to come closer?

193
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,770
Oh, come on.

194
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,220
- What about it? 
   - These guys.  

195
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,140
The new person to join our team is here. The person that we talked to on the phone yesterday.

196
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,210
Ah! Hello!

197
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,000
Nice to meet you.

198
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,460
  - You got introduced by Mr. Heo, right? 
 - Yes.  

199
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,890
I'm Lee Dong Chool. Nice to meet you.

200
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,300
Nice to meet you as well. I heard you had been working in this area for a long time.

201
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,650
Yes. I don't have any special certificates, but I have long experience in the field.

202
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:51,660
I'll work my best not to be a burden to other team members.

203
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,230
Thank you.

204
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,410
  I believe you heard everything from Chief Yoo, right?  

205
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,770
     

206
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,270
Yes, CEO.

207
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,370
Do you want to come to the office?

208
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,660
Why don't you come and say hello to the design team?

209
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,820
And why don't we have a date together as well?

210
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,950
Yes, yes, sounds great, CEO.

211
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,630
Yes, I get it.

212
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,150
Was it the CEO?

213
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,380
She said I should come to the office now to say hello to the design team.

214
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,860
That's great! Congratulations. Congratulations to you!

215
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,100
It worked out great!

216
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,790
My Seo Yeon. She picked a good guy as her boyfriend.

217
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,880
Mr. Hwang Na Ro.

218
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,970
You said this to me.

219
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,770
You'll help me to get rid of Bit Chae Woon.

220
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,670
That's right.

221
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,560
I'll do that.

222
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,870
So, what are you going to do to help me?

223
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,650
First, you should let Bit Chae Woon come back to the office.

224
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,660
I heard that the design team is trying to bring her back to work.

225
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:53,870
Are you saying that I have to keep her close if I want to do something to her?

226
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,620
Right.

227
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,500
Then, how can I split her and Jae Hee oppa's relationship?

228
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:10,500
I found out that Bit Chae Woon's biological father is a huge troublemaker.

229
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,760
Do you know about her biological father?

230
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,470
My mother's ex-husband?

231
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,760
How do you know about him?

232
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,500
You asked me to help you.

233
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,810
So I looked into it.

234
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:31,570
Woo Jae Hee's parents wouldn't like a woman who has a troublemaker father.

235
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,350
  Who the hell is this guy? He's not a regular guy.  

236
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,350
Well, will you trust me?

237
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,420
It smells good.

238
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,350
Thank you for everything, Ms. Lee.

239
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,320
Goodbye.

240
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,720
It was nothing.

241
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:15,670
I hope you can recover your memory after going back home. And take care of yourself.

242
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,270
Thank you. Take care.

243
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:25,690
Eemes hyung! Where are you going in nice clothes? Oh, hello.

244
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:34,640
Hwak Se, James, no, I mean the president is going back to his home now.

245
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,420
Ah... Is that so?

246
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,740
Then, you talked about everything already?

247
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,130
Yes.

248
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:50,720
- Thank you for everything until now. 
 - It was nothing!

249
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,940
Eemes hyung!

250
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,770
You should take care of your health! And you should recover your memory.

251
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,470
And if you get bored, come to see us at any time.

252
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,070
I'll do that, Hwak Se.

253
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,850
Thank you for everything.

254
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,920
There will be tons of deliveries to do today.

255
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,490
Don't worry about that.

256
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,010
And also,

257
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,450
eat this on the way.

258
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,120
- We'll get going now. 
 - Okay. Goodbye.

259
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,290
Have a safe trip back home.

260
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,480
Eemes hyung, if you get bored, come to see us!

261
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,190
  Jung Hoo oppa.  

262
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,330
  I wish you to be happy.  

263
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,800
  I wish you to be healthy and happy.  

264
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,210
  Everybody's leaving.  

265
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,950
  Chae Woon and Woo Jung Hoo.  

266
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,570
I'll carry that.

267
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,170
  Can you carry this for me?  

268
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,070
  How can I carry a woman's bag? It's embarrassing.  

269
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,670
  It's heavy.  

270
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,370
  I know it's not heavy because it only has clothes.  

271
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,570
- Is it heavy? 
 - No, it's not. Let's go.

272
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,520
What's wrong?

273
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,880
- Ah... 
 - Yes?

274
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,570
It's nothing.

275
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,770
Oh, no! Jae Hee's father!

276
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,280
- Stop there! 
 - Are you okay?

277
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,270
Stop there!

278
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,270
  Hey, Woo Jung Hoo! Stop there! Woo Jung Hoo!  

279
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,870
Jae Hee's father! Jae Hee's father!

280
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:33,230
  Did she get away well? Did she run away safely with our Jae Hee?  

281
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,220
Thank you for the ride.

282
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:58,920
I make a loss if I drive you like this in the middle of my work hour. What should I do?

283
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,870
This is compensation for your loss.

284
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,720
That's not enough at all.

285
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,070
I still need more.

286
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,200
The compensation got exceeded.

287
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,280
Is that so? Then,

288
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,670
I'll return it.

289
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,750
Please take care of my mom.

290
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,570
Don't worry about it.

291
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:36,270
Ah! I have something for you.

292
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,700
Ta-da!

293
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:50,940
I know you'll miss your family. So I made your personal Samgwang villa just for you.

294
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,210
This is so cute.

295
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,830
This is the Ms. Lee Soon Jung.

296
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,410
Then, is this one me?

297
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,110
No!

298
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,920
The prettiest one who's eating at the table is our Hae Deun.

299
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,500
Koala, you should be on here, the second floor.

300
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,470
Right.

301
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,120
Thank you for making this.

302
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,200
Yes, Min Chul.

303
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,460
Did you look into Hwang Na Ro?

304
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,310
He has a history of fraud?

305
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,300
Hwang Na Ro has a criminal history of fraud?

306
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,250
Bit Chae Woon!

307
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,970
I heard you went to the site.

308
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,340
From whom?

309
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,180
I heard it from Hae Deun and Ra Hoon.

310
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,000
Was that not true?

311
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,270
Hwang Na Ro, don't you know about it?

312
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,480
Did you...

313
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,890
move to the CEO's place?

314
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,650
How can you do that all of a sudden? That's unexpected.

315
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,450
- Is it unexpected? 
 - Of course!

316
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,200
Why don't we talk?

317
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,670
By the way,

318
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,740
why did you go to the CEO's place all of a sudden?

319
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,510
There were a lot of people who didn't want me to move to the CEO's place.

320
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,160
So I was going to stab them in their back.

321
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,660
Is that so?

322
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,690
- Like who? 
 - For example,

323
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,190
it's you, Hwang Na Ro.

324
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,500
Why do I, why do I not want you to go?

325
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,470
Do you have the same idea as Woo Jae Hee?

326
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,900
That I'm suspicious. Something like that?

327
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,800
What do you think about that?

328
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,840
Are you the person who went through my room?

329
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,190
Yes.

330
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,090
Let me ask you about one thing.

331
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,570
Did you really like me?

332
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,020
What is this?

333
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:51,750
Are you taking turns with Woo Jae Hee to attack me?

334
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,650
Answer my question.

335
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,030
Yes, I liked you.

336
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,490
Really?

337
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,080
Then do you want to have a relationship with me?

338
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,880
That's what you wanted!

339
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,700
Dating Park Seo Yeon, a daughter of a wealthy family, and get money.

340
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,330
But I'm curious.

341
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:26,190
What if you dated me and realized that there's no money you can get from me? Then what were you going to do?

342
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,760
I guess you'll break up with me and go to find other prey?

343
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,310
So what?

344
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:38,600
You're saying the same thing as Woo Jae Hee. Just forget about everything and leave!

345
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,020
We're in the company building.

346
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:47,870
- Why are you acting like this? It's not like you, Na Ro. 
 - Are you playing with me now?

347
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:55,670
When I realized you became close to me with that kind of intention, I got really disappointed in you.

348
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:02,250
You comforted me when I was having a hard time, and you helped me.

349
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,560
- So I thought you were a good friend. 
   - A friend?  

350
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:11,360
A friend! Why is everybody loves to say I'm your friend!

351
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,250
Koala said that, and now you, headbutt.

352
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,000
Why am I your friend?

353
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:23,830
Is it because I live in the same Samgwang villa, or because I also got abandoned by my parents like you, Bit Chae Woon?

354
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,030
I thought there would be a lot of things that we can relate to.

355
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,860
Maybe that's why I trusted you so easily.

356
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,580
Now I don't like you.

357
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,530
I hate you!

358
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,650
But that's why I feel more pity for you.

359
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,460
Na Ro.

360
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,220
You should reveal everything you've done wrong, ask for forgiveness,

361
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,150
- and leave. 
 - No.

362
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,410
I'm not going to leave.

363
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,890
I love Samgwang villa.

364
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:15,050
You don't have the right to live there.

365
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,030
You should leave.

366
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,480
So, I think we should bring back Bit Chae Woon to the design team.

367
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,890
I was wondering what you think about this, director Jang.

368
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:49,370
  She already made the decision. Why is she asking for my opinion?  

369
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:54,440
I agree with your idea, CEO.

370
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:00,870
She was an intern, but it's hard to find a talented employee like her.

371
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:06,170
If you approve of the idea, then I'm happy with it.

372
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,910
  Welcome, Bit Chae Woon.  

373
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,910
I just finished talking about your return to the office with director Jang.

374
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,840
Director Jang also gladly approved the idea.

375
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,480
Thank you, director.

376
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,870
Yes, Bit Chae Woon. Let's work hard together again.

377
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,120
Then, I'll let you two have a conversation.

378
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,680
  Oh, wait.  

379
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:45,590
Director Jang. I'm going to get off from work a bit early today.

380
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,160
I should buy some stuff for Bit Chae Woon to use.

381
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,060
Mom! Why are you suddenly tip-toeing around me?

382
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,030
That makes me feel sorry.

383
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,060
  I'm sorry.  

384
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,510
I was like that yesterday because I was surprised.

385
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:09,270
You know how my temper is, mom.

386
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,640
My welcome was a bit late.

387
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,270
Let's get along well together, Bit Chae Woon.

388
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,670
Yes. Let's get along well.

389
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,140
Then, two of you enjoy your shopping!

390
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:48,670
- Jae Hee! 
 - What happened?

391
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:53,689
I was trying to go back home with your father, but then on the street...

392
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:56,459
You should've talked about this with me first!

393
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:01,769
I didn't tell you because it seemed like you weren't talking about your father because you think of me.

394
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:08,159
I thought if I bring him back home and I'm around and make the old feelings,

395
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,579
I thought he would recover his memory. But I didn't know this was going to happen...

396
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:18,309
I'm sorry that I yelled at you.

397
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:21,699
Don't blame yourself, mom. You tried to do the best.

398
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:25,649
I talked with his doctor, and they said there's no big issue.

399
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:30,469
I kept felt like it was all my fault.

400
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:37,849
He didn't want to get a divorce, but I insisted on it. So maybe that's why he became like this.

401
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:43,349
That's not true. I think he also tried to live the best on his own after the divorce.

402
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,249
But then he got into an accident...

403
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:49,149
So, don't think of it as your fault, mom.

404
00:35:04,129 --> 00:35:07,399
I think you'll look good in this. Why don't you try it on?

405
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:17,539
Chae Woon.

406
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:20,219
You're so pretty!

407
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:24,079
  Your daughter looks like you, so she's beautiful.  

408
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:28,649
Right? My daughter is very beautiful, right?

409
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:41,539
What about this one? I think she'll look good in this one as well.

410
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:45,219
Try this one on, too, my daughter.

411
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:50,639
I'll be back after changing.

412
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,299
Mom!

413
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:08,089
  I'm sorry...  

414
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:48,749
- Oh, Hae Deun. You're home early. 
 - Yes! Are you going somewhere, mom?

415
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,049
Yes, I'm just going out for a bit.

416
00:36:51,529 --> 00:36:56,239
The house is so quiet today! Where's James? Did he go out for work?

417
00:36:59,569 --> 00:37:03,519
- Well, I'll be back. 
 - Okay! Have a good day!

418
00:37:05,149 --> 00:37:07,849
Ah, I need some sweatpants for my training camp.

419
00:37:08,189 --> 00:37:10,789
I know unni has some that she doesn't wear!

420
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:15,349
Huh? Where are all of her clothes?

421
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,049
Her makeups are all gone, too.

422
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:22,629
Why did she take everything to go out to the site for a couple of days?

423
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:30,419
Bit Chae Woon...

424
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,009
Oh? Hae Deun!

425
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:50,679
  How are you, Hae Deun?  

426
00:37:51,259 --> 00:37:54,869
- Hello. 
 - Why don't you come inside?

427
00:37:58,169 --> 00:38:01,539
We'll just talk out here.

428
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:04,179
Alright.

429
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:14,999
Unni, how can you do this to us?

430
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:18,919
You promised with us, but how can you leave us like this!

431
00:38:19,249 --> 00:38:21,689
Right now, no matter what I say,

432
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:26,299
- you wouldn't understand it. 
 - What can't I understand?

433
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:28,859
I guess you wanted to leave us when your biological mother came to you?

434
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:31,629
And also, it's such a wealthy family.

435
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:36,029
I guess there's no reason for you to live with a non-biological family anymore!

436
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:39,969
Why don't you answer back to me?

437
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:51,049
If it's not like that, then tell me. If I'm thinking something wrong, then tell me I'm wrong.

438
00:38:51,149 --> 00:38:53,349
I don't have anything to say.

439
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:56,049
What you said is right.

440
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:58,949
Unni...

441
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:05,649
Let's see each other again when our feelings are sorted out.

442
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,769
Goodbye.

443
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:14,269
Unni, how can you do this to me?

444
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:17,819
How can you do this to Ra Hoon and me?

445
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:19,639
Hey!

446
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:22,319
  How can you not ask about our mom?  

447
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:27,489
Her feeling must be a mess right now!

448
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:30,809
  How can you not ask about mom?  

449
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:35,049
Unni! Unni!

450
00:39:39,939 --> 00:39:41,919
  Unni...  

451
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:54,639
I'm sorry, Hae Deun...

452
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:57,529
I'm sorry, mom...

453
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:18,069
Where's Hae Deun?

454
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,419
You should've invited her in.

455
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:23,479
She has a thing to do, so she left.

456
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,749
She must come here because she missed you, right?

457
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:32,359
You said you didn't tell your siblings about you moving when you were coming here.

458
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:36,349
Right. I'm going to tell them later.

459
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:41,139
Is it because you're worried that they might be sad?

460
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:45,699
They'll be okay even though they figure out about this.

461
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:47,749
They are strong kids.

462
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:53,349
Oh, right. We finished decorating your room. Let's go and check it!

463
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:57,849
Ta-da!

464
00:41:03,189 --> 00:41:05,419
When did you do all this?

465
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:11,189
I thought you might be uncomfortable to use the guest room. So I asked people to hurry up on this.

466
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:19,269
  Unni, there are two scenes that I always dreamed about when I was young.  

467
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:23,239
  One of them is my real parents come to find me.  

468
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:28,689
  And the other one is, when I go to their house, there's a fancy room for me.  

469
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:32,209
  The bed, the desk, and the bureau are all expensive ones.  

470
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:37,249
  And then, when I open the closet, there are tons of expensive clothes hanging. 

471
00:41:40,879 --> 00:41:44,869
  My Hae Deun. If she sees this, she would like it.  

472
00:41:45,729 --> 00:41:47,919
  Did she go home safely?  

473
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:55,099
You are worried about Hae Deun, aren't you?

474
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:01,629
- You should go out now. She would've not gone that far. 
 - No, it's okay. I'll see her later.

475
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:23,619
That wouldn't be torn apart by doing that.

476
00:42:23,649 --> 00:42:27,549
- The worst teacher..? 
 - What? The worst-- Well, let me see.

477
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,649
This kind of thing-- Wait, what is this? Is it saliva?

478
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:34,329
Is this your saliva?

479
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:42,119
Why are you in this neighborhood?

480
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,929
Somebody that I know lives around here.

481
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:48,889
What's wrong with you? Did somebody not send you 50,000 won again?

482
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:52,149
- What's that? 
 - Your eyes are red.

483
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,549
Like this one.

484
00:42:55,399 --> 00:43:00,439
- It's because somebody ran away. 
 - What? Who ran away?

485
00:43:01,299 --> 00:43:03,279
It's your boyfriend. Right?

486
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:06,119
Oh, you were here to catch your boyfriend.

487
00:43:06,729 --> 00:43:10,389
Why are you trying to catch him?

488
00:43:10,409 --> 00:43:15,109
Just let them go. The ones who are going to leave will leave no matter what.

489
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,059
The guys who will come to you will come whenever as well.

490
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:20,839
Wait, I'm here to say exactly the same thing to my sister.

491
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:26,269
My sister is obsessed with this guy right now.

492
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:28,389
Does your sister live around here?

493
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:32,089
Oh! I untied it! Did you see it? I did it! Yes!

494
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,389
But this is very pretty! Why are you taking this off?

495
00:43:34,629 --> 00:43:36,859
Please, throw that out for me.

496
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:40,649
- It's a heartbreaking thing for me. 
 - Why do you throw this out? It's a waste!

497
00:43:40,749 --> 00:43:47,649
One second. It's going to look good on me. Wait, Lee Hae Deun! Wait, wait! You should tie this for me!

498
00:43:47,729 --> 00:43:49,089
You should tie this--

499
00:43:49,549 --> 00:43:53,149
Does she live with her ears closed..?

500
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:58,499
This house is still very grand. Wait a second.

501
00:43:59,419 --> 00:44:03,119
I hope mom is still at work right now.

502
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:21,859
Joon Ha..?

503
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:40,569
Is it not?

504
00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:51,399
My heart burns!

505
00:44:51,419 --> 00:44:55,419
- I almost got into big trouble! 
 - What's going on?

506
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:58,049
- Did you not pay back someone again? 
 - What?

507
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:02,249
No, it's something more significant than that.

508
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:06,389
- Goodbye. 
 - Wait, wait a second.

509
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:10,949
- Let's do it like this. 
 - About what?

510
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:16,149
Isn't it strange that we keep running into each other in various places?

511
00:45:16,229 --> 00:45:21,019
- Can't you feel some cosmic level of destiny or something like that? 
 - So what?

512
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:28,699
How can you say it like that? If we run into each other again, then we are meant to be!

513
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:34,469
At that time, I'll ask you... I don't know. I don't know what I should say.

514
00:45:34,479 --> 00:45:37,299
- I'll-- 
 - Are you asking me out?

515
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:42,249
- What? 
 - I heard this kind of thing so many times throughout my whole life.

516
00:45:42,259 --> 00:45:46,299
This kind of scheme doesn't work for me. Even on a day like today, my god...

517
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:51,129
Excuse me. You should listen to the end of the sentence.

518
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:56,329
Also, I leave far away soon. I hope you have a happy life.

519
00:46:00,029 --> 00:46:01,419
She's leaving?

520
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:51,919
You must have lost your mind.

521
00:46:52,649 --> 00:46:55,179
How dare you send Seo Yeon to us?

522
00:46:57,059 --> 00:46:58,739
Ma'am.

523
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:02,259
I made this clear to you.

524
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:09,579
I can't have Chae Woon with me because I feel sorry for young lady Jung Won.

525
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,189
You raised her terribly.

526
00:47:13,629 --> 00:47:16,229
How dare she threatens me?

527
00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:20,739
Well, you can't disguise the blood.

528
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:22,629
She is the daughter of Park Pil Hong, after all.

529
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,809
Ma'am.

530
00:47:27,269 --> 00:47:34,419
Our Chae Woon is the daughter of Park Pil Hong, but she's also your granddaughter.

531
00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:38,759
- So please don't say such things. 
 - What?

532
00:47:39,469 --> 00:47:45,819
- How dare you speak like that to me! 
 - I have nothing to be scared of anymore.

533
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:49,259
Chae Woon found her biological mother and went to live with her.

534
00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:55,499
So I want you to stop being like this to me.

535
00:47:58,439 --> 00:48:03,809
I think Bit Chae Woon picked up my call the other time.

536
00:48:05,209 --> 00:48:07,939
- What did you say? 
 - Why?

537
00:48:08,729 --> 00:48:10,949
Do you think I would've said something I shouldn't say?

538
00:48:10,979 --> 00:48:14,729
  I told you it'd be over if you took it all on you!  

539
00:48:14,749 --> 00:48:17,859
  What's so good about sending Seo Yeon to our place now?  

540
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:20,449
  The filthy person, Park Pil Hong's child!  

541
00:48:22,759 --> 00:48:26,879
I knew that might have happened.

542
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:32,759
Ma'am, you are very cruel!

543
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:40,709
But Chae Woon will never be intimidated by such things.

544
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:42,799
Oh, I'm sure.

545
00:48:43,389 --> 00:48:45,489
You have an enormous amount of affection towards her from raising her.

546
00:48:46,419 --> 00:48:48,769
You are both shameless people.

547
00:48:48,979 --> 00:48:50,429
Ma'am.

548
00:48:51,779 --> 00:48:59,009
Because of you, I lived a hard and unfair life.

549
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:04,019
But I'm not going to ask you for anything.

550
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:10,879
My Chae Woon, that precious child,

551
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:18,559
it is more than enough for me to have the opportunity to raise her until now.

552
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:21,609
So what?

553
00:49:22,349 --> 00:49:28,149
What do you want to say? Why did you bother me so much to meet up with you?

554
00:49:32,209 --> 00:49:42,409
I want you to treat Chae Woon rightfully as the daughter of the CEO Kim Jung Won and your granddaughter.

555
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:43,649
What?

556
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,789
I'm going to watch you.

557
00:49:46,379 --> 00:49:48,989
Please, I want you to do what I said.

558
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,779
- Hwak Se hyung! 
 - Yes.

559
00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:06,549
- Are you ready? 
 - Yes, I'm ready.

560
00:50:06,649 --> 00:50:09,449
I'm sorry it's such a small stage. The gathering isn't that big.

561
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:14,609
What are you talking about it? I'm so happy that you let me go on the stage.

562
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:17,599
I really appreciate it.

563
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:19,759
- Did you get the list of the song requested? 
 - Yes.

564
00:50:24,879 --> 00:50:28,749
     

565
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:36,429
It's my honor to have you all here.

566
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:39,869
I'm Hwak Se, and I hope you enjoy the time.

567
00:51:18,649 --> 00:51:20,849
  What brings you here today? You never came to the reunion!  

568
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:23,969
I'm here because I have nothing better to do!

569
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:37,469
♫   The times when if anybody asks me wouldn't hurt   ♫

570
00:51:37,529 --> 00:51:45,019
♫   Are all those me in the past a lie?   ♫

571
00:51:45,149 --> 00:51:51,149
♫   I'm going to keep what I miss as what it is in my heart   ♫

572
00:52:14,439 --> 00:52:18,879
Who the hell is that guy? He sucks! Hey, treasurer!

573
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:21,899
- I said you should spend some money on it! 
 - Hey, sit down!

574
00:52:21,919 --> 00:52:24,329
Don't hire a cheap singer!

575
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:28,769
- What the hell are you doing? 
 - I'm really sorry about the inconvenience. I'll sing my best!

576
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:30,399
Hey, treasurer!

577
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:33,829
What is this! It hurts my ears! I'll be a better singer than him!

578
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:37,249
I had to meet the budget! At least, he looks like a singer!

579
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:39,149
Hey, you guys.

580
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,889
Hey, you guys! You guys, be quiet.

581
00:52:54,959 --> 00:52:57,839
Hey, you rude bastards.

582
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:03,429
Even though you guys are drunk and became dogs, a person is singing here with sincerity.

583
00:53:03,439 --> 00:53:06,359
What kind of shitty manner is that, you guys?

584
00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:08,899
How can you guys be considered as well-educated ones?

585
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:12,029
  - What the hell is wrong with her?   
 - Aunt, I'm totally fine.

586
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:15,849
  Lee Man Jung! What is it? Did you fall for him at first sight?  

587
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:21,649
- Come back to the seat! Let's just drink more! 
    - What is it! Is he your boyfriend or what!  

588
00:53:21,729 --> 00:53:23,729
Yes, he is. What are you going to do now?

589
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:26,729
He's the guy that I love.

590
00:53:27,149 --> 00:53:34,139
- What? 
 - So you should apologize. You should apologize, too. You guys should all apologize to him!

591
00:53:34,729 --> 00:53:39,869
- He is getting treated for his sick throat for a while. How long has it been? 
 - Me? It has been two months...

592
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:42,549
He can sing this well, even in the middle of treatment.

593
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:47,049
He was singing great! You guys just didn't listen to him because you guys were so busy drinking.

594
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,359
Do you guys know anything about singing? Do you guys know anything about art?

595
00:53:50,379 --> 00:53:52,959
He's an artist! An artist!

596
00:53:52,999 --> 00:53:56,799
Forget about it. You guys don't deserve to listen to him singing. This is it for today.

597
00:53:56,819 --> 00:53:59,259
- Let's go, babe. 
 - Babe?

598
00:53:59,259 --> 00:54:01,029
Let's go.

599
00:54:01,249 --> 00:54:06,079
- Don't grab me! Don't! Don't hold me! 
 - You're holding my hand...

600
00:54:08,929 --> 00:54:11,279
Come on, let's go!

601
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:13,349
Wait! My guitar is there, and I didn't bring anything!

602
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:17,949
Let's just be here for now! They'll leave soon to go to another place. So, let's just wait here.

603
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:22,219
Why did you do that?

604
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,809
A person like me gets into this kind of thing a lot!

605
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:29,859
Why did you do that to embarrass yourself in front of your alumni?

606
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:34,219
What's embarrassing? I'm not embarrassed at all.

607
00:54:34,649 --> 00:54:39,149
Of course! The guy that I like was singing that sincerely, and they had the worst manner ever!

608
00:54:39,249 --> 00:54:42,449
I should've done more! Ugh, I'm just going to hold it for now. I'm so pissed off!

609
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,709
The guy that you like?

610
00:54:50,529 --> 00:54:54,099
Do you like me or something like that?

611
00:55:18,469 --> 00:55:27,399
Are you asking me right now because you really didn't know about it, or are you trying to play a game?

612
00:55:29,149 --> 00:55:34,409
Did you really think I was always going to your restaurant to see the handsome owner?

613
00:55:34,429 --> 00:55:40,619
I thought we had mutual feelings. I like you, and you like me. Wasn't it? Then were you just playing with me?

614
00:55:47,379 --> 00:55:50,079
Did I guess it wrong again?

615
00:55:57,709 --> 00:55:59,339
That's embarrassing.

616
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:01,789
I guessed it wrong again.

617
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:07,129
Okay! Then, it's fine.

618
00:56:07,609 --> 00:56:10,089
Let's go and--

619
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:20,259
Forget about it. Okay! Why don't we go for a drink now?

620
00:56:20,489 --> 00:56:22,459
Wait.

621
00:56:22,649 --> 00:56:24,849
Wait a second.

622
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:27,659
Yes, I do.

623
00:56:29,309 --> 00:56:32,089
Let's say...

624
00:56:33,179 --> 00:56:35,279
I like you.

625
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:40,469
But how can I say that to you?

626
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:47,389
I mean, there's Soon Jung noonim,

627
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:51,219
and you know about my situation.

628
00:56:52,049 --> 00:56:54,049
What situation?

629
00:56:55,029 --> 00:56:56,929
Then, what about me?

630
00:56:57,479 --> 00:56:59,979
Do I have something?

631
00:57:00,579 --> 00:57:04,569
I met a bad guy and lost all of my money,

632
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:08,539
and I blew off my sister's house.

633
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:14,119
I'm living with my sister and her family at this age, what's so great about me!

634
00:57:14,129 --> 00:57:20,859
But what's that? What does that have to do with you and I have feelings for each other?

635
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:27,899
Okay.

636
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:31,099
Listen carefully.

637
00:57:32,139 --> 00:57:35,509
Yes, I like you, aunt.

638
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:43,279
No! I really do like you, Lee Man Jung!

639
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:50,439
I like that you act out when you get drunk, and that you snore when you sleep, and that you're such a fighter!

640
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:58,599
I just liked everything about you from the beginning. But!

641
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:06,829
But...

642
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,509
Then, let's just simply kiss each other.

643
00:58:13,549 --> 00:58:16,049
You're so cool!

644
00:58:30,099 --> 00:58:32,109
Do you know that you look like the actor Jung Woo Sung?

645
00:58:32,329 --> 00:58:34,589
Give me a second, Kim Hye Soo.

646
00:58:35,939 --> 00:58:38,129
I'm so happy!

647
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:43,139
I feel like my heart is going to burst!

648
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:55,389
  Unni! Unni!  

649
00:58:58,069 --> 00:59:00,379
  Noona, are you sleeping?  

650
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:01,999
No, not yet!

651
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:15,669
Noona.

652
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:18,249
Just tell me the truth.

653
00:59:18,609 --> 00:59:21,509
The big sister went to the CEO's place, right?

654
00:59:24,259 --> 00:59:25,439
Went to where?

655
00:59:26,219 --> 00:59:29,419
I called her earlier today, and she didn't pick up the phone.

656
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:32,829
But no matter how busy she is, she always calls us back.

657
00:59:34,999 --> 00:59:38,689
She's out of touch from us for us to get detached from her, right?

658
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:44,279
I guess it's real.

659
00:59:45,899 --> 00:59:47,719
She really left.

660
00:59:49,069 --> 00:59:51,389
Don't tell mom that you know about this.

661
00:59:51,399 --> 00:59:53,859
It seems like they didn't tell us on purpose.

662
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:55,839
Yes, I won't.

663
00:59:57,949 --> 00:59:59,049
Noona.

664
00:59:59,749 --> 01:00:03,049
When we slept here together with a string tied to us.

665
01:00:04,829 --> 01:00:06,639
  Shh!  

666
01:00:24,409 --> 01:00:27,389
You tied that because you thought the big sister might run away.

667
01:00:27,909 --> 01:00:32,319
But I was afraid that both of you might be gone.

668
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:35,309
Why am I running away?

669
01:00:35,329 --> 01:00:39,429
You always said that you are looking for your rich parents.

670
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:48,119
But honestly, I never thought about that kind of thing.

671
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:51,149
Because I am...

672
01:00:54,579 --> 01:00:57,279
The one who nobody looked for.

673
01:00:59,189 --> 01:01:05,369
The only people who love me are our mom and two sisters.

674
01:01:09,369 --> 01:01:13,289
You were always sick! A little kid was thinking about unnecessary things too much.

675
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:16,989
Maybe it's because I was always sick and lay down on the bed?

676
01:01:21,049 --> 01:01:24,049
Did Cha Ba Reun move out well? Where is she now?

677
01:01:24,499 --> 01:01:26,599
She must be at her friend's place.

678
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:29,499
You miss her, don't you?

679
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:32,919
- No. 
 - I got you, right?

680
01:01:33,049 --> 01:01:36,119
- No, it's not like that! 
 - I totally got you. Tell me about it!

681
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:38,129
  Young lady.  

682
01:01:38,449 --> 01:01:40,749
This just arrived.

683
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:47,449
     

684
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,489
Should I bring this to your room?

685
01:01:49,509 --> 01:01:51,509
I'll do it for myself.

686
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:12,859
  - Don't do this! Why are you acting like this? 
 - Mom!  

687
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:16,799
Mom!

688
01:04:18,249 --> 01:04:19,749
Chae Woon!

689
01:04:35,849 --> 01:04:40,249
  I know that Chae Woon wouldn't come back.  

690
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:43,359
  But it's fine.  

691
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:48,069
  I can think about her while I'm waiting.  

692
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:57,199
  If I wait for her, it feels like I'll see her again.  

693
01:05:29,919 --> 01:05:31,299
Mom.

694
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:33,919
Chae Woon!

695
01:05:35,809 --> 01:05:38,169
Chae Woon...

696
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:43,249
Chae Woon!

697
01:05:43,709 --> 01:05:46,149
Chae Woon..!

698
01:05:56,049 --> 01:05:58,109
Chae Woon...

699
01:06:22,549 --> 01:06:27,849
  Honey! Are you going out today as well? It's Sunday today.  

700
01:06:27,869 --> 01:06:30,679
  There's no Sunday for a person who runs a business.  

701
01:06:30,689 --> 01:06:34,359
  But you should play with Jae Hee sometimes.  

702
01:06:34,539 --> 01:06:37,849
  When do I make money if I care for weekends and everything?  

703
01:06:38,209 --> 01:06:43,629
  Also, my parents are coming to visit us, so you should go out to the Seoul station to pick them up.   

704
01:06:43,649 --> 01:06:44,879
  They are coming again..?  

705
01:06:46,189 --> 01:06:47,789
  Woo Jung Hoo!  

706
01:06:49,149 --> 01:06:51,049
  Woo Jung Hoo!  

707
01:06:51,399 --> 01:06:52,659
  Who are they?  

708
01:06:52,689 --> 01:06:54,459
  Woo Jung Hoo!  

709
01:06:54,489 --> 01:06:59,129
  - Open the door! I'm here to take the money! 
 - Money?  

710
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:04,349
  Actually, my business partner, Mr. Kim, used a private loan and ran away.  

711
01:07:04,359 --> 01:07:08,509
  Oh, my goodness! Why didn't you tell me about this until now!  

712
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:11,929
  What am I going to do by telling you? It would've only made you worry.  

713
01:07:11,939 --> 01:07:19,019
  I'm going to run away that way to attract their eyes, so you should run out to the back with Jae Hee.  

714
01:07:19,049 --> 01:07:21,969
  I don't want to! I can't leave without you!  

715
01:07:22,019 --> 01:07:26,599
  - Hurry up! What if our Jae Hee gets hurt? 
 - Honey!  

716
01:07:29,789 --> 01:07:35,119
  Jae Hee's mother. I lov... lov...  

717
01:07:38,149 --> 01:07:43,049
  Hurry up and go. Hurry, go, go.  

718
01:07:44,689 --> 01:07:47,559
  - Honey! 
 - Woo Jung Hoo, open the door!  

719
01:07:47,869 --> 01:07:51,329
  Get him! Stop there! Hey, Woo Jung Hoo!  

720
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:53,179
  Stop right there!  

721
01:07:56,549 --> 01:07:58,949
  Did she run away safely?  

722
01:07:59,049 --> 01:08:02,649
  Did she run away safely with our Jae Hee?  

723
01:08:02,959 --> 01:08:09,969
- Honey! Are you okay? 
 - Father! No, I mean, James!

724
01:08:12,999 --> 01:08:17,029
What should we do? I guess his memory hasn't come back yet.

725
01:08:17,209 --> 01:08:21,239
James, are you okay? Where do you feel uncomfortable?

726
01:08:24,699 --> 01:08:27,179
Do you remember me? Woo Jae Hee, I mean,

727
01:08:27,179 --> 01:08:32,339
you always called me Yoo Jae Hee! The one who used the same room in Samgwang villa.

728
01:08:34,709 --> 01:08:37,979
Oh, you remember me! Thank goodness.

729
01:08:37,999 --> 01:08:41,609
We were really worried about you! You were asleep for a long time.

730
01:08:42,019 --> 01:08:46,169
- Mom, I'll call the doctors right now. 
 - Okay!

731
01:08:48,599 --> 01:08:50,999
What's wrong, James?

732
01:08:54,459 --> 01:08:56,649
Do you want to say something?

733
01:08:59,349 --> 01:09:01,999
I'll bring the doctors right away.

734
01:09:02,379 --> 01:09:04,519
Jae Hee...

735
01:09:04,809 --> 01:09:05,989
Yes?

736
01:09:07,329 --> 01:09:08,939
Jae Hee.

737
01:09:09,709 --> 01:09:12,119
Yes, I'm Woo Jae Hee.

738
01:09:12,129 --> 01:09:15,919
You always called me Yoo Jae Hee.

739
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:20,779
Why are you a Yoo Jae Hee?

740
01:09:21,519 --> 01:09:22,669
What's that?

741
01:09:24,549 --> 01:09:26,229
You are Woo Jae Hee.

742
01:09:26,749 --> 01:09:28,559
My son.

743
01:09:31,509 --> 01:09:35,589
- James... no, I meant, father! 
 - Honey!

744
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:39,529
D-Did your memory come back?

745
01:09:43,239 --> 01:09:45,149
Honey.

746
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:50,849
- Jae Hee's father! Jae Hee... 
 - Father!

747
01:09:50,859 --> 01:09:54,339
- Father! 
 - Your memory is back!

748
01:09:54,519 --> 01:09:55,949
  Father...  

749
01:09:57,249 --> 01:10:01,149
- Father... 
 - It's a miracle!

750
01:10:25,879 --> 01:10:33,509
♫   In the extravagant building forest, You're walking with confidence, City Boy  ♫

751
01:10:33,519 --> 01:10:38,719
♫   You're the star of this city, So beautiful Girl   ♫ 
      

752
01:10:38,749 --> 01:10:42,879
  We talked about that you're not going to reveal that Bit Chae Woon is your daughter, mom. Let's go to work!  

753
01:10:42,949 --> 01:10:45,559
  This is her clothes? I guess she's really going to live here.  

754
01:10:45,559 --> 01:10:47,049
  - It's gross. 
 - Seo Ah!  

755
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:50,549
  Jung Min Jae! Aren't we strangers now?  

756
01:10:50,549 --> 01:10:55,269
  If you're going to share the room with me, I think you should take good care of sanitation.  

757
01:10:55,349 --> 01:10:58,349
  - Oppa! 
 - Seo Ah, how did you find here? Are you here with mom?  

758
01:10:58,449 --> 01:11:00,649
  Do you know what's going on in our house?  

759
01:11:00,749 --> 01:11:02,749
  Soon Jung, you should disappear.  

760
01:11:02,779 --> 01:11:04,999
  Just forget about everything and go far away.  

761
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:07,949
  How can I ask what Soon Jung is hiding?  

762
01:11:07,949 --> 01:11:10,849
  Just make the model. I'll do the rest.
