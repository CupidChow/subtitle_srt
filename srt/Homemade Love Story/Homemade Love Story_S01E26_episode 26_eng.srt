1
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,850
At that time, 
      

2
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,720
I was physically sick and having a hard time.

3
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,440
Above all, because of the person who was your father,

4
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,080
I was always depressed

5
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,210
and didn't have any motivation for life,

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,240
so I couldn't really take care of you.

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,050
After losing you,

8
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,870
I felt like everything was my fault,

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,740
so I was having a difficult time for a while.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,640
But then, even after finding you miraculously,

11
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,540
I still feel like I'm failing at protecting you.

12
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,800
I'm so sorry, Seo Yeon.

13
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,670
I'm so sorry.

14
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,190
You shouldn't be.

15
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,310
It's not your fault.

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,800
I never resented you.

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,300
And I still don't resent you.

18
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,280
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,420
Mom!

20
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:17,030
  At that time, I was too weak...  

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,780
  I'm sorry for everything, Seo Yeon.  

22
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,290
  I'm so sorry...  

23
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,710
  Don't be sorry.  

24
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,740
     

25
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,640
     

26
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,310
     

27
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,440
  Hello? Director.  

28
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,540
What?

29
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,800
Did you have a drink?

30
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,070
You're so strange.

31
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,270
Why are you around me whenever I'm a mess?

32
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,900
Where are you now? I'll be there.

33
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,690
It's fine. I'm at home.

34
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,620
  Do you want to have another drink with me? I'll come to pick you up.  

35
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,550
Hwang Na Ro.

36
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,540
You're not a good person.

37
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,690
  How can you suggest another drink to a drunk person?  

38
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,540
If it were Jae Hee Oppa,

39
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,350
he would've scolded me.

40
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,660
Seo Ah,

41
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,410
alcohol is not good for your body.

42
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,360
  Don't lean on alcohol.  

43
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,840
Director. Hello?

44
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,940
You know that I'm a bad person.

45
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,450
You're getting guys like me because your mind is so weak.

46
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,920
After talking about old memories,

47
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:09,090
it makes me feel embarrassed and weird.

48
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:22,240
Then, you still don't know about what he's doing now?

49
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,990
No...

50
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,030
  Jung Won!  

51
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,350
It has been a while since I heard from him.

52
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,220
I don't know where he lives or how he's doing.

53
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,710
Okay.

54
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:48,090
- It's late. Let's go to bed. 
 - Yes. Good night.

55
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,700
Good night, my daughter!

56
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,750
Oh, mom. I'm sorry.

57
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,800
I didn't know you called me.

58
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,670
I guess I called you when you were asleep.

59
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,990
No, I was talking with the CEO.

60
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,620
Oh, is that so.

61
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,540
Chae Woon.

62
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,340
Are you okay?

63
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,900
Nothing is going on, right?

64
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,240
Yes. Why?

65
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,800
Nothing. I was just wondering.

66
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,150
  Mom, you're still worried about me because of the mistake that I made at the event.  

67
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,580
I'm doing fine!

68
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,590
Okay. It's good to hear that.

69
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,800
Is everything okay at the office?

70
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,740
Everything's fine.

71
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,740
  What about the house?  

72
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,210
House's also fine. I'm getting used to the place. I'm doing great.

73
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,530
  I should go to bed now!  

74
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,340
- Let's talk again later, Chae Woon! 
   - Okay.  

75
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,980
I shouldn't go to see Chae Woon.

76
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,290
She went back to her birth mother. She went back to the place where she should be.

77
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,250
Seo Ah!

78
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,800
Alcohol smell! Why did you drink this much?

79
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,960
- Mom. 
 - Yes?

80
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,330
Get away from me!

81
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:46,050
Mom! Mom...

82
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,320
Mom, you only had me.

83
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,140
You only had me.

84
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Ms. Joo, can you get me some coffee?

85
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,340
Park Pil Hong...

86
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,430
How did you find here?

87
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,880
Jung Won. Long time no see.

88
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,250
I missed you.

89
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,830
How did you find here?

90
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,670
Get out.

91
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,760
Get out of here, now!

92
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,060
Get out!

93
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,020
Get out! Get out!

94
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,090
Get out!

95
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:45,190
Get out... Get out... Get out!

96
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,730
Why did Park Pil Hong come out in my dream..?

97
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:11,610
So you can't search only with Park Pil Hong's name?

98
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,900
Ah, because it's personal information.

99
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,710
Yes, thank you, Min Chul. Have a good day.

100
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,240
I tried to find out about Moong-i's biological father, but it's not as easy as I thought.

101
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,410
     

102
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,640
     

103
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,580
  I wonder if my father has some breakfast.  

104
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,220
- And put this on lock... 
   - Please select the function you want.  

105
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,190
A function that I want?

106
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,590
What do I have to press?

107
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:26,240
Of course! If you pick up your phone right away, then you must feel like losing.

108
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,690
One, two, three!

109
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,750
  - Why?   
 - Bingo!

110
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,330
What?

111
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,590
Good morning, Mr. Woo Jung Hoo!

112
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,060
Why did you call me this early in the morning?

113
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,840
Are you checking on me? Did you think something might happen to me?

114
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,490
How do you feel?

115
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,840
Are you experiencing anything like dizziness, headache, or lost memories?

116
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,070
  Hello? Mr. Woo Jung Hoo!  

117
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,540
- Oh, yes! I have something to ask you. 
   - What is it?  

118
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,670
  About the rice cooker.  

119
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,150
I'm trying to make rice,

120
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,860
  but what should I press? I already put the grain in it.  

121
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,840
Are you making rice?

122
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,200
I mean, there are too many buttons here. And I don't have the instructions.

123
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,740
What should I press?

124
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,260
When I was leaving the house, I made the setting already.

125
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,690
Can you find the start button? Just press that one.

126
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,660
  Start button?  

127
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,340
  Circular one, circular one...  

128
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,340
Oh! The start button. It's here.

129
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,940
Just press that button.

130
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,800
Hello?

131
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,340
  Are you sure?  

132
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,970
Can't you trust me?

133
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,740
  Just press it now!  

134
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,030
I said, press it!

135
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,130
  - White rice. I'll start making delicious rice for you!   
 - It surprised me. Why is this making such a funny noise?

136
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,630
  Did you do it well?  

137
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,680
Yes, yes. It's working.

138
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,440
  - It's surprising!   
 - Honey.

139
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,560
Oh. Do you have any other thing to ask?

140
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,050
No, that's all.

141
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,820
Okay, then the phone call is done!

142
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,010
It's so strange!

143
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,740
He's making rice by himself. It's crazy. It's so crazy.

144
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,290
Now, I should get some side dishes!

145
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,130
Is she dealing well with the manic-depression?

146
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,120
  Good morning, mother!  

147
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,950
Oh! I can get that for you!

148
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,340
- Did you sleep well, Na Ro? 
 - Yes.

149
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,630
I'm so clumsy.

150
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,140
Na Ro! What happened to your face?

151
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,720
Ah, I got bumped into something. I was coming home drunk.

152
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,660
- You should be careful! You might get into big trouble. 
 - Yes, ma'am!

153
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,840
I'll wash these.

154
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,650
Na Ro.

155
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,670
Yes?

156
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,550
I heard there was some posting on your company's community board.

157
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,050
How do you know about that?

158
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,040
I somehow heard about it.

159
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,680
Do you know who posted that?

160
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:24,040
It was somebody's prank! It got sorted out pretty soon.

161
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:31,020
- Is our Chae Woon... 
 - Chae Woon is not a person to be shaken by such a thing.

162
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,250
Aren't people in the office say something?

163
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:41,950
It's nothing to even talk about it. That board has a lot of nonsense gossips, so people don't really care that much.

164
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,660
Don't worry about it!

165
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,310
But how did you know about that?

166
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,860
Did someone screenshot that and send it to you?

167
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,500
Who did that?

168
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,690
I just heard it from someone.

169
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,470
Hey, Hwang Na Ro!

170
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,810
What are you doing right now?

171
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,580
- What are you saying to Chae Woon's mother? 
 - What?

172
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,070
Mr. Woo!

173
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,760
I asked him about something.

174
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,940
Oh, Mr. Woo! What happened to your face!

175
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,390
Ah, something fell on me at the construction site...

176
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,010
- Oh, no! 
 - I'm fine.

177
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:49,030
  Delicious white rice is done! Please mix it well.  

178
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,440
What is this?

179
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,070
Now he's calling me with a video call?

180
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,160
Wait, no.

181
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,110
One, two, three!

182
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,240
And four.

183
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,670
Yes, Mr. Woo Jung Hoo?

184
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:23,170
  You said it'll be done by just pressing the start button! What is this!  

185
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,720
What is that? My goodness!

186
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,540
Oh, no!

187
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,340
Why are you laughing?

188
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,990
  You should've put water in it, too! How can you just put rice grain in and start cooking?  

189
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,280
Why are you telling me that now!

190
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,590
Isn't that a basic thing to know?

191
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,810
  Or you should've asked me before!  

192
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,180
Don't you have any instant rice?

193
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,880
I ate them all!

194
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,230
I should bring some more then.

195
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,980
What did you eat for breakfast?

196
00:17:53,020 --> 00:18:00,030
  Me? I ate an American-style breakfast.  

197
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:05,020
  Put some water in a pot and put that rice in and cook it to a boil.  

198
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:10,570
Or put some water into the rice cooker and press the start button again. It'll work.

199
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,640
You still have some time, right? I have to go and get ready for work.

200
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,150
  W-Wait.  

201
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,640
  - How is your Jo--   
 - Yes?

202
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,130
  - I mean, that Jo-- Jo--   
 - What?

203
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,390
  What do you want from me? What is it?  

204
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,640
How can I make millet-rice? 
      

205
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,740
I like rice with millet in it.

206
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,840
I'll teach you how to make that when you master the white rice. Okay?

207
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,040
  Then, have a great day!  

208
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,720
This kelp soup is so good!

209
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,520
It reminds me of Eemes hyung.

210
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,860
Eemes hyung really liked kelp soup with brisket in it.

211
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,770
James said he likes beef-radish soup, too!

212
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,430
- Big sister likes beef-radish soup. 
 - Hey!

213
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,640
That's right! Chae Woon loves beef-radish soup.

214
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,600
Mom! I like that soup, too!

215
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,000
I know that, too! Hae Deun also loves that soup.

216
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,690
Have some more.

217
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,450
Chae Woon didn't just like beef-radish soup.

218
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,700
She liked every soup like Yukgaejang or any other soup.

219
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,470
Mother! This kelp soup is amazing! Can I have some more?

220
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,030
- Yes! I'll get it for you. 
 - No, I can do it for myself!

221
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,130
- This soup is amazing, mother! 
 - Is that so?

222
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,810
  - Have as much as you want, Na Ro. 
 - Yes. 

223
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:57,330
It's so good! I wonder if Chae Woon is having enough soup in that house.

224
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,240
She needs to drink a bowl of soup for breakfast!

225
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,900
  Jjung-a!  

226
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,980
  Jjung-a?  

227
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,240
What?

228
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,870
- Jjung-a-jji! 
 - What?

229
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,160
  What's that?  

230
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,030
The Jjung-a-jji that you were eating yesterday!

231
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,240
Jjung-a-jji's not on the table. Noonim, do we have some Jjung-a-jji?

232
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,960
- You mean, Jjang-a-jji? 
 - Yes, Jjang-a-jji. 
      

233
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,620
- Jjang-a-jji. 
 - Jjang-a-jji!

234
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,710
- I know where it is. 
 - Yes, aunt. Can you get some?

235
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,640
Hwak Se uncle!

236
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,390
Hey! Cha Ba Reun! You...

237
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,620
Man Jung!

238
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,140
You should be quiet when you're eating. She's loud!

239
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,140
  Auntie, you're the loudest!  

240
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,740
Jjung-a-jji!

241
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,540
  When did I eat that yesterday?  

242
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,140
Jjung-a-jji! Jjung-a-jji!

243
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,220
How is your stomach? You seemed to drink a lot yesterday.

244
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,350
I'm fine.

245
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:22,010
Why don't we go on a trip to somewhere close this weekend?

246
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,490
Yes! Sounds great.

247
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,880
How about you, Seo Ah? It works for you, too, right?

248
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,260
In a way, you guys are like sisters.

249
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:37,380
Until now, because of busy works--

250
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,760
Now that I think of it, Bit Chae Woon and I are sisters.

251
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:51,820
My birthday is earlier, so I'm the unni.

252
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,660
Is that how it is?

253
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:04,840
We're sisters. Isn't it wrong to date a guy the older sister dated?

254
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,540
It is not right to date a guy the older sister dated.

255
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,930
But you didn't date him.

256
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,940
What?

257
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,350
Seo Ah.

258
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,040
You keep saying as if you dated Woo Jae Hee.

259
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:39,750
If you keep saying that, you might fall into a delusion as if you dated him.

260
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,660
Chae Woon.

261
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,340
A delusion?

262
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,190
A delusion!

263
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:54,380
- Did you just say it is a delusion? 
   - Seo Ah!  

264
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,090
You just saw that, right, mom?

265
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,400
- She thinks I'm a crazy bitch in a delusion! 
   - Jang Seo Ah!  

266
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:05,370
Watch your language! Why are you acting like this more and more!

267
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,970
That's right.

268
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,850
I guess I'm becoming crazy!

269
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,760
Because of your biological daughter.

270
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,590
  Seo Ah!  

271
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,960
  Seo Ah!  

272
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,000
Young Lady! Let me do it.

273
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,680
No, it's okay.

274
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,340
Oh, no! What should we do!

275
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,930
I'm fine.

276
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,960
I uh, mother.

277
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,920
Yes, Mr. Woo?

278
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,140
It would be great if you can tell me everything.

279
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,910
I know about it a little bit since Chae Woon told me.

280
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:12,550
I should know about your situation so that I can take care of you better.

281
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,040
Did you hear about it from Chae Woon?

282
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,330
Yes, about the things that happened until now.

283
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:29,390
It's good that Chae Woon has someone to tell everything.

284
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,220
Thank you, Mr. Woo.

285
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,610
It's my pleasure.

286
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:40,920
Then, is Seo Ah the one who sent you the posting?

287
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,190
I'll not say this to Chae Woon.

288
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,950
If she knows about this, she must be worried.

289
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,110
Will you?

290
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,460
That photo

291
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:04,680
was sent from Chae Woon's grandmother.

292
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,880
I think she's concerned with Chae Woon's stuff

293
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,790
and trying to send me a warning.

294
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,190
Oh, I see.

295
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,120
The Chairwoman is not a regular person.

296
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:29,040
Lee Soon Jung. I guess she must have felt that she can't act out.

297
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,070
By the way,

298
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,020
who posted that on the community board?

299
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,750
Would it be Seo Ah?

300
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,740
Yes, Mr. Nam. What is it?

301
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,520
Bit Chae Woon is dating someone?

302
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,740
Okay, I'll see the photo.

303
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,160
This guy is..!

304
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,200
Woo Jae Hee, the Min Jae's son!

305
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:14,390
He's the one our Seo Ah is dying for!

306
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,040
And he is dating Bit Chae Woon?

307
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,900
Hwang Na Ro!

308
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,340
I'm warning you again. Don't make any trouble. Did you understand?

309
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,290
Woo Jae Hee.

310
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,910
I'm also going to warn you just one time.

311
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,350
Stop bugging me.

312
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,870
I can do a thing that a good boy like you can't even think about it.

313
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,190
So be quiet and take care of Bit Chae Woon.

314
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,050
That bastard!

315
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,820
If Park Pil Hong made a lot of trouble before,

316
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,730
he might have been to jail.

317
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:13,640
Hwang Na Ro has been in jail.

318
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,540
Do they know each other?

319
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,000
  I still couldn't find out where Park Pil Hong lives.  

320
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,260
  He might be living with a different identity.  

321
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,780
Is that so?

322
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,300
But you're sure that he hasn't shown up around my house or the company.

323
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,420
  Yes. He didn't show on any of the surveillance cameras.  

324
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,740
Okay. Yes.

325
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,100
Park Pil Hong.

326
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,380
What is he doing now at where?

327
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,830
He must be watching me.

328
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,740
Jung Won is looking for me?

329
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,040
Does she miss me that much?

330
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,170
Oh, right. Did you get rid of professor Kim from Hwang Na Ro?

331
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,780
That's great. These bastards, they don't have loyalty or what so ever. Everything is possible with money.

332
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,030
You guys don't have philosophy!

333
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,970
Then, now it's like we got rid of the arms and legs of Hwang Na Ro.

334
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,010
  The person you're trying to reach is not available...  

335
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,250
Professor Kim, this bastard, is acting weird.

336
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,630
Why is he ghosting me suddenly?

337
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,720
Good morning, Bit Chae Woon.

338
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,050
You did it, right?

339
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,140
I'm sorry?

340
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,490
The one who wrote the posting about I'm the daughter of the CEO.

341
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,460
Ah, you and Woo Jae Hee is attacking me together again.

342
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,270
I don't know anything about that.

343
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,450
Of course, you'll say that.

344
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:25,210
- I guess now you're plotting with Seo Ah?  
 - Plotting?

345
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,750
I don't like that expression.

346
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,670
There are so many better words you can use. Like feelings for each other, or even

347
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,300
a relationship?

348
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,740
The last one is my wish.

349
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,800
I can't just look at you when I don't have any chance.

350
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,250
- Hey, Hwang Na Ro! 
 - Bit Chae Woon.

351
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,290
I believe you heard of this phrase.

352
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:56,970
Love is a mobile thing.

353
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,020
Hwang Na Ro.

354
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,530
I'm not going to stand it if you keep messing around like this.

355
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,830
Bit Chae Woon's charm is being tough.

356
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,220
Yes, Min Chul.

357
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:36,540
So I want you to look into if Hwang Na Ro and Park Pil Hong have any connection.

358
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,360
For example, they were in the same prison together.

359
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,440
Yes, thank you for doing that.

360
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,040
Oh, Mr. Lee! You came out early!

361
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,640
Mr. Woo! Hello!

362
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,540
- Did you clean here all by yourself? 
 - I just did it in the morning.

363
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,410
You should've done it with us! You must have worked so much.

364
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,790
No, it's okay. I'm a very neat person, so I can't handle to see messy space.

365
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,490
Ah, do you want some morning coffee?

366
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,760
- I'll get the coffee. I'll be back soon. 
 - Mr. Woo.

367
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,230
I already prepared everything.

368
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,110
Wow, did you bring all this stuff with you?

369
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,090
Yes, I love drip coffee, so I always pack this around with me.

370
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,600
Wow! Mr. Lee, you're really cool.

371
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,900
You look like a person who knows how to enjoy life.

372
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,190
I'm pretty romantic, right?

373
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,730
Yes, you are.

374
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,840
- Wow. I'll be on the phone for a second. 
 - Yes, yes.

375
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,090
Moong-i.

376
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,680
Yes, Koala! Good morning!

377
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,090
What is it? Your voice sounds like you're exhausted from the morning.

378
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,780
Well, I'm doing some work that I need to use my physical power.

379
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,210
The job that totally suits me.

380
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,440
Ah. Are you sure nothing is going on with you?

381
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,940
What are you talking about?

382
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,160
Is there something going on at home? Is it about my mom?

383
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,980
There's nothing going on at home. I can't even ask you anything!

384
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,580
Because of your first-daughter instinct, your instinct to care for everybody else!

385
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,750
Thank you so much for the coffee!

386
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,660
- Are you at a cafe? 
   - No, I'm at the site.  

387
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,250
But Mr. Lee here made a drip coffee right now.

388
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,450
It smells really nice!

389
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,240
At the site?

390
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:34,270
Yes. Mr. Lee brought everything to make the drip coffee.

391
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,760
Oh! He's so cool!

392
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:39,410
I wish I can try his coffee next time.

393
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,820
That sounds good.

394
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,080
My girlfriend said she wants to try your coffee as well!

395
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,800
Yes! Come by whenever!

396
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,780
  Yes, I will!  

397
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:54,900
- Yes, it's getting cold. 
   - Everybody's falling for my charm.  

398
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:03,220
  Of course, you guys should. The three of us should be super close so that we can surprise Jung Won.  

399
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,600
Oh, that's right, about your biological father.

400
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,760
Mr. Park Pil Hong.

401
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,280
Ah, yes.

402
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,570
  I asked my detective friend Min Chul to look him up,  

403
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:22,710
but he said it's not possible to find about him just with his name because it's personal information.

404
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,660
But, I thought about it.

405
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,130
And he might have some connection with Hwang Na Ro.

406
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,060
You never know about him.

407
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,070
So I'm going to search for him by connecting them.

408
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,900
Mr. Lee! I'll be back from an outside meeting! Thank you for the coffee.

409
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,000
Yes! Have a nice day!

410
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,440
Why are those cute babies looking for Park Pil Hong?

411
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,990
Who said that I am a suspicious person?

412
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,120
Hwang Na Ro, that bastard?

413
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,140
My Jung Won?

414
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,780
Or is it Lee Soong Jung?

415
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,760
The community board incident was happened inside of the company.

416
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,470
It would've not done by Park Pil Hong.

417
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:20,830
Then, is it really done by Seo Ah?

418
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,940
Yes, Soon Jung! How have you been?

419
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,580
  I'm sorry to call you when you're busy.  

420
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,960
No, I'm not busy.

421
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,750
Chae Woon is doing well.

422
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,560
Yes, thank you for everything.

423
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,420
I...

424
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,290
What is it?

425
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:58,430
I got a message from the chairwoman yesterday.

426
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,520
What? From my mom?

427
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,800
My mom sent this to you?

428
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,050
What did she say about it?

429
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,390
She said I should refer to this.

430
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:21,280
  So, I was worried  

431
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,290
that you might get in trouble because of Chae Woon,

432
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,710
and I was also worried about Chae Woon. That's why I'm calling you right now.

433
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,780
Chae Woon's fine.

434
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,860
I'm fine as well.

435
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,290
But did my mom contact you often like this?

436
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,060
Did she contact you before, too?

437
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,930
Yes.

438
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:53,460
She contacted me a couple of times recently because of Chae Woon.

439
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,180
Why?

440
00:35:55,850 --> 00:36:02,480
She's not a person who just contact people without any reason.

441
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:05,160
But why did she contact you?

442
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,690
Why?

443
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:16,350
I think the chairwoman can't take Chae Woon as her granddaughter yet.

444
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,930
I guess that's why she's worried about stuff and contacted me.

445
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,740
From now on,

446
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,480
I'm not just going to take it anymore, chairwoman.

447
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,890
I need to protect my Chae Woon.

448
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,650
Why the hell did you do that, mom?

449
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:07,100
- Why did you send the anonymous community board post to Soon Jung? 
 - Why shouldn't I?

450
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:12,640
We're risking this much right now, so I sent that to Soon Jung for her to close her mouth.

451
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,780
That was unnecessary.

452
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,890
Did Soon Jung only talk about those photos?

453
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,130
Did she say anything else?

454
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,780
Mom, did you say something else, too? What did you say to her?

455
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,880
Soon Jung, that girl is pretty good. She knows how to make a move.

456
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,610
Mom.

457
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,770
There's something that I don't know about it, right?

458
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:45,320
There's something in between you and Soon Jung, right?

459
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:53,110
There's nothing! If there's anything, I'm trying to protect you and our family.

460
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:57,840
If you think about it, it's all because of you.

461
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,520
It's all because of your bad relationship with Park Pil Hong!

462
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,480
You're saying that again!

463
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,350
That's right.

464
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,610
Is Bit Chae Woon dating Min Jae's son?

465
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,480
Woo Jae Hee?

466
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,040
How do you know about that?

467
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,510
He's the one our Seo Ah likes.

468
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,620
Is Seo Ah okay with them dating?

469
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,450
Do you think she would be okay with that?

470
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,880
Mom, please don't talk about this to Seo Ah.

471
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,690
I'm really anxious because of that these days.

472
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:39,670
I bet! Seo Ah that princess, can't even tell me about it because of her pride.

473
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,380
I feel bad for her!

474
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:49,060
Bit Chae Woon that thing is a bad relationship with us in a lot of different ways!

475
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,990
Mom, Bit Chae Woon is your granddaughter!

476
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:59,820
- Stop talking about her like that! 
 - I told you not every granddaughter is the same.

477
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,450
Bit Chae Woon, she is not a girl that should be revealed to the world!

478
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,040
It's for you and our family.

479
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,970
     

480
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:36,320
Oppa, why did you call me?

481
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,920
You never call me.

482
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,040
How have you been?

483
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,640
I haven't been well.

484
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,030
  Why did you call me?  

485
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,280
I have something to ask you.

486
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,110
Is that so?

487
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:58,490
Isn't it hard to talk over the phone? Let's talk in person.

488
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,440
Well...

489
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,280
Are you afraid of me?

490
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,630
I'm sorry? No, it's not like that!

491
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,140
But then, why did you guys stop laughing when I showed up?

492
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,310
I'm sorry!

493
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,860
- Mr. Jung. 
 - Yes, brother-in-law.

494
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,910
Why do the employees stop laughing when I show up?

495
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,540
Why is everybody feel uncomfortable about me?

496
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,760
You didn't know about that until now? It's because you're too--

497
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,410
What is it?

498
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,180
What?

499
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:08,850
I mean, you're a bit picky and stern.

500
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,120
A while ago, somebody laughed in the middle of a meeting, and you said,

501
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,970
"Is my face funny? We're in a serious meeting, and why are you laughing!"

502
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:23,490
After you yelled like that, nobody laughed again in front of you! I doubt they will laugh even if you tickle them.

503
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:30,900
- Did I do that? 
 - Yes! Don't you remember that?

504
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,710
Right, I was like that.

505
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:57,190
I only thought about the work, so I couldn't see the people.

506
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:04,360
If it wasn't about the company's work, nobody talked to me.

507
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,040
Including my family.

508
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,370
  Welcome home.  

509
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,640
  Bad teacher!  

510
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,370
- Why did you come so late? 
 - There were tons of traffic.

511
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,340
-  I just late by like 5 minutes! 
 - Let's go faster!

512
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,770
  These days, the ones with lace like this one are selling well.  

513
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,150
What are you talking about it? You should wear those. Your sense became weird these days!

514
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,440
  My goodness.  

515
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:46,600
I think this is better! Like a fierce animal.

516
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,990
This is a bit too much of an animal print.

517
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,340
- These are selling well, too. 
 - Right? Hae Deun, what do you think about this one?

518
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,400
No! Trendy style these days are something like these.

519
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,250
Here!

520
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:02,830
She has a great sense!

521
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:05,140
You hired a good employee.

522
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,450
She's not my employee.

523
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,650
Here!

524
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,570
That's right. This kind of vest is trendy again!

525
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,390
An employee.

526
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,090
An employee?

527
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:21,040
- Do you want me to join your company? 
 - Yes.

528
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,410
How many employees do you have?

529
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:28,990
Let me think about it. With this building and that building, it's only you and me.

530
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,910
- What is that? 
 - What are you talking about it?

531
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,620
It's a tiny company, but we're going to be full-time positions.

532
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,040
If you join my company, I'll make you the director. I'll be the CEO, and you'll be the director. How is that?

533
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,640
The size is pretty big! For two of us.

534
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:48,330
I'm fine with it. I told you before that I'm going to leave soon.

535
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,560
What are you talking about it? Are you really leaving?

536
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,790
Yes, it's for real!

537
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,620
Then, can you work for me until you have to leave?

538
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,630
I have to go to the training camp.

539
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:04,280
What? A training camp?

540
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,450
Are you becoming an Olympic athlete?

541
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,060
I haven't made up my mind yet, but...

542
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:15,090
Then, why don't you work for me until you leave! Will you?

543
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,140
Please?

544
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,000
I'll think about it.

545
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,940
Your reaction made me embarrassed. Have as much as you want to eat.

546
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,270
  Jjung-a! Shall we go on a date today?  

547
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,170
  I don't have work today.  

548
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,760
  Is my Jjung-a busy today?  

549
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,340
  I'm busy today.  

550
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,510
  But I'll make time for you.  

551
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,670
It has been a while for me to go on a date!

552
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,140
Let's go out for a date!

553
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,950
I look good. I don't have anything more to touch.

554
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:51,920
House is not just a place to rest, but these days, it's also for your work and hobby.

555
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,030
Because it needs to function for various demands, people are more interested in interior design.

556
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,210
He's my son, but he's very awesome!

557
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,110
These kinds of big show-rooms are trendy these days.

558
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,700
You're here!

559
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,840
Hello. We met before.

560
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,200
Hello, professor.

561
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,650
How is your back? You almost fell the other day.

562
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,420
I'm fine because you saved me.

563
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,090
Yes? Hello?

564
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:49,510
Also, we have various types of bathrooms here.

565
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:54,450
You can experience the ones that you want to try. But the water is not connected!

566
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,640
Yes, please come this way.

567
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,060
Ms. Jung Min Jae, are you busy?

568
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:03,360
Yes, I'm a bit busy. Why?

569
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:08,780
I was going to ask you about it this morning,

570
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,460
- but is your manic-depression-- 
   - Mr. Woo Jung Hoo.  

571
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:15,340
If it's not an urgent matter, let's talk later.

572
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,340
- Mom, you're here-- 
 - Oh, my! You surprised me!

573
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,940
  - Jae Hee!   
 - Oh! Thank you for coming, professor.

574
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,940
  Jae Hee! You looked really awesome!  

575
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,310
You looked very professional! I want to change my kitchen, too.

576
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:31,230
- What happened here? 
 - I just bumped into something...

577
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,540
- You also want to renovate your kitchen! 
 - Yes!

578
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,040
For you, I think elegant style kitchen will fit you.

579
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:41,430
Oh, my son can recognize my elegance!

580
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:47,830
- Oh! She met up with Jae Hee.  
   - I think he resembles you.  

581
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,820
  - Jae Hee has a good voice like you.   
 - Huh? Who is that?

582
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:56,100
- Oh, do I have a good voice? 
 - Of course!

583
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,370
You sound like a voice-actor! Well, you look like an actor.

584
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:04,070
- What? 
   - Jae Hee, you must be happy. You resemble your mother, so you're handsome and have a nice voice.  

585
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:08,390
  What are you talking about it!  

586
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,930
  You're flattering me too much!  

587
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:15,480
  - Professor, you said that before as well. I guess you became my mom's fan! 
 - What are you talking about it! 

588
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,580
A professor?

589
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,340
  Mom, why do you like it so much!  

590
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,060
These people!

591
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,800
By the way, who is that guy?

592
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,920
- Hello? Jae Hee's mom! 
   - Oh!  

593
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,360
Hello!

594
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,540
     

595
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,220
  The person you're trying to reach is unavailable right now... 

596
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:47,820
Woo Jae Hee, this bad son... 
      

597
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:54,480
- But are you really his mother? 
 - I gave birth to him.

598
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:01,710
In the meeting? 
      

599
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,230
Seriously, who the hell was that guy?

600
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:13,450
Like a pepper flake that got stuck in between teeth, he's stuck in between Jung Min Jae and Woo Jae Hee and laughing!

601
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,070
Who the hell is he?

602
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,030
Enjoy!

603
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,010
Lee Ra Hoon.

604
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:22,670
Yes?

605
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:26,330
- Can I get something delicious for you today? 
 - Why, all of a sudden?

606
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,320
Enjoy!

607
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:32,380
Because I got paid today! The work that I did for the administration office in school!

608
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,270
- Oh, really? 
 - Yes!

609
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,240
What are you going to get for me?

610
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,420
- Anything! 
 - Anything?

611
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,330
What should we eat?

612
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,420
I feel like I arrived a bit too early.

613
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,300
Ah-ha, I was right.

614
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:52,800
What should I do? Should I go back and come back?

615
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,240
I feel like I put on too much make-up.

616
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,470
I can feel the mascara.

617
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,040
It is too much. But I look good!

618
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:07,330
It's a bit uncomfortable. Oh, my goodness!

619
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,700
You look very pretty!

620
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:14,930
What is it? Did you get a flower for me?

621
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,640
- I just picked it up on the way here. 
 - What?

622
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,760
Thank you.

623
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,890
Shall we go now?

624
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:26,980
Yes, shall we?

625
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:34,640
- Were you this pretty the whole time in the hospital? 
 - Of course!

626
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,240
- I have my basic beauty. 
 - What should I do with you!

627
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,580
Aren't you spending too much money today?

628
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:50,110
I wanted to spend some money today on you.

629
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,700
You saw me crying when I was talking with my sister, right?

630
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:57,190
So, you feel bad for me, right?

631
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:00,380
I felt like that a little bit,

632
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:04,040
but you looked cute when you were crying!

633
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,900
It's not cute...

634
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,000
I wanted to thank you because you let me live in the Samgwang villa.

635
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:17,590
My older brothers, who are way older than me, all got married and left the house.

636
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,720
I was just living with my dad, and felt very lonely.

637
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:25,860
Even though I was hiding when I was living in the Samgwang villa, it felt less lonely.

638
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,590
There are a lot of people living together.

639
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:34,600
Ah, the joy of living is something like this. That's what I felt.

640
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,830
You felt a big thing when you were living in hiding.

641
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,990
- Lee Ra Hoon. 
 - Yes?

642
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,040
Let's have a relationship.

643
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,990
What?

644
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,850
Let's start an actual relationship.

645
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,230
I know you want it, too.

646
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,860
When did I say that?

647
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:10,340
What are you trying to do with just getting me a pasta?

648
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,070
Also, I'm not a college student.

649
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,670
You're saying that again!

650
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,440
You had a crying confession to Hae Deun unni and your mother.

651
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,340
And what is that have to do with our relationship?

652
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,510
From today, we're in a relationship.

653
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,300
How does that sound?

654
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,040
I'll be back from the restroom.

655
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,540
Lee Ra Hoon, he's just...

656
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,670
He's!

657
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,440
He's never going to have a girlfriend.

658
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:09,730
What is it?

659
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,810
Yes?

660
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:23,060
  From today, we're in a relationship. 

661
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,640
What did you say? I couldn't hear you!

662
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,180
You heard it. Why are you pretending you couldn't hear me?

663
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:37,270
From today! We're in a relationship!

664
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:02,690
- I was going to get the movies, too! 
 - Today is the first day of our relationship, so I wanted to get the tickets.

665
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:04,890
And you wanted to see this movie.

666
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,950
- Oh, no! 
 - What's wrong?

667
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:13,800
I got the wrong seats because I was rushing.

668
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:15,920
We have to sit separately, what should we do?

669
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:18,030
Why don't we change it now?

670
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,180
It's all full besides the first row!

671
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:24,220
I guess we should just take those seats?

672
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,240
- Do you want some popcorn? 
 - No, you can have it all.

673
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,040
Enjoy the movie!

674
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:39,840
What's wrong?

675
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,940
Let's get up. Let's get up.

676
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,820
Ra Hoon.

677
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:12,060
I'm sorry!

678
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,190
I'm so sorry!

679
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,350
  Moong-i, I guess you had a hard time today, too.  

680
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,750
  Did you think about me a lot?  

681
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:06,680
  Ah, I forgot about thinking about you, Koala.  

682
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:14,650
  Really? I was thinking about you all the time! I have a dedicated section for you inside my head.  

683
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,230
  I know you're lying.  

684
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,260
  It's not a lie!  

685
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,350
  I'm going to meet up with Seo Ah tonight. I'm going to ask her about some stuff.  

686
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,670
  Are you reporting that to me?  

687
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,040
  Yes! I'm reporting to Moong-i.  

688
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:38,210
  I grant you the permit.  

689
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,440
I wonder if Ms. Soon Jung is doing well.

690
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:14,910
  Actually, there's something that I have to tell everything about,  

691
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:19,530
  but I can't do that.  

692
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:24,780
What's the story that she couldn't tell me?

693
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,230
I feel like somebody's making her suffer.

694
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:34,970
I wish I could be a help to her.

695
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:52,760
    
 Mom, I'm going to come home late tonight. I'm sorry.  

696
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:56,050
  Okay. Come home safe.  

697
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:02,620
    
 Ms. Lee! I think I'm going to come home late tonight.  

698
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,630
    
 Unni, I'm coming home late.   

699
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:11,270
    
 Noonim, I'm going to come home late tonight! Please go to bed first.  

700
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,540
Everybody's coming home late tonight.

701
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,190
Let's go inside.

702
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,440
Please just talk to me here.

703
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:47,880
How dare you say to Jung Won?

704
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,520
Are you trying to threaten me?

705
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,240
Yes.

706
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,140
What?

707
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:05,920
I told you that I'm going to watch you to protect my Chae Woon, but you didn't do anything that I asked you.

708
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,400
If you can send me the text like that to me,

709
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,640
- then you must be giving a hard time to Chae Woon-- 
 - That's why I told you before!

710
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:15,950
Before you get more harassed, leave.

711
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:18,210
I can't leave!

712
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,360
Why do I have to leave!

713
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:23,820
How dare you look at me straight with your eyes open..!

714
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:26,950
Lee Soon Jung, did you lose your mind?

715
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,500
- Are you crazy! 
   - Ms. Lee!  

716
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,490
President!

717
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:45,790
Is there something going on?

718
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,440
Nothing. It's just...

719
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:57,100
Ah, hello, chairwoman.

720
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:59,540
I haven't seen you in a while.

721
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,730
Who... are you?

722
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:06,860
I'm Jung Won's friend Min Jae's husband.

723
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:09,050
Jae Hee's father.

724
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,150
Jae Hee's father?

725
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,940
President! Your memory..!

726
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,670
You're here.

727
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,690
Did you have dinner?

728
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,140
I just ate something.

729
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,650
What about you?

730
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,270
I ate something at the site.

731
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,310
I heard the stuff that happened in the company.

732
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,760
Bit Chae Woon snitched on you.

733
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,960
She didn't snitch to me. I just heard about it while we were talking.

734
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,440
Right, you guys are in a relationship.

735
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:30,750
I heard it from Chae Woon's mother as well.

736
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:39,180
- Bit Chae Woon snitched on to that lady as well? 
 - No, she heard it from the chairwoman.

737
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:44,790
The mother of the CEO sent a screenshot of the posting.

738
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,620
My grandmother did that?

739
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:50,350
I'm leaving! Good night!

740
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,240
Ah, I'm exhausted.

741
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,700
    
  Bit Chae Woon, you must have worked hard today.  

742
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:03,530
  It was okay. I finished going around every store.   

743
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,510
  You have to go to one more place. What should I do?  

744
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:08,850
Wow, why is she like this again?

745
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:13,330
Where is it?

746
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,140
Sure, I'll send this emoji, too.

747
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,170
Hey, Seo Ah. Stop drinking.

748
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:33,880
You can't handle a drink.

749
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:37,970
- Let's go home. I'll take you home. 
 - I don't want to!

750
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,750
Let's go.

751
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,480
- Oppa, you should go by yourself. 
 - You're drunk like this, and how can I go by myself?

752
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,640
  Hwang Na Ro?
    

753
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,730
Yes, Na Ro.

754
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,430
Where are you?

755
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:03,470
Are you drinking today as well?

756
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:08,680
Where are you? You don't sound like you're at home.

757
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:11,200
Can I come to you tonight?

758
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:14,150
Do you want to come here?

759
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:19,830
Right, you always wanted to hang out with me.

760
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,470
I feel bad to say no to you every time.

761
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:25,360
I'm at--

762
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,440
Hey, Hwang Na Ro.

763
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,040
  You know who I am, right?  

764
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:31,480
Just go home quietly!

765
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,660
Hello?

766
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:40,240
Woo Jae Hee? Is she with Woo Jae Hee right now?

767
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,040
     

768
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:50,210
  The power is off. Your call will be redirected to the voice-mail.  

769
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:01,710
Hello, driver. Where is the director Jang Seo Ah now?

770
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:04,930
I have urgent documents to hand it over to her.

771
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:08,200
What are you doing?

772
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:10,250
Give it back to me.

773
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,810
Let's go home, Seo Ah.

774
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,950
Why are you interfering in my personal life?

775
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,950
You said you and I are nothing.

776
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,590
You have a girlfriend, Bit Chae Woon.

777
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:25,880
- But how can you interfere with me with what kind of right! 
 - I have a right to interfere!

778
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,130
You're my friend Joon Ah's baby sister!

779
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:30,860
How can I let you hang out with a bad guy!

780
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:32,510
A bad guy?

781
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:35,500
Why is Hwang Na Ro a bad guy?

782
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,170
Because he likes me? Yes!

783
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,490
He said he likes me.

784
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,310
You're the only person who rejects me, but there are plenty of other people who are desperate to date me!

785
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,700
No, stop drinking, Seo Ah.

786
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:55,870
Listen carefully to me. Hwang Na Ro is a bad guy. He has a criminal record of fraud!

787
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,250
Do you think he's getting close to you because he likes you?

788
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:06,850
He's getting close to you with an evil intention!

789
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:09,060
Oppa, how can you be like this to me?

790
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:11,500
You are not accepting my love!

791
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:15,260
You made me stay around you for a long time.

792
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:20,490
Now you're dating another woman! And you're dating Bit Chae Woon, the one that I hate the most in this entire world!

793
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,190
And why can't I meet someone else?

794
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:25,680
How can you be like this to me...

795
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:32,370
  The new owner of our agency store will be waiting in that cafe. Just tell them briefly about the work.  

796
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:45,040
I feel like Jang Seo Ah ordered this.

797
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,720
To make me see her with Koala.

798
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:11,810
Oppa, why are you so selfish?

799
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:16,630
How can you only care about yourself!

800
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:22,000
Come out now. Let's go home.

801
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,240
I knew about everything!

802
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:29,070
That Hwang Na Ro is a bad guy.

803
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:32,130
I knew he has a criminal record!

804
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,530
- What? 
 - I don't care if he's a bad guy.

805
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,580
Rather than living my life miserably after getting abandoned by you,

806
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:42,620
I wanted to be with someone who loves me, even though he's a bad guy.

807
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:46,700
- Excuse me. You can't be like this in here. 
 - I'm sorry.

808
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:51,390
- Let's go home. 
 - Let go of me! Let me go!

809
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:55,990
You're not going to take responsibility for me. You only want to see me when there's a problem!

810
01:06:56,030 --> 01:07:01,600
- Oppa, how can you be like this to me! 
   - Excuse me!  

811
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,240
Moong-i.

812
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,240
Seo Ah!

813
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:26,680
Let go of me!

814
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:32,040
Seo Ah. Seo Ah!

815
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,260
Yes, driver. Where are you?

816
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:52,570
We're on the street here. Yes!

817
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:15,050
Moong-i, you'll get cold.

818
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:18,150
I'm okay.

819
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:28,030
I'm sorry.

820
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:41,740
  He must be having a hard time. What should I do?  

821
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:48,840
♫   My heart is filled with tears   ♫

822
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:54,550
♫   Did you forget? Did you forget about me?   ♫

823
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:59,330
♫   Did you forget all those memories   ♫

824
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:05,530
♫   My heart is opening arms to you   ♫

825
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:09,880
♫   I'm barely going through today   ♫

826
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:15,840
♫   Did you forget? Did you forget about me?   ♫

827
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:21,060
♫   I'm still waiting for you   ♫

828
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,840
     

829
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:26,580
  I remember you and Chae Woon's mother knew each other since young.  

830
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,980
  How did you know each other?  

831
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,590
  Is she your first love?  

832
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,030
  - I was right! 
 - No, it's not!  

833
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,870
  I'm totally right!  

834
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,530
  If she's my father's first love, then it gets complicated.  

835
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:39,330
  Excuse me.  

836
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,930
  Young lady Min Jae!  

837
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:43,220
  J-Jae Hee's mom!  

838
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,180
  Bit Chae Woon will get out of this house soon.  

839
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:49,000
  If I get close to you, Jae Hee oppa will be anxious, right?  

840
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:52,190
  Can you look at me in a better way? Like I have feelings for you.  

841
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,950
  - Will you? 
 - And then?   

842
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:55,700
  And then?  

843
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:58,490
  - Prison medical service volunteer work? 
 - I always did it every year around this time.  

844
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:01,150
  Thank you for the food, mother. Enjoy your meal!  

845
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:03,210
  I finally remembered.
