1
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,890
Why are you so strong?

2
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,150
You're stronger.

3
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,340
Ha! That car is getting a ticket.

4
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,380
- Oh! Excuse me! 
 - Is that your car?

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,830
Sir, sir! Police officer! I'm sorry, we'll take this out now.

6
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:49,010
- We'll take this out now. 
 - I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you so much!

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,740
- Thank you so much! 
 - Thank you!

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,140
     

9
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,190
I shouldn't have run into you.

10
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,900
Likewise.

11
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,680
Thank you for the food! It looks good.

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,040
You should eat first.

13
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,840
If you're hungry, it gets sadder.

14
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,740
- I'm not sad. 
 - Here.

15
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,870
This part got totally red!

16
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,520
It's really good.

17
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,840
My parents filed for a divorce by mutual consent today.

18
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,540
The woman who left the house I was talking about was my mother.

19
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,940
That's not an occasion for you to cry! You're not a baby.

20
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,140
I said I didn't cry!

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,890
Okay. You didn't cry, and you're not a baby. Is it good?

22
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,640
Your parents' divorce doesn't mean they're no longer Koala's...

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,940
no, I meant Mr. Woo's parents.

24
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,840
I know. But it just makes me feel a bit sad.

25
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,540
It makes me feel like my family is getting destroyed now.

26
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,840
What's getting destroyed? Even though they got divorced, they are still your parents.

27
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,260
Then, you guys are still family.

28
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,370
Family is forever!

29
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:58,160
Also, that choice got made under their mutual agreement, so you just have to admit it.

30
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,940
But family isn't that cool and simple.

31
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,430
Connected by blood is not that simple.

32
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,240
Why?

33
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,140
Did you...

34
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,040
hear that I got adopted?

35
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,140
I'm sorry?

36
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:29,170
  Mom, the reason why I was looking for my biological parents was just out of curiosity.  

37
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,630
  I was just simply wondering about the people who gave birth to me are like.  

38
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:42,090
That's why you think I don't know anything about a blood connection?

39
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,940
No, it's not like that. I just meant--

40
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,440
That can be right!

41
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,660
But connected by blood or biological family is not the essential factor to be considered as a family.

42
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,580
I also know well about what family means.

43
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,240
I-I really didn't mean that way...

44
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,900
Okay. I know you didn't mean that.

45
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:16,470
But the reason why I got it in a twisted way automatically might be because I'm self-conscious about that.

46
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,720
I really didn't mean that!

47
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,340
- I'm really sorry. I guess I got sensitive and said it in the wrong way. 
 - No, it's totally fine!

48
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:33,040
Now I have to go back to the store. I'll finish eating this on the way. Thank you!

49
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,140
Don't be too sensitive. It's your parents' decision, so just admit it for them.

50
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,330
And comfort your mother well. Fighting, Koala! You got this!

51
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm leaving!

52
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,780
Okay, bye.

53
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,270
Ah, excuse me!

54
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,430
Ah, she's so clumsy...

55
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,440
Huh? I think I saw this somewhere before.

56
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,150
Gomgomi! 
      

57
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,320
  I got this thing!  

58
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,780
  That's an important thing for me! Please keep it safe.  

59
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,270
  It depends.  

60
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:02,320
  Ah! You just laughed, right? I can see everything from you. That's good! You should laugh more.  

61
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,120
The weather's nice today!

62
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,230
  It won't be that common for people to come to see books on their divorce day,  

63
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,080
  but this is pretty nice.  

64
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,460
  You can do this, Jung Min Jae.  

65
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,140
     

66
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,840
     

67
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,390
  I hope you have a nice life, Mr. Woo Jung Hoo.  

68
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,330
Umm... CEO?

69
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:22,920
- I don't think the report was that funny. 
 - Why not?

70
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:30,020
The report that our company's bed is getting better and better with technological innovation is exciting news!

71
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,790
It's all thanks to all of you. Thank you.

72
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:54,560
  Now I can understand that phrase says I'm crying even when I'm smiling.  

73
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,920
I wonder if our Hae Deun ate lunch...

74
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,940
Ah! They asked for sandwiches as well!

75
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,430
- Yes, mom. 
 - Hae Deun! I'm in front of your office.

76
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,040
  You're in front of my office?  

77
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,830
  I came to work in an apartment around this area, and I thought about you.  

78
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,940
Do you have some time? It's still lunch time.

79
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:45,040
- Oh, no, I already ate. I have to practice right after the lunch break. 
   - Is that so?  

80
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,740
You're working hard! Well, then, I see.

81
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:55,810
Hae Deun! My daughter is working really hard, so I'll send you tons of energy, okay?

82
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,630
Yes, yes, thank you, mom.

83
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:08,890
Our Hae Deun, please let her get a lot of compliments from the teacher,

84
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,420
and please let her pass the second audition as well.

85
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,020
I'm sorry, mom...

86
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,640
I told you to finish the report of the Spring-Summer season, but why did you come out without finishing it?

87
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,240
I heard that I should go around the stores first in the morning.

88
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,740
It means after finishing your work. How can you go out without finishing your work?

89
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,770
  - Maybe you didn't give enough time for her to finish the work.   
 - CEO.

90
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,620
I looked into it and figured that Ms. Lee Bit Chae Woon was the only person who did the store works.

91
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,940
What happened to the other intern?

92
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,540
I volunteered. I split the work with the other intern, Kim Dae Won.

93
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,990
- And we're going to switch our work next week. 
 - Is that so?

94
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,940
And I should've submitted the report yesterday, but I couldn't finish it. I'm sorry.

95
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,640
- No matter how busy you are, you have to do your job within the deadline, right? 
 - Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

96
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,870
Yes, you're doing a great job! How's it going these days?

97
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:21,990
  - I guess the last promotion worked?   
 - Yes, and the launch of the new product helped as well.

98
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:27,370
- Which product is the most popular one for the customers? 
 - It's this one.

99
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,640
- Oh, this one? 
 - Yes.

100
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,040
  Then, with this one...  

101
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,870
What if we display these two together? With this and...

102
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,540
There will be an important event at the company soon.

103
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,740
You should get prepared well for that.

104
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,010
Yes, I'll do my best.

105
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:13,050
- Ah, I heard that you don't like this kind of response. 
 - I did.

106
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,800
But it's good to hear when you said it.

107
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,040
Be careful! Isn't it heavy? You should be careful of your back.

108
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,040
I'm fine. When I'm in a good mood, I become really strong!

109
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,940
- Ah, excuse me. 
 - Careful, careful!

110
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,920
Cha Ba Reun.

111
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,540
Now she's really not following me anymore.

112
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,340
  How dare you judge me like that? Who do you think you are!  

113
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:05,550
Well. She must be completely put off by me now.

114
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,800
What am I thinking right now?

115
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:17,190
- If you came a little bit earlier, then there was a room flooded with light! 
 - Oh, uncle!

116
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,740
- Who is she? 
 - She came for a room to rent. She saw that room rental post late and came here.

117
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,140
- Hello. 
 - Yes, hello.

118
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,380
What should we do? We don't have any empty rooms anymore.

119
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,590
- I'm totally fine to share a room. 
 - Do you mean to share a room with other people?

120
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,470
But there's no room to be shared. Because everyone is guys.

121
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,190
What if she shares the room with Man Jung?

122
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,040
If aunt finds that out, then she might get upset and never come back home.

123
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,680
Why are you worrying about Man Jung?

124
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,170
I'm just worried about the consequences. I'm sorry, but you should look for another place.

125
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,240
- Can I share the Man Jung's room? 
 - No, no. Man Jung's room is not okay.

126
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,870
I can look for another room for you. I know all of the rentals in this area.

127
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,200
- I'm sorry about that. 
 - Excuse me!

128
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,000
Have a safe trip back home!

129
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,490
I don't need another place.

130
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,760
If you don't need it, then what can I do. I'm sorry. Then, goodbye.

131
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,500
There's no room to rent?

132
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,520
- Why don't we start by finishing the marble? 
 - Yes.

133
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,310
  It's your parents' decision, so just admit it for them.   

134
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,980
  And comfort your mother well.  

135
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,620
Jae Hee.

136
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,430
Ta-da!

137
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,540
I'm sorry that I kept bothered you to meet me.

138
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,840
It was on my mind after we said goodbye like that before.

139
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,210
- Wait for a second for me. I'll bring my bag. 
 - You don't have to!

140
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,980
For today, you should spend time by yourself as you wanted to.

141
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,740
You know that I'm always by your side, right?

142
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,750
Of course, I know that. Thank you, it's very pretty.

143
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:37,930
- The flower isn't that pretty. Ms. Jung Min Jae is prettier. 
 - Right?

144
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,860
Ah, I have something for you, too.

145
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,770
Ta-da. It's your present!

146
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,770
What?

147
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,920
I thought your car was too old, so I bought a new one with the money I saved.

148
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,780
I don't deserve this!

149
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,740
I love you, my son. Don't worry about me. I'll live a fabulous life.

150
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,400
I love you, too, mom.

151
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,140
  Woo Jae Hee, fighting!  

152
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,810
Fighting!

153
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,160
Maybe I should've consoled him more.

154
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,020
Hey, Bit Chae Woon.

155
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,510
This is my problem.

156
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,470
That I act differently than I think.

157
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,900
I'm an idiot, idiot, idiot!

158
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,880
- Please use the facility cleanly. 
 - Yes, I'm so sorry.

159
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,540
I returned after finished my work well.

160
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,440
Thank you for your hard work.

161
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,200
Also, thank you for saving me before.

162
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,470
It was nothing.

163
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:53,280
I don't know why Director Jang Seo Ah keeps asking me to make only you work outside of the office. It puts me in an awkward position.

164
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,990
  She's very different from the CEO. Maybe it's because she's not her real daughter.  

165
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:06,160
You didn't know about that? That the CEO got remarried?

166
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,740
They don't necessarily talk about that in public, but people who know know.

167
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,630
Pretend you didn't hear that.

168
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:29,040
  Seo Ah wasn't the biological daughter of the CEO.  

169
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,710
Your team members?

170
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,260
Yes. I think we'll bond more if I can invite them home and have a home-cooked meal together.

171
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,740
Our director Jang, that's a good idea.

172
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,540
Should I let the hotel MaRa to take care of the food?

173
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,680
No, I know the best chef.

174
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,750
Is that so? Our mom is the best!

175
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,060
     

176
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,180
Yes, young lady.

177
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,240
Your daughter's coworkers?

178
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,350
Yes! It's not for difficult guests,

179
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,600
but my daughter wants to invite her team members and have dinner together.

180
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,040
Can you help me with this, Soon Jung?

181
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,850
I'm terrible at cooking.

182
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:45,140
Of course, I can help you.

183
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:53,170
No, I'll prepare at home with anything I need.

184
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,430
What kind of food does your daughter likes?

185
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,700
Yes. Then think about it, and give me a text.

186
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,420
Yes.

187
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,530
  Our daughter still likes foods that kids will like.  

188
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:30,040
  Sweet and spicy tteokbokki, fried squid, and-- 
    

189
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,850
  I'm sending you some pictures.  

190
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:42,450
  While I was looking at the surveillance camera around the company's building, I found a person that looks like the same person.   

191
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,840
  There is a chance it's not the same person, but the shoes are exactly the same.  

192
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:51,310
  It's a luxury brand shoes that's not possible to get it from our country.  

193
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Come this way.

194
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,870
Let me introduce him. This is the translator who's going to take care of our Spain project this time, Mr. Hwang Na Ro.

195
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,260
Nice to meet you. I'm Hwang Na Ro.

196
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,030
Supervisor Yoon, about our new project--

197
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,090
Director, are you okay?

198
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,150
You should be careful not to fall.

199
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,740
Thank you.

200
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,640
  You should be careful.  

201
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,560
  Not to fall.  

202
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,670
Then, I will brief about the Spanish urban fashion that I translated.

203
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:59,460
Girasol, it means sunflower.

204
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:06,360
This season, they have introduced design products that used motifs from Spanish architecture that are not well-known.

205
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:12,770
A house that looks like a castle in a fairytale. They hommage the sunflower patterned tile of the architecture

206
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,740
and made the design that shows the beauty of the autumn.

207
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:24,920
Among them, the main theme of this season is the sunflower pattern that gives a vintage vibe.

208
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,150
  Chae Woon, if you have time, please go visit your aunt.  

209
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,800
  You have to step up to move Man Jung's feeling.  

210
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,540
Bit Chae Woon!

211
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,740
- Oh! What if any of the office people see us? 
 - What's wrong with that?

212
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,840
Everybody already left. You're the last one to come out!

213
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,940
You're such a workaholic.

214
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,750
- Did you wait for me? 
 - Yes! Let's go home together.

215
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,470
I have to go somewhere before going home.

216
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,120
Then, let's go there together and go home.

217
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,390
I think it's better to go by myself.

218
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,640
What's this? Are you playing hard to get?

219
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,540
What are you talking about? We're all the same Samgwang people.

220
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,860
Samgwang people. That's right, Samgwang people.

221
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:19,740
Okay, I'll get going. I'll see you later at home.

222
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,240
It's not easy. It's not easy at all.

223
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,480
Yes, Dr. Lee. Come in.

224
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,840
I'm not Dr. Lee, but I'm Driver Lee.

225
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,900
How did you know about this place?

226
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,170
My god, Kim Hwak Se! I told him to shut his mouth up!

227
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,340
Tell me his number!

228
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,750
Yell at him later.

229
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,820
Come back home, auntie.

230
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,930
What? You came here because your mom sent you, right?

231
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,450
It's fine. Tell her that everything's fine.

232
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,660
You're eating all of my mom's cooking, but you're not coming back home?

233
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,250
What's that, auntie? Why are you being like a rebellious high school kid?

234
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,960
Then, should I throw out the food that she sent?

235
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,010
So, tell her that she shouldn't send the food anymore!

236
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,810
Take this with you.

237
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,940
You and I are really...

238
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,540
I'm leaving.

239
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,990
Bye.

240
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,040
What's this? What's wrong?

241
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,630
I'm going to say this only one time!

242
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:06,930
Auntie, I'm sorry. I did it wrong.

243
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,700
So, come back home, please.

244
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,200
You didn't do anything wrong, I did.

245
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,320
- Let me go. It's hot. It's hot! 
 - Ah, really.

246
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,080
Your waist doesn't have any curve.

247
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,270
- That's my charming point. 
 - That's true.

248
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,840
I mean! You should come back home. Okay?

249
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,340
Skinny girls like you are ruining the future idea of beauty in this country!

250
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,560
Eat more! You have to gain 10kg more at least! I'm the standard.

251
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,410
You guys should stop doing this. Go up to your rooms and rest.

252
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,790
After finishing this.

253
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,300
Is this called you trimmed the onions?

254
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,700
- I'm holding a knife. 
 - I got it. 
   - I'm home!  

255
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,760
She came home early...

256
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,580
You're home early!

257
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,340
What's all that? Are you preparing a home party?

258
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,170
No, mom is doing this for a family that she knows.

259
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,140
- It's done now! 
 - Mom, why are you taking this away? Let's do it together!

260
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,910
It's fine, it's fine. It's done now.

261
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,840
- It's not done at all! There's a ton left here. 
 - No, it's done. I'm fine.

262
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,840
You guys should stop now as well.

263
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,340
I hate you, mom! We had been working the whole time, but now you're making us stop after unni came home.

264
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,960
Mom said she didn't need any help, but we volunteered.

265
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,940
You insisted, I didn't!

266
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,930
What's wrong with you guys? Stop that!

267
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:43,540
Today's work is done now! Go to your rooms!

268
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,740
- Good work today! 
 - Good work today! Good night!

269
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,510
Please check that when the lighting company owner comes tomorrow.

270
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,220
- I'll do the rest of the finishings tonight. Have a good night. 
 - Thank you for your hard work!

271
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:09,010
    

272
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,760
  You might get sick. Go home and rest.  

273
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,450
Why am I thinking of the headbutt all of a sudden?

274
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,640
Disappear, disappear, disappear!

275
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,900
Disappear, disappear, disappear!

276
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,350
Headbutt! Go away!

277
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,940
Ha! Jung Min Jae.

278
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:03,240
You're not the only person who has your own life. I'm going to enjoy my own life as well!

279
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,340
Put the laundry in and...

280
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,940
And then...

281
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,450
Ah, press this.

282
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:03,340
Close the door and press this.

283
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,140
And after that...

284
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,690
  You should change your underwear every day.  

285
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,720
Underwear.

286
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,940
Why is this not opening?

287
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,550
Are you looking down at me as well?

288
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,060
Did Koala come home?

289
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,610
Why am I worried about him?

290
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,530
Gomgomi. Yes.

291
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:52,890
I should get my Gomgomi back. I'm going out to get my Gomgomi.

292
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,010
Good night! Thank you so much.

293
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,000
Aigoo, Mr. Woo!

294
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,640
You're coming home late.

295
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,210
Yes, Hyungnim. How are you? I had a lot of work today.

296
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,000
- You're working really hard. 
 - No, it's nothing.

297
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,190
By the way, is there something going on with you? Your face looks really dark right now.

298
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:20,590
- Nothing's going on.
 - No, there's something. Do you want to have a drink and raise the temperature with me after my work?

299
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,380
- Today's not a good day. Let's do it next time. I'm sorry. 
 - Is that so.

300
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:32,110
Go inside. You should have some rest! Sleeping will cure everything! I'll not snore tonight!

301
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,270
Are you working out in the middle of the night?

302
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,940
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

303
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,670
What?! Why would I?

304
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,840
I said that without any reason, but your reaction is so obvious!

305
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,800
Oh, right. The-- Ouch!

306
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,350
I'm sorry.

307
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,030
- That really hurt me. 
 - Are you okay?

308
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,780
- I'm not going to give this back to you. 
 - Gomgomi! Give it back to me.

309
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,670
Give it back to me! Give it back to me!

310
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,900
- How? 
 - Give it back to me like this! Argh! Give it back to me!

311
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,950
Give it back to me! Ah! Give it back to me!

312
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,100
What the hell was that?

313
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,120
Do they have feelings for each other?

314
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,940
Ah, that's not good.

315
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,980
It's not good at all.

316
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:57,180
Give it back to me! Ah, stop it and give it back to me!

317
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,500
- Give it to me! 
 - I will! I will!

318
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,940
- That was a lie! 
 - What the!

319
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,040
- What the hell are you doing? 
 - What are you doing? 
 - I don't know!

320
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,920
- Hey! Koala! Hey! 
 - Koala..?

321
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,290
Hey, Koala!

322
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:15,420
Wait one second! I'll give it back to you.

323
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:20,110
- Okay, here. 
 - Hey!

324
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,110
What's going on with you guys? You might hurt yourself!

325
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,980
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

326
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,640
- It's here now! 
 - Ah, I lost it.

327
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,030
It's cut off now! What are you going to do with this?

328
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,840
- I'm sorry... 
 - Mr. Koala.

329
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,270
  You're so adorable.   

330
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,610
  Seo Yeon, why are you so adorable?  

331
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,760
Auntie!

332
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,260
Lee Man Jung!

333
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,570
- Wait a minute. Wait. 
 - Man Jung.

334
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,580
- Man Jung, come here. You're not going anywhere!
 - Auntie!

335
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,630
I'm just here to pick something up. I'm going back out soon.

336
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,490
- Don't go, Auntie! 
 - Where are you going! 
 - Auntie!

337
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,960
You guys kicked me out before.

338
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,470
- Why are you being like this? Let me go! 
 - When did I say you should leave the house?

339
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,700
Unni, you were just looking at me leaving the house!

340
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,930
That means you want me to get out of here, isn't it?

341
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,400
I know that everyone hates me as well!

342
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:10,490
- Unni, I know you don't like me! 
 - Who hates you!

343
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,740
Everyone! Every one of you hates me, isn't it? My god!

344
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,490
- Let me go! 
 - You can't go!

345
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:20,050
- What's that? Get out of my way. 
 - I'm not going to.

346
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,840
- Get out of my way! 
 - You just hit the pit of my stomach...

347
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,920
Man Jung!

348
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,570
Don't go.

349
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,540
Who hates you?

350
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,760
You're a very precious person to me!

351
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:40,690
Why do you think I worked as a housekeeper from 16!

352
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,500
For you, Man Jung!

353
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:47,880
For you to get a good education and to have a great life. You don't know about that?

354
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,370
Do you really don't know about that?

355
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,690
So, don't go. Don't go away, Man Jung.

356
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:02,440
Why are you talking about that old story?

357
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,340
I studied a lot all because of you and grew up well, of course.

358
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,290
And stop crying.

359
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,440
- Stop crying. 
 - Don't go away, okay?

360
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,350
  Stop crying!  

361
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,920
What's this?

362
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,790
My goodness...

363
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:55,048
Is Dr. Song or whatever is not harassing you anymore?

364
00:34:56,048 --> 00:34:58,108
It's none of your business.

365
00:35:02,748 --> 00:35:06,548
And also, this thing

366
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:09,948
is not mine.

367
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:13,708
Oh, really?

368
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:19,088
I thought you threw this on that day.

369
00:35:19,648 --> 00:35:22,448
Ah, but it wasn't you...

370
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:26,598
Because I didn't go to that place on that day, so it's not by me.

371
00:35:26,618 --> 00:35:28,968
  Because I didn't go.  

372
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,738
Are you disappointed right now?

373
00:35:31,768 --> 00:35:37,678
But then, how did you know what day I was talking about?

374
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:44,688
My goodness. Whatever day you were talking about, I didn't go!

375
00:35:44,748 --> 00:35:53,448
Whatever day you were talking about, I didn't go! I really didn't go! Get out of my way! Frog's legs!

376
00:35:53,758 --> 00:35:56,908
What the hell was that?

377
00:35:56,948 --> 00:36:00,228
It's not me! I never went to that place!

378
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:04,408
- Don't flatter yourself! 
   - I never went to that place! Don't flatter yourself!  

379
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:08,318
You're annoying me!

380
00:36:33,328 --> 00:36:36,608
It's good to hear once in a while.

381
00:37:06,898 --> 00:37:09,548
Turn off the light! The light!

382
00:37:10,058 --> 00:37:12,878
Turn off the light!

383
00:37:20,068 --> 00:37:23,808
My electricity bill is getting wasted...

384
00:37:31,948 --> 00:37:34,848
Oh, no. My undershirt!

385
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:44,818
What's this?

386
00:37:44,868 --> 00:37:47,048
You said I should soak this first!

387
00:37:57,768 --> 00:38:02,558
  Don't soak the undershirts in bleach for a long time. It will make holes.  

388
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:06,168
Why did I miss this?

389
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:09,868
Jung Min Jae! You should've written this bigger!

390
00:38:09,948 --> 00:38:14,248
  You should've written this bigger! Don't blame me like this.  

391
00:38:14,448 --> 00:38:18,648
  It's your fault that you didn't thoroughly understand the housekeeping tips.  

392
00:38:18,748 --> 00:38:23,948
  You have to go through some trial and error for a while. Don't blame yourself.  

393
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:39,098
There's a hole.

394
00:38:39,678 --> 00:38:42,788
There's a hole...

395
00:38:43,928 --> 00:38:49,178
Woo Jung Hoo, I got holes in my life now.

396
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:54,158
It got freaking holes!

397
00:38:59,148 --> 00:39:00,948
Oh, that hurts...

398
00:39:09,028 --> 00:39:10,578
You're following me.

399
00:39:10,578 --> 00:39:14,738
I'm not following you. I'm going to take the bus because I didn't bring my car back from work yesterday.

400
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:17,358
Oh, is that so.

401
00:39:23,698 --> 00:39:26,348
About the other time,

402
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:29,638
that was really a misunderstanding.

403
00:39:31,028 --> 00:39:36,868
When I poorly talked about a family.

404
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:39,648
Ah, well.

405
00:39:40,648 --> 00:39:45,048
At that time, I was in a bad mood. I want to make an official apology.

406
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:49,348
If you really want to, then sure.

407
00:39:56,968 --> 00:39:59,368
Do you have a story behind that?

408
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,148
Are you talking about the Gomgomi?

409
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:08,788
I heard that my biological father gave this to me.

410
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:12,178
I think it was the time when I got sent to the orphanage.

411
00:40:12,218 --> 00:40:15,378
But I don't remember anything about it.

412
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,548
Hi, Koala.

413
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:24,988
Gogomi, I'm not a koala.

414
00:40:25,028 --> 00:40:27,588
I'm Alain Delon.

415
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:30,318
I don't know about that.

416
00:40:32,288 --> 00:40:35,608
It got dirty. You should wash it!

417
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:50,778
  5209! You got a visitor!  

418
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:55,058
Jung Won!

419
00:40:57,548 --> 00:41:01,148
What changed your mind? You had been refusing to see me until now.

420
00:41:01,248 --> 00:41:05,548
I had been thinking about you, and I realized how much I missed you.

421
00:41:05,648 --> 00:41:10,648
- My Jung Won, you're still beautiful. 
 - Stop that nonsense.

422
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:18,588
Do you know who this person is?

423
00:41:18,638 --> 00:41:22,558
My eyesight is not good these days.

424
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:26,798
Well, it's very blurry.

425
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:29,908
  This little punk, Hwang Na Ro?  

426
00:41:29,938 --> 00:41:35,358
- Who's this? 
 - He is a suspicious person who's going around me these days.

427
00:41:36,678 --> 00:41:39,568
I thought you sent this guy.

428
00:41:39,608 --> 00:41:44,588
Jung Won, how can you have that humongous misunderstanding!

429
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:52,198
Mr. Park Pil Hong. If you're planning some scheme in here as well, then I'm not going to stand that.

430
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:56,938
- Jung Won, I'm not-- 
 - Don't call my name!

431
00:41:57,048 --> 00:42:06,448
Yes. But I had been tearing my heart out with my regrets and remorse for you every day for years.

432
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:13,148
- I'm done with my visit. 
 - Jung Won! I mean Ms. Jung Won. Are you in contact with Soon Jung these days?

433
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:16,378
You know, Soon Jung, who worked at Ms. Min Jae's place.

434
00:42:16,378 --> 00:42:19,978
Why are you asking about her?

435
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:25,568
No particular reason. But have you heard anything about her?

436
00:42:25,578 --> 00:42:27,958
I don't know anything about her.

437
00:42:29,158 --> 00:42:31,638
Take care.

438
00:42:32,548 --> 00:42:34,348
Jung Won!

439
00:42:34,448 --> 00:42:38,648
Ms. Jung Won! Goodbye! See you again! Bye!

440
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:53,708
Yes, Soon Jung.

441
00:42:54,128 --> 00:42:57,448
I was about to leave.

442
00:42:57,488 --> 00:43:00,408
  I'll send a car for you. Come out in a bit.  

443
00:43:00,448 --> 00:43:04,448
No, it's okay. I have a person to drive for me.

444
00:43:04,558 --> 00:43:05,868
Yes.

445
00:43:06,898 --> 00:43:09,368
- Noonim, what should I do? 
 - What's going on?

446
00:43:09,398 --> 00:43:13,758
- There's a club that wants me to come now and do the interview. 
 - Really? That's great!

447
00:43:13,778 --> 00:43:17,758
No, it's not about that. I was going to drive for you today, so I even rented a car!

448
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:20,638
It's okay. I can just call a cab and go by myself.

449
00:43:20,658 --> 00:43:25,428
No, these are heavy. At least, let me help you to bring these to the cab.

450
00:43:25,428 --> 00:43:27,198
I can carry those!

451
00:43:27,198 --> 00:43:30,858
- Na Ro, you didn't go out today? 
 - No, mother. I don't have any work today.

452
00:43:31,948 --> 00:43:35,148
Is that so? You don't have work today?

453
00:43:35,258 --> 00:43:39,538
- Today? 
   - Yes. I wanted to make a delicious home-cooked meal for you.  

454
00:43:39,648 --> 00:43:41,948
You probably haven't had a home-cooked meal in a while.

455
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:45,198
  I'm having incredible home-cooked meals all the time.  

456
00:43:45,238 --> 00:43:48,148
  Also, my mom misses you.  

457
00:43:48,178 --> 00:43:50,978
I feel like you're being remote to us these days.

458
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:54,448
Your mother said that?

459
00:43:55,658 --> 00:43:57,678
Okay. I'll be there tonight.

460
00:43:57,708 --> 00:44:00,098
Yes, oppa. I'll see you then.

461
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:03,668
Great.

462
00:44:04,168 --> 00:44:08,868
If I introduce him as my boyfriend to the team members, then he can't do anything about it as well.

463
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:15,068
- Sorry I called you out when you're busy, uncle. 
 - No, it's fine.

464
00:44:15,078 --> 00:44:17,768
How's my father?

465
00:44:19,268 --> 00:44:23,588
Oh, yes, he's great. He has been very energetic these days.

466
00:44:23,608 --> 00:44:27,668
  We hope the product development to go well next quarter as well...  

467
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:34,928
  I don't know where that power comes from.  

468
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:40,148
  He eats very well and is full of energy these days.  

469
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:44,488
I think even though he went through this pain of divorce,

470
00:44:44,488 --> 00:44:48,568
but he transcended that into this idea of a new beginning of life.

471
00:44:48,578 --> 00:44:51,508
You know that he has a very strong mentality.

472
00:44:52,748 --> 00:44:57,348
Is that so? Well, it's good to hear.

473
00:45:05,748 --> 00:45:10,248
As expected, he has no regrets.

474
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:14,058
Why am I even worry about a person like that?

475
00:45:21,048 --> 00:45:24,128
Yes, Jae Hee.

476
00:45:24,168 --> 00:45:26,698
I'm doing well!

477
00:45:26,748 --> 00:45:29,748
Do you know that you are calling me every two hours these days?

478
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,788
- Did I? 
   - Yes.  

479
00:45:33,848 --> 00:45:39,048
You should focus on your work. I'm going to focus on my life.

480
00:45:39,448 --> 00:45:41,748
Alright.

481
00:45:53,298 --> 00:45:59,728
♫   I guess I'm still young   ♫

482
00:45:59,788 --> 00:46:10,208
♫   Mom, why am I keep waiting   ♫

483
00:46:10,248 --> 00:46:18,748
♫   Mom, why do I suddenly miss   ♫

484
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:23,028
  This chorus part is important.  

485
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:27,178
  It sounds bright, but have to put some mournful feelings. 
    

486
00:46:30,148 --> 00:46:36,048
♫   I guess I'm still young   ♫

487
00:46:36,148 --> 00:46:38,548
  Jung Hoo Oppa is so cool!  

488
00:46:38,548 --> 00:46:47,148
♫   Mom, why do I keep getting sad   ♫

489
00:46:47,148 --> 00:46:54,448
♫   Mom, why do I suddenly want to cry   ♫

490
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:20,048
I was going to carry this all the way in.

491
00:47:20,058 --> 00:47:25,008
This is more than enough. Na Ro, have a safe drive back home.

492
00:47:25,038 --> 00:47:28,788
Okay. Then, good luck with your work.

493
00:47:31,728 --> 00:47:34,068
- You should go inside first. 
 - Have a safe drive.

494
00:47:39,948 --> 00:47:45,848
When did they become this close to going in and out of their house?

495
00:47:46,978 --> 00:47:50,688
This is becoming a real problem.

496
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:17,388
  Our Chae Woon should have grown up in a wealthy house like this.  

497
00:48:25,918 --> 00:48:29,658
  Mr. Hwang Na Ro, the design team is having a get-together at the Director's house today.  

498
00:48:29,748 --> 00:48:32,848
  Please come if you have time. It's not mandatory.  

499
00:48:32,848 --> 00:48:35,508
Design team get-together?

500
00:48:37,758 --> 00:48:40,238
Then Bit Chae Woon is coming too?

501
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:49,408
It's ready.

502
00:48:49,488 --> 00:48:51,848
Put this on the left side of the table, please.

503
00:48:52,588 --> 00:48:54,918
  CEO is coming.  

504
00:48:56,548 --> 00:48:58,348
- Welcome home, CEO. 
 - Thank you.

505
00:49:00,448 --> 00:49:04,048
Young lady, how have you been?

506
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:07,598
I had been great, young lady Soon Jung.

507
00:49:07,628 --> 00:49:12,038
- Thank you for coming. You must have worked too much to get ready for this. 
 - It was nothing.

508
00:49:12,078 --> 00:49:18,538
This is my daughter.  Seo Ah, she's my friend that I knew from when I was young. You should say hello to Ms. Soon Jung.

509
00:49:18,568 --> 00:49:25,388
- Nice to meet you. Thank you for helping us today. 
 - Your welcome. Nice to meet you as well.

510
00:49:26,748 --> 00:49:30,748
  Is she supposed to be Chae Woon's younger sister?  

511
00:49:30,848 --> 00:49:34,148
My daughter looks exactly the same as me, isn't she?

512
00:49:34,178 --> 00:49:35,838
Yes.

513
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:40,408
I'll come back after changing my clothes. Oh, Seo Ah, that thing.

514
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:53,828
These are the clothes of our brand. It's our gratitude for helping us tonight.

515
00:49:53,848 --> 00:49:59,648
- I hope you like it. 
 - Ah, of course. Thank you.

516
00:50:03,948 --> 00:50:05,468
LX...

517
00:50:05,488 --> 00:50:09,228
Oh, you didn't know about it? It is our CEO's brand.

518
00:50:09,248 --> 00:50:13,148
- And she's the Director of the company. 
 - I'll be back after changing my clothes as well.

519
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:19,548
Jang Seo Ah...

520
00:50:20,048 --> 00:50:23,348
She's the Director Jang Seo Ah?

521
00:50:23,518 --> 00:50:25,198
Yes.

522
00:50:30,368 --> 00:50:31,588
How can this happen?

523
00:50:31,638 --> 00:50:37,198
  You know Jang Seo Ah, right? The one who falsely accused me that I hit her.  

524
00:50:37,228 --> 00:50:39,988
  She's my boss now.  

525
00:50:47,998 --> 00:50:51,338
Ma'am, come and check on this, please.

526
00:50:51,408 --> 00:50:53,438
Yes.

527
00:51:06,588 --> 00:51:09,158
Yes, oppa. Are you on the way here?

528
00:51:11,578 --> 00:51:13,008
What?

529
00:51:13,038 --> 00:51:16,358
We got a problem at the site, so I don't think I can make it tonight.

530
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:22,548
Really? How can you do that to me? I was looking forward to seeing you.

531
00:51:25,548 --> 00:51:29,048
Seo Ah, I'll call you back. I'm sorry! Get out of there!

532
00:51:31,268 --> 00:51:33,398
Bring that over here!

533
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:43,748
  How can this kind of thing keep happens?  

534
00:51:46,278 --> 00:51:48,848
  I should get myself together.  

535
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:54,458
  My daughter wants to invite the team members for dinner.  

536
00:51:54,468 --> 00:51:58,548
  If it's the team members from the office, then is Chae Woon coming too?  

537
00:51:58,568 --> 00:52:02,098
  Oh, no. I shouldn't run into Chae Woon.  

538
00:52:03,848 --> 00:52:07,878
I'm sorry. I got an emergency at home.

539
00:52:07,898 --> 00:52:13,268
Oh, my goodness! Did you make all of these by yourself?

540
00:52:13,278 --> 00:52:17,668
I'm so sorry.

541
00:52:17,678 --> 00:52:26,658
It's my fault that I asked you to do it. I know you're so devoted to everything.

542
00:52:32,198 --> 00:52:34,358
This is so good.

543
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:38,538
It tastes exactly the same as what I had back in the days at Min Jae's place!

544
00:52:38,748 --> 00:52:42,748
Young lady, I have some urgent thing today--

545
00:52:42,848 --> 00:52:46,548
- CEO. The office people just arrived. 
 - Already?

546
00:52:46,648 --> 00:52:49,848
They came earlier than I expected!

547
00:52:58,438 --> 00:53:00,708
  I don't have a choice now.   

548
00:53:02,148 --> 00:53:05,148
- Welcome! 
 - Hello! Thank you for inviting us!

549
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:11,148
- Was it easy to find the way here? 
 - Yes! Your place looks amazing!

550
00:53:11,178 --> 00:53:14,598
Thank you. You guys must be hungry!

551
00:53:14,628 --> 00:53:17,968
  Yes, we are hungry!  

552
00:53:17,978 --> 00:53:21,758
- Where's Ms. Bit Chae Woon? 
 - She'll come soon. She said she's going to finish her work first.

553
00:53:21,758 --> 00:53:26,568
Is that so. Then, shall we start first?

554
00:53:26,588 --> 00:53:29,828
  - Hello!   
 - Welcome.

555
00:53:29,828 --> 00:53:32,958
- You look beautiful! 
 - Thank you.

556
00:53:32,968 --> 00:53:35,978
  Then, let's start with some Hors d'oeuvres.  

557
00:53:44,048 --> 00:53:46,648
I'll go to the CEO's place again.

558
00:53:51,448 --> 00:53:53,548
     

559
00:53:54,218 --> 00:53:56,028
Yes, Na Ro.

560
00:53:56,948 --> 00:53:58,448
Do you need help?

561
00:53:58,548 --> 00:54:04,548
Yes, about the Spain project, I saw the file that I received, but it didn't have last year's report--

562
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,028
Na Ro, one second, please.

563
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:11,168
- What's up? 
 - Headbutt, I need your help.

564
00:54:11,188 --> 00:54:13,398
Why are you keep calling me like that?

565
00:54:14,248 --> 00:54:15,748
At the site?

566
00:54:15,898 --> 00:54:18,088
I can't help you now. I have to go to a get-together.

567
00:54:18,148 --> 00:54:21,148
Help me, Head... Ms. Bit Chae Woon.

568
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,358
I'm really in a hurry. I have to finish this by tonight.

569
00:54:24,448 --> 00:54:27,148
Please, Goddess, the plumbing master!

570
00:54:27,158 --> 00:54:32,078
I really can't help you tonight. I'll connect you to someone else!

571
00:54:33,738 --> 00:54:41,978
Argh! It's bursting! Everybody, get out of the way! Pow! Phew!

572
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:49,448
A specialist will come soon. Do something else first. Let's change the pipes first!

573
00:54:49,468 --> 00:54:54,468
Hello? Mr. Woo Jae Hee? What's going on?

574
00:54:54,488 --> 00:54:57,888
Hello? My goodness...

575
00:54:58,498 --> 00:54:59,638
Oh, Chae Woon!

576
00:54:59,638 --> 00:55:05,648
Na Ro, I'm sorry. Koala... No, I meant, Mr. Woo's site has a problem, so I have to go there now.

577
00:55:05,648 --> 00:55:07,488
What about the get-together?

578
00:55:07,548 --> 00:55:11,348
I don't think I can make it there. I'll send you the report by email later. Taxi!

579
00:55:11,368 --> 00:55:13,048
Ms. Bit Chae Woon!

580
00:55:22,338 --> 00:55:24,228
Woo Jae Hee again?

581
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,548
This guy is really...

582
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:31,458
This is instead of going out.

583
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:36,068
- We'll start dinner soon. 
 - Thank you.

584
00:55:37,448 --> 00:55:40,448
Yes, Ms. Bit Chae Woon.

585
00:55:41,098 --> 00:55:45,758
Oh, is that so? Okay, I got it.

586
00:55:45,788 --> 00:55:50,538
- What's going on? 
 - She has an urgent thing, so she said she can't make it tonight.

587
00:55:51,498 --> 00:55:56,458
Aigo, it would've been nice if she could come as well.

588
00:55:57,668 --> 00:56:01,238
  - Then, shall we say toast? 
 - Yes!  

589
00:56:01,268 --> 00:56:04,418
I got tricked by you again.

590
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:07,188
I fell for your evil trick again!

591
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:10,968
It's going to be a real feast there tonight.

592
00:56:12,248 --> 00:56:17,448
- I'm hungry! 
 - I'm sorry. I'll get you dinner after this.

593
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:21,038
It wouldn't be an ordinary dinner over there.

594
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:23,858
What a loss.

595
00:56:23,878 --> 00:56:26,738
You have such a greed for food!

596
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,668
You said you're uncomfortable with your director, and you still want to go there?

597
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:32,908
I'm not uncomfortable with her anymore.

598
00:56:33,048 --> 00:56:35,048
Also, it's our CEO's place as well.

599
00:56:35,118 --> 00:56:41,758
I really like our CEO a lot. She's a really cool person.

600
00:56:43,228 --> 00:56:48,688
Ah, I'm really getting hungry! Oh!

601
00:56:50,668 --> 00:56:54,948
- What should we do? 
 - Why did you throw that over there? Wait.

602
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:59,458
- What are you doing? I'm all wet now! 
 - I stepped in the wrong place!

603
00:56:59,498 --> 00:57:04,378
I'm sorry! You must be cold! Why did you wear such a thin layer!

604
00:57:10,248 --> 00:57:11,148
This Koala!

605
00:57:11,148 --> 00:57:14,548
Lock that one! Over there!

606
00:57:18,948 --> 00:57:22,138
- I'm really all wet now! 
 - I'm all wet, too!

607
00:57:55,408 --> 00:58:00,528
  It became harder to talk about it now.  

608
00:58:23,648 --> 00:58:28,248
  This is why I don't like you. You never regret, nor make any apologies!  

609
00:58:28,348 --> 00:58:32,048
  It's because our relationship is expired.  

610
01:00:16,328 --> 01:00:20,618
  This is rice with soup, fried chicken, jajangmyeon, and bulgogi.  

611
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:24,438
  This is rice with soup, fried chicken, jajangmyeon, and bulgogi...  

612
01:00:34,448 --> 01:00:37,148
  I had been working hard.  

613
01:00:37,348 --> 01:00:39,848
  I had been only looking ahead and lived diligently.  

614
01:00:52,848 --> 01:00:58,648
  How can you secretly eat these cookies!  

615
01:01:24,968 --> 01:01:27,038
Min Jae...

616
01:01:33,488 --> 01:01:36,688
Min Jae...

617
01:01:43,138 --> 01:01:45,378
- I'm leaving, mom! 
 - Me, too!

618
01:01:45,378 --> 01:01:47,638
  Okay, have a good day!  

619
01:01:47,648 --> 01:01:51,168
Is she sick or something?

620
01:01:51,948 --> 01:01:56,248
  I'm changing my clothes right now. Have a nice day, guys.  

621
01:01:56,348 --> 01:01:58,418
- Okay, mom! 
 - I'm leaving, too!

622
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,648
  Have a nice day, Mr. Woo.  

623
01:02:01,348 --> 01:02:06,648
- I'm leaving! 
   - Yes, my daughter.  

624
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:16,088
Mom.

625
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:20,948
- Are you sick? 
 - Oh, no. I'm just sleepy.

626
01:02:21,008 --> 01:02:25,998
- Have a nice day. 
 - Okay. Sleep tight.

627
01:02:26,028 --> 01:02:27,718
Chae Woon.

628
01:02:28,688 --> 01:02:30,088
Yes, mom.

629
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:38,158
What's wrong?

630
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:43,848
How are you with the people at work?

631
01:02:43,868 --> 01:02:47,908
And also with the one who was your classmate before.

632
01:02:47,948 --> 01:02:53,778
I'm good with them. You know who I am! I got everything under control.

633
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:58,428
And higher executives are nice to you as well?

634
01:02:58,478 --> 01:03:07,398
Of course! And I think our CEO really likes me.

635
01:03:07,548 --> 01:03:09,238
Is that so?

636
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,808
That's great.

637
01:03:12,818 --> 01:03:17,068
It's good that your CEO likes you.

638
01:03:17,088 --> 01:03:24,318
Your daughter is doing this great, so don't worry. Okay?

639
01:03:24,678 --> 01:03:29,008
I don't worry about you.

640
01:03:29,568 --> 01:03:33,228
- I'm going to be late. I should get going. 
 - Be careful of cars.

641
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:36,168
- Have a good rest! 
 - Okay.

642
01:04:05,028 --> 01:04:09,608
- Did he go to the factory? 
 - No, he took a few days off.

643
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:12,838
What? He did that?

644
01:04:30,058 --> 01:04:36,778
♫   In the pitch-black road of mine   ♫

645
01:04:36,818 --> 01:04:40,438
♫  On the day, even the hope gets shaken  ♫

646
01:04:40,448 --> 01:04:44,148
You're going to visit your husband's grave? Why all of a sudden?

647
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:50,048
No particular reason. I wanted to get some fresh air.

648
01:04:50,078 --> 01:04:52,918
And I wanted to see him as well.

649
01:04:54,048 --> 01:04:58,508
So I think I'm going to be late tonight.

650
01:04:58,538 --> 01:05:04,258
Can you talk well to the kids later, so they don't get worried about me?

651
01:05:04,278 --> 01:05:10,258
Sure. Unni, nothing is going on, right?

652
01:05:10,418 --> 01:05:13,068
Have a safe trip.

653
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:21,568
Is she getting sentimental because it's autumn?

654
01:05:22,148 --> 01:05:29,548
♫   Everybody looks happy except me   ♫

655
01:05:29,578 --> 01:05:35,928
♫   Is the good day will ever come   ♫

656
01:05:35,948 --> 01:05:43,948
♫   Love is so difficult, life is so hard   ♫

657
01:05:44,048 --> 01:05:50,448
♫   Youth these days are having a hard time   ♫

658
01:05:50,568 --> 01:05:56,958
♫   Well, just living with that in my heart   ♫

659
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:21,258
Excuse me! Hello!

660
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:24,088
Is there anybody...

661
01:06:30,498 --> 01:06:34,348
Excuse me! Excuse me!

662
01:06:34,348 --> 01:06:39,408
  What should I do?  

663
01:06:41,238 --> 01:06:44,948
  - Soon Jung! 
 - Ajussi!  

664
01:06:44,998 --> 01:06:47,908
  I'm not an Ajussi!  

665
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:01,448
  Ajussi!  

666
01:07:07,678 --> 01:07:11,338
  Sir, are you okay?  

667
01:07:14,018 --> 01:07:16,628
  What is your name?  

668
01:07:21,598 --> 01:07:25,128
  Can you tell us your name? Do you remember your name?  

669
01:07:46,468 --> 01:07:48,988
  Sir, what's your name?  

670
01:07:50,648 --> 01:07:53,648
  This person, is he..?  

671
01:07:53,678 --> 01:07:56,868
  Please tell us your name. Do you remember your name?  

672
01:07:56,878 --> 01:08:02,928
My... name is...

673
01:08:03,558 --> 01:08:05,958
  Yes, continue, please.  

674
01:08:07,438 --> 01:08:10,598
Jae...

675
01:08:12,938 --> 01:08:15,748
Jae...

676
01:08:17,608 --> 01:08:20,218
Jae...

677
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:27,198
Jae... Im...

678
01:08:28,048 --> 01:08:29,648
Se?

679
01:08:39,138 --> 01:08:41,998
James?

680
01:08:42,848 --> 01:08:52,648
♫   Now we are going to like each other   ♫

681
01:08:52,718 --> 01:09:02,298
♫   When the time that has been passed comes back   ♫

682
01:09:02,348 --> 01:09:10,748
♫   Now we are going to love each other   ♫ 
      

683
01:09:10,848 --> 01:09:12,948
  Don't worry about me!  

684
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:15,548
  Psychologically, I got a little bit of manic-depressive.  

685
01:09:15,578 --> 01:09:18,478
  Wouldn't it be better to take him to the police now?  

686
01:09:18,528 --> 01:09:21,308
  Unni! Your reaction is weird.  

687
01:09:21,348 --> 01:09:23,648
  A room-share? You mean I have to share a room with someone else?  

688
01:09:23,648 --> 01:09:25,948
  How can we let a random boy into the attic room?  

689
01:09:25,968 --> 01:09:28,858
  - Nice to meet you. 
 - Nice to meet you too, Lee Ra Hoon.  

690
01:09:28,948 --> 01:09:32,648
  Not just the Samgwang villa, and Lee Bit Chae Woon? She's already hooked on me.  

691
01:09:32,748 --> 01:09:34,848
  Mr. Na Ro, show us your baby photo as well!  

692
01:09:34,918 --> 01:09:38,008
  - I don't have any. 
 - How can you not have any? 
 - Do you want to see mine?  

693
01:09:38,038 --> 01:09:40,318
  This is when Ms. Bit Chae Woon was a baby? Look at her cute cheeks!  

694
01:09:40,348 --> 01:09:44,448
  He might not be the same person, but his shoes are the same.  

695
01:09:44,508 --> 01:09:47,748
  Your sneakers are pretty.
