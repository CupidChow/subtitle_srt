1
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,630
Have a nice evening.

2
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,110
Oh, Chae Woon.

3
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,260
Did you come by to go home with me?

4
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,120
I still have ways to go 
until I get off work.

5
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,760
Well, Father, that's not it.

6
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,970
There's an emergency meeting 
at Samgwang Villa right now.

7
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,160
Why? Is something wrong?

8
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,500
Well...

9
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,590
You'll get to find out anyway. 
So I'll tell you.

10
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,380
- My sister Hae Deun and...
- Joon Ah are dating.

11
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,660
What?

12
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,980
I can't believe it...

13
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,290
We knew about it already, but

14
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,100
they got caught by the mothers today.

15
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,160
So Hae Deun and Joon Ah 
asked us to help out.

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,580
So we're rushing over there.

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,910
Gosh, what in the world...

18
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,980
They're youths in their prime...

19
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,080
I guess. They're at their peak...

20
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,730
Aigoo...

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,840
Why is Seo Yeon doing back home?

22
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,610
My daughter got prettier 
after she got married.

23
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,730
 
So Jae Hee and Chae Woon
 knew about this.

24
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,000
You just left us out?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,510
Jae Hee and Unni just found out, too.

26
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,660
But we didn't know we'd
 get caught so soon, either.

27
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,140
My gosh.

28
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,390
You're together at work and home.

29
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,160
Of course, you got caught.

30
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,120
 Mr. Makjang, this is a bad sign, huh? 

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,240
 Yeah. 

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,520
 - I love you, too. 
- In any case...

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,550
I'm in so much shock.

34
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:25,060
Right. I know a man and a woman
 can get close somehow.

35
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,990
But this is...

36
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,480
I'm so taken aback by this.

37
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,940
Joon Ah, Chae Woon is your younger sister.

38
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,280
Hae Deun is Chae Woon's younger sister.

39
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,160
Stop anyone walking down the street.
 This is an absurd relationship.

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,460
If you stop people walking down 
the street, they'd hate it.

41
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,990
Look at you!

42
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,110
Are you kidding around 
even in this situation?

43
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,810
Oh, it's Unni!

44
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,000
- Hey, Jae Hee! It's Jae Hee.
- Did you call your sister?

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,370
Did you ask Jae Hee to come?

46
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,710
I only called Unni.

47
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,170
I only called Jae Hee.

48
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,090
They must be coming together. 
Hey, Jae Hee!

49
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,500
Jae Hee?

50
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,510
Geez...

51
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,990
Well...

52
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,960
Mom, is something the matter?

53
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,980
- Something is the matter.
- What's going on?

54
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,460
- I'm going to the military.
- What?

55
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,920
- Jang Joon Ah!
- I'm sorry.

56
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,040
- It's Unni!
- Hey, Jae Hee!

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,750
Hello, Mother. Hello, Mother.

58
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,980
Jae Hee, you're back again.

59
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,880
Why did you call your sister over?

60
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,390
I missed her.

61
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,050
Hey, Lee Hae Deun.

62
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,040
You asked me to come
 for support, huh?

63
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,980
Soon Jung, we keep 
getting sidetracked.

64
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,830
How about we take our kids
 and talk to them separately?

65
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,970
Yes, I'll do that.

66
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,690
So, do Man Jung and Hwak Se
 also know about this?

67
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,910
Auntie knows. So I'm sure
 Uncle knows, too.

68
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,470
My gosh.

69
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,080
Gosh, I was the only one in the dark. 
Everyone else knew.

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,920
This was confusing to me, too, 
in the beginning.

71
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,940
You have to punch in the forefeet 
or hind feet correctly.

72
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,150
It's confusing.

73
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,000
You just have to watch for that. 
Do you get it now?

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,090
Yeah.

75
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,950
Wow, you know. This is so neat!

76
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,870
In this big and wide Seoul,

77
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,440
among so many neighborhoods,
 you're here in this neighborhood.

78
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,750
How can I meet you in this jokbal place?

79
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,990
I know.

80
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,720
So are you married? Do you have kids?

81
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,160
I'm not married yet.

82
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,920
Oh, really?

83
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,930
Well, both of my parents were very ill.

84
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,780
I had to take care of them 
while working

85
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,790
and time flew by.

86
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,610
You used to be so nice to me, Oppa.

87
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,910
Aigoo, I was. I was so nice to you.

88
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,220
- Eems hyung.
- Yes?

89
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,730
A long time ago, Eun Ji and I used 
to swim in the stream,

90
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,750
and we went fishing together. 
Hey, we snuck into the watermelon farm.

91
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,530
- Right.
- We snuck out watermelons.

92
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,300
It was so fun.

93
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,020
You two were childhood friends.

94
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,400
Wow!

95
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,820
That was the good old days.

96
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,330
Oppa, do you live around here?

97
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,860
Yeah. I live at Samgwang Villa.

98
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,980
Over there. It's the villa over there.

99
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,420
Samgwang Villa?

100
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,690
Yeah.

101
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,230
Do you know Samgwang Villa?

102
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,420
Oh, no...

103
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,640
Hwak Se oppa.

104
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,450
- Yeah?
- Help me with this.

105
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,420
Do it again.

106
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,230
I get so confused with this, too.

107
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,890
You're right.

108
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,590
Right, like that.

109
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,440
How could they be hometown friends?

110
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,460
If they hadn't met, they'd be 
crying by now.

111
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,790
What are they laughing at?

112
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,400
Oh, my gosh...

113
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,630
- Man Jung.
- Aigoo.

114
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,990
Why don't you go inside? Go in.

115
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,180
No, I'm out for a walk.

116
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,440
Man Jung!

117
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,820
Have some jokbal!

118
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,320
Eems hyung.

119
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,890
What?

120
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,400
Man Jung was just here.

121
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,030
Jjung-a?

122
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,780
Where?

123
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,790
She said she came out for a walk.

124
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,590
Hwak Se.

125
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,110
You have to be clear about things
 like this in the beginning.

126
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,670
You said you're just hometown
 friends with Eun Ji, right?

127
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,110
Gosh, of course.

128
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:51,480
Then explain to Man Jung at home 
later and give her confidence.

129
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,250
Okay, I'll do that.

130
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,910
Gosh. You're such a veteran in
 this area, too, Eems hyung.

131
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,450
But I can't seem to
 figure out my situation.

132
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,070
You're so humorous.

133
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,490
 If someone approaches you, 
don't stop him. 

134
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,910
 And don't mind the kids. Just date him. 

135
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,320
 I won't come by this place anymore. 

136
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,940
 So don't think about me. 

137
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,850
Why did Jung Hoo say that?

138
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,610
Is he really dating someone?

139
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,160
I'll ask him tomorrow when 
he comes out to inspect the store.

140
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,130
Mom, are you really unhappy
 about me dating Hae Deun?

141
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,340
You really don't know 
why I'm reacting this way?

142
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,120
You two aren't just ordinary
 men and women.

143
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,920
I know, Mom. I know.

144
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,770
As for our family relationship, once 
Bit Chae Woon is registered as your daughter,

145
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,390
it's not an issue, Mom.

146
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,970
Yeah, right. You said it'll take some 
time for the matter to settle, right?

147
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,090
But in reality, even if it's not settled,

148
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,820
it doesn't really matter
 if you think about it, Mom.

149
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,500
What do you mean it doesn't matter?

150
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,590
Is this that simple?

151
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,550
Even after the paperwork is settled,

152
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,700
the fact that Seo Yeon and Hae Deun 
are sisters doesn't change.

153
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,570
That's right. That is true, but...

154
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,080
honestly, none of us are blood-related.

155
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,200
Why are you doing this?

156
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,220
And Mom, now that Hae Deun 
and I are so in love,

157
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,480
if you tell us, "Stop being in love!

158
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,350
Stop your feelings! No! Stop!"

159
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:39,260
We can't say, "Yes, we got it. 
We won't like each other anymore."

160
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,190
- Joon Ah.
- Yes?

161
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,980
Honestly, I'm...

162
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,280
so disappointed.

163
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,660
After you came back from London, 
you never told me about it.

164
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,630
And you shock me with such 
an outrageous relationship.

165
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,790
Mom, I was so shocked when
 I first found out as well.

166
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,450
But for now, how about 
we let them be?

167
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,690
And if we let them be...

168
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,790
and get married later?

169
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,090
What if they break up 
after dating for a while?

170
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,470
We did consider that and
 talked to them about it.

171
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,830
But even then, we can't say, 
"Break up already!"

172
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,200
Mom, we'll never break up.

173
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,420
Hey, Lee Hae Deun...

174
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,020
Everyone says that in the beginning.

175
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,490
Hwak Se and Man Jung said that, too.

176
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,060
How can you jump into a relationship
 just because you're attracted to him?

177
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,570
You should consider 
the situation as well.

178
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,100
You're a grownup, Hae Deun.

179
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,390
- Mother.
- Yeah?

180
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,900
- My mom is leaving.
- Oh, really?

181
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,510
Aigoo...

182
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,970
She's leaving?

183
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,620
Thanks for being on my side.

184
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,490
Hey, I didn't side with you.

185
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,820
I did so because Mom is so worried.

186
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,960
I'm watching you.

187
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,650
CEO, you're going to leave?

188
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,850
I should go.

189
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,820
Are you going, too, Joon Ah?

190
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,200
Yes, I'll take Mom home and 
spend the night there.

191
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,740
Okay. That's a good idea.

192
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,460
Take your mom home.

193
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,260
I'll go now, Soon Jung.

194
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,440
- Yes, CEO.
- Goodbye.

195
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,200
It's time for my Seo Yeon to go home.

196
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,880
Did she pass already?

197
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,870
Should we take home some jokbal?

198
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,160
Should we?

199
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,490
It's nice to go home 
with you, Chae Woon.

200
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,220
Me, too, Father.

201
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,870
Aigoo, you must be cold, Chae Woon.

202
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,690
- Put this around your neck.
- No, I'm fine, Father.

203
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,610
It's cold. Put it around your neck.

204
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,360
Thank you.

205
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,300
Geez, I'm so jealous.

206
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,600
I want a father-in-law, too.

207
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,830
Should I take off my coat for you?

208
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,680
- Give it to me then.
- Hey, man!

209
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,150
Let's go.

210
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,240
The jokbal place ahjussi is so lucky.

211
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,790
How lucky is he that he could love
 Seo Yeon to his heart's content?

212
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,510
Geez.

213
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,960
Geez, I'm so jealous.

214
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,970
You're home early.

215
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,570
- What?
- Ta-da!

216
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,800
Thank you.

217
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,420
What were you thinking
 about, Man Jung?

218
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,370
Me? What? I wasn't thinking
 about anything. What?

219
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,570
What?

220
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,440
Man Jung, are you a little down
 because of Eun Ji?

221
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,180
Who's Eun Ji?

222
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,630
The new part-timer at jokbal place.

223
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,250
My hometown friend.

224
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,470
Her name is Eun Ji?

225
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,270
She and I are nothing. Seriously.

226
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,910
Ever since we were little. When we were
 this small, we grew up in a country town.

227
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,540
That's why she was so glad to see me.

228
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,690
So what? Did anyone say anything?

229
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,800
You're so funny, Hwak Se. 
You must think I'm small-minded.

230
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,550
I don't get jealous over stuff like that.

231
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,190
What? What?

232
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,290
My nickname is "So cool Man Jung."

233
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,530
I'm so cool about that stuff. I'm fine.

234
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,050
- So cool Man Jung?
- Yup.

235
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,060
Jjung-a, you're so cute 
when you get jealous.

236
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,490
My goodness.

237
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,900
- I'm not jealous right now.
- Yes.

238
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,750
- You're not jealous?
- Oh, yes.

239
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,650
- Go and practice your song.
- Practice my song?

240
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,230
- Yes.
- Man Jung, come here for a moment.

241
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,850
My gosh, what's wrong with you?

242
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,000
Man Jung, really. That's not it.

243
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,810
I said I'm not jealous.

244
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,320
I'm so sorry.

245
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,690
- Why are you sorry?
- I had no idea she'd be so happy to see me.

246
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,320
She did hug you pretty tightly.

247
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,530
I'll hug you tighter. Tighter...

248
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,900
Gosh.

249
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,380
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

250
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,750
Oppa, what brings you home?

251
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,880
Hi, Seo Ah.

252
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,860
Sleep in the guest bedroom for the night. 
Your room isn't made up yet.

253
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,280
Okay.

254
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,810
Oppa.

255
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,480
Why? What?

256
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,230
You're dating Lee Hae Deun?

257
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,930
Oppa, you've finally gone insane.

258
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,020
How can you call your older 
brother insane, Seo Ah?

259
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,640
Gosh, seriously.

260
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,420
And you're not in
 the position to say that.

261
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,100
What about me? What?

262
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,500
- Na Ro?
- Right, him.

263
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,730
My Na Ro is such a good guy.

264
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,610
He's responsible, competent,

265
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,110
and he loves me.

266
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,300
My Hae Deun loves me, is responsible,
 and competent, too.

267
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,210
Competent? She's not even...

268
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,040
What? What did you just say?

269
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,140
Gosh. Anyway, I'm sick and tired 
of Samgwang Villa people.

270
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,940
Why are you doing this, too?

271
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,610
You're hurting my feelings
 to say stuff like that.

272
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,880
Should I get serious and dig deep
 into Hwang Na Ro? Should I?

273
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,860
Mom is so worried these 
days because of you.

274
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,050
Oppa.

275
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,550
You're quite a load of worries
 for Mom, too.

276
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,890
Anyway, I don't like Lee Hae Deun.

277
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,880
I don't like Hwang Na Ro.

278
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,690
Aigoo, my baby Hae Deun...

279
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:17,380
Were you upset because you 
didn't feel welcome by my mom?

280
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,071
Aigoo, aigoo...

281
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:24,560
Gosh, I had no idea I'd be 
a star of a melodrama.

282
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,850
More than that, I'm upset that you 
just left for your home like that.

283
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,170
I didn't even get to thank
 you for the necklace.

284
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,600
I mean, my mom seemed upset, so...

285
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,540
I came home to comfort her.

286
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,500
But she won't let me.

287
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,460
Hae Deun, maybe I shouldn't have come.

288
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,720
Mr. Makjang, the CEO ahjumma, no, no...

289
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,090
I don't think your mom likes me. Right?

290
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,060
Gosh, no. What do you mean 
she doesn't like you?

291
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,520
My mom tends to be cold 
and chic anyway.

292
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,570
She's upset about Seo Ah these days.

293
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,410
She's just sensitive. What do you mean 
she doesn't like you? That's not true.

294
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,950
Then Jang Seo Ah must know, too.

295
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,440
Huh?

296
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,290
Gosh!

297
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,420
She'll torment me starting
 tomorrow. I won't go into work.

298
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,680
- Why, Noona?
- Geez, go back in.

299
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,230
Ra Hoon?

300
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,470
Aigoo, my Hae Deun...

301
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,160
Aigoo, are you upset that we're apart 
after living under the same roof?

302
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,180
Is that it, my baby? Hae Deun...

303
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,760
Joon Ah.

304
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,030
Yes, Mom.

305
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,500
- Hello? Hello?
 - Were you on the phone? 

306
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,910
 Hae Deun? 

307
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,120
 No. 

308
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,870
- Joon Ah.
- Yes?

309
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,290
Why don't you move back 
home for now?

310
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,710
Back home?

311
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,170
 Well... 

312
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,170
I want to move back home, too...

313
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,770
but all my things are at Samgwang Villa.

314
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,680
Well, I can ask Mr. Kim to 
bring that home tomorrow.

315
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,620
I guess so. Mr. Kim...

316
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,070
Mom.

317
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,790
Honestly, I came home to spend 
some time with you and comfort you.

318
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,690
But if you say that out of the blue, 
I'm taken aback.

319
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,690
I'm not telling you guys not to date.

320
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,150
At times like this, I thought
 it would be good to

321
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,800
stay apart and think things
 through rationally.

322
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,540
Also, regarding Seo Ah's issues...

323
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,440
It would be nice if you'd stay
 by my side for now.

324
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,350
If you don't want to, I can't help it.

325
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:29,430
Mom, it's not that I don't want to.

326
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,430
What the heck, Mr. Makjang? 
You can't even get a word in.

327
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,350
Are you a mama's boy?

328
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,970
I don't think the CEO likes 
Hae Deun that much.

329
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,040
My Hae Deun is so lovable.

330
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,660
Gosh, aside from the fact that
 our family tree is getting tangled...

331
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,660
I'm a bit offended about this.

332
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,230
Gosh...

333
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,740
- Mom.
- Hi, Ra Hoon.

334
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,690
Were you working on something?

335
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,430
No, just doing some cleaning.

336
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,530
Aigoo, my Ra Hoon is going 
to leave home soon.

337
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,670
Mom...

338
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,130
Ra Hoon, before you go to the military,

339
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,390
give me a list of all
 the foods you want to eat.

340
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,790
I'll center everything around your taste 
and make them for you day and night.

341
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,950
Really?

342
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,130
- Of course.
- Really?

343
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,380
- Based on my taste?
- Of course.

344
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,830
- I'm so happy!
- Aigoo...

345
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,000
Aigoo, are you that happy?

346
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,410
I'll get fattened up before I go.

347
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,900
It's okay. Tell me everything
 you want to eat.

348
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,470
My baby...

349
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,340
My baby...

350
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,800
Geez...

351
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,910
I never dreamed that Hae Deun and 
Joon Ah would cause such a scandal.

352
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,330
Moong-i, be honest with me.

353
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,270
What do you think of Joon Ah 
as Hae Deun's spouse?

354
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,800
Well? I'm not sure.

355
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,080
Who cares? They're so
 in love with each other.

356
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,830
But what do we do?

357
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,970
You saw earlier how cold 
two moms were, right?

358
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,040
I know.

359
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,940
Gosh, they started 
a difficult relationship.

360
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,440
I know.

361
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,460
But I'm most worried about
 Hae Deun getting hurt.

362
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,620
We should support them.

363
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,620
But act as though we're setting
 them straight on the surface.

364
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,560
We should.

365
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,020
Aigoo.

366
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,310
You must be busy taking on 
Father's company project, too.

367
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,400
I am busy, but it's fun.

368
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,390
Father may not express it, but 
he must be so happy and feel secure.

369
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,290
Because you're working with him.

370
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,550
I wonder.

371
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,510
Gosh, we can't even spend time
 together because of work.

372
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,900
- We're newlyweds, you know.
- I know.

373
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,930
We have to run around minding
 family matters on top of it, huh?

374
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,550
But still, we're together every
 night. Isn't that nice?

375
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,680
Well, that's nice, but...

376
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,200
Just a minute. Let's hug 
each other for a moment.

377
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,590
Come on, no.

378
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,130
I have to send this email.

379
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,950
You can send it later. 
Come here for a minute.

380
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,160
Come on. I said no.

381
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,090
Geez, I'm cold. It's cold.

382
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,200
Just a minute. Just a minute.

383
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,630
Let's stay like this.

384
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,210
Gosh, it's so nice.

385
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
 

386
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,930
Lee Hae Deun.

387
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,110
Are you dating my brother?

388
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,500
Yes.

389
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,840
Why?

390
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,320
Because he comes from 
a wealthy family?

391
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,790
There was a truckload of girls
 like you for my brother.

392
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,470
Pathetic girls who throw 
themselves for money.

393
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:08,260
Director, what makes you think 
I like Jang Joon Ah for money?

394
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,270
There's no way my oppa 
would fall for a girl like you.

395
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,990
My brother has high standards.

396
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,990
Well, since you showed
 interest while flirting,

397
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,080
I'm sure he lost his mind momentarily.

398
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,120
I never flirted with him...

399
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,800
Yup, Jang Joon Ah has high 
standards. Extremely high.

400
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,610
That's why he likes me.

401
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,320
Men with high standards 
usually fall for me.

402
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,970
Anyway, I don't like you.

403
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,440
My mom doesn't like you, either.

404
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,750
So get away from my brother.

405
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,730
I don't like you, either, Jang Seo Ah.

406
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,890
I'm not a huge fan of the CEO, either.

407
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,100
When I look at you two,

408
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,280
I feel like reconsidering
 dating Jang Joon Ah.

409
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,650
But you can't control your feeling
 when you like someone.

410
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,040
I heard you're dating Na Ro oppa, too.

411
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,750
Do CEO and Joon Ah like 
Na Ro oppa? No, right?

412
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,270
But you still date him.

413
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:00,030
So don't be tacky and meddle 
in other people's romance.

414
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,750
Pay attention to your own relationship.

415
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,440
You. The director is talking to you.

416
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,030
Hey, did you just grab my hair?

417
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,720
- Why did you yank my hair?
- Hey, hey!

418
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,220
- Hey, hey!
- My hair!

419
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,950
- How dare you yank my hair?
- Let go!

420
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,680
- Oh, no!
- Hey, hey!

421
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,950
What are you doing?

422
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,730
- It hurts!
- Are you okay?

423
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,170
It hurts!

424
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,110
- I grabbed it by mistake!
- Switch! Switch!

425
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,940
What are you doing?

426
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,470
- She yanked my hair first!
- Come on now!

427
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,790
You're ridiculous!

428
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,250
- I can't believe this!
- What are you doing?

429
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,710
So what about it?

430
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,390
- Control yourself.
- I told you to fire her!

431
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,490
Hae Deun, please!

432
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,650
- Why yell at me?
- What in the world?

433
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,790
- What?
- Seriously!

434
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,180
Seo Ah, please...

435
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,810
Gosh, so annoying!

436
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,360
- Seriously!
- Calm down!

437
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,990
Why are you fighting with her?

438
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,140
Why did you stop me? 
Jang Seo Ah yanked my hair!

439
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,720
Hae Deun, you misconstrued.

440
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,980
Seo Ah is so unstable 
mentally these days.

441
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,830
That's why I stopped you. Otherwise, 
I would've stopped Seo Ah.

442
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,320
You're always siding with 
your sister or your mom.

443
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,470
I heard you're moving back 
home tonight, too.

444
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,060
When did you hear that?

445
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,280
I guess you heard last night.

446
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,620
I mean, my mom is very uneasy
 these days over so many things.

447
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,050
So I feel like I should be home.

448
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,220
Whatever! Seriously.

449
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,140
Hae Deun...

450
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,980
- Your clothes...
- Geez...

451
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,410
Hae Deun! Hae Deun...

452
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,310
I can't believe there's 
a nail sticking out here.

453
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,890
What? What if people get 
scratched up here?

454
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,330
I should call the police about this...

455
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,790
All the branch sales are
 going up. I'm so glad.

456
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,040
You're right.

457
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,360
It's excellent news.

458
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,180
What's on my afternoon schedule?

459
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,190
Yes, the first in sales...

460
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,140
You're inspecting my sister 
Jung Min Jae's store.

461
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,360
Why don't you go alone, Director Jung?

462
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,530
Pardon?

463
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,750
But why, Jung Hoo?

464
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,200
I have another matter to attend to.

465
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,390
What matter?

466
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,520
I know that you have nothing
 else on your schedule.

467
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,430
A personal matter came up. Go alone.

468
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,980
 

469
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,710
Noona isn't here.

470
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,440
Do you think my mother would like this?

471
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,110
Of course.

472
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,310
I gave this away as a gift myself.

473
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,680
It doesn't slide down even if 
you move. It's comfortable.

474
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
She said it works out 
your abs while sleeping.

475
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,430
She was so happy with it.

476
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,370
Elders must love it, right?

477
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,860
Yes, of course. It's the best gift 
to please your parents.

478
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,690
Hi, Noona!

479
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,240
Noona.

480
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,050
When did you get here? 
Where is the president?

481
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,220
Oh, he said something urgent came up.

482
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,630
But to my knowledge, 
he didn't have anything urgent.

483
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,950
 She cut it straight across. 

484
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,100
 Like an idiot. A comedian. 

485
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,740
That's right.

486
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,820
She should meet someone 
who makes her laugh.

487
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,620
Oh, Mr. Woo!

488
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,140
Hello.

489
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,320
Oh, hello.

490
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,240
What brings you to my company?

491
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,760
Yes, I have a friend who works 
at the research lab here.

492
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,520
- I was here to meet him.
- Oh, I see.

493
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,110
Mr. Woo, did you have
 lunch by chance?

494
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,630
There's a place I go to
 when I'm in this area.

495
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,270
There.

496
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,880
This place is good to eat alone.

497
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,500
The food tastes good, too.

498
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,710
 He's naturally very attentive. 

499
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,390
Jae Hee is well, right?

500
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,540
Yes.

501
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,690
I met your daughter-in-law in
 front of my house last time.

502
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,470
She makes such a nice impression.

503
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,550
My daughter-in-law is 
a wonderful person.

504
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,680
Since we're spending time together,

505
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,040
I'd like to say something.

506
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,840
Sure.

507
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:30,390
Jung Min Jae and I are just friends.

508
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:34,320
We have no plans to get back
 together or anything like that.

509
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,910
Keep that in mind.

510
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,050
I see.

511
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,640
Friends. That's good.

512
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,230
But I think Noonim still
 thinks about you a lot.

513
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,310
Really?

514
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,580
Yes.

515
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,070
I happened to take a hike with
 Noonim in our neighborhood.

516
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,960
She talked about you mostly.

517
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,550
She said she chased after you a lot
 because she loved you first.

518
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:08,410
But she still thinks of herself as a winner, 
having married her first love.

519
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,580
But still, while living together...

520
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,530
I didn't treat her well.

521
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,750
I see.

522
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,630
But Noonim didn't mention
 anything like that.

523
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:33,010
She just wanted to have a turning point
 in her life, so she moved out.

524
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,110
Is that so?

525
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,840
Yes.

526
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,020
When I sit and think about it, 
I have lots of regrets, too.

527
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,080
My wife passed away.

528
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,000
My wife was also my first love.

529
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,460
But I'm regretting it a lot because
 I don't think I was good to her.

530
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:58,540
You come across as someone very
 attentive and good to your wife, Professor.

531
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:08,190
I actually think you were attentive
 and good to your wife.

532
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,190
Nah...

533
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,090
Oh, go ahead and eat 
before the food gets cold.

534
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,520
Okay.

535
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,200
Kim Hwak Se.

536
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,910
Today's monthly final. You must make it.

537
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,240
Today...

538
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,280
You must.

539
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,600
For my beloved Jjung-a...

540
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,200
I must make it.

541
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,150
He's coming.

542
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,630
- Aigoo, Hwak Se.
- Yes?

543
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,760
You must be nervous.

544
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,800
Aigoo, Noonim. I've been on 
stage so many times. Nervous?

545
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,680
Aigoo, look at that.

546
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,490
Wait a minute.

547
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,310
Uncle.

548
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,500
- Don't be nervous and good luck.
- Nervous?

549
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,910
Uncle, we'd go and cheer you 
on if we didn't have to work.

550
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,460
- Right.
- Aigoo, I know.

551
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,470
I have to work at 
Yeonhuidong today, too.

552
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,740
Gosh, it's okay, Noonim. 
Man Jung will be at the station...

553
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,870
Okay... She's coming.

554
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,150
Right. That's good.

555
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,150
Drink the warm water slowly.

556
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,230
Okay, thank you, Noonim.

557
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,640
Uncle.

558
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,630
Oh, my gosh! What to do...

559
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:48,230
Uncle, you have Auntie with you 
even if we can't be there for you.

560
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,940
You'll do great. Fighting!

561
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,390
- We'll root for you.
- Fighting!

562
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,810
Fighting!

563
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,210
Oh, my.

564
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,860
It's Chae Woon. Chae Woon.

565
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,920
Hi, Chae Woon.

566
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,390
Uncle? He's about to leave.

567
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,880
Oh, yeah? Wait a minute.

568
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,380
It's Chae Woon.

569
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,230
She wants to root for you.

570
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,920
Hi, Chae Woon.

571
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,320
Aigoo, you must be busy...

572
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,360
You didn't have to call.

573
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,520
Uncle, what in the world? 
Are you nervous?

574
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,310
Hey, nervous? I'm made for the stage.

575
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,010
Nervous? Why be nervous?

576
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,220
All right...

577
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,600
What the heck, Uncle? Drink some
 water. Don't be nervous.

578
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,740
You'll be fine. I'll send you good energy.

579
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,420
Okay. Thanks, Chae Woon.

580
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,790
I'll do a good job.

581
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,920
Don't you worry.

582
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,890
- Aigoo. That's bad. You keep hiccupping.
- Okay.

583
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,270
I know...

584
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:45,130
Oh? It's Jae Hee. Jae Hee is calling.

585
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,390
- Really?
- Aigoo...

586
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,650
Hi, Jae Hee.

587
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,610
You didn't have to call.

588
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,080
All right...

589
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,090
Yeah. Thanks.

590
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,330
Yes, James ahjussi.

591
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,710
That's right. Don't worry.

592
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,550
Uncle is talking to Mr. Woo right now.

593
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,830
I'll just sing thinking I'm in my room.

594
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,000
It's Hae Deun.

595
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,550
- Hi, Hae Deun.
- Don't worry.

596
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,380
You want to cheer on Uncle, too?

597
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,360
- Uncle?
- Okay, wait a minute.

598
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,820
Hi, Joon Ah hyung.

599
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,200
Uncle is on the phone right now.

600
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,210
Hi, Hae Deun.

601
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,680
- He's on his way out.
- Yeah, yeah.

602
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,730
Oh, my...

603
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,390
Geez.

604
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,190
All right...

605
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,000
 Hwak Se, I'm on my way to the station. 

606
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,980
 See you later. I love you. 

607
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,040
The hiccups stopped.

608
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,330
Wow, this is so neat.

609
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,260
Yes, yes, boss.

610
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,690
Yes, the ingredients?

611
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,700
Yes, I'll check on it.

612
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,460
Yes. Okay.

613
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,810
Okay.

614
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,420
Eun Ji!

615
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,950
Hwak Se oppa.

616
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,600
You didn't leave for the station yet?

617
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,040
Yeah, the boss is running late today.

618
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,600
He asked me to check 
on the ingredients.

619
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,640
It's because I'm new at this.

620
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,060
It's because I'm not good at it yet.

621
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,280
Gosh, no.

622
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,520
Hey, are you sweating 
from carrying all this?

623
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,990
Two of them. Okay.

624
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,090
Okay, three of these.

625
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,530
Okay.

626
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,950
Eun Ji.

627
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,130
What's wrong?

628
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,950
Hey, are you sick?

629
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,580
Hey! Hey! Eun Ji! Eun Ji!

630
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,730
- My stomach...
- Eun Ji, what's wrong?

631
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,870
- My stomach...
- Your stomach hurts?

632
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,210
Hey, Eun Ji, can you stand up?

633
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,910
Hey!

634
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,220
Eun Ji!

635
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,480
Hey! Wake up!

636
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,580
Seo Yeon, are you okay
 with them dating?

637
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,460
If Hae Deun marries Joon Ah,

638
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,520
she becomes your sister-in-law.

639
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,120
Yes.

640
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,950
I feel so strange when
 I think about it, too.

641
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,530
But my Hae Deun got to have a goal
 in life while they're dating,

642
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,980
and I think she grew up a lot.

643
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,760
I think they do have a positive
 influence on each other, Mom.

644
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,930
That could be true for Hae Deun, but

645
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,160
not really for Joon Ah...

646
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,930
Oh, yeah.

647
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:47,210
You have no idea how 
secure I feel now that

648
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,760
you've joined the smart 
clothing project.

649
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,090
I'm having so much fun 
working on it as well.

650
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,520
I think it's going to turn out well.

651
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,030
Oh, Hwang Na Ro is 
working hard on it, too.

652
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,020
Yes.

653
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,143
He is working hard.

654
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,960
Seo Yeon, you still oppose
 Hwang Na Ro, right?

655
00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:14,418
Well...

656
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:17,688
 But still, help me. 

657
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:21,368
 I'm sure Mom will discuss him with you. 

658
00:34:21,368 --> 00:34:24,518
 If you say positive things 
about Na Ro then, 

659
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:27,508
 that would be a great help to me. 

660
00:34:27,508 --> 00:34:29,188
Yes...

661
00:34:29,188 --> 00:34:34,048
But I still want to consider 
Seo Ah's feelings.

662
00:34:34,048 --> 00:34:35,848
Right.

663
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:40,988
But I do want to find out

664
00:34:40,988 --> 00:34:43,638
more about that Hwang Na Ro.

665
00:34:43,638 --> 00:34:45,458
But there's no way to do that.

666
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:49,418
So how was he while he lived
 at Samgwang Villa?

667
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:51,758
Did you notice anything strange?

668
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,288
Well...

669
00:34:53,288 --> 00:34:55,048
um...

670
00:34:55,048 --> 00:34:58,638
he did get along with others.

671
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:03,038
I'll look into it further, Mom.

672
00:35:03,038 --> 00:35:05,708
Yeah, Seo Yeon. Look into it further.

673
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:07,178
Okay.

674
00:35:18,338 --> 00:35:24,238
 Park Pil Hong is the one who'd 
know well about Hwang Na Ro. 

675
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,728
 

676
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:41,748
Why isn't he answering his phone?

677
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:43,608
He should answer the phone.

678
00:35:45,118 --> 00:35:47,248
Why isn't he here?

679
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:54,678
We'll start the show.

680
00:35:54,678 --> 00:35:56,848
Participants, please move this way.

681
00:35:56,848 --> 00:35:58,718
- Yes.
- Oh, no...

682
00:35:58,718 --> 00:36:00,308
- This way, please.
- I'm going crazy.

683
00:36:06,488 --> 00:36:09,198
You still can't reach Kim Hwak Se?

684
00:36:09,198 --> 00:36:12,668
Yes. I wonder if he got 
into an accident...

685
00:36:12,668 --> 00:36:14,928
It's a live show. 
We'll go ahead and start.

686
00:36:14,928 --> 00:36:17,448
If he doesn't arrive in the next
 ten minutes, he can't compete.

687
00:36:17,448 --> 00:36:19,548
What if you put him toward the end...

688
00:36:19,548 --> 00:36:21,948
- and when he arrives...
- But it's a live show. I'm sorry.

689
00:36:21,948 --> 00:36:23,998
Can't he go in the middle?

690
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:26,848
There are so many people anyway. 
Gosh, this is crazy.

691
00:36:34,578 --> 00:36:36,668
 
 Unni, Unni...

692
00:36:36,668 --> 00:36:38,778
What if he got into an accident, Unni?

693
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:40,978
He wouldn't just not answer my calls...

694
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:43,388
Wait, Unni, I'm getting a call.

695
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:44,908
 

696
00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:49,798
He... Hello?

697
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:51,668
Hello?

698
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,708
Why didn't you answer the phone?

699
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:59,488
Where... where are you? 
Did you get hurt?

700
00:36:59,488 --> 00:37:02,318
Why? Why aren't you here?

701
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:11,058
What did you say?

702
00:37:11,058 --> 00:37:13,658
 

703
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,378
Hwak Se.

704
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:29,018
Oh, Jjung-a.

705
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:31,648
I'm sorry. You must've been worried.

706
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:34,688
Eun Ji had acute abdominal pain?

707
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:36,318
Yes.

708
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:42,258
I was going to call the ambulance

709
00:37:42,258 --> 00:37:45,298
and hurry over to sing.

710
00:37:45,298 --> 00:37:49,058
But Eun Ji doesn't have a guardian.

711
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,688
You must've been scared.

712
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:56,868
But the hospital takes care of
 emergency patients without a guardian.

713
00:37:56,868 --> 00:38:00,318
Yes, yes, I realized it when I got here...

714
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:04,228
But earlier, Eun Ji had 
lost consciousness.

715
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:06,998
What if she had to go in
 for emergency surgery...

716
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:09,648
I was so worried about that.

717
00:38:09,648 --> 00:38:12,078
You weren't worried about me?

718
00:38:12,078 --> 00:38:15,718
I got so scared, wondering
 if you got into an accident.

719
00:38:19,628 --> 00:38:21,508
You should've called me,

720
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:24,468
sing quickly, and come 
back together. Or...

721
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,888
I could've come here.

722
00:38:28,038 --> 00:38:30,848
Yes, that is true, but...

723
00:38:30,848 --> 00:38:32,508
I couldn't...

724
00:38:32,508 --> 00:38:35,918
bring myself to ask you...

725
00:38:35,918 --> 00:38:38,728
Why couldn't you ask me?

726
00:38:39,788 --> 00:38:43,048
Hwak Se, don't you know what an
 important day today is? Did you forget?

727
00:38:43,048 --> 00:38:46,358
We worked so hard for today.

728
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:52,808
I'm okay about it, but...

729
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:55,088
I feel so bad for you, Man Jung...

730
00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:59,598
How could you be okay with that?

731
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:03,328
When would you get 
another chance like this?

732
00:39:03,328 --> 00:39:06,198
I'm not the issue here...

733
00:39:10,878 --> 00:39:12,478
Hwak Se.

734
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:16,308
By chance...

735
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:20,078
Are you more than friends...

736
00:39:20,078 --> 00:39:24,158
with that Eun Ji? Above and beyond 
of being oppa and sister?

737
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:27,068
Gosh, no. It's nothing like that. Really.

738
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:30,378
We were friends from childhood, 
and we were close. And...

739
00:39:30,378 --> 00:39:32,618
Eun Ji's parents were so good to me.

740
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:35,358
- That's why...
- You said you lost touch for years.

741
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:37,808
And now that she appeared, 
you're going to this extent?

742
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,668
Giving up your important work?

743
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,978
I just don't get it.

744
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:46,458
I mean, she blacked out earlier...

745
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,728
I didn't know what to do...

746
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:54,188
You must've been extremely worried.

747
00:39:54,188 --> 00:39:56,478
Don't cry. It looks like you're about to.

748
00:39:57,288 --> 00:39:59,028
Take good care of her.

749
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:01,128
I have to get back to the hospital.

750
00:40:01,128 --> 00:40:04,518
- Wait, Man Jung.
- Kim Eun Ji's guardian.

751
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:05,948
Yes.

752
00:40:18,718 --> 00:40:21,658
What do you think of putting the 
new line of products over there?

753
00:40:21,658 --> 00:40:23,608
I think they'll easily be seen.

754
00:40:23,608 --> 00:40:26,288
I still have clients looking
 for winter clothing.

755
00:40:26,288 --> 00:40:27,828
I'll put them there as I reorganize.

756
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:29,488
Yes, got it.

757
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:34,438
 

758
00:40:36,888 --> 00:40:39,388
Excuse me. I have a call to take.

759
00:40:45,798 --> 00:40:47,408
Yes.

760
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:51,048
Yes, I called you earlier.

761
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:55,278
I have something to ask you. 
I'd like to meet you.

762
00:40:57,148 --> 00:40:59,288
Yes, I'll see you there.

763
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:21,078
 Put this jacket on. 

764
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,618
 You look so cold. 

765
00:41:23,618 --> 00:41:24,848
 No thank you. 

766
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:26,558
 Pardon me. 

767
00:41:41,618 --> 00:41:45,868
♫  Because it's you, and it's me  ♫

768
00:41:45,868 --> 00:41:49,438
♫  Because it's you  ♫

769
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:52,588
♫  Don't ask me why I love you  ♫

770
00:41:52,588 --> 00:41:54,098
Seo Yeon!

771
00:41:56,028 --> 00:42:00,688
♫  Because it's you, and it's me  ♫

772
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:02,658
Thanks for calling me up.

773
00:42:02,658 --> 00:42:06,148
I was so happy when
 I saw that you had called.

774
00:42:16,248 --> 00:42:19,508
Jae Hee is good to you, right?

775
00:42:19,508 --> 00:42:21,008
Your in-laws, too.

776
00:42:22,278 --> 00:42:25,458
Since you're so friendly,
 I'm sure they love you.

777
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:27,948
I'll get to the point.

778
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,178
I was wondering how 
Hwang Na Ro is doing these days.

779
00:42:34,368 --> 00:42:37,908
After talking to Jae Hee, 
I looked into it here and there.

780
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:39,658
Hwang Na Ro, that a**...

781
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:41,108
No...

782
00:42:41,108 --> 00:42:43,998
Hwang Na Ro is living 
a wholesome life these days.

783
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:46,548
He cut off contact with bad people...

784
00:42:46,548 --> 00:42:48,788
I guess I'd do the same.

785
00:42:48,788 --> 00:42:52,098
What's he got to lose? 
He grabbed onto a rich girl.

786
00:43:04,478 --> 00:43:08,168
Seo Ah wants to marry Hwang Na Ro,

787
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:11,408
and Mom is very upset about it.

788
00:43:11,498 --> 00:43:16,548
She's worried that he'll cause trouble
 as you did in the past.

789
00:43:16,548 --> 00:43:19,588
Geez, my Jung Won must be so worried.

790
00:43:19,588 --> 00:43:23,418
How did Jang Seo Ah get tangled
 with a guy like that?

791
00:43:24,658 --> 00:43:26,458
It won't be easy even if...

792
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:31,158
Hwang Na Ro ends his past life
 and tries to start anew.

793
00:43:31,198 --> 00:43:36,198
I'm sure his old friends know
 how well he's doing right now.

794
00:43:36,248 --> 00:43:37,398
Yeah, that's right.

795
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:39,908
They'll try to rip him off somehow.

796
00:43:41,268 --> 00:43:44,748
Now that I think about it, there is 
someone I feel uneasy about.

797
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:46,128
Who?

798
00:43:46,128 --> 00:43:47,958
There's this guy named "Professor Kim."

799
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,138
He used to pull tricks 
with Hwang Na Ro...

800
00:43:50,138 --> 00:43:51,798
I mean, he used to work with him.

801
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,728
He's dying of jealousy.

802
00:43:53,728 --> 00:43:55,848
Ticked off that he's been left out.

803
00:43:57,038 --> 00:44:01,198
Well, I guess there are other punks
 that bother me as well.

804
00:44:01,198 --> 00:44:03,248
Seo Yeon, don't worry.

805
00:44:03,248 --> 00:44:04,498
I'll look into it and

806
00:44:04,498 --> 00:44:07,488
I'll straighten them out if 
I find any that are shady.

807
00:44:07,488 --> 00:44:10,558
But don't get involved with
 them now for that reason.

808
00:44:10,558 --> 00:44:14,688
Just find out if Hwang Na Ro is

809
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:16,788
plotting something shady.

810
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:20,938
All right. Don't worry. I'll take it 
on and look into all the details.

811
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:26,468
I can't believe my Seo Yeon is 
discussing things with me.

812
00:44:26,468 --> 00:44:28,668
I'm so happy.

813
00:44:33,158 --> 00:44:35,248
What kind of work 
are you doing these days?

814
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:38,658
Well, I enjoy sewing, as you know.

815
00:44:38,658 --> 00:44:41,138
I sew at a clothing repair shop.

816
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:44,268
Seo Yeon, don't worry.

817
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:46,098
I've straightened out.

818
00:44:46,098 --> 00:44:48,178
I'll live a good, wholesome life.

819
00:44:50,678 --> 00:44:53,128
If Hwang Na Ro is up to no good,

820
00:44:53,128 --> 00:44:55,978
call me directly and not Jae Hee.

821
00:44:55,978 --> 00:45:00,378
But wouldn't it be safer to get 
Jae Hee involved in this?

822
00:45:00,378 --> 00:45:03,118
I'm embarrassed even though
 he's my husband.

823
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:05,918
Yeah, right.

824
00:45:05,918 --> 00:45:09,478
Well, it's shameful to 
show how I'm living.

825
00:45:11,498 --> 00:45:13,398
Go home safely.

826
00:45:19,948 --> 00:45:22,488
Don't you have any warm clothes?

827
00:45:22,488 --> 00:45:24,628
I do have it, but...

828
00:45:24,628 --> 00:45:27,918
you know I'm stylish.

829
00:45:27,918 --> 00:45:30,488
I don't get cold easily. 
Don't worry about me.

830
00:45:30,488 --> 00:45:32,008
I'm not worried about you.

831
00:45:32,008 --> 00:45:33,688
Goodbye.

832
00:45:33,688 --> 00:45:36,588
I can pay for that...

833
00:45:36,588 --> 00:45:40,068
Bye, Seo Yeon. Thanks for the coffee.

834
00:45:40,068 --> 00:45:41,788
That girl...

835
00:45:41,788 --> 00:45:44,048
She's worried about her dad.

836
00:45:46,848 --> 00:45:52,128
Wow, it smells much better since 
Seo Yeon is paying for it.

837
00:45:53,578 --> 00:45:56,658
Ahjumma, hello!

838
00:45:56,658 --> 00:45:59,698
Ba Wi, you're back from your grandma's.

839
00:45:59,698 --> 00:46:02,298
Aigoo. Did you have a nice time?

840
00:46:02,298 --> 00:46:04,288
Good to see you, Ba Wi.

841
00:46:04,288 --> 00:46:06,208
Me, too, ahjumma.

842
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:08,968
I missed you, ahjumma!

843
00:46:08,968 --> 00:46:10,538
You did?

844
00:46:10,538 --> 00:46:13,508
We made some cookies.

845
00:46:13,508 --> 00:46:15,358
Ba Wi said we should share 
them with you.

846
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:18,338
Oh, my. Ba Wi, did you 
bake them yourself?

847
00:46:18,338 --> 00:46:21,188
They look wonderful!

848
00:46:21,188 --> 00:46:22,738
Come in, Ba Wi.

849
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,098
Thank you, ahjumma.

850
00:46:25,098 --> 00:46:26,778
Wait...

851
00:46:26,778 --> 00:46:28,368
Come in.

852
00:46:29,568 --> 00:46:31,058
Okay.

853
00:46:33,598 --> 00:46:34,708
My gosh...

854
00:46:35,718 --> 00:46:38,328
You met Jae Hee's dad this afternoon?

855
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:39,418
Yes.

856
00:46:39,418 --> 00:46:42,358
I had to stop by his 
company research lab.

857
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:46,328
I bumped into him, so we 
grabbed lunch together.

858
00:46:46,328 --> 00:46:47,618
I see...

859
00:46:47,618 --> 00:46:49,728
That's what happened.

860
00:46:49,728 --> 00:46:52,648
Mr. Woo is so cool.

861
00:46:52,648 --> 00:46:54,798
He told me some helpful advice.

862
00:46:56,388 --> 00:46:58,068
Really?

863
00:46:58,068 --> 00:46:59,868
Is he like that?

864
00:46:59,868 --> 00:47:03,138
Ahjumma, can I watch TV?

865
00:47:03,138 --> 00:47:05,568
My favorite show is on soon.

866
00:47:05,568 --> 00:47:07,638
Ba Wi, let's watch it at home.

867
00:47:07,638 --> 00:47:10,718
I like ahjumma's house.

868
00:47:10,718 --> 00:47:12,888
Her TV is huge.

869
00:47:12,888 --> 00:47:15,318
Sure. Watch it here.

870
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:16,708
Drink milk as you watch.

871
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,428
Thank you!

872
00:47:18,428 --> 00:47:20,748
Geez, look at him.

873
00:47:20,748 --> 00:47:23,388
He wants to stay here 
as long as he can.

874
00:47:23,388 --> 00:47:25,678
Oh, my. Is that what Ba Wi is doing?

875
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:39,818
Oh, yeah, Mr. Woo said something 
strange to me earlier.

876
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:41,958
What did he say?

877
00:47:44,238 --> 00:47:49,858
 Jung Min Jae and I are just friends. 

878
00:47:49,858 --> 00:47:54,078
 We have no plans to get back
 together or anything like that. 

879
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:57,158
My gosh...

880
00:47:57,158 --> 00:48:02,198
Why would he say that to 
you out of the blue?

881
00:48:02,198 --> 00:48:05,708
I'm cautious as I'm 
guessing this, but...

882
00:48:06,588 --> 00:48:10,168
I think he was mindful of 
me as he said that.

883
00:48:10,168 --> 00:48:12,418
Mindful of you, Professor?

884
00:48:14,018 --> 00:48:16,708
In my view, I think...

885
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:20,348
Mr. Woo realized my feelings.

886
00:48:20,348 --> 00:48:21,828
That I...

887
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:30,798
That I'd like to get closer 
to you, Noonim.

888
00:48:32,448 --> 00:48:35,478
Oh, I see...

889
00:48:56,088 --> 00:48:58,158
 And since you love it, 

890
00:48:58,158 --> 00:49:02,098
 he made pancakes to bring them 
over to you in the morning. 

891
00:49:02,098 --> 00:49:04,458
 If someone approaches you, 
don't stop him. 

892
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:07,868
 And don't mind the kids.
 Just date him. 

893
00:49:12,968 --> 00:49:14,928
What's with Woo Jung Hoo?

894
00:49:15,988 --> 00:49:19,638
Is he genuinely telling 
me to move on?

895
00:49:29,718 --> 00:49:31,288
That's right.

896
00:49:31,288 --> 00:49:37,018
We should seek the research team
 for smart clothing simultaneously.

897
00:49:37,018 --> 00:49:38,918
Yes.

898
00:49:38,918 --> 00:49:41,478
I emailed you the relevant files.

899
00:49:42,448 --> 00:49:43,788
Yes.

900
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,378
Thank you, Chief Yoon.

901
00:49:56,468 --> 00:49:58,118
Seo Ah?

902
00:49:59,928 --> 00:50:02,668
She could just walk in now.

903
00:50:08,818 --> 00:50:10,378
Hi.

904
00:50:16,148 --> 00:50:18,128
It's nice.

905
00:50:18,128 --> 00:50:20,818
Hey, Jang Seo Ah gave 
you all this, huh?

906
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:24,158
Your own place, a car...

907
00:50:24,158 --> 00:50:26,448
I'm envious of you, Hwang Na Ro.

908
00:50:26,448 --> 00:50:29,168
Seo Ah will be here soon. Get out.

909
00:50:29,168 --> 00:50:31,118
Let's talk later.

910
00:50:31,118 --> 00:50:32,598
S***...

911
00:50:32,598 --> 00:50:35,458
I came here for your sake.

912
00:50:35,458 --> 00:50:36,420
What?

913
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,080
I almost went to CEO Kim Jung Won 
directly but came here.

914
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,020
Hey, are you kidding me?

915
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:50,500
I told you to show me your appreciation.

916
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,890
You sent me a chump change.

917
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:58,300
You have no fear, huh?

918
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,800
Are you sticking it to me?

919
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,170
I told you to wait, a**hole!

920
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:05,240
Ask Jang Seo Ah to give you money!

921
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,010
Tell her to give you a big one!

922
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:09,070
- You a**hole!
- Na Ro...

923
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,130
Seo Ah.

924
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,920
Hello, Seo Ah. I'm Na Ro's friend.

925
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,980
I've heard a lot about you.

926
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,540
Stay in touch, buddy.

927
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:52,340
Why is all this on the floor?

928
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:57,110
Seo Ah, don't do that.

929
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:58,930
I'll pick them up.

930
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,350
I'm sorry for showing you this.

931
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:05,790
I knew him from before.

932
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,580
He came looking for me, knowing
 that I work for a good company.

933
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,430
How much is he asking for?

934
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,740
Ask him how much he wants.

935
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:27,870
And let's move the officetel 
tomorrow right away.

936
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:30,020
To somewhere he doesn't know.

937
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,320
We don't need to do that, Seo Ah.

938
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,320
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

939
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,610
He's not a big deal. Just trust me.

940
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,050
Na Ro.

941
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,850
Don't hide anything from me.

942
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:46,100
I'm ready to deal with it.

943
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,660
When I started loving you,

944
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:51,350
I said, fine.

945
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,950
I thought stuff like this could happen.

946
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:57,020
If we overcome this period,

947
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,880
you don't have to meet
 people like that again.

948
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,420
Let's endure together. Okay?

949
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,740
 

950
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,950
There's a clothing repair shop here.

951
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,010
Hello.

952
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,890
Yes, welcome.

953
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:34,640
How can I help you?

954
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,040
I have a rip right here. 
Could you fix this?

955
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,480
Of course.

956
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,730
I can fix it like you just
 bought it from the mall.

957
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:43,960
Pick it up tomorrow.

958
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,700
Okay. Thank you.

959
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,230
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

960
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,260
Aigoo, Seo Yeon's younger sister.

961
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,250
She makes a nice impression, too.

962
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,100
Seo Yeon is so blessed.

963
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,300
Geez, you scared me!

964
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,830
You jerk, you ignored my calls.

965
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:10,430
How did you know I was here?

966
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,130
I know everything.

967
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,200
I'm glad you came.

968
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,450
I heard you're very close
 to Jang Seo Ah.

969
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:20,290
My Jung Won and my 
Seo Yeon are so worried.

970
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:24,400
So I was thinking. 
Hyungnim, help me.

971
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,090
Help with what?

972
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:30,090
Get that a**hole, Professor Kim, 
out of my face.

973
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,340
Geez, Professor Kim. That a**hole.

974
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,330
I guess he's trying to suck you dry.

975
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:39,430
He's committed lots of crimes.

976
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:41,990
Dig them out and send him 
back behind bars or...

977
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,940
Anyway, stop him from butting in.

978
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:48,120
I'll be sure to pay you enough for it.

979
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,220
I don't need any money, man.

980
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,570
I got burned for such money, man.

981
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:54,200
I don't want to get in trouble 
with Seo Yeon again.

982
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,700
Hyungnim, did I ever ask 
you for a favor?

983
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:00,270
Help me out just once.

984
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,260
 Seo Ah wants to marry Hwang Na Ro, 

985
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,050
 and Mom is very upset about it. 

986
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:13,240
 My Jung Won and Seo Yeon shouldn't 
be distraught because of this jerk. 

987
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,650
Hyungnim.

988
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,990
Hae Deun, you're home.

989
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:45,730
Hi, Mom.

990
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:48,670
Gosh...

991
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:50,740
Are you upset?

992
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:55,200
I don't feel good, either.

993
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,220
Mom.

994
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:08,540
Joon Ah.

995
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,150
Thank you for coming home.

996
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:13,160
Where is Seo Ah?

997
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,510
She's not home yet.

998
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,640
Mom.

999
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,180
Yeah?

1000
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,570
What's wrong?

1001
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:39,050
Mom, I can't live like this.

1002
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,550
I'm suffering so much...

1003
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:43,550
Mom, I'm really sorry.

1004
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:45,340
Joon Ah.

1005
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,430
♫  Don't cry  ♫

1006
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:52,050
♫  I can understand you now  ♫

1007
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:54,480
Hae Deun! Hae Deun!

1008
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,840
Aigoo, where are you going this late?

1009
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,350
- Mom.
- Huh?

1010
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:04,520
You always told us this.

1011
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,370
That we should be courageous,
 especially during hard times.

1012
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,810
Yes, I did say that.

1013
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:10,510
I'm being courageous, Mom.

1014
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,130
I can't stand it because I'm so upset.

1015
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,520
Because of Joon Ah?

1016
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,600
What are you going to do?

1017
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,430
I'll be right back.

1018
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,510
Hey, Hae Deun, where are you going?

1019
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:25,340
Really. I'll be right back. 
Don't worry, Mom.

1020
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,430
Hey, Hae Deun!

1021
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:31,580
I'll get the CEO's approval and
 bring back Joon Ah.

1022
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:36,310
♫  I'm going toward you slowly  ♫

1023
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,690
I fell in love with someone
 first time in my life.

1024
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:40,960
How can I give her up? How can I?

1025
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,330
I'll never give up. Seriously.

1026
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,270
I'll go and tell...

1027
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:49,450
♫  Don't say anything  ♫

1028
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,420
I'll go and tell her.

1029
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:55,930
Mr. Makjang!

1030
00:57:55,930 --> 00:58:02,400
♫  What will you need? You have me  ♫

1031
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,590
Where are you going, Hae Deun?

1032
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:07,390
To get you, Mr. Makjang.

1033
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,800
♫  Don't you cry  ♫

1034
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,600
I was on my way to get 
you, too, Hae Deun.

1035
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,350
We synced. Right?

1036
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,190
♫  Even your tears  ♫

1037
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:18,960
Mr. Makjang...

1038
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:29,190
♫  What will you need? You have me  ♫

1039
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:36,080
♫  I feel bad for having 
nothing to give you  ♫

1040
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:42,630
♫  Don't you cry, I love you  ♫

1041
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:48,180
♫  Even your tears  ♫

1042
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:51,630
So it's like...

1043
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:54,150
Hello, Father!

1044
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:55,730
Did you have a long day?

1045
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:58,500
No way. My days are so fun

1046
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:02,630
Mom brought us some fruit. 
Have some. It's sweet.

1047
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:07,490
What brings you here, Jung Min Jae?

1048
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,110
What do you mean?

1049
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:11,360
I came to visit my son and 
my daughter-in-law.

1050
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:15,910
Of course, your son and your 
daughter-in-law do live here.

1051
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,190
But it's still my house.

1052
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,000
See?

1053
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,930
I knew you'd say that.

1054
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:27,520
Actually, I'm here because I have 
something to say to you.

1055
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,210
Mom, say what?

1056
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,030
Come into my room for a minute.

1057
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:39,170
Gosh, we're strangers now. 
How can I go to your bedroom?

1058
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,360
Mother, we'll go up.

1059
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:47,490
I'm joking.

1060
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:50,830
Excuse me.

1061
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,850
It's nothing, Chae Woon.

1062
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:00,390
Don't be shocked.

1063
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,330
Oh, Dad...

1064
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,700
Do they still have something
 to fight about?

1065
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:13,190
I've never seen Father with
 that facial expression.

1066
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,800
Wait...

1067
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,030
What do you want to say?

1068
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,050
How can you say such 
a thing to Professor Son?

1069
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:31,240
I heard you told him that we 
wouldn't get back together.

1070
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,700
Isn't that the fact?

1071
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,590
It is a fact.

1072
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,550
But why would you tell him that?

1073
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,470
As if to say we're not 
getting back together,

1074
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:44,260
so go ahead and date 
Jung Min Jae if you want to.

1075
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,140
That is what I meant.

1076
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,780
What?

1077
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:53,500
That Professor Son, the child's dad...

1078
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,960
seems to be interested in you.

1079
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,450
But I don't think he's able
 to make a move.

1080
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,630
So I gave him a sign.

1081
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,630
 - I mean... 
- Professor Son...

1082
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,030
 - why would you give him that sign? 
- Son Jung Hoo?

1083
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,180
- Jae Hee, what are you doing? Come here.
 - Whether he's interested or not? 

1084
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,720
Let's go over there.

1085
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,960
 Aren't you interested in him, too? 

1086
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,620
I noticed that you were laughing to 
happily talking to Professor Son.

1087
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:21,080
Right. Of course, that's the case.

1088
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,840
You saw, huh?

1089
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,270
You saw Professor Son and I hiking, 
and you got miffed...

1090
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:29,190
That's why you said you 
wouldn't see me again.

1091
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:31,630
And you said that to 
Professor Son today.

1092
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:38,960
I'm not miffed, Jung Min Jae.

1093
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,730
From the bottom of my heart,

1094
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:49,500
I hope that you'll meet 
a good man and start anew.

1095
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:54,960
It happens to be that Professor Son 
seems to be a good man.

1096
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,410
You're interested in him, too...

1097
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:03,290
yet I thought I was in the way. 
That's why I said that to him.

1098
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:08,800
Why do you keep saying
 you're in the way?

1099
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,340
Why do you...

1100
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:15,260
make me feel so bad?

1101
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,980
Feel bad?

1102
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,310
Hey, Min Jae.

1103
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,070
"Hey, Min Jae?"

1104
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,110
Yes.

1105
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:34,160
Let me call you like the good old days.

1106
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,940
Hey, Min Jae.

1107
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,520
What, Jung Hoo oppa?

1108
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:48,250
You don't need to feel bad toward me.

1109
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,780
Not at all.

1110
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:53,950
Well, actually...

1111
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:55,730
I also...

1112
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,840
I also...

1113
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,270
You also, what?

1114
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:05,310
I also am seeing someone.

1115
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:06,890
What?

1116
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:09,320
Aigoo...

1117
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,770
Wait, Dad...

1118
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:14,170
Wait, Jae, why...

1119
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:15,990
I'm sorry, Mother.

1120
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:17,570
Jae Hee, let's go.

1121
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,740
Wait. Wait a minute.

1122
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:22,870
Dad, are you really seeing someone?

1123
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:27,170
And you're dating Professor Son?

1124
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,120
That's not it.

1125
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,600
- Well...
- Yeah, there's someone.

1126
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,860
We're not allowed to see other people?

1127
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,610
Dad.

1128
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,460
Re... really?

1129
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:43,320
That's right! It's true! 
What will you do about it?

1130
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,830
Wait...

1131
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,690
Jung Hoo.

1132
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,560
Father.

1133
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:53,840
♫   Good, good, good, the best!  ♫

1134
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,150
Mom...

1135
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:57,660
♫   Honey, baby, sweetie, darling, good!  ♫

1136
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:03,680
♫   It's good! It's very, very good   ♫

1137
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:10,160
♫   I totally fell for you   ♫

1138
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,970
♫   I totally fell for you   ♫

1139
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:17,500
♫   It's perfect! You're truly perfect   ♫

1140
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:25,860
♫   It's a destiny like a present   ♫

1141
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,400
♫   The pretty face with a big big smile   ♫

1142
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,210
 

1143
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:32,790
 CEO hates me to my face. 

1144
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:34,320
 Lee Hae Deun. 

1145
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,390
 - Mr. Makjang!
- My gosh! Hae Deun! 

1146
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:40,940
 Director Lee! Director Lee! 

1147
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:42,690
 It's a lie, right? 

1148
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,890
 It's not a lie. It's true. 

1149
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:47,400
 Then let me meet her. 

1150
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,830
 The woman you're dating. 

1151
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:51,120
 Why? I can't do that. 

1152
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,350
 Don't be delusional. 

1153
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:56,590
 That Hwang Na Ro! If he doesn't 
treat me right, I'll destroy him. 

1154
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:57,340
 What? 

1155
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:00,630
 I think Kim Eun Ji is 
Ra Hoon's birth mother. 

1156
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,480
 Hwak Se's hometown friend. 

1157
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,320
 What did you say her name is? 

1158
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,270
 Eun Ji. Kim Eun Ji or something like that. 

1159
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:07,510
 It's our grand opening gift. 

1160
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:09,090
 I made it myself. 

1161
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:11,800
 Isn't it cute? The repair shop gave it away, 
saying it's for their opening. 

1162
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,190
 Isn't it similar to the one you
 hung on your purse?
