1
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,170
     

2
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,150
Moong-i!

3
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,620
Moong-i, are you okay? What's going on?

4
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,450
It's nothing.

5
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,960
- Mr. Lee! 
 - Mr. Woo.

6
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,440
I was walking by, and I thought a woman was in trouble, so I ran over here,

7
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,770
and it was your girlfriend.

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,750
- Hwang Na Ro! What did you do to Chae Woon! 
 - What did I do?

9
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,410
I was just talking with her. Why are you all overreacting?

10
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,040
  Mister!  

11
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,160
I met you before at the construction site.

12
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,170
- Did we meet before? 
 - What a coincidence, right?

13
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,750
But why are you here?

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,730
As if you were waiting somewhere, you just popped out.

15
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,120
I guess I was waiting for you.

16
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,890
To meet up again like this.

17
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,060
Isn't he suspicious?

18
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,090
- Why is he suspicious? Watch out for your words! 
 - Right?

19
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,260
I'm the most suspicious person in this world.

20
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,100
Also, I'm the worst person in this world.

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,060
By the way, mister. I guess you did some kicking back in the days. You're pretty good at it.

22
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,460
Well, yes. I was a bit good at it.

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,730
By the way, sir.

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:04,490
Even though you know her, if you make a woman surprised in this dark night time,

25
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,350
I think it's easy to make a person like me misunderstand the situation.

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,350
Please refrain from doing so from now on.

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
What did you say?

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,420
Hey! Stop it.

29
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,750
Moong-i, excuse me for a second.

30
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,290
Stay here with me. It's better not to talk with someone like that guy.

31
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,360
- Thank you. 
 - It's nothing.

32
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,710
But are you really okay? Did you get hurt somewhere?

33
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,230
- I'm fine. 
 - Okay.

34
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,730
- Oh! 
 - Ah, thank you!

35
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,840
You're going to make this into your habit!

36
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,160
Hwang Na Ro. Are you this far now?

37
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,730
- Now you're threatening Chae Woon? 
 - I didn't threaten her.

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,450
I was just talking with her.

39
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,780
Did you really like Chae Woon?

40
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,080
Are you like this now because of a love-hate feeling?

41
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,380
- Love-hate? 
 - Are you feeling love-hate because you got rejected by her?

42
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,850
Do you think I'm like Jang Seo Ah?

43
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,230
Do you think I'm being like Jang Seo Ah having a tantrum because she got dumped by you!

44
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,320
At least Seo Ah is simple!

45
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,860
- She's not cunning like you. 
 - What?

46
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,400
You talk prettily.

47
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,960
  Hwang Na Ro!  

48
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,580
You imagine too much, Woo Jae Hee.

49
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:56,360
Then, while you're at it, why don't you think more about him?

50
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,340
  What?  

51
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,420
  That bastard!  

52
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,260
Thank you!

53
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,420
- Let me pour for you, too. 
 - Yes!

54
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,610
Thank you.

55
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,480
Let me pour for you, too.

56
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,060
- Fill it to the top, please. 
 - She drinks more than me! She's good at drinking.

57
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,460
Is that so?

58
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,940
Oh, that's right. There's something to celebrate for Mr. Lee, so why don't we have a toast?

59
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,290
What celebration?

60
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,640
Mr. Choi left the job, so now he's the general manager of the site.

61
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,420
- Thank you so much! 
 - Congratulations!

62
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,540
- It's nothing. I'm still a contract worker. 
 - You'll be in a regular position soon!

63
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,490
- Then, let's celebrate you becoming a regular employee soon! Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

64
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,130
By the way, I feel like I'm interrupting you two's date.

65
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,040
I'll drink this and leave soon.

66
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,560
No! I wanted to take you out for a nice meal since you made so much coffee for me.

67
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,160
I'll get you a drink, which is better than a meal.

68
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,270
I also wanted to have some private time with you, so today's a good chance.

69
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,460
Thank you.

70
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,140
By the way, was he works with you in the same company?

71
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,840
Yes. But we're not in a good relationship.

72
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,970
Is that so.

73
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,930
I misunderstood. I thought you were in trouble.

74
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,580
Ah! Hwang Na Ro, he's a problem...

75
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,960
If you get into trouble, just call me. I'll run to you right away.

76
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,660
Oh, Moong-i, you must feel secured! But it makes me feel jealous!

77
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,060
Thank you for offering that.

78
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,520
Did you do martial arts? Your flying kick was amazing earlier!

79
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,340
Was it?

80
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:55,560
When Joon Ah came to our site and messed with me, Mr. Lee thought I was in trouble and twisted his arm like this.

81
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,180
I didn't learn it seriously but just did it as a hobby.

82
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,920
But why were you there at that time?

83
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,570
I thought you got off from work early today.

84
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,260
Ah, yes. It was...

85
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,030
I was actually on the way back from a night security interview for a building nearby.

86
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,660
  Ah...  

87
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,370
That building with a sandwich shop on the first floor.

88
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,350
Ah, right.

89
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,960
Did the interview go well?

90
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,160
They said they'd call me back, but I don't know. I don't have any experience in security jobs.

91
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,720
Are you going to be okay to do construction work in the day and security work at night?

92
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,450
That position looked like a great one because it was between the day shift and the night shift.

93
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,920
So it didn't look that hard.

94
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,210
I hope you can get that work.

95
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,280
But what should we do with this? It fell off.

96
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,320
That's old now, so it falls off easily.

97
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,910
Why did that fall off? Did Hwang Na Ro push you?

98
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,530
No, it just fell off by itself.

99
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,210
Do you think I'll just stand still if he pushed me? I would've hit him with my forehead like this!

100
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,550
Don't do that!

101
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,510
Ah, it's dangerous.

102
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,560
- You shouldn't deal with a guy like him directly. 
 - Ah, okay.

103
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,980
Do you carry a sewing kit around with you?

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes. I actually like to sew.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,570
- I didn't expect that! 
 - That's true.

106
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,660
- He's really good at sewing! Look at him. 
 - You're right. He's really good!

107
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,380
I think you're really good at doing stuff with your hands.

108
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,590
Do you like to make stuff?

109
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,890
Yes. I can do simple fixes for my clothes.

110
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,030
And I used to make this kind of dolls as a hobby.

111
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,410
Really? I heard that my biological father made this doll as well.

112
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,560
I didn't drink that much, but I guess I'm already drunk.

113
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,990
Are you bleeding?

114
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,760
I'm okay.

115
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:11,450
You know they say even a monkey can fall off from trees. You two complimented me so much that I made a stupid mistake.

116
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,160
I have something. One second.

117
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,860
- No, it's okay! 
 - No, it's better to put something on.

118
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,210
Here.

119
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,910
There you go.

120
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,070
Thank you.

121
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,160
- Here. It's done now. 
 - Thank you!

122
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,160
Wow, it's very strong! It's never going to fall again.

123
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,060
Yes, it won't fall again.

124
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,930
Then why don't we have a toast to celebrate the recovery of Gomgomi?

125
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,370
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

126
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,830
Wait.

127
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,850
  The bench must be cold.  

128
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,820
  When he was James, he wiped the chair for me.  

129
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,310
  We don't click with each other!  

130
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,060
So what was unreasonable to you?

131
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,120
Yes?

132
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:43,750
I'm not a child. How long are you going to follow me around?

133
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,590
I'm here to see Jae Hee! Trust me!

134
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,380
Do you think I'll believe that?

135
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:58,320
I can understand how you feel just by hearing you farting.

136
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,620
Fart-- When did I fart?

137
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,260
What are you talking about it? You are the one who always farts a lot, did you forget that?

138
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,760
Also, my fart is just making a bright sound,

139
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,210
but your fart makes shh kind of sneaky sounds.

140
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,760
No, that's not right. If you make a sound, then at least I can run away from you.

141
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:23,480
You always made me surprise with your awful smell!

142
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,110
Are we sitting here to talk about fart?

143
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm at my work hour!

144
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,870
You are the one who said we should talk!

145
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,920
Did I say that?

146
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,010
Anyway, stop paying attention to me,

147
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:48,790
and take care of your own life, Ms. Jung Min Jae.

148
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,570
Did you make me sit on this cold bench just to say that?

149
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,660
Is it cold? Is it too cold for you?

150
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,960
When did you worry about me? That's unusual.

151
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,260
Let's go now.

152
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,560
I said I'm here to see Jae Hee, and you don't trust me.

153
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:15,170
Are you working in the jokbal place at night?

154
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,770
- Yes. 
 - Why?

155
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,870
If you work at night and going into the office in the morning would be hard.

156
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Sure, nevermind. It's your hobby.

157
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:31,030
You don't have a hobby because it costs money. This is great! You can make money while you're doing your hobby.

158
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,660
Exactly, that's what it is!

159
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:38,450
So think like that from now on and stop worrying about me.

160
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,530
I wasn't worried about you!

161
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,900
You need to fix that incurable disease.

162
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,920
- Incurable disease? 
 - Your narcissism!

163
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,660
You are fine most of the time, but whenever I show up, it comes back!

164
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,810
I should go now. Have a safe trip back home.

165
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,110
There's another incurable disease he has. He gets sulk easily.

166
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:09,960
  Maybe he got an incurable disease or something?  

167
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,860
Mr. Woo Jung Hoo!

168
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,160
What is it again?

169
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,270
Do you...

170
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,060
What is it?

171
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,140
You don't have any other illnesses, do you?

172
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,620
What? Are you talking about sulking disease?

173
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,990
- Did you hear that? 
 - Listen.

174
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,220
I had been listening to your grumbling for 30 years! Did you think I don't know what you say by now?

175
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,000
There's one more thing.

176
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,660
What is it? Did they say something from the hospital?

177
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,060
Don't you remember what you always grumbled about?

178
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,680
Shh-- The farting disease!

179
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,130
Why is he keep talking about farting?

180
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,160
It's really strange!

181
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,060
He totally changed into the James,

182
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,640
but he turns back into the old-time Woo Jung Hoo whenever I show up.

183
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,160
How was he back in the days?

184
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:26,560
He's really stingy, cranky, talks bluntly, doesn't have any manners, and he gets sulky easily.

185
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,630
Is that so.

186
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,610
  Soon Jung!  

187
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,260
I can't imagine that at all.

188
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,860
  Of course. He was always nice to you from old-times.  

189
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,010
This is that ginger tea!

190
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,810
The tea that Woo Jung Hoo drank a ton.

191
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,450
Yes. How is it?

192
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,070
I'm not a big fan of ginger.

193
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,350
Oh, then should I bring you a different tea?

194
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,530
No, it's okay! It's good for your health.

195
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,730
- Mom! Oh, hello! 
 - Hello!

196
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,170
Mom, did you see my gray hat that comes down on the side?

197
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,450
Why are you looking for that now?

198
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240
Excuse me.

199
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:25,350
- That was dirty, so I washed it for you. 
 - Oh, really?

200
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,820
I don't know why he likes this so much.

201
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,860
     

202
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,480
  If you want to be a good writer, you should learn more about our language.  

203
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,450
  So this is for you.  

204
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,880
  Mom, where's the trash bag?  

205
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,270
  It's right here. Where it always is.  

206
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,490
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,200
I guess the youngest child will always be the young child even he's all grown up like that.

208
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,630
Is that so? I only have one son, so I don't know.

209
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,090
Mr. Woo is very mature.

210
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,030
Oh! You drank all of the ginger tea, after all.

211
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,990
- It's good! 
 - Do you want some more?

212
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,530
No, it's okay.

213
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,860
Mr. Lee makes me feel good whenever I see him.

214
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:59,140
Right? He's really working hard as well, so everyone likes him.

215
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,340
I wonder if he has a daughter.

216
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,260
I feel like that.

217
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,660
I don't know because we didn't talk about his family.

218
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:15,300
But since he had that sewing kit, it feels like he lives by himself.

219
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,190
That's true.

220
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,290
He looks a bit lonely.

221
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,160
But something's off about him.

222
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,740
About what?

223
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,430
When Hwang Na Ro came to your site to find someone,

224
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:39,850
the way he was looking Mr. Lee wasn't the ordinary way.

225
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,780
Right? I felt that too at the time.

226
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:49,230
But that's Hwang Na Ro's character as well. He looks at a person with full of suspicion.

227
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,910
So I thought he was instinctively wary of Mr. Lee.

228
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,320
Maybe it was like that.

229
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,010
Today, Seo Ah was going to appoint Hwang Na Ro as her executive secretary.

230
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,450
But the CEO didn't approve it.

231
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,310
That happened today?

232
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:11,210
So I told her not to do that.

233
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,360
I think Hwang Na Ro was angrier at me because of that.

234
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,400
By the way, you looked pretty cool earlier.

235
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,410
You didn't get intimidated by him.

236
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,950
I could be like that because I trusted you would show up somewhere.

237
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,400
Today, Mr. Lee came earlier than you.

238
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:39,750
But don't be too brave in trust of me showing up! What if I can't come to save you at a critical moment?

239
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,100
I don't think so!

240
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:48,130
You will run right to me. Even if I'm at the end of the earth and shout, "Help me, Koala!"

241
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,350
I'll run like woo-da-da-da?

242
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,380
Come here.

243
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,790
How can I make that kind of mistake?

244
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,410
Was it because it was related to Seo Yeon?

245
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,620
I should sue that bastard Hwang Na Ro again!

246
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,700
Seo Yeon.

247
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,170
What do you want?

248
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,030
You lost your cool today.

249
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,790
You should've not come out there.

250
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,190
  It was very awkward.  

251
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,560
I told you before. Don't give any damage to my Seo Yeon.

252
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,690
What kind of damn damage are you talking about?

253
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,780
You shouldn't reveal your identity like that on an impulse.

254
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:16,900
Woo Jae Hee and Bit Chae Woon will think about something like this when they wash their feet at home tonight.

255
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,170
There's something strange about it.

256
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,660
Why did he come out from there at that time?

257
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
You should worry about yourself, you bastard.

258
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:31,960
Anyway, don't forget that I'm always watching you, and be careful of your behavior.

259
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,480
You should wash your feet and go to bed now.

260
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,180
I guess you're a father as well.

261
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,860
Is father something like that?

262
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,260
I never had a father, so how can I know?

263
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,900
What's wrong?

264
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,740
I wonder if Seo Ah might come now.

265
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,380
If her car comes in, we can hide right away.

266
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
How?

267
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,520
If you just go like this and camouflage like this!

268
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,050
- What is that? 
 - If you do it like this, then other people can't see you!

269
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,560
Oh, the car! The car!

270
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,860
- I'm sorry, it was a lie. 
 - Hey!

271
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,160
I'm sorry. You're so cute!

272
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,620
What are you talking about it!

273
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,260
Thank you for bringing me home.

274
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,260
Good night.

275
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,420
Should I walk with you until over there?

276
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,160
- No, it's cold. You should go inside. 
 - Okay.

277
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,460
Good night!

278
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,360
- Good night! Just think about me, and let's meet in the dream. 
 - You, too!

279
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,750
Get inside safely.

280
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:08,200
Oh, I forgot to tell you about this! There was something--

281
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,990
Yes?

282
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,710
Oh? Where did the dictionary go that I put it here?

283
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,920
That's so weird! I definitely put it here.

284
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,870
Where did it go?

285
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
     

286
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:01,840
Jung Min Jae! Why did you do this! Why did you take this with you!

287
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,400
What am I going to do now!

288
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,710
I should bring this back.

289
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,920
But how?

290
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,150
If she asks why I took this in the first place, then what should I say?

291
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,060
Should I say I'm taking a college entrance exam next year?

292
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,020
My hormone is messing with me! What am I going to do now!

293
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,580
Why? Why!

294
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:34,080
It's because this originally belongs to me.

295
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
It's my man's dictionary.

296
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,660
     

297
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,520
That doesn't make any sense! We got a divorce already.

298
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,990
What's wrong with me?

299
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:54,160
I'm embarrassed about myself! My god!

300
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,290
Yes, thank you! Welcome!

301
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,160
Oh, Hae Deun!

302
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,760
Younger daughter!

303
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,440
Oh? James! How are you?

304
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,710
I'm good. How have you been?

305
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,470
- Are you working here now? 
 - Only at night.

306
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,810
- Then can I see you every day now? 
 - Yes!

307
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,030
- Is it this place? 
 - Oh, Mr. Makjang! This is the place.

308
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,520
How can you just disappear when I was on the phone? I got lost.

309
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,960
- What are you talking about it? I told you this is the place. 
 - I know.

310
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,860
  Who is he?  

311
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,360
Ah, he's Makjang-- no, he's the CEO of where I work.

312
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:36,380
I got hired by an online shopping company! So we're here to celebrate my joining the company.

313
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,660
Hae Deun, I'm so happy for you!

314
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,080
This is really great!

315
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:50,470
Then if you're the CEO, a very high-ranking person came all the way here.

316
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,400
- Please take good care of our Hae Deun. 
 - Me, too. Nice to meet you.

317
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,610
Ah, I'm Hae Deun's uncle.

318
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,990
Oh, you're her uncle! Your uncle is very young!

319
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,160
Hello... Oh!

320
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,610
Aren't you Joon Ah?

321
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,300
Oh! Aren't you Jae Hee's father?

322
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,080
- I was right! 
 - Jae Hee's Father!

323
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,360
Why are you here? Are you running this restaurant?

324
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,260
No. There's a reason.

325
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,680
Do you know each other?

326
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,510
Ah, he's my son Jae Hee's friend.

327
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,840
Really? That's surprising!

328
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,950
Do you know Jae Hee? How do you know him?

329
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,050
- Mr. Woo is renting a room from our place! 
 - What?

330
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,660
- The place where Jae Hee's renting a room is your place? 
 - Yes.

331
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,150
- Also, he's my sister's boyfriend. 
 - What?

332
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,760
Wait, what does it mean he's her sister's boyfriend?

333
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,260
Is Hae Deun the younger sister of my mom's found biological daughter, Lee Bit Chae Woon?

334
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,830
What is this? What is going on?

335
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,480
What is it?

336
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,720
- Hae Deun! 
 - What's wrong?

337
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,470
- I just realized something more surprising right now. 
 - What is it?

338
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,910
- Eems hyung, did you recover your memory? 
 - What is 'Eems hyung?'

339
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,200
Yes, uncle.

340
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,800
I couldn't tell you in time.

341
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,020
- What! 
 - I asked you what is 'Eems hyung?'

342
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,670
I'll tell you what happened in the past later. Just wait for now.

343
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:29,760
- James, I'm really surprised! Congratulations! I'm happy for you! 
 - Thank you, young daughter.

344
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:36,970
Eems hyung! I'm really happy that you recovered your memory! I knew you would recover!

345
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,710
I'm really sorry, but I want to talk with Jae Hee's father in private for a minute.

346
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,980
- Can you talk with me for a second? 
 - Sure.

347
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,340
I'm sorry.

348
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:53,300
So, you came back from London a while ago.

349
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,190
And the CEO doesn't know about this?

350
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,550
No, but Seo Ah knows that I'm here.

351
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,060
Jae Hee also knows about this as well.

352
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:07,060
I think you should tell the CEO. Your mother went through a lot these days.

353
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,000
Yes, I want to tell her, too.

354
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:15,420
But I feel bad that I didn't accomplish anything even when I got to go to London.

355
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,590
You don't have to accomplish something.

356
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,510
If you accomplished or not, you're her precious son.

357
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,680
She must think like that, too.

358
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,920
So tell her as soon as possible. This is not right.

359
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,910
Yes, I'll do that.

360
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,340
By the way...

361
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,360
Can you keep in secret that my mother is the CEO of the LX company to them?

362
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,760
Sure. I won't tell them about that.

363
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,480
Aunt!

364
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,960
Oh! James, you're back!

365
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,360
- Have you been alright? 
 - Yes, it's the same.

366
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,750
This is Hae Deun's new boss.

367
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,380
Hae Deun got hired today.

368
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,470
What's that?

369
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,860
Hae Deun got scammed a lot, so I wonder if she got hired in a sketchy place.

370
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,350
I can hear you!

371
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,370
- Oh, you heard me. I'm sorry! 
 - I heard everything!

372
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,390
- Oh, no! 
 - I'm not a sketchy person.

373
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,860
I run an online clothing store.

374
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,660
Oh, and this is Hae Deun's aunt.

375
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,110
You're Hae Deun's aunt! Nice to meet you. I'm Jang Joon Ah.

376
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,790
I'm Jae Hee's friend.

377
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,470
- Oh, is that so! 
 - He's not a sketchy guy. He's pretty trustworthy.

378
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,710
Of course! If he's Mr. Woo's friend, then he's trustworthy.

379
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,900
He's very handsome as well!

380
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,730
Why don't you go inside, aunt? Hae Deun is in there.

381
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,260
Hwak Se is there, too.

382
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,920
Oh, yes? I should go home.

383
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,110
- Why don't you go inside? 
 - No, no.

384
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,140
- You should go inside! 
 - Why do I have to?

385
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,690
- Come inside! 
 - Ah, yes!

386
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,710
There's aunt, and there's uncle, what a big family!

387
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,430
- There's a customer! 
 - Auntie!

388
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,490
Have a seat here!

389
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,850
- Is it okay for me to join you guys? 
 - Of course!

390
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,290
Hey, I heard you got a job! An online clothing store? What are you doing there?

391
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:16,560
I work as a model and do the styling. I make money, and it's fun!

392
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,440
Is that so? Thank you so much!

393
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,890
- Are you guys having a company get-together? I should pay for this! 
 - Yes!

394
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,200
  It's great! Have a drink, have a drink!  

395
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,010
We should have soju! Do you like soju?

396
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,260
- I only drink soju. 
 - Really? You're going to get along with me well!

397
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,960
- Should I get you a bottle of soju? 
 - Yes, please!

398
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,420
Mom!

399
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,040
What are you working on?

400
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,860
I'm working on new product development.

401
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,290
I have a presentation next week.

402
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,570
- Then, I shouldn't see that. 
 - That's right.

403
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,060
- I want to see it! Show it to me! 
 - I can't do that!

404
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,680
This is an old one, isn't it?

405
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:22,680
Yes. I had this since I was young, so it feels wrong if I don't have this.

406
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,930
You stitched this recently!

407
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,540
It got so old, so it fell off today, but somebody sewed it for me.

408
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,410
- They did a great job! 
 - Right?

409
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,040
A man did this for me, and he was good at sewing.

410
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,160
A man? There's someone besides Jae Hee?

411
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,640
No. He's someone who works at Jae Hee's construction site.

412
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:50,060
That's right. Let's have dinner together with the Samgwang villa family.

413
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:56,580
It has been a while since you come here, but we haven't had a chance to have a formal get-together with both families.

414
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:00,800
- Then, I'll ask my mom. 
 - No, don't tell her in advance.

415
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,240
If you tell her, she's going to prepare a lot of things.

416
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,090
So let's make a surprise announcement.

417
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,960
Let's gather at our place or a restaurant.

418
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,940
- How does that sound? 
 - I like it.

419
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,410
- Let's make a surprise announcement! 
 - Yes, a surprise announcement!

420
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,570
Young lady!

421
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,760
Seo Ah, are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?

422
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,620
Mom, were you at Bit Chae Woon's room?

423
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,590
Yes.

424
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:40,360
I thought you were in the study room, so I was bringing this to you, but I got dizzy.

425
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,940
What's wrong with you? Is your anemia got worse again?

426
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,960
I don't know.

427
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,260
Let's go into your room, and you should lay down.

428
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,210
  What's wrong with you again?  

429
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,860
Ah, I drank too fast.

430
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,160
By the way, your brother is so handsome!

431
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:20,360
Right? My siblings are all good-looking.

432
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,440
Hey! Why didn't you call my roommate Ba Reun? Tell her to come out!

433
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:29,130
B-Ba Reun is coming home late tonight because she's busy with her part-time work.

434
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:34,030
  Cha Ba Reun is such a queen of part-time work! She's very put it together.  

435
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:37,320
I think aunt drank too much.

436
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,860
Aunt, I think you're drinking too much tonight.

437
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,860
Why do you care about it? Do we have any relationship to care about my drinking?

438
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,040
I mean, you said your stomach isn't feeling great these days.

439
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:58,510
- Oh! Why are you taking care of the aunt suddenly, uncle? 
 - I know.

440
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,720
I don't know why he's taking care of me when we don't have any relationship.

441
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,440
Why do you care if my stomach is not feeling well or there's a hole in my stomach?

442
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:11,860
- We're feeling great today! Today's a happy day! Our Hae Deun got-- 
 - A  job!

443
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,060
It's amazing!

444
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,560
If you are an aunt and uncle, then are you in-laws?

445
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:21,010
  No, no, no.  

446
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,200
We don't have any kind of relationship.

447
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:33,320
Let's have another round of shots!

448
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,250
  - Why are you keep just drinking beer?   
 - Joon Ah!

449
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,600
- You shouldn't drink too much. 
 - Ah, Jae Hee's father!

450
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,320
Do you remember what we talked about it before?

451
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,980
- Have a safe trip back home later. 
 - Yes, sir!

452
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,360
Mr. Eems! Congratulations on your memory recovery.

453
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,680
- Thank you, aunt. 
 - Your welcome.

454
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,210
- Don't drink too much. 
 - Congratulations!

455
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,020
- Congratulations! 
 - Thank you, thank you.

456
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,120
- Hae Deun, Ra Hoon, see you later. Have a seat! 
 - Goodbye! Good night!

457
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,210
I hope to see you every day!

458
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,760
- Let's do cheers again! 
 - Yes, cheers!

459
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,460
Uncle.

460
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,610
I'll get off from work now.

461
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:36,050
Oh, Eems hyung, are you leaving now? You must be lonely to be at home by yourself.

462
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,850
I should get used to that.

463
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,080
- I'll go home now. 
 - Yes, Eems hyung. Thank you for your hard work.

464
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,570
Hwak Se!

465
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,970
Do you want to come to my place and eat ramen together?

466
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,520
Kim Hwak Se already got off from work?

467
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,820
Yes, he just left.

468
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,560
- Are you drunk? 
 - Hyung!

469
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,410
  That sounds painful! Are you okay?  

470
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,860
- Hello? 
 - Hyung, wake up!

471
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,760
  - Put yourself together! 
 - How much is it?  

472
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:23,580
  We already paid for it.  

473
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,970
What should we do?

474
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,780
- Wake up! 
 - You shouldn't sleep here!

475
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,140
- Auntie, help with this! 
 - Auntie, please!

476
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,210
Aunt, let's have another drink! Let me go!

477
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,150
Kim Hwak Se, really...

478
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,650
- What's going on? 
 - Cha Ba Reun, are you coming home now? Hold on to this.

479
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,670
It hurts!

480
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,070
- By the way, who is this? 
   - He's my company's CEO.  

481
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,110
CEO?

482
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,260
Give me some freedom.

483
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,170
- Mr. Makjang! 
   - Oh, no!  

484
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,206
Mr. Makjang!

485
00:34:58,206 --> 00:35:00,117
Is he Mr. Woo's friend?

486
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:04,157
I smell fermented beans from him.

487
00:35:04,177 --> 00:35:06,257
He's also Hae Deun's boss.

488
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:08,347
Mom, I heard you know that Hae Deun got a job.

489
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:12,987
Oh, right! I talked on the phone with her earlier today! Congratulations!

490
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:14,567
Thank you, mom!

491
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:18,657
Ms. Lee! It's so hard for us to hold on to him. Can we put him down somewhere?

492
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:21,457
Yes, yes. But where should we put him?

493
00:35:21,457 --> 00:35:24,357
He's Jae Hee's friend, so should we put him in Jae Hee's room?

494
00:35:24,427 --> 00:35:26,527
Be careful! Oh, no!

495
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:28,497
- This is terrible. 
 - We'll go upstairs.

496
00:35:28,547 --> 00:35:30,907
Be careful!

497
00:35:33,857 --> 00:35:36,357
What is going on tonight?

498
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:42,017
Yes, uncle!

499
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:44,957
  At James's place?  

500
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,567
  Oh, you're going to stay over at his home?  

501
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:53,557
Oh. Yes, okay, I got it.

502
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:59,397
Is Hwak Se not coming home tonight?

503
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:05,147
Yes! He went to James's place together after work, and he's going to stay over at James's house.

504
00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:09,257
I think James is a bit lonely.

505
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:11,757
He must be the one who's lonely.

506
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:13,387
What's that?

507
00:36:13,747 --> 00:36:15,187
Nothing.

508
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:18,977
- I'm going. 
 - Yes, go upstairs and have some rest!

509
00:36:20,157 --> 00:36:24,857
- Come in, Hwak Se. Come on in! 
 - Yes... Wow!

510
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:28,987
Wow, I never saw a house like this...

511
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:33,157
Your house is...Oh!

512
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,857
  Be careful!  

513
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:39,127
Wow! Wait, wait a second.

514
00:36:39,137 --> 00:36:41,557
It's right! You're in that picture!

515
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:46,577
Mr. Woo is in there, too! It's so good to see his face here.

516
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:54,637
Eems hyung, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were this kind of person and made you do delivery before.

517
00:36:54,657 --> 00:36:58,157
Don't feel distant from me. I'll be sad if you do so.

518
00:36:58,297 --> 00:37:02,117
Just treat me the same as before. Will you?

519
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:07,837
That's why I didn't tell you right away that I recovered my memory.

520
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:12,157
- Will you? 
 - Yes, yes. Sure.

521
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:14,177
But wow! What is all this?

522
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:19,977
Why is Mr. Woo left the house that's like a palace and live in Samgwang villa?

523
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:28,057
Ah, Jae Hee's very independent since he was young.

524
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:32,337
It's because he's very independent. He can leave this house because he's independent.

525
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:35,667
Wow! I can't understand that at all!

526
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:43,007
Wow, what is this? Hyungnim, I think this is natural leather!

527
00:37:43,017 --> 00:37:46,137
Wow! My goodness, hyungnim!

528
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:55,287
So my feeling was right.

529
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:59,757
That you and the aunt are in a good relationship.

530
00:38:01,257 --> 00:38:05,967
Well, you have very sharp eyes.

531
00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:13,727
But then, why do you look so worried?

532
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:16,697
If you met a good person, it's time for you to be happy.

533
00:38:18,107 --> 00:38:22,447
Yes, I have to be happy.

534
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:30,207
But I feel like I'm looking up at a tree that I shouldn't look up.

535
00:38:30,987 --> 00:38:39,177
In my situation right now, I feel sorry to like an incredible woman like her...

536
00:38:41,877 --> 00:38:44,017
Why do you think that way?

537
00:38:45,017 --> 00:38:50,967
Ah, because she's a doctor, and you're not?

538
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:56,747
But she likes you. Isn't that all it takes?

539
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:04,007
That's what I thought, too.

540
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:12,997
If Soon Jung noonim knew about this, what would she think?

541
00:39:15,207 --> 00:39:20,337
She worked so hard to support her sister,

542
00:39:20,347 --> 00:39:24,037
and if Man Jung says she likes something like me...

543
00:39:27,457 --> 00:39:33,757
I also worked so hard to support all of my younger siblings.

544
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:38,757
I don't think Soon Jung will think like that.

545
00:39:38,857 --> 00:39:44,357
To her, you are like a brother, too.

546
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:47,597
Do you think so?

547
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:54,557
Oh? Wait a minute.

548
00:39:55,457 --> 00:39:58,457
Did you just call her, "Soon Jung?"

549
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:07,547
Ah! That's right! I think I heard from Mr. Woo that you two knew each other.

550
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:09,857
It's just like...

551
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:13,357
Why are you so shy? Wait a minute.

552
00:40:13,627 --> 00:40:16,627
Is she your first love?

553
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:22,757
Don't say nonsense! We all lived together in the same neighborhood.

554
00:40:28,757 --> 00:40:30,557
Why are you making that sound!

555
00:40:30,657 --> 00:40:34,157
- "Why are you making that sound!" 
 - Your phone is ringing.

556
00:40:34,187 --> 00:40:36,647
     

557
00:40:44,187 --> 00:40:45,747
It's from the jokbal place.

558
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:53,157
  The person you're trying to reach is not available...  

559
00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:54,657
Ah, really...

560
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:59,407
Why are you not picking up the phone?

561
00:41:03,957 --> 00:41:07,657
  Hwak Se, are you going to be like this? You got off from work without telling me.  

562
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,597
  And now you're not even coming home tonight?   

563
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:13,867
  If you have something on your mind, you should tell me straight...  

564
00:41:18,897 --> 00:41:23,777
  I need to know my place.  

565
00:41:31,457 --> 00:41:37,657
What do you want me to do! You're really...

566
00:41:39,357 --> 00:41:41,947
Is the father doing part-time work at the jokbal place?

567
00:41:41,947 --> 00:41:43,517
You didn't go there?

568
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:46,517
I just passed there, because I didn't know about this.

569
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:48,347
You should've told me before.

570
00:41:48,937 --> 00:41:52,167
Even though you are busy, you should take more care of your father.

571
00:41:52,187 --> 00:41:57,867
Everybody in his company thinks something's wrong because he got soft all of a sudden.

572
00:41:57,887 --> 00:41:59,467
Is that so?

573
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:03,997
Wow, I guess he really did change.

574
00:42:04,007 --> 00:42:07,747
I'll take more care of him. Don't worry, and have some rest.

575
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:09,817
Okay.

576
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:29,157
Maybe my father is lonely because he's by himself at home.

577
00:42:29,977 --> 00:42:31,787
What the--

578
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:40,107
Father-- I guess he came here.

579
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:43,727
I guess you missed Yoo Jae Hee.

580
00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:47,867
I guess you fell asleep first because you felt embarrassed.

581
00:42:48,757 --> 00:42:52,857
Father, you should sleep with your socks off.

582
00:42:53,087 --> 00:42:55,657
Aigo, these socks.

583
00:42:57,557 --> 00:43:02,157
Why are his legs so thick? Does he work out these days?

584
00:43:02,227 --> 00:43:05,337
Excuse me... James?

585
00:43:05,577 --> 00:43:06,927
James!

586
00:43:06,947 --> 00:43:09,387
It's noisy! I said it's loud.

587
00:43:09,457 --> 00:43:12,657
You are so rude. I'm sleeping here, and you're being rude.

588
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,157
Hey! J-Joon Ah..!

589
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:17,777
Why are you here? Hey, Jang Joon Ah!

590
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:20,517
- Joon Ah! Joon Ah! 
 - Stop calling me.

591
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:24,057
Who are you? I said, stop calling me!

592
00:43:24,117 --> 00:43:26,177
It's Woo Jae Hee!

593
00:43:26,227 --> 00:43:29,087
Woo Jae Hee, why are you at my place?

594
00:43:29,597 --> 00:43:33,677
This is my place-- What are you doing here?

595
00:43:33,717 --> 00:43:36,587
You're very drunk!

596
00:43:36,627 --> 00:43:39,747
He's totally wasted! Joon Ah, wake up. Joon Ah!

597
00:43:39,777 --> 00:43:41,117
Joon Ah, wake up!

598
00:43:41,157 --> 00:43:43,257
Oh, Mr. Woo! You're home.

599
00:43:44,377 --> 00:43:47,067
I heard he's your friend.

600
00:43:47,857 --> 00:43:51,257
That's right, but why is he here?

601
00:43:51,617 --> 00:43:54,517
It's a bit long to explain it to you.

602
00:43:55,497 --> 00:43:56,277
I mean...

603
00:43:56,277 --> 00:43:59,027
Seo Ah's brother is there right now?

604
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:04,477
Yes. Joon Ah's not good at alcohol, and I think he drank too much today.

605
00:44:04,487 --> 00:44:06,177
Apparently, they had a fun time.

606
00:44:06,207 --> 00:44:09,777
It's funny that Hae Deun got a job at Joon Ah's company.

607
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:11,817
I know.

608
00:44:11,847 --> 00:44:16,317
Hae Deun told me that he just said he's my friend.

609
00:44:16,357 --> 00:44:18,457
He didn't say he's the son of the CEO.

610
00:44:18,457 --> 00:44:21,357
I guess he thought it's overwhelming to share for now.

611
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:23,757
I guess so.

612
00:44:24,277 --> 00:44:26,277
Wait a minute.

613
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:32,587
Then, is Joon Ah becoming your oppa?

614
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:35,527
Ah, I think so.

615
00:44:35,537 --> 00:44:38,547
Then do I have to call him oppa later on?

616
00:44:38,557 --> 00:44:43,747
What is that? I haven't heard you calling me oppa yet.

617
00:44:44,237 --> 00:44:46,567
This oppa and that oppa is different!

618
00:44:46,587 --> 00:44:48,227
But still!

619
00:44:48,957 --> 00:44:53,797
I wanted to be called as oppa by my girlfriend.

620
00:44:54,757 --> 00:44:55,737
I get it.

621
00:44:55,757 --> 00:44:58,857
  Koala oppa! I'll call you in a mix of those from now on.  

622
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:01,807
That's not what I wanted! Drop the Koala.

623
00:45:02,237 --> 00:45:05,657
Then, what? I'm going to call you Ala oppa!

624
00:45:06,467 --> 00:45:08,597
  Ah, by the way, I'm going to invite  

625
00:45:08,597 --> 00:45:10,587
my mom and my siblings to this place.

626
00:45:10,657 --> 00:45:14,857
Mom over here, I mean the CEO said we should do that.

627
00:45:14,887 --> 00:45:16,707
That's great.

628
00:45:17,157 --> 00:45:21,707
By the way, did you decided to call her your mother now?

629
00:45:21,737 --> 00:45:25,727
Yes. It's still awkward, but I'm going to call her that way.

630
00:45:26,337 --> 00:45:29,397
That's great. You made a great choice, Moong-i!

631
00:45:29,457 --> 00:45:32,357
Moong-i? Who's Moong-i?

632
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:36,177
Moong-i's so rude when a person is sleeping!

633
00:45:36,257 --> 00:45:38,757
Who's Moong-i? Moong-i?

634
00:45:38,857 --> 00:45:40,657
Be quiet!

635
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:45,507
I'm sorry. He was drunk talking.

636
00:45:45,557 --> 00:45:52,557
♫   My weary heart melts away.   ♫

637
00:45:52,617 --> 00:46:04,517
♫   You, the one who cares for me without any reason, you're my one love.   ♫

638
00:46:04,527 --> 00:46:12,807
♫   Meeting like a fate, and stopped time.   ♫

639
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:18,787
♫   I knew it was all.    ♫

640
00:46:18,857 --> 00:46:22,657
♫   I'm in love, I'm in love    ♫

641
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:33,057
♫   I guess love changes everything.   ♫

642
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:46,957
♫   You make me fill up my whole day with the thoughts of you.   ♫

643
00:46:46,977 --> 00:46:48,937
♫   With you   ♫

644
00:46:48,937 --> 00:46:51,397
Jae Hee's mom?

645
00:46:54,057 --> 00:47:00,157
♫   With you   ♫

646
00:47:01,097 --> 00:47:02,747
Eems hyung!

647
00:47:02,767 --> 00:47:05,047
Good morning!

648
00:47:05,457 --> 00:47:08,557
Yes, uncle. Did you sleep okay?

649
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:13,767
What is all this?

650
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:16,537
Here!

651
00:47:20,427 --> 00:47:26,327
I thought you weren't able to eat a decent breakfast, so I went out early in the morning to get some groceries.

652
00:47:26,337 --> 00:47:32,087
I saw the inside of the fridge, and it was completely empty!

653
00:47:32,107 --> 00:47:36,537
Wow, you made soybean stew!

654
00:47:36,547 --> 00:47:40,157
I was looking at you like this,

655
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:43,977
and I think your meal, your cooking is the biggest problem!

656
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:47,337
There's a limit to buying food if you have to do that every day.

657
00:47:47,357 --> 00:47:52,267
I think it's a good idea for you to learn how to cook!

658
00:47:54,197 --> 00:47:56,807
Do you think I can cook?

659
00:47:56,827 --> 00:48:01,627
Of course! When I saw you working at the jokbal place, I think you have a talent for it!

660
00:48:01,657 --> 00:48:05,237
I can help you a little bit.

661
00:48:07,457 --> 00:48:09,687
Look at you, liking the idea!

662
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:11,457
- Let's eat, let's eat. 
 - Yes.

663
00:48:11,557 --> 00:48:13,457
It looks amazing!

664
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:18,607
Eems hyung, there's rolled omelet, too!

665
00:48:22,607 --> 00:48:24,277
- It's so good! 
 - Is it good?

666
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:26,637
- Isn't it hot? 
 - Hwak Se!

667
00:48:29,567 --> 00:48:32,247
My rolled omelet is really good.

668
00:48:32,337 --> 00:48:34,377
Is that so?

669
00:48:34,617 --> 00:48:40,627
So, I know it's a bit sudden, but I wondered if today works for you.

670
00:48:40,657 --> 00:48:43,547
I want to have dinner with you tonight.

671
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:48,757
Yes, of course. Today works for me.

672
00:48:48,797 --> 00:48:51,777
I think my kids will have time tonight as well.

673
00:48:51,797 --> 00:48:55,967
Then, I'll invite you to come over to our place.

674
00:48:55,997 --> 00:48:59,027
I knew you were going to say that!

675
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:03,707
If I told you in advance, I knew you would prepare everything, so that's why I asked you so suddenly.

676
00:49:03,717 --> 00:49:07,947
This time, let's have it at my place. I already asked people to prepare everything.

677
00:49:07,957 --> 00:49:10,677
It's okay to do it at our place.

678
00:49:10,717 --> 00:49:13,787
Then, let's gather at your place next time.

679
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:18,747
Next time, you prepare everything, and this time it's at our place. Okay?

680
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:20,557
Sure.

681
00:49:21,357 --> 00:49:22,757
Yes, mom.

682
00:49:23,597 --> 00:49:27,007
Dinner? At the CEO's house?

683
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,577
Are we going to the CEO Kim Jung Won's place?

684
00:49:30,617 --> 00:49:33,257
  - Of course, it works for me! I'll be there soon.   
 - My family house?

685
00:49:33,277 --> 00:49:36,307
I'll tell Ra Hoon. Okay!

686
00:49:37,547 --> 00:49:40,287
Mr. Makjang, I have to get off from work a bit early today.

687
00:49:40,317 --> 00:49:42,707
How can you just get off from work earlier?

688
00:49:42,757 --> 00:49:44,457
Something important has come up.

689
00:49:44,477 --> 00:49:48,187
I got invited to the house that I wanted to visit again!

690
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:53,787
There are so many works to do! And you just joined the company. What a weird person you are!

691
00:49:53,807 --> 00:49:57,957
Mr. Makjang, you stayed over at our place last night.

692
00:49:57,977 --> 00:49:59,857
Also, you ran away in the middle of the night.

693
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:03,867
I ran away because I was embarrassed!

694
00:50:03,887 --> 00:50:08,867
My mom was worried about you so much because you went away without having breakfast.

695
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:11,187
Did your mother worry about me a lot?

696
00:50:11,197 --> 00:50:14,357
Yes! So I'm leaving work early today.

697
00:50:14,457 --> 00:50:17,657
Yes, you can go home. What? What are you talking about it?

698
00:50:17,697 --> 00:50:22,467
Your mother worrying about me and you get off from work early today has no relation.

699
00:50:22,557 --> 00:50:24,657
Now I think about it, and it has a relation.

700
00:50:24,757 --> 00:50:27,357
- You can go home now. 
 - Right? I'll get going!

701
00:50:29,217 --> 00:50:32,407
She used me again.

702
00:50:32,437 --> 00:50:35,377
Let's just take a break today.

703
00:50:37,797 --> 00:50:43,777
CEO! Is there anything I can get ready before the Samgwang villa family comes over?

704
00:50:43,797 --> 00:50:47,037
There's nothing. Ms. Jo is preparing for everything.

705
00:50:48,177 --> 00:50:49,827
Director Jang.

706
00:50:51,117 --> 00:50:54,447
Thank you so much for taking care of today's gathering.

707
00:50:54,477 --> 00:50:56,787
It's nothing, mom.

708
00:50:57,107 --> 00:51:04,207
I never had a chance to formally got introduced to them, so I think it's a great idea that you made today's gathering.

709
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,637
Yes.

710
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:09,777
I hope both families have a great time together today.

711
00:51:09,777 --> 00:51:12,877
Yes, it will be.

712
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:17,377
I think so.

713
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:47,837
    
   

714
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:52,457
     

715
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,787
     

716
00:51:59,147 --> 00:52:02,457
  Yes, mom! Did you get a call from the CEO?  

717
00:52:05,377 --> 00:52:07,417
Don't be nervous!

718
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:11,547
Yes. I think you can wear something comfortable.

719
00:52:11,567 --> 00:52:14,217
Or you can ask what to wear to Hae Deun.

720
00:52:19,627 --> 00:52:21,147
  Okay!  

721
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:26,077
     

722
00:52:43,057 --> 00:52:45,257
Oh, Bit Chae Woon!

723
00:52:45,717 --> 00:52:49,387
Let's go to the Samgwang villa together later.

724
00:52:49,387 --> 00:52:50,987
- Together? 
 - Yes!

725
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:54,577
I was just going to send a car, but let's go there together and escort them.

726
00:52:54,657 --> 00:52:56,157
Ah...

727
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:59,747
Oh, it's our director Jang's idea.

728
00:53:00,217 --> 00:53:01,647
Oh, yes.

729
00:53:01,687 --> 00:53:05,227
You should go there and escort your mom and your siblings.

730
00:53:05,237 --> 00:53:07,397
I'll be at home and get ready for dinner.

731
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:09,487
Thank you.

732
00:53:20,257 --> 00:53:23,027
Mom, isn't this one better?

733
00:53:23,037 --> 00:53:24,347
You said this one is better!

734
00:53:24,457 --> 00:53:28,257
Right. But I think this one might be better.

735
00:53:28,847 --> 00:53:31,477
Is it?

736
00:53:32,757 --> 00:53:35,057
Hae Deun.

737
00:53:35,557 --> 00:53:37,937
You're the stylist!

738
00:53:37,937 --> 00:53:42,657
You said customers love your styling, and why do you have a hard time to choose for me?

739
00:53:42,707 --> 00:53:46,797
I know. It's hard for me to choose for you because I'm nervous.

740
00:53:46,817 --> 00:53:49,077
- There's nothing to be nervous about!  
 - Try this one on.

741
00:53:49,087 --> 00:53:50,867
Should I try that one on?

742
00:53:51,377 --> 00:53:53,277
I think this will make you look brighter.

743
00:53:53,357 --> 00:53:58,457
I guess it looks prettier because it's brighter. Let's see.

744
00:53:59,107 --> 00:54:00,567
Oh! It's very pretty!

745
00:54:00,567 --> 00:54:02,077
- Does it look okay? 
 - Yes, this is it.

746
00:54:09,077 --> 00:54:10,717
Does it look too dark?

747
00:54:11,757 --> 00:54:13,957
You look cuter in brown.

748
00:54:15,677 --> 00:54:17,417
- Really? 
 - Yes.

749
00:54:17,457 --> 00:54:19,577
You look more handsome in brown color.

750
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:24,257
Try this one.

751
00:54:26,937 --> 00:54:29,317
Then should I wear this one today?

752
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:39,627
Mom!

753
00:54:39,657 --> 00:54:43,057
- Soon Jung! I'm here. 
 - You're here.

754
00:54:43,157 --> 00:54:46,057
- Hello, CEO! 
 - Hello, Hae Deun.

755
00:54:46,137 --> 00:54:48,737
We could've just come by ourselves.

756
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:52,507
How can we let you do that? We are going to escort you on a full course.

757
00:54:54,737 --> 00:54:56,417
Hello, CEO!

758
00:54:56,447 --> 00:54:58,647
I haven't seen you in a while, Ra Hoon!

759
00:54:58,657 --> 00:55:00,887
Oh! You look awesome today.

760
00:55:00,957 --> 00:55:02,857
Thank you for inviting us today.

761
00:55:02,957 --> 00:55:05,857
We should've done this a long time ago.

762
00:55:05,957 --> 00:55:09,957
- Did you wash your feet cleanly? 
 - I washed it a hundred times.

763
00:55:11,177 --> 00:55:13,627
You smell fine today.

764
00:55:14,497 --> 00:55:17,287
- Hello! 
 - Yes, good to see you again!

765
00:55:17,297 --> 00:55:21,217
- Where's Man Jung? 
 - She has an evening shift today.

766
00:55:21,227 --> 00:55:24,417
Oh, really? Then tell her to come to my place after work.

767
00:55:24,427 --> 00:55:26,577
Yes. I'll call her.

768
00:55:49,677 --> 00:55:51,697
Hello.

769
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:58,357
Yes. I shouldn't be angry at him at all today.

770
00:55:59,797 --> 00:56:02,527
And keep smiling for him.

771
00:56:05,257 --> 00:56:06,987
Yes?

772
00:56:10,057 --> 00:56:12,357
Father!

773
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:14,507
Why are you here?

774
00:56:14,547 --> 00:56:17,697
Did you have a fun time last night with Hwak Se?

775
00:56:17,757 --> 00:56:20,857
I heard you invited him to the house.

776
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:24,257
Did you see Joon Ah? He came to the jokbal place yesterday.

777
00:56:24,257 --> 00:56:27,787
Ah, yes. He was totally wasted and crashed on my bed last night.

778
00:56:27,807 --> 00:56:32,267
- He didn't even tell his family that he's here! 
 - I know.

779
00:56:32,287 --> 00:56:35,667
By the way, why did you come here?

780
00:56:36,077 --> 00:56:39,147
I was just around the neighborhood.

781
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:42,107
Your mom said you should check on me because I'm acting weird?

782
00:56:42,137 --> 00:56:43,827
My goodness, father.

783
00:56:43,827 --> 00:56:48,847
- Do you think mom is always thinking about you? That's very narcissistic. 
 - Are you saying that, too!

784
00:56:48,857 --> 00:56:50,057
You surprised me...

785
00:56:50,067 --> 00:56:52,747
Why? Did someone else say you're narcissistic as well?

786
00:56:52,797 --> 00:56:56,957
Ah, it's my mom. She's the only person who's going to say that to you.

787
00:56:56,987 --> 00:56:59,537
No, it's nothing.

788
00:57:00,037 --> 00:57:04,487
Oh! Are you wearing a shirt that you were wearing when you were James?

789
00:57:04,517 --> 00:57:06,977
- No! What are you talking about it! 
 - Let me see it!

790
00:57:07,017 --> 00:57:12,727
- I haven't seen that shirt in a while! 
 - Stop it! It's ticklish!

791
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:17,107
I said it's ticklish! If you don't have anything to talk about, then go!

792
00:57:17,147 --> 00:57:22,097
- No! I'm going to have dinner with you tonight. 
 - What?

793
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:29,467
President Park Jong Bum? It's an important call, so be quiet.

794
00:57:29,497 --> 00:57:31,557
Yes, president Park!

795
00:57:35,097 --> 00:57:38,207
What? There's a photo of Jae Hee?

796
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,377
When did this photo get taken?

797
00:57:43,387 --> 00:57:46,047
Somebody sent this to him anonymously.

798
00:57:46,077 --> 00:57:49,047
With a comment saying the CEO Kim Jung Won has a hidden daughter.

799
00:57:49,577 --> 00:57:51,097
Who else got this?

800
00:57:51,187 --> 00:57:56,997
A couple of important board members. That's why some are suggesting holding an emergency board meeting.

801
00:57:57,117 --> 00:58:02,557
Anyway, I think three of them are going to CEO Kim's place right now.

802
00:58:02,867 --> 00:58:04,817
Today?

803
00:58:06,017 --> 00:58:10,517
  I guess we can't see each other today. We are having both families gathering at our place.  

804
00:58:10,527 --> 00:58:12,547
Today's not a good day.

805
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:14,567
What?

806
00:58:17,257 --> 00:58:20,747
Uncle, did you get such an email?

807
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:25,767
  I thought your mother wouldn't tell me the truth even if I asked her.  

808
00:58:26,557 --> 00:58:29,357
Ah, well...

809
00:58:32,047 --> 00:58:36,417
- Young lady, CEO is coming in. 
 - Okay.

810
00:58:38,657 --> 00:58:41,377
Come in, Soon Jung.

811
00:58:41,457 --> 00:58:45,157
- Hello. 
 - Hello!

812
00:58:49,457 --> 00:58:52,557
- Oh, Seo Ah! 
 - Ma'am, you are here!

813
00:58:52,657 --> 00:58:56,957
- Yes. Have you been well, Seo Ah? 
 - Yes.

814
00:58:57,057 --> 00:59:01,057
- Nice to meet you all. Welcome. 
 - Yes.

815
00:59:01,177 --> 00:59:04,347
Why don't we sit over here?

816
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:11,047
I was in a hurry so I couldn't prepare anything, so I brought some tea from home.

817
00:59:11,067 --> 00:59:13,347
She made all of these. It's delicious.

818
00:59:13,347 --> 00:59:17,877
Look at this! Your mom is always like this.

819
00:59:17,877 --> 00:59:20,707
  Even if I invite her unexpectedly, she prepares something to bring.  

820
00:59:20,707 --> 00:59:23,437
  Let's come over here and sit comfortably.  

821
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:25,697
- Yes. 
 - We'll get ready for the tea.

822
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:41,717
- Hey, why are you guys so quiet? 
 - We're not like that!

823
00:59:41,727 --> 00:59:45,567
Chae Woon must be happy since you have younger siblings.

824
00:59:45,577 --> 00:59:48,957
I always wanted to have younger siblings.

825
00:59:51,107 --> 00:59:58,037
Now think of Ra Hoon and Hae Deun as your siblings and stay close with them!

826
00:59:59,257 --> 01:00:02,657
Ah, I should do that!

827
01:00:04,607 --> 01:00:08,307
  Why is that rude little bastard so kind to us today?  

828
01:00:08,537 --> 01:00:11,277
  I know. It makes me feel anxious.  

829
01:00:16,757 --> 01:00:18,557
  The person you're trying to reach is unavailable...  

830
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:21,167
Why is she not picking up her phone?

831
01:00:35,947 --> 01:00:38,387
- It's okay. 
 - Have a seat, Soon Jung.

832
01:00:39,407 --> 01:00:41,797
I'll do it, mom.

833
01:00:45,557 --> 01:00:49,157
Wow! The teacups are very pretty! Aren't they, mom?

834
01:00:49,197 --> 01:00:51,137
Yes, they are.

835
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:53,247
  Please, have some tea.  

836
01:01:02,137 --> 01:01:04,277
Who is it, Ms. Jo?

837
01:01:04,287 --> 01:01:06,517
Oh, it's...

838
01:01:13,787 --> 01:01:15,677
Is it my uncle?

839
01:01:15,957 --> 01:01:18,107
Director Hong is here, too!

840
01:01:21,757 --> 01:01:23,327
Her uncle?

841
01:01:23,337 --> 01:01:25,067
  What should we do, mom?  

842
01:01:25,087 --> 01:01:27,647
It's okay. I can just say we have guests.

843
01:01:27,897 --> 01:01:31,547
Oh, uncle texted me before.

844
01:01:31,787 --> 01:01:38,087
He received an email with a photo that Bit Chae Woon is your daughter.

845
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:40,967
What?

846
01:01:51,257 --> 01:01:55,957
We can be away for you.

847
01:01:56,067 --> 01:01:58,037
Ra Hoon, Hae Deun, let's go.

848
01:01:58,057 --> 01:01:59,987
No, don't do that, Soon Jung!

849
01:01:59,997 --> 01:02:01,837
I'll just tell them we have guests, so please have a seat.

850
01:02:01,877 --> 01:02:06,037
No, it's okay. We can talk at another time.

851
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:09,987
  - Chae Woon, let's go. 
 - You can follow me!  

852
01:02:10,457 --> 01:02:12,957
Hurry up.

853
01:02:20,507 --> 01:02:22,187
Have a seat.

854
01:02:23,257 --> 01:02:27,257
Executive director Jang, why did you come here all of a sudden?

855
01:02:27,867 --> 01:02:31,267
Seo Ah, didn't you tell your mother about this?

856
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:36,277
Sister-in-law.

857
01:02:36,307 --> 01:02:38,797
What is this?

858
01:02:38,837 --> 01:02:42,107
  There was a strange post on the company community board last time,  

859
01:02:42,127 --> 01:02:44,187
  and now, even this kind of thing came up.  

860
01:02:44,407 --> 01:02:50,077
It's so strange. So we know it isn't polite, but we had to come here suddenly.

861
01:03:08,197 --> 01:03:10,977
What is this? Why do we have to hide, mom?

862
01:03:11,017 --> 01:03:12,997
Shush.

863
01:03:15,557 --> 01:03:17,357
Mom.

864
01:03:19,857 --> 01:03:21,757
I'm sorry, mom.

865
01:03:24,257 --> 01:03:26,557
We're fine.

866
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:28,647
Noona, we're totally fine.

867
01:03:28,677 --> 01:03:31,277
  - Tell me about this, CEO.   
 - Huh?

868
01:03:31,587 --> 01:03:34,027
I think they're talking about you, unni.

869
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,707
Sister-in-law.

870
01:03:39,727 --> 01:03:41,907
Please be honest now.

871
01:03:42,357 --> 01:03:48,027
Is it real that you have a hidden daughter?

872
01:03:54,337 --> 01:03:56,897
Just tell us honestly, CEO.

873
01:03:56,937 --> 01:04:00,787
This kind of matter can't be hidden.

874
01:04:04,297 --> 01:04:06,397
This kid is...

875
01:04:10,357 --> 01:04:12,457
Chae Woon!

876
01:04:22,767 --> 01:04:25,157
Tell us about it, sister-in-law!

877
01:04:29,687 --> 01:04:33,917
This kid is--

878
01:04:34,557 --> 01:04:37,057
Hello!

879
01:04:37,477 --> 01:04:39,407
Chae Woon.

880
01:04:40,217 --> 01:04:43,667
CEO, can I say instead of you?

881
01:04:43,707 --> 01:04:45,977
No, let me talk--

882
01:04:49,917 --> 01:04:52,197
I'm not the CEO's daughter.

883
01:05:05,587 --> 01:05:06,777
I am--

884
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:10,047
- Let me tell you. 
 - No, CEO.

885
01:05:12,647 --> 01:05:15,697
I'm a middle school friend of director Jang Seo Ah.

886
01:05:15,707 --> 01:05:17,977
  Also, I'm an intern in the design team.  

887
01:05:17,977 --> 01:05:22,437
I have some issues, so I've been staying here for a few days.

888
01:05:23,007 --> 01:05:25,337
I'm not the CEO's biological daughter!

889
01:05:25,347 --> 01:05:30,467
I got this misunderstanding before as well, but I hope this doesn't happen again.

890
01:05:31,067 --> 01:05:33,087
Then, forgive me for interrupting.

891
01:05:33,717 --> 01:05:37,917
Seo Ah, I'll be out now.

892
01:05:38,177 --> 01:05:39,637
Okay.

893
01:05:39,657 --> 01:05:42,547
- Chae Woon! 
 - Mom.

894
01:05:44,257 --> 01:05:47,357
I'm sorry to make you in trouble, CEO.

895
01:06:28,857 --> 01:06:30,757
Moong-i!

896
01:06:31,597 --> 01:06:33,337
Koala.

897
01:06:33,357 --> 01:06:35,937
I heard about it.

898
01:06:37,347 --> 01:06:39,277
Are they here?

899
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:49,257
What did they say?

900
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:54,267
They were asking if I'm the daughter,

901
01:06:57,117 --> 01:06:59,647
so I said no.

902
01:07:02,467 --> 01:07:05,437
I said I'm not the daughter of the CEO Kim Jung Won.

903
01:07:07,767 --> 01:07:10,757
My mom is in there

904
01:07:11,357 --> 01:07:14,557
and Hae Deun, Ra Hoon, too. All of them probably heard this.

905
01:07:17,277 --> 01:07:20,777
They are hiding without doing anything wrong.

906
01:07:26,467 --> 01:07:28,617
Can you hug me?

907
01:07:28,727 --> 01:07:33,477
♫   I'm barely going through today   ♫

908
01:07:33,557 --> 01:07:44,657
♫   When the memories are fading, I stand on the street where we walked together   ♫

909
01:07:44,677 --> 01:07:55,207
♫   I'm trying to erase it again and again, but I can still hear you breathing on my ear   ♫

910
01:07:55,237 --> 01:08:01,027
♫   Did you forget? Did you forget about me?   ♫

911
01:08:01,067 --> 01:08:06,267
♫   I'm still waiting for you   ♫

912
01:08:06,287 --> 01:08:12,257
♫   My love is crying   ♫

913
01:08:12,277 --> 01:08:17,907
♫   My heart is filled with tears   ♫

914
01:08:17,947 --> 01:08:24,327
♫   I'm trying to erase it again and again   ♫

915
01:08:24,357 --> 01:08:30,057
♫   But I keep thinking of your face   ♫

916
01:08:30,057 --> 01:08:31,657
     

917
01:08:31,687 --> 01:08:32,767
  Where's Bit Chae Woon?  

918
01:08:32,807 --> 01:08:34,567
  She said she's going to sleep at that house.   

919
01:08:35,087 --> 01:08:38,077
  Seo Ah, who would be the person who sent the email?  

920
01:08:38,087 --> 01:08:40,227
  Mom, are you suspicious of me?  

921
01:08:40,237 --> 01:08:42,827
  - Did you find Bit Chae Woon's biological father? 
 - What about it?  

922
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,767
  Don't you think the person you're looking for is nearby you?  

923
01:08:46,077 --> 01:08:47,757
  I'm here to see Soon Jung.  

924
01:08:47,777 --> 01:08:49,447
  Then, I'll get going. Bye!  

925
01:08:49,477 --> 01:08:50,507
  Bye.  

926
01:08:50,527 --> 01:08:51,807
  Oh, you forgot this!  

927
01:08:51,807 --> 01:08:54,687
  Soon Jung had this. Why did Jae Hee's mom have this?  

928
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,847
  Oh, no! It's embarrassing!  

929
01:08:56,957 --> 01:08:59,457
  I'm sorry, Soon Jung. I was thinking about my company.  

930
01:08:59,547 --> 01:09:01,457
  It's your selfishness.  

931
01:09:01,477 --> 01:09:04,577
  I'll proceed with the dissolution of adoption as soon as possible.  

932
01:09:04,657 --> 01:09:08,657
  Then I want you to take Chae Woon as your legal daughter.
