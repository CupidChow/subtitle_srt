1
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,240
Excuse me. Are you okay? Excuse me! 
      

2
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,970
- There's a person who collapsed here. 
 - Are you okay? Excuse me!

3
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,960
  Are you okay?  

4
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,720
  Somebody should call 119!  

5
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,740
Seo Yeon! Seo Yeon!

6
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,640
She's my daughter! Can you help me to put her on my back?

7
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,040
Seo Yeon! I'm so sorry...

8
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,490
I'm sorry, Seo Yeon...

9
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,640
  Miss! Can you hear me? Wake up!  

10
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,330
  Miss? Wake up!  

11
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,940
Can you hear me?

12
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,660
Seo Yeon? Are you okay? Seo Yeon!

13
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,240
  Park Pil Hong... Why did you do that?  

14
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,880
  Why did you do that to Jae Hee?  

15
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,090
  I have to say that, but...  

16
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,620
  Dad...  

17
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,740
Seo Yeon! Seo Yeon!

18
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,340
- What's the case? 
 - She collapsed on the street 30 minutes ago.

19
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,740
- How is her blood pressure? 
 - It's a bit low, but it's in the normal range.

20
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,840
  Let me see the chart.  

21
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,340
Are you her family?

22
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,090
Ah, yes.

23
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,640
- She'll be okay now. Follow me, please. 
 - Yes.

24
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,660
- What's the patient's name? 
 - Ah, it's Park Seo--

25
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,880
It's Lee Bit Chae Woon.

26
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,860
What's her birthday?

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,640
It's September 5th, 1994.

28
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,930
We don't have a matching result.

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Aren't you the father of the patient?

30
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,240
No, I'm just an acquaintance...

31
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,490
I'll call her family.

32
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,150
     

33
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,810
  The person you're trying to reach is not available now...  

34
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,550
I guess Jung Won got annoyed at me and not picking up the phone.

35
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,840
- It would be great if you can check on this drywall here. 
 - Yes, I got it.

36
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,640
Thank you.

37
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,720
Mr. Park Pil Hong.

38
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,940
Mr. Woo, I'm sorry.

39
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,840
I heard you got out of the police station. Where are you now?

40
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,630
- That's not the issue right now-- 
 - Park Pil Hong!

41
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,540
  Why did you come out? You should stay in bed!  

42
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,140
Chae Woon?

43
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,260
We need to talk.

44
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,440
  You shouldn't wake up now!  

45
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,340
Park Pil Hong, where are you now!

46
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,980
I'm sorry. I'll call you later!

47
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,940
- Miss! 
 - Seo Yeon!

48
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,280
Are you okay?

49
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,950
Don't go anywhere.

50
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,580
Don't go anywhere!

51
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,610
- Seo Yeon! 
 - Miss!

52
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,240
  The person you're trying to reach is not available now...  

53
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,270
     

54
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,830
I just called Mr. Woo.

55
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,860
Oh, wait. I didn't tell him the address.

56
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,080
Why did you do that?

57
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,840
Why did you call Jae Hee when he's working far away?

58
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,450
Did Mr. Woo go somewhere?

59
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,220
It's all because of you.

60
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,460
Because of you, he had to close his office...

61
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,500
Miss, you have to have some rest. Please stop talking for now.

62
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,780
Seo Yeon, why don't you have some rest first? I'm not going anywhere.

63
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,810
Call Jae Hee again.

64
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,540
And tell him I'm fine.

65
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,920
He'll be worrying about me. Call him.

66
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,440
Yes, Mr. Woo.

67
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,840
Park Pil Hong, where are you now?

68
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,320
What happened to Chae Woon?

69
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,460
Seo Yeon fainted for a second.

70
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,940
She fainted?

71
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,810
But she's fine now. I brought her to the ER.

72
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,030
Why? Why did she faint all of a sudden?

73
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,000
They said it seems like overwork made her collapse.

74
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,960
Don't worry. She just fell asleep.

75
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,740
Which hospital are you in now? Where is it!

76
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,040
     

77
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,740
     

78
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,240
Yes?

79
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,500
CEO, it's time for you to go to the meeting.

80
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,110
Okay.

81
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,340
  Jung Won. Seo Yeon is in ER right now. They said it's because of overwork. 
    

82
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,140
  It's not an emergency, so don't worry too much.  

83
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,500
  We're at Moo Jin Hospital.  

84
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,290
Seo Yeon is at the hospital..?

85
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,840
CEO! All of the board members are gathered in the meeting room.

86
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,780
Okay.

87
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,120
Is something going on?

88
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,990
Nothing! Why don't you go first? I'll come after a phone call.

89
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,280
Yes, CEO.

90
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,540
Chae Woon is at where?

91
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,040
  I'll be there soon. 
    

92
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,560
  Don't go anywhere and stay next to Seo Yeon.  

93
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,130
Soon Jung.

94
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,740
Doctor! What's wrong with my daughter?

95
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,140
I think she was overworking.

96
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,550
Extreme stress might be the cause.

97
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,640
She's a bit dehydrated, but she'll be okay after taking a rest.

98
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,360
Okay. Thank you so much.

99
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,520
Chae Woon.

100
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,910
My goodness! Chae Woon.

101
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,140
How did you bring her here?

102
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:56,580
Were you keep following Chae Woon the whole time?

103
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,710
No, it's not like that.

104
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,240
I felt so sorry, so I went to apologize to her, but then...

105
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,310
Do you really feel sorry?

106
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,350
It's all because of you. You know that, right?

107
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,400
Why are you--!

108
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:19,000
Why are you keep giving Chae Woon a hard time?

109
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,330
You shouldn't be like this to your child!

110
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,850
Even beasts don't do that!

111
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,730
I wanted to do it well. I wanted to be a proud dad to her.

112
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,950
Park Pil Hong.

113
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,450
Chae Woon had to go through a lot of trouble growing up.

114
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,570
Her fate changed because you brought her to me!

115
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,950
She suffered so much, and now her life is getting a bit better.

116
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,370
She met Mr. Woo and fell in love and trying to get married.

117
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,540
But because of you, everything is ruined now!

118
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,040
I'm sorry, Soon Jung.

119
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,030
I'll leave for now, and I'll visit you in the near future.

120
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,170
I promise. Let's talk again then.

121
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,340
- Park Pil Hong! 
 - Yes?

122
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,040
I have some money that I saved.

123
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,740
It's not a lot, but that's what I saved to send my children to college and help them get married.

124
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,940
- I'll give you all that money. 
 - I'm sorry?

125
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,940
I'll give you all that money, so can you please don't show up in front of our Chae Woon anymore?

126
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,670
Park Pil Hong.

127
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,660
I'll beg you, please.

128
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:49,450
Please! Please get away from our Chae Woon now.

129
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,440
Why are you doing this to me? If anybody sees us, people will think I'm such a bad person! I should go for now.

130
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,100
- Park Pil Hong! 
 - I'm sorry, Soon Jung.

131
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,340
- Park Pil Hong. 
 - Mr. Woo!

132
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,240
Mother.

133
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,030
  Smart wear is like digital wear.  

134
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:22,740
  Our LX group's smart clothing uses high-tech jacquard tags and interactive fibers.  

135
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,140
  You can operate from your smart devices and adjust the clothing according to your physical conditions,  

136
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,240
  and it can change according to the weather like when it rains, it can be waterproof.  

137
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,940
  Chae Woon is okay. 
    

138
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,240
  I'll be next to her, so don't worry too much.  

139
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,640
Chae Woon!

140
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,240
Are you awake?

141
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,340
Are you okay, Chae Woon?

142
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,140
- Mom. 
 - Yes, Chae Woon.

143
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,820
How did you know and come here?

144
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,940
Park Pil Hong.

145
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,040
- Where is he? 
 - Chae Woon, you should lie down more.

146
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,540
Mom, where did Park Pil Hong go? I held him right here.

147
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,040
Chae Woon. I met him, and I talked to him.

148
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,740
Did he run away again?

149
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,930
Chae Woon!

150
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,790
You shouldn't move! You're getting an IV right now. What are you doing, Chae Woon!

151
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,540
Mr. Woo..!

152
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,240
Jae Hee.

153
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,070
Chae Woon, why are you being like this?

154
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,180
What happened...

155
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,450
I'm fine.

156
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,260
How did you know and come here..?

157
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,150
Park Pil Hong told me...

158
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,540
I'll let you two talk.

159
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,340
Mother.

160
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,040
Please, Mr. Woo.

161
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,940
Why did you run over to me in the middle of work?

162
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,540
I know that you can't be absent at work now.

163
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,660
And I look terrible right now.

164
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,500
You don't look terrible at all.

165
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,380
Why did you get so skinny?

166
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,670
Are you not eating at all?

167
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,180
What about you? Are you not eating?

168
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,030
Look at your face.

169
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,340
I'm eating well.

170
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,400
Park Pil Hong, he's really not helping. Why did he contact you?

171
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,250
Why?

172
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,740
He helped a lot this time.

173
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,940
It's good enough that he thought of me at that moment.

174
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,570
You should've held him here.

175
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,540
I wasn't in good conscious...

176
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:36,900
He's also feeling very sorry for you.

177
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,140
He's not that kind of person. I don't trust that.

178
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,290
I heard you fainted because of overwork. Why did you push yourself too hard?

179
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,770
You look haggard as well.

180
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,800
They still love each other so much, but why did they think of breaking up?

181
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Yes, mom! I told you about this before that Mr. Mak-- no, I meant my CEO,

182
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,240
can he move into the room where Na Ro used to live?

183
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,720
  Oh, that he's going to use as his workspace as well?  

184
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,140
Yes! If it's okay, then we're going to move his stuff today.

185
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,030
- By the way, are you not home right now, mom? 
   - No.  

186
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,840
  Actually, your sister is a bit sick, so I'm at the ER.  

187
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,070
ER? Is she sick a lot? What happened?

188
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,740
Well, I guess it could've been worse.

189
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,910
I thought she was pushing herself too hard.

190
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,240
Are you sure I don't have to come?

191
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,930
Oh, okay. Yes!

192
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,340
Did you hang up the phone?

193
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,140
Is Bit Chae Woon sick?

194
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
When I saw her in the design department, she looked okay.

195
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,940
It's because she is overworked. She's in the ER and getting an IV now.

196
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,020
Oh, really? Then we should go there, too!

197
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,140
- I think we don't have to go. Mr. Woo's there right now. 
 - Jae Hee's there?

198
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,540
He would've been working now! Then did he run to her in the middle of his work?

199
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,130
Wow, I guess it's true love.

200
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,440
I know! I want to have a boyfriend who can run to me when I'm sick.

201
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,940
- What are you talking about it? You have me. 
 - What about it?

202
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,340
What?

203
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:48,910
When you weren't feeling great the other time, I ran over to you right away! Why are you pretending that you don't remember?

204
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,140
That and this is a bit different.

205
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,440
And also, when did I say I'll let you be my boyfriend?

206
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:04,590
What happened? Aren't we dating? I'm not your boyfriend?

207
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,440
- Since when? Since what time, minute, second? 
 - Wait for a second!

208
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,740
Last time, we were there and holding a doorknob and holding neck and did like this!

209
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,640
My god!

210
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:20,710
You have to say we're dating to be exclusive! Not everybody's dating just because they kissed.

211
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,740
Wait, Hae Deun! We have to go to pack! Director Lee!

212
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:31,520
I get it! I'll say it in words! Let's be exclusivo! Let's be exclusivay!

213
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,200
She's so adorable! I can't work right now. Director Lee, wait for me!

214
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,740
As I thought, the board of directors' reactions is negative.

215
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,440
I think they feel the risk of Smart clothing material development.

216
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,340
I expected this.

217
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:59,040
I reviewed it, and it's a promising business, so let's proceed.

218
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,920
- Ms. Goo, can you take this to my room? I'm going out for a second. 
 - Okay.

219
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,540
Ms. Goo, is there something going on with the CEO? She didn't look okay during the meeting as well.

220
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,090
She got a call before the meeting, and I think that's the reason.

221
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,340
Is that so?

222
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,210
- I wonder what happened to my mom. 
 - I have no idea.

223
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,980
I heard Park Pil Hong got out of the police station.

224
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,740
Yes, because of lack of evidence.

225
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,240
Wonder if it's because of him?

226
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,210
I should do something to Hwang Na Ro, that cheeky bastard.

227
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,790
Yes, professor Kim?

228
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,740
So everybody's against this project that the CEO Kim announced ambitiously?

229
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,340
What do you think about this project?

230
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:17,440
It's a risky project, but if it succeeds, I think it'll be very profitable.

231
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,270
I think it's a good project as well.

232
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,830
- Is that so? 
   - Yes.  

233
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,540
- Mr. Hwang. Would you leave the room for us? 
 - Yes, ma'am.

234
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:40,790
You have to go against the project that your mom is promoting.

235
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,540
That way, you can hold her back.

236
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,140
Grandma, what are you talking about it?

237
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,060
Your mother told me to step aside from work.

238
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,040
She said I should go back to America.

239
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,340
Did mom say that to you? But why..?

240
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,220
I think she couldn't take it anymore.

241
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,840
You wouldn't be an exception.

242
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,640
I tried my best to make an excuse, but she's still suspecting us.

243
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,290
So, you should be prepared as well.

244
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,740
In a way, you and I abused the power of our company.

245
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,550
I guess mom can be persistent on that.

246
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:34,330
From now on, any trouble, frame it all on Hwang Na Ro.

247
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,030
That's the way for us to survive.

248
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,340
Grandma. How can you say such a thing?

249
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,330
Is Na Ro our cannon fodder?

250
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,940
What? Did you just call him Na Ro?

251
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,240
Do you...

252
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,140
Do you have feelings for him?

253
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,660
Yes. I love him.

254
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,740
So please don't think of him like that.

255
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,140
What did you just say?

256
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:18,360
I guess the Chairwoman grandma and the CEO Kim Jung Won is going to have a war.

257
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,590
Where should I line up?

258
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,210
     

259
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,760
Why did you call me, professor Kim?

260
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,640
  It's been a while. You're doing great these days!  

261
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,560
What's so great about it? I'm just working as a servant.

262
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,240
Hey, you got a great house, a great car! You became so successful.

263
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,640
  You're not going to forget about me, right?   

264
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,890
  We were such a close partner!  

265
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,640
  Also, you didn't pay my part yet.  

266
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:07,640
You can't be like that as a human, Na Ro.

267
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,480
  Hey, Son Ba Wi! Let us hang out at your place.  

268
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,880
There's nobody at your place.

269
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,140
My mom is at home!

270
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,440
- You're lying! You don't have a mom. 
 - No, I do have a mom!

271
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,720
Hey, just open the door.

272
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,630
So we can play video games at your place!

273
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,290
- Ba Wi, what's going on? 
 - Mom!

274
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,540
- Are you Ba Wi's mom? 
 - You're not, right? I heard he doesn't have a mom.

275
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,470
W-Who said that? I'm Ba Wi's mom!

276
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,840
Did you guys tell your parents and came here?

277
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,970
I should call both of your houses.

278
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,420
You don't know our phone numbers!

279
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,520
Why don't I know that? Don't you know moms at school share the phone numbers?

280
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,140
Ah, I should call your school teacher first.

281
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,640
Hey, we should just go. Bye!

282
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,570
If you guys bully Ba Wi again, you'll get in a real trouble!

283
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,200
Ba Wi, I did great, right?

284
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,630
Oh, Ba Reun!

285
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,440
When did you come here?

286
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,900
Just now. I just turned that corner and saw you right away.

287
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,940
- But can you hear my voice with that earbuds? 
 - Yes. I can hear you clearly.

288
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,680
Let's go.

289
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,530
- Ah! Ah! 
 - I can hear you.

290
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,640
If we took a cab, they would've come all the way to the house! Why did you rent a car?

291
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,040
I didn't know that would be the only parking lot...

292
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,640
- Is it very heavy? 
 - Can't you tell?

293
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,040
Then, put one of the boxes on top of here.

294
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,740
I'm holding two boxes.

295
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,340
- Then, just hold those boxes, and you should get on top of this! 
 - Can I do that?

296
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,570
Of course not.

297
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,040
Hae Deun, I didn't tell you about that.

298
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,330
- What about it? Let's go home and then talk. 
 - Wait!

299
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,580
I have to tell you before we go home because I feel guilty.

300
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,640
- Then, put those down and talk about it. It's heavy. 
 - Yeah?

301
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:25,030
I'm a guy. I can hold 70 of these boxes and can stand upside down.

302
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,230
Then you can hold all of these.

303
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,340
Should we talk without the boxes?

304
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,040
I have something... to tell you.

305
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:43,140
- My mom is-- 
 - Oh, we stopped there before, too. What about her?

306
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,670
I mean...

307
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,550
- I'm about to tell you! So my mom is-- 
   - Noona!  

308
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,640
Ra Hoon! Ba Reun!

309
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,620
Can you guys help with these?

310
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,340
- Were you just holding this all the way here? 
 - Yes! It was so heavy!

311
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,300
  It must have been heavy!  

312
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,840
- Yes, yes, here. 
 - Thank goodness.

313
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,430
- Thank you, thank you! 
 - Wait one second.

314
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,990
Hurry up and go! Did you get earrings? It's pretty. Hurry up and go!

315
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,590
Hyung, don't you know about Bluetooth earbuds?

316
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,230
What are you talking about it? Do you think I'm an idiot?

317
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,840
You're an idiot. Let's go, guys.

318
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,910
Hae Deun, wait. You guys should go first!

319
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,750
- I'm talking to you! 
 - Oh, right! What were we talking about it?

320
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,950
- So, my mom is... 
 - Right.

321
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,100
- I was going to tell you about this for a long time. But the timing wasn't right-- 
 - Hae Deun!

322
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:40,430
- Oh! How are you? 
 - We just made a Siraegi dish, so you should come and take some.

323
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,200
I, uh-- Hae Deun!

324
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,130
Where did that lady just pop out?

325
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,740
So she made Siraegi dish at the laundromat?

326
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,100
- Oh, CEO! How are you? 
 - Hello!

327
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,140
I haven't seen you in a while! I guess you guys are coming back from somewhere.

328
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,940
Yes, we went out somewhere close. Why don't you come in?

329
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,950
Ah, but my mom's not home right now.

330
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:13,720
I talked over the phone with her. We are going to meet here, but I guess I arrived first.

331
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,340
  Ah, is that so?  

332
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:20,030
What are you holding? It looks very heavy!

333
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,260
What is it? It's not a weekend drama, but it is like one!

334
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,640
Oh, Mr. Makjang! Where are you going?

335
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,940
Because of that Siraegi!

336
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,500
What about it?

337
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,840
Because of that Siraegi! That lady had to make that Siraegi at that time, so..!

338
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,930
I'm screwed...  I'm completely screwed.

339
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,240
Where are you going! What is up with him?

340
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,760
Come inside, CEO!

341
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,140
- It was cold on the way, wasn't it? 
 - No, it was fine!

342
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,030
I'll make some hot tea for you.

343
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:02,380
No, Ra Hoon! I'm not a guest, so please don't worry about me.

344
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,130
- No, please. 
 - I'm fine..!

345
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,560
By the way, why did you bring such heavy stuff?

346
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,340
- Somebody is moving into the downstair's room today. 
 - Oh.

347
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,940
Those clothes look familiar. I feel like I saw it somewhere...

348
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:31,080
- Unni! I heard you went to the ER. Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

349
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,840
- Mr. Woo came too. 
 - Yes, have you been alright, Hae Deun?

350
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,540
- You left without saying goodbye! 
 - I'm sorry.

351
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,040
Let's go inside. It's cold for Chae Woon.

352
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,120
Jae Hee, you should go now.

353
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,520
- Can I come inside a bit-- 
 - You should go.

354
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,980
Your phone was keep ringing on the way here.

355
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,680
You're getting another call. What should we do?

356
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,790
Thank you for coming today. Have a safe trip back to work.

357
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,680
I'll get going, Chae Woon. I should leave, mother.

358
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,540
Yes. I can't hold onto you.

359
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,740
But why don't you come inside for a second..?

360
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,490
Take care, Hae Deun.

361
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,340
I'll get going, Chae Woon.

362
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,240
- Goodbye, Mr. Woo. 
 - Have a safe trip back!

363
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,450
Let's go inside.

364
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,940
It's cold, let's go in!

365
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,740
- What is this tea? It's so good! 
 - Right? It's a burdock tea.

366
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,740
- Let's drink it together! 
 - I drink it often.

367
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,040
- Noona! 
 - Seo Yeon!

368
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,360
- Unni! 
 - Are you okay, noona?

369
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,940
Mom, you came here as well?

370
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,540
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

371
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,740
You came here early, CEO.

372
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,230
Thank you, Soon Jung.

373
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,440
I had an important meeting at that moment, so I couldn't run right away. I'm sorry, Seo Yeon.

374
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,140
It's okay. I'm sorry to make you worry.

375
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:07,820
Chae Woon has anemia, and she had been working too hard these days, so...

376
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,240
Did you?

377
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,370
- I didn't know about that. 
 - It's not that severe! I'm fine now.

378
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,840
- Right, mom? 
 - Yes.

379
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,140
They said she'll be fine after getting some good rest.

380
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,460
I'm glad to hear that.

381
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,460
Hae Deun, hello?

382
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,880
Hello.

383
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:37,790
- Chae Woon, why don't you go lie down and rest?  
 - Yes, you should go inside and lie down.

384
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,950
- Yes. 
 - Okay, let's go.

385
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,440
I can go by myself.

386
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,220
Let me try this Siraegi to see how good this is.

387
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,740
If she finds out my mom is the CEO Kim Jung Won,

388
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:37,650
and my sister is Seo Ah, director Lee would be so shocked.

389
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,210
Not just director Lee, but my mom will be surprised as well.

390
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,070
But what am I supposed to do? I like Lee Hae Deun.

391
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,440
I don't know. I'm just going to face it.

392
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,540
What am I doing here?

393
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,050
     

394
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,700
     

395
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:05,380
Huh? Is Hwak Se's radio singing contest is today?

396
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,960
Wait, where's the radio?

397
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,960
Brother-in-law! It's time for you to go around our franchise stores.

398
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,140
- Where's the radio? 
 - I'm sorry?

399
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,540
- Hurry up and bring a radio! 
 - Okay, wait for a second, please.

400
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,280
No, you can download an app!

401
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,640
So, is this place going to be the office as well?

402
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,740
Yes. It's going to be his living space and office space. But where did Mr. Makjang go?

403
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,960
Noona! Did you see the text from James?

404
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,020
What text?

405
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,890
- Really? 
 - Yes.

406
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,940
Yes, director.

407
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,440
Yes, so I just have to move down there.

408
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,690
Right. Thank you for your offer.

409
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,180
I'll think about it.

410
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,340
Yes, thank you!

411
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,440
I wasn't expecting this.

412
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,270
I didn't expect anything from here, but...

413
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,270
It's great! I should move down there and make tons of money.

414
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,740
And I should end it with Kim Hwak Se... It's great.

415
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,550
  To the Samgwang villa family,  

416
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:43,940
  Hwak Se participates in a radio singing contest at 2 P.M. today.  

417
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,340
What?

418
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,910
So he's not picking up my calls, but he's going out for the contest?

419
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,940
- A radio singing contest? The same person that I met? 
 - Yes!

420
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,680
- Wow, he must be good at singing! 
 - Yes!

421
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,150
Wait, where's the radio?

422
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,810
Oh, it's here!

423
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,740
- Mom, did you see the text? 
 - Yes, Chae Woon.

424
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,040
You should lie down more!

425
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,640
Yes! Why don't you listen to it in bed?

426
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,240
I also want to listen to it here.

427
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,940
Chae Woon, how can I operate this?

428
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:30,240
- Here you go, Ba Wi! Have as much as you want. 
 - Thank you!

429
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:45,440
  Ms. Jung Min Jae. If you have time right now, why don't you turn on the radio?  

430
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,840
  It's because we have to click likes.  

431
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,040
Why did Woo Jung Hoo send me this?

432
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,840
Mom! Radio, radio! Let's turn it on now!

433
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,860
I'll turn it on.

434
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,940
  Now we have a contestant from Seoul, Kim Hwak Se, on the radio. Kim Hwak Se!  

435
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,040
  Yes, hello! I'm Kim Hwak Se.  

436
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,840
  Kim Hwak Se, I heard you have something to say before you start singing.  

437
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:24,640
Ah, yes. The person who gave me a lot of inspiration when I was making this song,

438
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:32,340
  my only love, and who will be my last love! I want to say I'm dedicating this song to her, Lee Man Jung.  

439
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:38,340
  Yes. Kim Hwak Se's only love, Lee Man Jung! Are you listening to this now? Please sing the song now.  

440
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:44,240

441
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:49,090
  - Then, Kim Hwak Se, sing the song for us! 
 - Yes, thank you!

Oh, my god!

458
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:42,890
Oh, my god! It's so great!

459
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,640
T-Thank you!

460
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,260
Thank you...

461
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,380
- It's amazing! 
 - So crazy!

462
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,020
Hwak Se is really good at singing!

463
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,040
- I think his dream is to be a singer, right? 
 - Yes.

464
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,840
He had been going through a hard time because of his bad throat condition, but I guess he practiced a lot.

465
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,340
Do you think auntie also listened to this?

466
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:37,210
I bet she listened. James sent a group message to everybody.

467
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,730
  This is the address where Hwak Se is.  

468
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,900
He's not picking up my calls. What should I do about it?

469
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,470
Next patient, please!

470
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,380
  Oh, Mr. Makjang!  

471
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,440
Where have you been after leaving your stuff to us?

472
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,640
  Joon Ah, I heard your stuff is coming in today.  

473
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,940
- Welcome. 
 - Hello, mother. Sorry for saying hello late.

474
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,540
Joon Ah! Why are you here?

475
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,820
Mom...

476
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,910
Mom?

477
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,050
M-Mom?

478
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:43,580
My goodness... This is ridiculous.

479
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,940
This is Joon Ah's surprise event!

480
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,600
Mom, I'm really sorry.

481
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,190
I had to empty out the office that I was using, so I needed space to put my stuff,

482
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,520
but I couldn't find a place, so I came here.

483
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:07,720
Even so, then you should've told me first!

484
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,540
But it's my problem, so I should take care of myself.

485
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,740
Were you really going to live here?

486
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:19,140
Yes! The office before was also my living space as well.

487
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,440
Joon Ah, if you do like this, then you're putting me in an awkward position!

488
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:29,040
It's Soon Jung's place! What would she think about me?

489
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,240
Mom, I think it's a matter of way of thinking.

490
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,740
If you think this place is your friend's place, then it's a bit weird,

491
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,790
but it's also your daughter, Chae Woon's home.

492
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:45,760
So, if you see it in a bigger picture, then it's a family's house! So you can feel more at ease about it.

493
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,170
Then what about your real family?

494
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,440
Do you have to live here when you have a real family home where your mom and sister live?

495
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:06,100
I'm sorry, mom. But you know me that I'm more comfortable being by myself.

496
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,120
Also, the house is...

497
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,750
You mean the house is uncomfortable.

498
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:18,520
You talked with me last time, but I guess you're still not feeling fine about it.

499
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,790
Mom, I'm trying really hard, but...

500
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:33,650
I think it's still... I don't think I can change right away. I'm sorry, mom.

501
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,760
Okay...

502
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,790
I'll get going.

503
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,040
- I'll take you home. 
 - No, don't come outside.

504
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,840
Alright.

505
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,450
Call me.

506
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:11,570
She took medicine, and now she's asleep.

507
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,450
Should we go outside?

508
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,040
- I'm leaving now. Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye, CEO!

509
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,040
Ah... Goodbye.

510
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,620
Hae Deun, thank you for letting our Joon Ah stay here.

511
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:50,390
Ah, sure. But if I knew he was your son, I wouldn't let him stay here.

512
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,140
Why? Why wouldn't you let him stay here if you knew he was my son?

513
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,740
Just because. It's because you're a very overwhelming person.

514
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,940
- Hae Deun! 
 - Noona, why are you acting like that?

515
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,040
She finds you a bit difficult...

516
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,890
- It's not like that. 
   - What's wrong with you?  

517
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,320
- I'll get going. 
 - Yes, goodnight.

518
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:28,600
Don't come outside, Soon Jung.

519
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,140
- I'm sorry to make you angry. 
 - No, I wasn't angry.

520
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,840
I didn't know about it as well!

521
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:40,560
I knew that Joon Ah was Mr. Woo's friend, but I didn't know he was your son.

522
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,340
Should I scold him and send him back home to you?

523
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:50,620
No, don't do that. Even if you send him out, he won't come to me.

524
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:55,440
I actually feel safe that he's next to you.

525
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,980
- Thank you for taking care of him from now on. 
 - You don't have to say that.

526
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,730
Everybody's leaving me.

527
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,600
Chae Woon left me, and now Joon Ah as well.

528
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,840
Don't think it like that.

529
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:25,840
I think being a mother is like that, sending kids away and can be sad and lonely.

530
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:32,770
But I'm in you all! You have to insist like this and live.

531
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
I guess so.

532
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,800
- I'll get going. 
 - Yes, have a safe trip back home.

533
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:57,470
  Director Lee, can I see you on the first floor for a second?  

534
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,020
Noona, Joon Ah hyung is asking to see you.

535
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,640
Tell him I don't want to see him.

536
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,540
- Director Lee, I-- 
 - Don't come inside!

537
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,840
Can I talk in private with your sister?

538
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,730
- Ah, yes, sure. 
 - Thank you.

539
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,240
Don't come inside. Let's talk outside.

540
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,570
How can a human be like this? How can you completely deceive me?

541
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:45,320
Director Lee, I wasn't trying to completely deceive you or anything...

542
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,540
I was trying to talk about my mom to you earlier today,

543
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,140
but some lady came out and gave you Siraegi, and the kids were popping out from nowhere!

544
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,540
I tried my best to tell you! This is unfair!

545
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:03,540
Also, you don't like my mom and Seo Ah, so it was harder for me to tell you.

546
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,940
Ah, whatever!

547
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,630
I want you to leave.

548
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:14,140
What? I-I just moved in here. I don't have any place to go.

549
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,650
I don't care if you go back to your palace-like house or go somewhere else is none of my business.

550
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,440
- I don't know! Goodbye. 
 - Wait!

551
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:28,340
Where are you going? Then what about our work? The styling company?

552
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,940
Of course, I'm doing the work! It's not a kids' play.

553
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,940
Wait! Why are you keep going somewhere? Do you have a plan or something?

554
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:41,640
Then... What about our that thing?

555
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,510
- What about it? 
 - Huh?

556
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:51,440
That we... we kissed.

557
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:57,770
Ah! I don't know what you're talking about it. But I'm going to cancel everything besides the work! It's the end!

558
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,940
Director Lee, wait! How can you cancel that..!

559
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,110
It was my first kiss...

560
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,040
There are moles at this house.

561
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:17,240
I just move in here! What should I do?

562
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,170
Oh, Joon Ah!

563
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,920
What are you going to do now? Your mother seems to be very sad.

564
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,140
I'm sorry.

565
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:42,640
But your mother still allowed this, so visit her tomorrow and make her feel better.

566
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,420
Yes, I'll do that.

567
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:50,420
Anyway, welcome to the Samgwang villa!

568
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:56,240
C-Can I live here? Hae Deun just told me to leave.

569
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,940
Hae Deun said that? She can't decide you to stay or leave.

570
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,540
I'm the owner!

571
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,260
Welcome, Joon Ah! Happy to have you here.

572
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,610
- Thank you so much! Thank you for letting me stay here. 
 - Welcome, hyung!

573
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,020
- Welcome! 
 - Thank you, thank you!

574
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,840
Where were you guys and popped up?

575
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,740
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

576
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,840
- Call us from now on! We can do delivery. 
 - Yes, thank you!

577
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:40,740
Hwak Se, I heard you singing on the radio.

578
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,930
Congratulations to you for going to the final!

579
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,540
  But Hwak Se, when are you going to come back?  

580
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,340
  It's too much for me to work by myself. Hwak Se, come back soon!  

581
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,540
Eems hyung...

582
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:06,120
I have to get in the finals at the end of the month to go back home. I just got the first round.

583
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,950
Oh, so you weren't going to come back home if you don't get the end of the month final?

584
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,340
I guess that was your plan.

585
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:23,190
You were going to end with me without calling me. Is that right?

586
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,240
Ah, that was your plan.

587
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:29,020
- Man Jung..! 
 - Why are you not picking up my calls?

588
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,310
You read all of my texts. Why did you not respond?

589
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,640
That's great! But even when you come home, I'm not going to be there. Congrats to you!

590
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:39,770
You left the house because of me, so you should come back to the Samgwang villa since I'll be gone.

591
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,240
If I'm gone, you can have a happy life with my sister and my nieces and nephew.

592
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:49,040
Also, you should keep getting the treatments. You should sing happily after getting your throat treated well.

593
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,360
I'm going down to a big hospital in Chungju. I felt bad to leave without telling you because I have a decent manner.

594
00:48:54,420 --> 00:49:00,800
- I came all the way here to talk to you in person! 
 - Talking in person about what?

595
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,960
Are you breaking up with me?

596
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:08,090
Right?

597
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,370
Am I right?

598
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,820
I guess...

599
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:23,710
it's easy for you to fall in love and easy for you to break up.

600
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,970
Are you really going to break up with me?

601
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,740
Look into my eyes straight and say it again!

602
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,800
Are you going to break up with me?

603
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,660
Tell me!

604
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:52,200
I'm asking you. Tell me straight into my eyes if you want to break up with me!

605
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:55,580
  You said you came all the way here to tell me that!  

606
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,660
I'm here because I missed you...

607
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:22,690
I told you...

608
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:29,170
I told you that we should tell your sister a little later when I'm more settled with my career, right?

609
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:34,210
But you talked as you pleased, and got angry as you pleased, and you just left the house!

610
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,540
Then what should I do?

611
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:42,840
Yes, I came out of that house because I wanted to run away and hide as well. But!

612
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,620
But I'm not going to live like that from now on.

613
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:53,240
I'm going to work really hard and achieve something, and then I'm going to tell your sister confidently that I love you.

614
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,140
Think about it.

615
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,830
How did we start?

616
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:03,900
How did we begin our relationship?

617
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:06,880
Do you know how I started loving you..!

618
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:12,830
No, I can't break up with you. So you should know that. Also!

619
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,680
I'm going to pretend that I didn't hear anything of what you said before.

620
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,240
I can't break up with you as well.

621
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:21,280
I can't break up with you...

622
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,560
It's all because you didn't pick up my calls...

623
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:48,290
Then why don't you run into my arms?

624
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,440
- Why didn't you pick up my calls! 
 - You're an idiot...

625
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:10,630
♫   This is also love. If this is also love,    ♫

626
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:16,920
♫   then I'm okay, no matter how much it hurts   ♫

627
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,980
It's okay.

628
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:24,240
So I'm saying you should've picked up my calls! Why didn't you pick up my calls! Why!

629
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:27,360
Just run into my arms!

630
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:42,050
  From now on, any trouble, frame it all on Hwang Na Ro.  

631
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:49,560
  What if Grandma just uses Na Ro and dump him away?  

632
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,820
- Na Ro. 
 - Yes?

633
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,670
Should we get engaged?

634
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,010
Engagement?

635
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,300
Yes.

636
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:09,420
Is it too early?

637
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:16,070
Well, the CEO doesn't trust me yet.

638
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:22,930
I think my mom has to trust you if we get engaged.

639
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,100
I would love to do that right away,

640
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,850
but I'm worried we might ruin it by rushing it.

641
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,120
Is it?

642
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,440
I'll bring more water for you.

643
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:56,740
  Hwang Na Ro. Are you kidding me? Did you send this money as my compensation?  

644
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:01,840
  Are you saying I should eat this and fall off? I guess you're not afraid of anything these days.  

645
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,150
Who is it?

646
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:09,240
It's Ms. Yoon. She texted me that she sent me the report by mail.

647
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,340
- Seo Ah. 
 - Yes?

648
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,700
Let's just...

649
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,570
get married.

650
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:39,150
Do you mean that?

651
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:42,450
I want to live with you as soon as possible.

652
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:49,190
I love you.

653
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,740
I love you, too.

654
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,940
  There was a time when our Jae Hee was this small.  

655
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,130
  But when did he grow up already and going through this suffering?  

656
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,070
  It's cold outside, and I wonder if he's wearing warm enough when he's working...  

657
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,390
  Jae Hee...  

658
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:32,300
  "Even though,"  

659
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,060
  "With friends, even though." Yes.  

660
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,940
  "Uses together with friends."  

661
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,840
  - "With friends..." 
 - Right.  

662
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,640
  Are you knitting my vest right now?  

663
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,430
  You asked me to knit one because it's cold.  

664
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:56,710
  I'm saving money! Since you're knitting one for me, I don't have to spend money on my vest.  

665
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,480
  I bought this yarn with money.  

666
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:05,580
  But that was originally our Jae Hee's sweater! So, I saved my money for the vest.  

667
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:11,120
  If I get tired of the vest, knit me a scarf with that yarn again.  

668
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,810
  Yes, sure.  

669
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:18,660
  "I share things with my friends."  

670
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,740
- Stingy guy... 
 - What did you say?

671
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,340
Oh! Nothing, Ba Wi.

672
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:43,500
  Ms. Jung Min Jae, did you listen to the radio?  

673
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:51,710
  Yes. I pressed the like button as well.  

674
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,790
You did great!

675
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,210
Huh? 
      

676
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,680
Is she even calling me?

677
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,170
What did I do to deserve your call?

678
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:21,140
Woo Jung Hoo, I'm sorry that I yelled at you the other time because I thought you weren't helping Jae Hee.

679
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,840
It's okay. Everybody knows that you have a short temper.

680
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:29,250
That's why you didn't come to the doctor's appointment, right?

681
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:33,350
What? Oh, that's because--

682
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,840
  You and I are really meant to be! How can we run into each other wherever we go?  

683
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,740
  I know!  

684
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,580
I was a bit busy that day. I'm sorry.

685
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,800
You're such a grumpy.

686
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,170
What's that?

687
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,200
Nothing!

688
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,850
I think my dad is here!

689
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,440
I guess so!

690
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:05,670
What is it? Is the Ba Wi kid over there again?

691
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,340
Hello?

692
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:11,780
What was that?

693
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,290
I'm sorry to make you keep taking care of him.

694
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,640
You should've stayed at home!

695
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,040
I love staying at her place!

696
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,440
I also love staying with you, Ba Wi!

697
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,590
I can take care of him the days my store closes early.

698
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,980
No, it's okay! That's too much for me to ask you.

699
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,710
The nanny who takes care of Ba Wi went to her hometown for vacation, so that's why this keeps happening.

700
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:41,520
Then, I'll take care of him until she comes back.

701
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:46,750
- Dad! She also became my mom today! 
 - What?

702
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:55,340
Kids were making fun of me and said, "you don't have a  mom!" again, but she stepped up and said, "I'm Ba Wi's mom!"

703
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:01,940
Really? Did the kids do that again to you?

704
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:07,050
- Didn't they hit you? 
  - No, I didn't get hit this time.

705
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,810
Let me see.

706
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:12,870
Do they hit you before?

707
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,440
Those bad boys! I'll scold them big time!

708
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,140
Thank you so much, noonim.

709
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,940
It's nothing.

710
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:35,740
That dad and little son are habitually coming over!

711
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,040
How can they be at her place every time?

712
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,640
Father, hello?

713
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,070
Oh, Joon Ah!

714
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:53,640
Eat as much as you want. I heard you are going to live in the Samgwang villa now?

715
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:56,500
That's great. We'll see each other often from now on.

716
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,540
Yes, so I came here to say hello to you as well.

717
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:05,040
That's good. But the Samgwang villa people still don't know who you are?

718
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,380
You shouldn't hide it like that.

719
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:12,240
Now they all know about it because my mom visited the house all of a sudden today.

720
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,260
Why did she visit here?

721
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:18,190
Bit Chae Woon was sick today, so I think she came here because she's worried.

722
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,960
Chae Woon is sick?

723
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,140
- Did mom go to Yeonhui-dong this late at night? 
 - Yes.

724
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,140
There's an event there tomorrow.

725
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,140
Mom is having the hardest time.

726
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,540
She worried the whole day because of me as well.

727
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:35,750
- Unni, have some bigger bites! 
 - I got it.

728
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,300
Yes, you should eat more to get better faster!

729
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,240
Okay.

730
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,650
  - Is there anybody home?   
 - James!

731
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,260
Father!

732
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:49,820
Chae Woon, I heard you got sick today.

733
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,710
How did you hear about that?

734
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,940
Joon Ah came over to say hi and told me.

735
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,740
Eat this and get better soon!

736
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,640
- It's tangerines! 
 - Ah, thank you so much!

737
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,340
And I got this for you, too!

738
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,940
It's very pretty!

739
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,340
James, you have such a great sense!

740
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:14,840
- I didn't know you had such a side like that. 
 - I did have it! Why?

741
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,540
- Ra Hoon, you should learn that! 
 - I got it.

742
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:22,440
Chae Woon.

743
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:26,860
I guess you're having a hard time being far away from Jae Hee.

744
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:38,200
Even if a person is tired physically, they can endure it if they feel secure emotionally.

745
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:47,740
The thought that I made Jae Hee like that is bothering me.

746
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:53,090
How hard it will be, how cold he will be,

747
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:58,740
how many thoughts he will be having. I keep having these thoughts.

748
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:06,210
So I tried to work harder not to think about it, but it didn't work well.

749
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,940
Also, I miss him a lot.

750
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,770
You should see him if you miss him!

751
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:28,540
Life is too short not to see the person that you miss.

752
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:33,110
Especially when you are the young people at the age to love.

753
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:38,880
Father...

754
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:59,810
  Do you remember Jae Hee's high school friend, Bum Jin?  

755
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:03,640
  - Of course, I remember him. 
 - You do remember him.  

756
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:09,550
  Bit Chae Woon asked me about Bum Jin today.  

757
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:20,140
  If she's asking me about him, I think Jae Hee still has a trauma related to Bum Jin.  

758
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,160
  - Joon Ah. 
 - Yes?  

759
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,540
  Can you find Bum Jin? Don't tell about this to Jae Hee.  

760
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:39,340
  These days, you guys can find old friends pretty easily.  

761
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:43,540
  Yes, I'll do that.  

762
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:52,140
It won't work for Jae Hee if I just talk to him.

763
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:08,360
Moong-i...

764
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:17,660
I miss Moong-i so much...

765
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,960
Father! Why are you here?

766
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:48,540
Why are you in these clothes at this time..?

767
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,820
Yoo Jae Hee.

768
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,360
Father, did you...

769
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,740
Yoo Jae Hee. Let's go home.

770
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,940
Did you lose your memory again? What happened?

771
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,140
Let's go home, Yoo Jae Hee!

772
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,840
- What the... 
 - Let's go home!

773
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:22,720
♫   In the extravagant building forest   ♫

774
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:26,440
♫   You're walking with confidence, City Boy   ♫

775
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:30,870
♫   In the suffocating gaze of people   ♫

776
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:34,600
♫   You're walking with pride, Working Girl   ♫

777
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:42,040
♫   Who would be that handsome Boy   ♫

778
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:49,950
♫   You're the star of this city, So beautiful Girl   ♫

779
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:55,250
♫   You can make every dream come true   ♫

780
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,740
     

781
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,040
  I want to be Jjung-a's boyfriend! Please allow me.  

782
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:03,880
  - Why are you bowing down? You don't have to do that. 
 - But still...  

783
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:05,360
  I can't allow it!  

784
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,030
  I asked to do it to grandma.  

785
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,840
  I got angry at Jae Hee so much, so I wanted to destroy him.  

786
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:13,900
  - You should turn yourself into the police and get investigated. 
 - I'm not going to lean on you anymore, mom. 

787
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:17,100
  - Seo Ah! 
 - I only have you now, Na Ro.  

788
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,040
  So please don't say I should go.  

789
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,700
  Auntie!  

790
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,040
  - Mr. Woo! 
 - Aunt! How have you been?  

791
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,840
  My goodness! I'm glad you're back!  

792
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,940
  Mr. Woo's back! Everybody, come out!  

793
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,060
  We want to do a wedding.  

794
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:35,140
  What is it? Are you getting married now?  

795
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:37,760
  That's the money you can take.  

796
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:40,540
  You have something to do for me before you get this money.
