1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,200
Everyone,

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,420
this is my biological daughter,

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,000
Lee Bit Chae Woon.

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,720
CEO.

5
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:39,330
She's my daughter that I lost twenty-something years ago, and I found her now.

6
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,600
Mom...

7
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,360
There's big news! 
      

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,300
- What's wrong, Kim Dae Won? 
 - About Lee Bit Chae Woon.

9
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,500
She was the daughter of the CEO Kim Jung Won!

10
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,500
I heard that the CEO officially announced it at the board meeting.

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,700
  Then that rumor was all true?  

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,560
Ah, that's great!

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,100
Then maybe she didn't give her a full-time position this time to provide her with a better position later?

14
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:24,110
I bet if she's the CEO's daughter, then people might misinterpret things, so they must have been cautious.

15
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,670
Especially from suspicions like you just made.

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,600
Ah, if I knew about this, I should've been nice to Bit Chae Woon before.

17
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,580
  You sound sneaky, Kim Dae Won.  

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,100
Since the CEO's hidden daughter got revealed, maybe there's her son among us as well!

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,630
That's true! I remember the CEO has a son.

20
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,030
- I think I heard he was studying abroad. 
 - Is that so?

21
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,900
  Then, maybe it's...  

22
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,000
- It's fine, it's fine. 
   - Is it Kim Dae Won?  

23
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,170
- That's right! Didn't you study abroad?  
 - Why are you guys acting like that? I wish I were the CEO's son!

24
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,390
  - I'm really not the son!   
 - What were you saying before?

25
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,990
What about it?

26
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,810
Mom, how can you do that?

27
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,960
How can you officially announce Bit Chae Woon as your daughter and kick out the Chairwoman?

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,140
Calm down, director Jang.

29
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,010
- I'm trying to make everything straight. 
 - Mom!

30
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,640
Also, you have to get a police investigation.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,500
I hope you don't think you can get away from destroying Jae Hee's company, right?

32
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,090
How can you be like this to me?

33
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,400
You should protect me!

34
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,660
- Why do you want to destroy me--! 
 - Seo Ah!

35
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,100
I'm not trying to ruin you.

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,700
I'm trying to fix you before it's too late.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,460
Mom!

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,800
Put yourself together, Seo Ah.

39
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,420
I'm not going to take your tantrum anymore.

40
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,640
I'm not going to take this.

41
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,100
- I'm going to use everything-- 
 - Sure.

42
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,120
Try to shake me by using everything you can. I'll be shaken for you!

43
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,460
But right now, you should calm down first.

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,500
Every board member also knows that you are acting emotional, not rational!

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,200
I'm going to marry Hwang Na Ro.

46
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,900
What?

47
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,950
Are you revenging on me like this?

48
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,080
No. I had been thinking about this.

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,190
I don't want to live with you anymore.

50
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,440
I'm going to marry a person who truly loves me.

51
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,130
Seo Ah!

52
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,000
How can my mom be like this to me? How can she!

53
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,800
Calm down!

54
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,190
Na Ro!

55
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,120
- Are you okay? 
 - Are you okay, Seo Ah? Did you get hurt?

56
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,090
- Oh, no! I'm sorry... 
 - Seo Ah, don't be like this.

57
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,100
You promised that you wouldn't be mad and upset like this, remember?

58
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry...

59
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,100
I'm fine, so please calm down.

60
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,200
Calm down, Seo Ah.

61
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Calm down. It's okay.

62
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,200
I...

63
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,400
told my mom.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,600
I told her I'm going to marry you.

65
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,480
Seo Ah..!

66
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's...

67
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,230
get married.

68
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,300
Marriage...

69
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,400
Am I getting married to Jang Seo Ah?

70
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,110
Am I going to be the son-in-law of the LX company?

71
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,960
What?

72
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,700
My dismissal got passed?

73
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,680
My goodness... Park Pil Hong.

74
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,870
What happened to Park Pil Hong?

75
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,400
What happened to Park Pil Hong?

76
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,480
What happened!

77
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,030
Are you Mr. Park Pil Hong?

78
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,270
Aren't you Mr. Park Pil Hong?

79
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,140
I'm not. I'm Lee Dong Chool.

80
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,460
I bet the Chairwoman must be nerve-wracked by now.

81
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,280
There's something you can't do it with money, Chairwoman.

82
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,470
Ah, but it's a shame that I didn't take that money.

83
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,870
I wonder how much it was in total.

84
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,100
Mom, you didn't have to do that.

85
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,850
What are you going to do now?

86
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,270
What do you mean by that?

87
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,670
Bit Chae Woon, now you have to work harder than before.

88
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,620
So you don't be embarrassed to be my daughter.

89
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,820
I'm worried that you might face trouble because of today.

90
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,630
What trouble?

91
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,100
Are you worried that I might get fired from the CEO position?

92
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,610
I'm not worried about that.

93
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,320
I'm not afraid of anything like that anymore.

94
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:04,200
If anything, what I'm scared of the most is to lose my position as your mom.

95
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,460
I finally realized that.

96
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,900
Until now, I'm so sorry for everything, Seo Yeon.

97
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,470
Don't say that.

98
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,720
It's okay, mom.

99
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
Do you have some other issue?

100
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,000
Nothing. I'm just worried about Seo Ah.

101
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,000
  Bit Chae Woon!  

102
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,700
Bit Chae Woon, we heard about it. How can you hide it from us completely?

103
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,800
Ah...

104
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,350
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:05,910
- Congratulations, Bit Chae Woon. I heard you found your birth mother in twenty-something years. 
 - Ah, yes.

106
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,610
Then I'll be back from going around the store!

107
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,850
Oh, no, Bit Chae Woon! It's cold outside. I'll go instead of you.

108
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,320
No, it's my work! I'll be back!

109
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,620
Ah, it's somehow bothering me.

110
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,560
Chae Woon!

111
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,980
Did anything happen at work?

112
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,830
Oh, did you hear about it already?

113
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,390
At the board meeting, the CEO announced...

114
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,000
that I'm her biological daughter.

115
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,810
Did she?

116
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,700
I actually went to see the CEO earlier today.

117
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,200
She seemed to be thinking about that.

118
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,500
  Anyway, Chae Woon, congratulations! I'm happy for you.  

119
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,520
Thank you, mom.

120
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,610
Isn't anybody saying something to you at the office?

121
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,290
Is anybody making you feel uncomfortable?

122
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,000
There's nothing like that!

123
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:11,080
I bet they'll say stuff behind me, but you know I don't get affected by that.

124
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,400
Yes. Yes, you did great, Chae Woon.

125
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,400
I'm so happy for you, my daughter!

126
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,720
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

127
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,700
  She is...  

128
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,300
  not my biological daughter.  

129
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,300
  - Mom! 
 - Mom.  

130
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,120
Yes, it went all well.

131
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,560
Everything went well for my Chae Woon.

132
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,140
What?

133
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,920
My mom asked you to do that kind of stuff?

134
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Yes! She asked me to have an interview with a reporter and say that you have a daughter with me, and you threw her away.

135
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,200
It feels like I'm snitching on you, so I wasn't going to tell you about this.

136
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,050
But I was worried that you might get in trouble.

137
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,160
I guess she really got pushed into a corner.

138
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,800
But I confidently rejected your mother's suggestion!

139
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,760
- She said she's going to give me money in cash like this big, but I-- 
 - So?

140
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,340
- Are you asking me to compliment you? 
 - Yes.

141
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,110
I even gave back the deposit that I got last time to her!

142
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,110
I did good, right?

143
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,060
Yes, you did great.

144
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,400
Park Pil Hong.

145
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,100
Seo Yeon is going to get married soon.

146
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,560
Really? She's getting married soon!

147
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,770
So please, don't make any trouble from now on.

148
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,900
Until now, you made our Seo Yeon suffered enough.

149
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,980
I wasn't going to say this, but I'm afraid you might make trouble again,

150
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,920
so I'm asking you.

151
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,980
Did you understand?

152
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,190
Of course.

153
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,600
- I can come to see the wedding, right? 
 - How dare you think you can come?

154
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,430
You can't come.

155
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:59,720
I always dreamed about walking into the wedding march with my daughter.

156
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,000
What?

157
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Do you think it's impossible?

158
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh! Okay, I get it.

159
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,980
It has a great scent.

160
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,860
Right foot, left foot, and then... 
 ♫  The yellow cafe I see over there  ♫

161
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,090
♫  I'm meeting her for the third time today  ♫

162
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,980
♫  My heart is running toward that place  ♫

163
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,150
♫  But I feel nervous  ♫

164
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,500
- Are you getting all this today? 
 - Of course!

165
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,600
Oppa got paid.

166
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,700
- I'm impressed. 
 - Why? You got everything the other time.

167
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,400
Eat as much as you want. If you want, order more!

168
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,940
- Really? 
 - Yes, get everything you want!

169
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,500
I'm touched.

170
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,840
- Thank you for the food! 
 - Enjoy!

171
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,970
Were you sad that I couldn't work with you these days because I'm doing the modeling job?

172
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,540
I wasn't sad.

173
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,870
You were!

174
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:26,370
- Just tell me if you felt sad. 
 - No, I was really fine.

175
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,210
I'm happy that you're doing the work that you wanted to do.

176
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,200
But I'm a bit sad that we can't always be around together like before!

177
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,000
- Just a little bit? 
 - Yes, just a tiny little bit!

178
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,850
I'm glad it's just a little bit.

179
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,700
But now I'm getting a bit upset that you're only a tiny bit sad about it!

180
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Why are you getting upset about it?

181
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,990
- What are you doing? 
 - Let's eat, let's eat.

182
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,700
- Ah, I'll be back from the restroom. 
 - Okay.

183
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,710
     

184
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,860
- Isn't it good? 
 - Yes.

185
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,410
Oh, right.

186
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,710
- I have good news. 
 - What is it?

187
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,000
Today my mom

188
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,090
officially acknowledged me as her daughter.

189
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,900
Really? Congratulations, Moong-i!

190
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,500
She made a big decision.

191
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,100
Yes. She announced about me at the board meeting,

192
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,040
and I got a bit emotional.

193
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,980
Your mother is an incredible person.

194
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,410
Does your Samgwang villa mother know about this too?

195
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:19,890
Yes, I talked on the phone with her. She said they already talked about it earlier.

196
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,600
- I guess she'll be happy for you. 
 - Yes.

197
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,230
Mom was tearing up a little bit,

198
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,040
and it made me tear up as well.

199
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,820
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

200
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,320
It went well! Let's eat now.

201
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Director Lee.

202
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,080
My mom, I mean,

203
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,600
the CEO, now revealed that Bit Chae Woon is her daughter.

204
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,720
What about it?

205
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,010
Now that got cleared, do you feel better about my mom--

206
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,860
why am I keep doing this? I mean, do you feel better about the CEO now?

207
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,910
- Ah, well... 
 - It got better, right?

208
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,900
Then I wonder if you change your feelings about me.

209
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,700
- Mr. Makjang. 
 - Yes?

210
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,100
I mean, CEO.

211
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,990
I told you before that we should keep our relationship to official relations only.

212
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:26,390
It's true that I had feelings for you, too. But,

213
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,560
it's not going to work in the end, even though we get close to each other.

214
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,300
I hate getting hurt and cry kind of thing. So let's just end--

215
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,900
Lee Hae Deun, you're saying it so easily.

216
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,490
Yes, sure.

217
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,400
I also know that our situation is entangled too much, so it's very complicated.

218
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,800
You're my mom's biological daughter's sister,

219
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,250
and I'm that daughter's older brother, right? I know about it, too.

220
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,070
But isn't our feelings are the most important thing?

221
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,890
Are you giving up because it just looks hard? Are we only this much--

222
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,880
Was our relationship only this much?

223
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,300
Hae Deun, I...

224
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,220
I might look like a playboy,

225
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,550
but I barely dated anybody in my life. Actually, I tried my best!

226
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,820
not to get involved with anyone. I'm that kind of person.

227
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,790
I try my best not to give my heart to anyone! My sister is like that too!

228
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,200
So I've never liked someone this much,

229
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,850
- and I've never been this excited... 
   - Did I say I wasn't?  

230
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,790
But,

231
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:47,450
my sister had a hard time getting acknowledged by her birth mother, and now she's going to get married.

232
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,180
No matter how much I think about it, I don't think it's right for us to have a relationship.

233
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:57,400
I don't want to make my mom or sister worried because of my issue.

234
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:09,850
I know that I'm still like a child, but my family is most important to me.

235
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,600
I get it.

236
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,370
So can you hug me-- Where did she go?

237
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,230
Did she just leave after saying what she wanted to say?

238
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,310
Seriously, that's so mean...

239
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,950
Welcome!

240
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,220
Bit Chae Woon, how have you been?

241
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,460
Mother, how have you been?

242
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,410
You got so skinny!

243
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,050
I guess you suffered too much because of Jae Hee, right?

244
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,200
No, you are the one who worried a lot.

245
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,300
Thank you for coming here to see me before the formal meeting with both families. I know you must be busy.

246
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,380
I wanted to see you.

247
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,570
Me, too.

248
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,860
Aren't you busy, Jae Hee?

249
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,590
Yes, I'm busy. But I should make time to come together.

250
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,500
- Let's sit down and talk! 
 - Wait, Jae Hee.

251
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,200
Can just two of us talk in private?

252
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,950
  Why? Are you nervous?  

253
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,450
No, nothing. Sure.

254
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,580
It makes me nervous.

255
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,700
  Why is your bag so heavy, Ba Wi?  

256
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,300
Professor!

257
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,000
Jae Hee!

258
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,040
Are you visiting your mother's place?

259
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,290
Yes! How did you know this is my mother's place?

260
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,820
Ah, I moved to this building.

261
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,750
Where? Do you mean to over there?

262
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,380
Yes, we moved some time ago.

263
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,810
I said hello to your mother, and I also met your father.

264
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,470
Oh, really?

265
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,800
Hello!

266
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,120
Oh, Ba Wi! I haven't seen you in a while. You got so big!

267
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,880
It's uncanny! How can you move into a place across the hall?

268
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:16,330
I know! I was delighted to see her. It felt like it's meant to be.

269
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,130
It's meant to be..?

270
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,030
Is she at home?

271
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,340
Dad, can we visit her?

272
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,520
  Not now, Ba Wi.  

273
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,800
Bi Wi likes her a lot because she's very nice to Ba Wi.

274
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,540
Ah, is that so.

275
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,700
I like her a lot!

276
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,680
She became my mom as well.

277
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,200
Mom..?

278
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,390
Ba Wi had some trouble, and she helped him out.

279
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,810
Ba Wi, she's this guy's mother!

280
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,400
Hyung! You must be happy! I'm so jealous of you!

281
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,600
Oh, are you jealous of me? Well, thank you!

282
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,150
But what can I do? She has a guest in her place right now.

283
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,200
Why don't you come inside for tea?

284
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,080
I have to go back to work right now. I'll come by next time.

285
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,300
- Okay. Then please come by next time! 
 - Yes.

286
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,900
- Hyung, bye-bye! 
 - Yes, bye!

287
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,600
Let's go!

288
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,710
Hyung?

289
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,390
"It's meant to be?"

290
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,200
Um...

291
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,150
Feel free to talk, mother.

292
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,330
I, uh...

293
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:47,940
Are you in touch with Park Pil Hong..?

294
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,960
Yes. I mean, just sometimes.

295
00:22:53,400 --> 00:23:02,700
I heard that Park Pil Hong participated in what happened to Jae Hee.

296
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,310
Did you hear that from Seo Ah?

297
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,000
Yes. I went to see her.

298
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:16,530
I thought about it, and I thought Seo Ah would've done it. So I went to her and said, "You did this!"

299
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,230
but then she told me about him.

300
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,830
I also thought he did it at first, but it got revealed that he didn't do anything.

301
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,470
Oh, is that so?

302
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,760
Then I guess Seo Ah really did it...

303
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,160
Anyway, that's good news!

304
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,670
But...

305
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:44,880
he did get a job at Jae Hee's construction site before, right?

306
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:52,150
I thought about it, and I feel like I saw him at the site when I visited Jae Hee before.

307
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,340
Yes, he did. But he's not working there anymore.

308
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Yes! I recognized him right away!

309
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,100
I saw him at Jung Won's wedding. Also, I went to their house-warming party.

310
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:13,100
He wanted to see me from close, so he worked at Jae Hee's site for some time.

311
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,820
Ah, is that so.

312
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,300
Right, I understand that.

313
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,720
But there's something I'm concerned about it.

314
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:33,310
I guess you're worried that he might make some trouble, right?

315
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,730
Right.

316
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:41,130
I wanted to talk about it with Jung Won, but she gets so angry whenever I say Park Pil Hong's name.

317
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,190
I thought about talking to Soon Jung, but that doesn't feel right, so...

318
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,400
- So, this happened.  
 - Of course! I totally understand that.

319
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,990
But I was also worried about that,

320
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,210
so I asked him about this multiple times.

321
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:03,850
I know that he's not that trustable person, but I want to give him a shot. Please trust him for once, mother.

322
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,790
Okay. I'm sorry, Chae Woon.

323
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,200
But as a mother, I can't help but think about my son first.

324
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,900
So I got concerned more.

325
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,700
It's okay! I understand that. My mom also said the same thing to me already.

326
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,200
Oh, really?

327
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,700
I actually went through a hard time because of my in-laws!

328
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,700
When something getting resolved, then another person makes trouble and keep repeating that.

329
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,900
And my husband and I were the ones who took responsibilities and took care of everything.

330
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:43,290
I thought just loving him is all I needed in marriage,

331
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,900
but when I actually got married, that wasn't all of it.

332
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,300
Right. I guess you went through a lot.

333
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,780
I'm sorry, Chae Woon.

334
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,790
No, it's okay!

335
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:07,100
From now on, I'll look after Park Pil Hong more, so you don't have to worry. I'm sorry, mother.

336
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,360
- And also... 
 - I, uh...

337
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,190
Go ahead!

338
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:24,720
- Please don't tell Jae Hee about what we talked about today... 
 - Oh.

339
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,860
You're very thoughtful, Chae Woon.

340
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,500
I was just about to say the same thing.

341
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,190
I'm embarrassed.

342
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,400
Thank you for the fruits.

343
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,060
Ah, thank you! Take this one, please.

344
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,600
She can think like that.

345
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,950
Right, she can be like that.

346
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,800
Yes, Koala!

347
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,670
Moong-i! How was it with my mom?

348
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,020
It was good.

349
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,800
What were you guys talked about it? It looked serious.

350
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,690
Right, it looked serious.

351
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,200
We talked bad things about you!

352
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,600
My bad things? What about it?

353
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:51,330
It's not about that I wet my bed until 3rd grade or something like that, right?

354
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,200
Did you really do that?

355
00:27:54,650 --> 00:28:00,180
I didn't hear about that, but are you okay with telling that story to me? I'm going to make fun of you forever.

356
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:08,270
Soon Jung.

357
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,100
- Have you been okay? 
 - Yes.

358
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:21,180
It's unexpected for you to ask me to meet up.

359
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,800
I heard that Seo Yeon is getting married soon.

360
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,740
I heard it from Jung Won.

361
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,300
Are you cold? Why are you wearing such a thin layer?

362
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,200
I'm fine.

363
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,440
There's no place to go...

364
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,380
Why don't you come inside for now?

365
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,000
No, it's okay! How dare I go into your place?

366
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,400
It's okay. Please, come inside.

367
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,110
Come on in.

368
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,170
This is such a homey place!

369
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,510
It's very cozy.

370
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,200
What is the size of the land..?

371
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,100
Well, I'm not quite sure.

372
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,550
Do you own this house?

373
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,840
Ah, I guess you leased it?

374
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,450
I don't own this house.

375
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,580
Ah, is that so?

376
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:27,500
I guess you couldn't buy your house yet since you had to raise children.

377
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:34,000
Didn't Jung Won say she will give you something nice? She owns a lot of lands!

378
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,960
My goodness.

379
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,200
Have some ginger tea.

380
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,420
Thank you for the tea.

381
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,700
I was thinking about seeing you these days.

382
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,100
I bet you're worried that I might make trouble.

383
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,300
Yes!

384
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,300
I deserve to be treated like this. I deserve it!

385
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,790
The reason why I asked you to see me

386
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,900
was that I wanted to apologize to you.

387
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,160
I made a huge scar on Seo Yeon's heart and made Mr. Woo suffer so much.

388
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,670
About that, you should apologize to them first, not me.

389
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,800
I already did that.

390
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,360
I got scolded a lot by them, too.

391
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,200
Did you see Chae Woon?

392
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,790
Yes.

393
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,600
But I thought about it, and I feel sorry to you the most.

394
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,880
Back in the days, I made you take care of Seo Yeon,

395
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,860
so I feel like I dragged you down.

396
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,720
I thought about this from time to time throughout my life.

397
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,040
That I did such a horrible thing.

398
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,160
I'm surprised that you thought about that.

399
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,060
Of course, I'm human, too.

400
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,820
Right.

401
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:22,400
What you did shake up my life,

402
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:30,840
but I never regretted raising Chae Woon.

403
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:38,660
My Chae Woon was the best fortune that I ever had.

404
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,280
This kind of day comes in my life.

405
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:51,090
A day when you apologize to me.

406
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,450
Yes.

407
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,000
But my shortcoming is I do feel sorry, but I make another trouble--

408
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,800
- Oh, no! 
 - That is my biggest weakness.

409
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,120
You shouldn't be like that!

410
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:08,900
You really shouldn't be like that! You shouldn't block Chae Woon's new future.

411
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,510
Please, I ask you. Please don't be like that, okay?

412
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,760
Yes, I got it.

413
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,000
Ah, this is my small gift.

414
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,600
What is this?

415
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,000
I gave you a tremendous burden on your life, but there's no way I can pay you back,

416
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:33,300
and I don't have any money, so I just did what I can do.

417
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,000
Did you make all these by yourself?

418
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,470
You know that I'm good at making stuff with my hands.

419
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,190
Why don't you sit here for a second?

420
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,400
- Yes. 
 - I'll be back soon.

421
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,500
I wonder if this room is Seo Yeon's room?

422
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Who is it?

423
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,080
Seo Yeon!

424
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,770
How did you come here?

425
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,060
Did you make another trouble?

426
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,350
How can you come to my place?

427
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,140
- Seo Yeon, it's not like that. I was just... 
 - You should leave.

428
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,310
You should go. Get out, now!

429
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,420
Get out of my house!

430
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,660
Chae Woon!

431
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:15,360
I invited him to our place!

432
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:19,230
- It's too cold to talk outside. 
 - Mom.

433
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,580
Even so, how can you bring somebody like him into the house?

434
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,000
- Chae Woon, it's not like that. 
 - I'm sorry, but...

435
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,120
I want you to leave.

436
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,100
Right now.

437
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,600
Chae Woon! Listen to me.

438
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,370
- Chae Woon. 
 - I should get going.

439
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,260
Oh, wait. Park Pil Hong.

440
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,600
Please take this coat.

441
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,230
You look so cold.

442
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,600
It's okay. I'm sorry to disturb you.

443
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,300
- No, you should... 
 - I'm sorry, Seo Yeon.

444
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,650
Wait, Park Pil Hong!

445
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,480
Chae Woon. I invited him to our place!

446
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:04,040
  Why did you invite him over? Why?  

447
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,350
  Why do you bring such a person like him into our place!  

448
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,190
  Chae Woon, it's very cold outside!  

449
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,170
  - But you shouldn't bring such a person into here. 
 - Chae Woon!  

450
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,800
Park Pil Hong called me first to see each other.

451
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,950
He came to our neighborhood, and it didn't feel right to stand outside and talk.

452
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,500
So I told him to come inside.

453
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:37,290
How can you trust that kind of person and let him come inside?

454
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,500
He looked so cold.

455
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,780
Do you let anybody into the home just because it's cold?

456
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,350
Why is he anybody?

457
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,400
He's your birth father, Chae Woon.

458
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,760
He wasn't wearing enough and was shivering.

459
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:08,170
By the way, why did you come home so early today? Are you sick again?

460
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,660
No.

461
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,470
What's wrong?

462
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,870
Did something happen to you?

463
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,560
What is it, Chae Woon? What's going on?

464
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,870
Actually, I went to Jae Hee's mother's place to say hello.

465
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,570
And?

466
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,710
But Jae Hee's mother...

467
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:39,500
was concerned if Park Pil Hong might make another trouble.

468
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,530
So I told her it's not going to happen.

469
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:47,050
I said I asked him multiple times, and I made her feel better.

470
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,640
But while I was doing that, I thought,

471
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:57,640
why do I have to make these lame excuses because of him?

472
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:02,870
It made me feel pathetic.

473
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,370
That happened.

474
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:10,470
Because of him, Jae Hee's suffering so much right now,

475
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:14,260
and other people are all going through hard times,

476
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,980
but he's like an ember that never goes out and makes me feel anxious.

477
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,620
Mom, I have to go around and apologize to everybody on behalf of him.

478
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,270
Chae Woon.

479
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:32,880
Mr. Woo's mother can worry about that because she's his mother.

480
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,270
I know that, too.

481
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,340
I understand that, too.

482
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,270
I know that as well, but...

483
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,570
But mom...

484
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,400
But mom, it feels so weird.

485
00:37:50,270 --> 00:38:00,470
Other people think that Park Pil Hong is a big problem, a harmful person, and a worthless human being.

486
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,120
But then I also...

487
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,870
Actually, I also think that way.

488
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,610
But I really hate that other people also think that way. It's so strange.

489
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,070
It's okay, Chae Woon.

490
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,140
I understand how you feel.

491
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,150
I understand all of those feelings.

492
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,370
Mom, I feel terribly sorry for Jae Hee.

493
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:34,110
But even when I feel sorry for him, my own pride got hurt so badly as well.

494
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,580
I...

495
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,300
I wonder why I had to be born like this.

496
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,750
Why did a person like him had to show up as my father?

497
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,670
Chae Woon. It's okay...

498
00:38:54,770 --> 00:39:02,070
Yes. Just because Park Pil Hong is your father,

499
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:08,070
I know that you have to have him like a shadow in your life.

500
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:12,570
But that's not your fault, Chae Woon.

501
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:20,170
It's unfortunate, but you just have to pity him that he's making poor decisions,

502
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,470
and you can just live like that, Chae Woon.

503
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:27,240
The only thing that I'm concerned about is I don't want you to feel intimidated.

504
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:31,900
I don't want you to make yourself stressed out like this.

505
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,140
Yes.

506
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:40,770
Don't think like that. Okay?

507
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,770
Yes, I won't.

508
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,130
My Chae Woon, I'm sorry you're having a hard time.

509
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,010
My poor thing...

510
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,140
Don't think it that way and live proudly.

511
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,870
- I got it. 
 - Yes.

512
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,030
I got it, mom...

513
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,970
Let's go home, Hae Deun...

514
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,460
What is it?

515
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,570
  I'm going to stop by the fabric company and get off from work there.  

516
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,830
So now she wants to go separately?

517
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,190
She's too mean to me when we live in the same house.

518
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,280
- Live in the same house? 
 - Oh, my!

519
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,070
Why are you eavesdropping?

520
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:45,320
- Do you live in the Samgwang villa? 
 - Yes, why?

521
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,320
- The downstair's room? 
 - Yes, the downstair's room...

522
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:52,790
Oh, right. You were the one who used to live there. It's a cozy and nice room, why did you move out?

523
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,870
Please take care of Seo Ah today as well.

524
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:58,430
Why are you keep asking favors to me?

525
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,770
Do you want me to sleep at your place again?

526
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:04,470
I'll persuade Seo Ah and make her go back home tomorrow, so please take care of her one more time.

527
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:09,270
You don't look like a person asking a favor! How can you ask with your hands in the pocket?

528
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,470
Formally ask me again.

529
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,670
Please.

530
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,370
Yes, there you go.

531
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,870
I don't want to do it!

532
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:24,400
Please take care of her! Isn't it better than me going in there and sleep with her?

533
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,930
That's right. But seriously, who are you?

534
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,860
I'm a person who loves Seo Ah.

535
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,740
Ah... I understand that you love her, but why do you say it with your eyes like this?

536
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,970
- Please take care of her, hyungnim. 
 - Who told you to call me hyungnim?

537
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:47,500
You have to be nice to me! Do you know that?

538
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,540
She even has a pretty hand-writing.

539
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:08,270
Did I make a bad choice to postpone the offer from the big hospital?

540
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,310
Am I giving up my career again because of a guy?

541
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,160
That's not true!

542
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,500
I should support Hwak Se to become a singer,

543
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,870
and then let's take the offer. Just push it until then.

544
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:33,570
Right? For Hwak Se, just push it a little bit...

545
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,170
- Jjung-a! 
 - You surprised me!

546
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,330
What are you talking about it by yourself?

547
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,890
Where have you been?

548
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,920
Wait a minute.

549
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,120
Jjung-a, you look prettier underneath the streetlight!

550
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,070
What is it! I know I'm pretty.

551
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,150
Your face is glowing with the streetlight, too!

552
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:04,550
- Did you practice a lot? 
 - I did a ton! I sang whenever I thought of you.

553
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,190
You shouldn't do that.

554
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,420
You're thinking about me all the time.

555
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,990
So if you sing whenever you think of me, then you'll make a hole in your throat!

556
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:17,610
Oh, no! If I have a hole in my throat, I'll get zero points!

557
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:25,470
♫   It's good! It's very, very good   ♫ 
 - You're doing great!

558
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,760
Can you sing it one more time more powerfully?

559
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,190
♫   It's good! It's very, very good   ♫

560
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,600
  I know that we have to get a police investigation soon.  

561
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:59,770
  Whatever it is, I'll take over everything, and I won't let Seo Ah get any harm.  

562
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,780
Joon Ah oppa?

563
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,860
Did you come here today as well?

564
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,270
  Oppa, you're putting in an effort as well.  

565
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:42,570
Mom.

566
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:49,570
You should go home. I'm staying here.

567
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,750
Seo Ah.

568
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,380
Let's go home.

569
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,790
I don't want to.

570
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,940
I'm going to stay here.

571
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,200
I'm a daughter that you don't need anymore.

572
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:12,540
The person who understands me is only Hwang Na Ro now.

573
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:18,640
Why do you think like that, Seo Ah?

574
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,660
I'm...

575
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,030
sorry.

576
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:30,270
I'm sorry that I left you alone until you think this way.

577
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,420
I'm really, really sorry.

578
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,720
I'll try harder.

579
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:50,770
Do you really want to marry Hwang Na Ro?

580
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:56,770
If you like him that much, then I'll think about him again, okay?

581
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,550
Can you give me some time?

582
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,230
Mom...

583
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,490
Let's go home, Seo Ah.

584
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:12,340
Without you, Seo Ah,

585
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,860
I'm having a hard time.

586
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:21,250
I can't do anything without you, Seo Ah.

587
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,050
Mom! Mom...

588
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,190
Mom, I'm sorry...

589
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:35,770
No, Seo Ah...

590
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,710
I'm sorry.

591
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,170
Really? That's what my mom said to Chae Woon?

592
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,190
She didn't tell you anything?

593
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,370
I didn't hear anything.

594
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:56,060
I guess she didn't want to make you worry.

595
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,860
She was crying really hard with talking about Park Pil Hong.

596
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,920
Brother-in-law.

597
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:05,770
Yes.

598
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,930
From now on, I want you to protect her by her side, so she doesn't get sad like today.

599
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:17,680
It sounded like your mother is going to be a harsh mother-in-law.

600
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,390
A harsh mother-in-law...

601
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:24,100
She wouldn't be like that...

602
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:29,270
I bet. But don't tell my sister about this because I'll get in trouble! Okay?

603
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,660
Sure.

604
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,650
     

605
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:47,470
What are you doing here, Ra Hoon?

606
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:50,120
Why? Did you fight with Ba Reun again?

607
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,900
No.

608
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,150
- Little Noona. 
 - Yes?

609
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:04,070
- Nothing. Good night. 
 - Okay.

610
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:11,670
  Director Lee! I'm in my room right now, but I think I broke my leg! I can't move, help me!  

611
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,970
Mr. Makjang! What? Where is he?

612
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,800
I'm here.

613
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,630
- What is it? I thought you hurt yourself. 
 - Wait.

614
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,550
Why do you leave right away?

615
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:27,150
Can we talk for a second?

616
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,320
Just for a minute.

617
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,870
I'm not a stranger. Let's talk for a bit.

618
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,150
You still sit down for me. Thank you.

619
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:41,790
I, uh...

620
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,160
Can you give me your hand? Let's hold our hands and talk.

621
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,040
Why?

622
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:55,670
You can shake your hands with strangers, but can't we hold our hands? Will you hold hands and talk?

623
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,620
I have something to tell you.

624
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:01,030
Do you hate me?

625
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,470
You like me.

626
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:06,100
Am I wrong? I'm right.

627
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:10,060
Isn't what you're worried about is this?

628
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:16,070
You're worried and bothered that your older sister's birth mother is my mom, right?

629
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,880
But listen to me carefully.

630
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:22,410
Your sister's birth mother is my mom.

631
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:27,440
Then, she's going to be registered under my mom.

632
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:32,170
So legally and technically, you and Bit Chae Woon are not related.

633
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:36,010
So there's no reason for you to be worried about this. I thought about this for a long time!

634
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:37,750
That's true.

635
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,660
- Right? Am I right? 
 - That's right!

636
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,420
That's right!

637
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,900
- Right? I'm right about this. 
 - Yes!

638
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:47,370
- Is it solved now? 
 - Yes!

639
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:50,670
Are we dating again?

640
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,680
  I think I can take it as a positive sign when you put your index finger on the nose.  

641
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,600
  - So, are we dating again?   
 - I'll think about it.

642
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,470
What do you have to think about it? Hae Deun!

643
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:07,050
I guess we're dating again.

644
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:42,070
  Please take this with you. It's very cold.  

645
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,920
  It's okay. I'm sorry to disturb you.  

646
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:52,570
Moong-i.

647
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,070
Jae Hee, you didn't go to sleep yet?

648
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:58,410
I was waiting if you might come out.

649
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:00,540
Why?

650
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,590
Just because.

651
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,330
Just because.

652
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:20,160
What do you mean by 'just because?'

653
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,840
This place is nice.

654
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,330
Look at the kitchen!

655
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,100
This place is very cute.

656
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:46,070
Oh, we can't take this place. Bye-bye!

657
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,570
Why? Do you like this place?

658
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:50,520
How much is it?

659
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,450
Ah... If I could've made that contract happened!

660
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:00,670
Stop regretting that!

661
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,880
But I feel sorry to you.

662
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:07,700
You're putting more money into the house we're looking for right now.

663
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:11,100
We're going to live together, so what's wrong with that?

664
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,200
It's obvious for someone who can put more money should provide more.

665
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:18,030
And when you make more money, you can offer more.

666
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,170
Moong-i.

667
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:23,470
I'll make a ton of money soon and give you a luxurious life!

668
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:26,570
Just tell me! Do you want that building? I'll buy you everything!

669
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:30,370
Then I'm going to look up all those buildings right now!

670
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,890
- All of those! Write it down now. I'll buy you everything. 
 - Okay, I got it!

671
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:47,670
Jae Hee, I thought about this last night.

672
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:51,000
What about we do it this way with our future place?

673
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:55,720
Wait. You're not going to say we should live together in my room in the Samgwang villa, right?

674
00:52:55,870 --> 00:53:00,770
I think that's a good idea, too, but the second floor is too crowded, so no.

675
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,590
Then what is it?

676
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,400
Let's rent the second floor in your father's house.

677
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,420
M-Moong-i...

678
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:18,470
I came out of that place right after high school because I hate my father.

679
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:20,370
But you're saying we should live together with him after we get married?

680
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,720
That's why I'm suggesting this more.

681
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,130
I know that you moved out from there because you don't have a good relationship with your father.

682
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,170
But the time passed in that way.

683
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:34,580
This time your father went to see you at the Incheon site,

684
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:38,460
and he found your friend Bum Jin and made the misunderstanding straight.

685
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:47,580
All those things, I think he wants to get rid of any bad emotional baggage between you and him.

686
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:53,160
I think that was like that, too, but--

687
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:54,960
See? You think like that too.

688
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:59,080
So I think now is our turn to respond to his gesture.

689
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:03,970
But do we have to do that by living together?

690
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:07,780
I think you wanted to do that as well.

691
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,810
But you just didn't have a chance to do it.

692
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:17,530
When he was James, you were so kind to him.

693
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:21,030
So I think you have tons of feelings that you want to do that.

694
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,000
I think it'll be uncomfortable for you.

695
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,120
No! I'm living with a lot of people right now in Samgwang villa as well.

696
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:33,590
Also, I already experienced living with your father in the same house.

697
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:44,950
Of course, this is all possible when your father allows this.

698
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:46,970
I don't think he'll approve this.

699
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,570
At my place?

700
00:54:53,660 --> 00:55:00,650
Yes, father. We looked for a place to live, but it was hard to find with our money.

701
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,720
So I thought what if we rent the second floor in your house.

702
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,870
Well, I don't know.

703
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:17,570
I guess you're uncomfortable about this. We don't have to do that.

704
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:21,870
See, Moong-i? Let's go find a place to rent.

705
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:26,470
Then should I lend you money to get a place? You can pay me that money back every month, too.

706
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,970
Father, I didn't say this with that purpose.

707
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,020
Didn't you?

708
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:37,330
Father, just for one year!

709
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:41,970
I think we can save more money by then.

710
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:44,070
Well, I don't know.

711
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:47,370
Moong-i, my father doesn't like the idea. Let's go.

712
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,660
When did I hate it? Moong-i--

713
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,770
Why do I hate the idea of living with Chae Woon?

714
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,290
I'm worried that you guys might feel uncomfortable.

715
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,160
We're totally fine, father! Right?

716
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:07,770
- Really? 
 - Of course! Right?

717
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:14,470
Then let's do it this way.

718
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:20,070
Don't think of taking care of me as your father-in-law,

719
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:26,170
but let's live like when we lived in Samgwang villa together, keeping each other's privacy. How does that sound?

720
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:30,690
Sounds amazing. Keeping each other's privacy, I'll keep that in mind.

721
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:33,870
Then are we settled..?

722
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:35,470
It's settled!

723
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,040
Yes, that's great! It's settled!

724
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,440
It's settled!

725
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:42,970
You...

726
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,700
Any suspicious following?

727
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:15,370
- There was nobody. 
 - That's good.

728
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:20,170
- Then it's finally just two of us for the Sunday date! 
 - It's a date!

729
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:24,820
- What are we doing today? 
 - I made a list for today.

730
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,990
- Are we doing all this today? 
 - We can totally do it!

731
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:32,970
By the way, shouldn't we announce that we're in a relationship before my sister's wedding?

732
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:37,560
Are you going to ruin Jae Hee and Bit Chae Woon's wedding?

733
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:41,040
Let's tell people after their wedding is done. Sounds good?

734
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,600
- I got it! 
 - Okay, let's go.

735
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:52,550
- Is it real what I just saw? 
 - Yes.

736
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:57,180
We just found the fourth couple in Samgwang villa.

737
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,080
- We're the third, and they're the fourth? 
 - Exactly.

738
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:10,500
The CEO said we should meet up here.

739
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:14,140
- At here? 
 - Yes...

740
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:21,220
Can we see a different size than this?

741
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,770
Chae Woon!

742
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:27,470
- Welcome, Soon Jung. 
 - Yes, CEO.

743
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,790
I think Jae Hee will arrive soon, too.

744
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,580
  - Mother! How are you?  
 - Hello!

745
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,150
I didn't know we're going to meet here.

746
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:39,190
- Isn't this place where you give the talk? 
 - Right.

747
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:40,740
Oh, is that so?

748
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,010
This place is very pretty.

749
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:46,720
It's so convenient that we can buy everything at once!

750
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:51,520
I got a quote to suit the size of your future house,

751
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:56,670
but you should look around with Jae Hee first. Let me know what you like. I'll get you everything you want.

752
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,510
Yes, but mom, I didn't know we're going to come to this place today...

753
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,770
What are you talking about the size of the house?

754
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,090
Oh, the place where they will live. You can see this catalog.

755
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,500
- Mother, we're-- 
 - Manager.

756
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:14,770
- Can you tour them around here? 
   - Yes, please come this way.  

757
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,320
Let's go.

758
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:27,640
If you finish the molding and the window frames with the same color as the kitchen furniture that I showed you earlier,

759
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,450
you can make the interior more luxurious.

760
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:33,170
This is a very nice one... It's great.

761
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,140
Why don't we go over there?

762
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,790
I knew this was coming when she asked us to come out today.

763
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:50,070
  I knew it.  

764
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:56,020
My legs hurt!

765
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,060
This place is so huge!

766
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,950
We walked around a lot but didn't get anything.

767
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,690
They are saying no to everything.

768
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:10,470
Even though Jae Hee's expert on this, how can they choose it easily on expensive interior stuff?

769
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:14,430
That's why I already set up on everything!

770
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:19,610
Mom, actually, we got a bit surprised today.

771
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:25,910
We thought we're just gathering today to talk about wedding planning, but these are too expensive for us...

772
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:30,400
Yes, mother. We don't have space to put these expensive things at our place.

773
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:33,650
Right, there's nothing to work on the second floor!

774
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:38,370
If you change the window frames and the doors, then it'll change the mood.

775
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:41,140
What? The room on the second floor?

776
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,190
You didn't know about this?

777
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,850
What about you, Soon Jung?

778
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:51,170
Mom, I was going to tell you about this today when we see each other in person.

779
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:57,470
Ah, yes. We think we're going to rent the second floor of my father's house.

780
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,140
What?

781
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:04,670
- I already got the place for you guys! 
 - Mom, that's a bit...

782
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,950
Yes, I think we'll feel more comfortable living in a place where we can afford it.

783
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,450
I'm sorry to say this when you made an effort.

784
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:13,860
CEO.

785
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:23,860
I also think we should let them start their life that suits their budget.

786
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,750
How can they live at the father-in-law's place?

787
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:30,740
Hey! That house is huge! They can totally live together.

788
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:35,670
Soon Jung. Did you know about this?

789
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:41,070
Yes, I heard about it on the way here.

790
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,670
Mom.

791
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:01,070
- I guess you're angry. 
 - I don't know.

792
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,800
I wanted to do the best for you this time.

793
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,860
I know how you feel.

794
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:13,360
But if we receive so much from you in our situation, then we'll be uncomfortable, and that's not right for you as well.

795
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:15,090
But still!

796
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:17,880
You could've given me a chance.

797
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,730
There will be tons of chances you can help us in the future!

798
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:22,960
From now on, I'll discuss it with you first.

799
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:29,450
I know how busy you are, but you looked at a house and furniture for us.

800
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:31,490
Thank you so much.

801
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:36,660
But can you really live in Jae Hee's father's house?

802
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:39,860
Yes! We actually talked about something like this as well.

803
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:44,720
We live at his father's place, and then we live at your home, and then we live at my other mom's place,

804
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,920
and then we live at mother-in-law's place? Like this.

805
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,170
My goodness! It's easy to say it.

806
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:56,070
- You guys should take good care of your lives. 
 - So...

807
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:59,010
So, please forgive me just this time.

808
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:01,250
I don't know! I feel left out.

809
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:04,270
Next time, I'm really going to discuss anything with you first.

810
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:08,700
Okay.

811
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:15,970
♫   It's good! It's very, very good   ♫

812
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:18,470
It's good, but I think you should put more power in your eyes.

813
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:24,550
♫   It's good! It's very, very good   ♫ 
 - You're playing around too much this time.

814
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,200
♫   It's good--!   ♫

815
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:32,570
Noonim, we were practicing...

816
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:35,450
- Right... 
  - Unni! Where's Bit Chae?

817
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:39,070
She's going to look around more with Mr. Woo.

818
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,930
Ah, I knew you went to see their future house stuff, right?

819
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:46,530
When you said you're going out to see Jung Won unni, I knew that was coming.

820
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:53,100
Unni, Jung Won unni said she's going to buy everything, right?

821
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:58,370
How great is it? Just pretend you can't win and let her buy everything.

822
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:05,370
  - Unni!   
 - I think she's in a terrible mood.

823
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:09,460
I knew what's coming when she said mothers are going to gather.

824
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,470
I knew this was going to happen.

825
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:15,670
I bet rich Jung Won unni must have shown off her money.

826
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:18,180
And Min Jae unni would've assisted more.

827
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:22,860
Ah, then noonim must be in a bad mood.

828
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,390
What can we do?

829
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:29,670
If I were her, I think it'll be great if somebody says they'll pay for everything.

830
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:34,500
People with money spend more money, and people with less money pay less. That's how people should do it.

831
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:39,360
Since she's not in a good, we should go upstairs and sing.

832
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:41,170
It's not good right now.

833
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:46,770
Don't you think it's good to receive when we can't afford much?

834
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:02,870
  Can we see a different size than this?  

835
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,690
Yes.

836
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,440
I already expected this.

837
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:21,900
I should just do my best to make stuff like this for her.

838
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:39,760
Ah, I thought getting married is simple as pick a wedding date and get ready for that,

839
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,480
but there's a strange battle between parents.

840
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:44,270
I know.

841
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:49,150
I think both of my moms weren't feeling great.

842
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:51,870
I know, and my mom as well.

843
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,820
Since it's an important event, I guess everybody gets extra sensitive.

844
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,090
Did we get sensitive as well?

845
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:03,300
Did we?

846
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:09,680
No, there's the most important course that we have to go through, so we have to buckle up.

847
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:13,370
Yes, we should. Cheer up!

848
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,070
Let's go.

849
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:53,280
How do I look?

850
01:06:54,170 --> 01:07:00,170
You look very beautiful. No, beautiful is not enough to describe you.

851
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:02,290
You look gorgeous.

852
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:11,490
Chae Woon.

853
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,300
Let's be happy together.

854
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,220
I love you.

855
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,520
I love you, too, Jae Hee.

856
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:36,470
♫  I love you, I like you  ♫

857
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:41,570
- You still haven't memorized it? Look at me. 
 - Like this?

858
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,820
No, not like that!

859
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:49,670
♫  As we change as the time passes  ♫

860
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:53,680
♫  In my eyes, to me  ♫

861
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:58,970
♫  You only sparkle to me  ♫

862
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:05,270
- Jung Won! 
 - Yes, Min Jae.

863
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:07,280
- Hello! 
 - Hello.

864
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:12,750
♫  I love you  ♫

865
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:20,370
♫   I think about the time we had, and it makes me feel touched   ♫

866
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:28,870
♫   On a sunny day or a rainy day, you are the one I was always together   ♫ 
 - Thank you for coming!

867
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:37,470
♫   Even just looking at your eyes, I can feel our deepened faith   ♫

868
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:47,270
♫   Now we are going to dream the same dream and live the rest of our lives together   ♫

869
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:52,770
♫   I love you, I like you   ♫

870
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:58,160
♫   I only trust you   ♫

871

♫   As we change as the time passes   ♫

872
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:15,250
♫   In my eyes, to me, you are the only one sparkles to me   ♫

873
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,870
     

874
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:19,350
  Hello, everyone. I'm finally getting married.  

875
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,330
  We'll live happily together!  

876
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:23,970
  I wish you to be happy, Seo Yeon...  

877
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:26,160
  Hello, CEO.  

878
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:28,270
  Hae Deun, you're acting weird from last time.  

879
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:30,470
  You don't know anything about this, CEO!  

880
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,130
  Then why don't you do everything by yourself?  

881
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:34,070
  Oh, no. I'm sorry!  

882
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:35,960
  Mother, father, please take our bow.  

883
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:40,860
  If you have any problem living with your father-in-law, please let me know at any time!  

884
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:42,420
  Is it already morning? Wake up, wake up!  

885
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:45,000
  Father, are you making breakfast?  

886
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:46,330
  It's the welcome breakfast!  

887
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:50,170
  - We'll make breakfast tomorrow! 
 - I've also made a schedule for us.  

888
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,270
  Is the "babies" represents us?  

889
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:56,190
  I heard that director Jang and secretary Hwang Na Ro got a police investigation.  

890
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:59,450
  She collapsed after coming out from the police investigation.  

891
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,620
  - Mom... 
 - Did grandmother collapse?
