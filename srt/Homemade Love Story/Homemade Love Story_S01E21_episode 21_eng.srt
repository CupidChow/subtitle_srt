1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,030
Chae Woon!

2
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,410
Chae Woon!

3
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,570
 

4
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,620
Chae Woon!

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,890
Chae Woon!

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,610
Chae Woon!

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,400
Chae Woon!

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,520
Chae Woon...

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,340
Chae Woon...

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,960
Ahjumma, are you okay?

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,840
Ahjumma...

12
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,600
I'm glad you left, my daughter.

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,180
I'm glad you left.

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,200
I'm glad you left, 
my daughter, Chae Woon...

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,900
One, two, three!

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,260
Hae Deun.

17
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,250
- Oh, my!
- Hae Deun.

18
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,710
Why does he think of me
 when he sees that?

19
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,550
Yay!

20
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,030
 No, no. 

21
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,420
Unni!

22
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,110
Mom, where did you go?

23
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,310
Outside.

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,630
Where did Chae Woon go?

25
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,360
Is she in the bathroom?

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,630
Chae Woon?

27
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,980
An urgent matter came up 
at the construction site.

28
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,400
She left in a rush.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,620
Again?

30
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,110
I gave her a jacket.

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,690
Gosh, my unni is such a workaholic.

32
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,630
It must be so hard on her.

33
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,340
You guys, play.

34
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,970
- Oh, okay.
- I'm going into my room.

35
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,270
Eems hyung, your face
 looked so funny.

36
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,140
- I did that earlier.
- You really didn't seem to know.

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,800
You're such a stickler.

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,340
- We'll do it this time.
- Is that right?

39
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,370
 It's our turn. 

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,660
 No, you can't. 

41
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,350
 It's our turn. 

42
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,690
 One person should be out. 

43
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,770
 One, two, three. 

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,700
What?

45
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,440
Unni, did you run without shoes?

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,470
No, no.

47
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,760
I got Chae Woon...

48
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,800
her jacket.

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,000
I lost my slippers.

50
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,290
Gosh.

51
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,170
Ouch.

52
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,570
Geez...

53
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,250
It hurts.

54
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,600
Aigoo, you should be careful.

55
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Stay still.

56
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,230
Gosh...

57
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,900
Unni, did Bit Chae leave?

58
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,990
Did she go to 
Jung Won unni's house?

59
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,180
Of course, she'd go.

60
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,860
With her personality.

61
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,160
You were so pathetic as 
you begged her to leave.

62
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,440
I'd leave, too.

63
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,030
She must've thought, "I have to leave
 for my mom to come to her sense."

64
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,430
That's why she left.

65
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,050
It's not like that.

66
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,010
She should go.

67
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,180
It's the right thing.

68
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,750
It will hurt.

69
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,670
Bear it.

70
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,400
Since your heart is ripping apart,

71
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,600
you don't feel this at all, huh?

72
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,720
 Idiot! 

73
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,350
 What, idiot? 

74
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,500
They're having a ball.

75
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,700
Yeah, Unni.

76
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,700
Cry when you're with me.

77
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,420
You can cry.

78
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,230
Unni, just express yourself and relax.

79
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,390
Cry out loud. You can make noise.

80
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,550
Okay?

81
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,310
It all worked out. Why would I cry?

82
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,220
It all worked out.

83
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,190
I'm glad she left.

84
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,200
I'm glad she left. 
My Chae Woon. I'm glad...

85
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,950
What the heck?

86
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,960
It worked out for the best.

87
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,720
 

88
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,440
Hi, what's up, Lee Hae Deun?

89
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,700
Unni, what's going on?

90
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,350
You left without telling us.

91
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,200
Chae Woon noona?

92
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,440
Hey, sorry.

93
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,230
I got an urgent call from the site.

94
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,610
I didn't want to break up 
the party by telling you.

95
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,660
Chae Woon noona!

96
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,520
Are you dressed warmly?

97
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,790
Isn't it cold over there?

98
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,140
Hey...

99
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,060
It's not cold at all.

100
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,850
I've layered so many clothes that,

101
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,250
I'm all round.

102
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,790
How is Mom?

103
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,760
Mom? She's in her room.

104
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,920
She's okay, right?

105
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,440
 Yeah. Why? 

106
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,000
Pay more attention to her. Got it?

107
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,130
Gosh, did you go somewhere
 far away or something?

108
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,830
No matter how much
 I pay attention to her,

109
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,060
I can't compare to you. So, you 
come and take care of her.

110
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,950
Right, you should take care of her.

111
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,410
 Hae Deun doesn't compare to you. 

112
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,350
Hey...

113
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,130
I have to work. I'm hanging up.

114
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,020
Okay. Take care.

115
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,810
Chae Woon, watch out, 
so you don't catch a cold.

116
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,380
 I love you lots! 

117
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,210
 You should love me
 like that, Lee Ra Hoon. 

118
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,930
 Why would I love you? 

119
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,250
 I'm your sister, too. 

120
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,200
 Wait a minute. 

121
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,850
 Let go. 

122
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,040
 - Let go, Chae Woon.
- Wait a minute! 

123
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,600
 Chae Woon... 

124
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,930
 Chae Woon. 

125
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,640
I'll get it.

126
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,290
Bit Chae Woon?

127
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,270
What the heck?

128
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,490
Seo Ah...

129
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,350
what's wrong? Who is it?

130
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,480
No, Mom.

131
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
Who is it?

132
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,700
Step aside.

133
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,300
Seo Yeon?

134
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,400
Seo Yeon... Seo Yeon!

135
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,900
Mom.

136
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,780
- Is someone here?
- I don't know!

137
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,700
Seo Yeon...

138
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,320
Bit Chae Woon.

139
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,510
Hello.

140
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm sorry to come over 
all of a sudden.

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,100
I...

142
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,940
came to live here.

143
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,840
I came too suddenly, right?

144
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,130
- Should I come back in the morning?
- No.

145
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,970
No, Seo Yeon.

146
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,310
I'm glad you came.

147
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,810
I'm glad you came, Seo Yeon.

148
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,150
I'm glad you came, Seo Yeon.

149
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,480
I'm glad you came.

150
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,030
Why, princess?

151
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,480
Is something the matter?

152
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,530
Grandma!

153
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,980
What do I do?

154
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,160
What?

155
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,100
Are you sick, my princess?

156
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,350
Huh?

157
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,500
Is someone here?

158
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,750
Wait...

159
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,580
Who is this?

160
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,890
Bit Chae Woon.

161
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,950
What?

162
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,030
 Is she Seo Yeon? 

163
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,400
Mom.

164
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,520
This is...

165
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,850
This is my...

166
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,730
Hello.

167
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,680
I'm Lee Bit Chae Woon.

168
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,710
Bit Chae Woon?

169
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,960
It's Seo Yeon.

170
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,760
Your maternal grandmother.

171
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,660
 This is... 

172
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,440
 the one who called? 

173
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,670
 I told you it'd be over if 
you take the blame, Soon Jung. 

174
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,230
 What do you want to accomplish by 
bringing Seo Yeon to our family now? 

175
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,350
 She's Park Pil Hong,
 that scumbag's seed. 

176
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,020
My gosh.

177
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,910
Seo... Seo Yeon?

178
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,350
Gosh...

179
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,070
What nonsense is this?

180
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,910
This is Seo Yeon?

181
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,930
How could a dead child 
come back to life?

182
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,810
Where did you find a weirdo and

183
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,250
rambling on right now?

184
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,720
Aigoo...

185
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,170
Oh, no, Grandma!

186
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,820
Your blood pressure...

187
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,060
Ms. Jo!

188
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,340
Bring some water for Grandma!

189
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,680
Aigoo...

190
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,800
Oh, no...

191
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,700
This is Seo Yeon.

192
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,100
We ran the DNA test...

193
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,660
and we confirmed that 
she's my child.

194
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,530
What?

195
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,270
What did you say?

196
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,560
Gosh...

197
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,960
Then...

198
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,280
you're...

199
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,020
really Seo Yeon?

200
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,450
She's really Seo Yeon.

201
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,880
Aigoo...

202
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,850
Are you...

203
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,510
really my granddaughter...

204
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,620
Are you really Seo Yeon?

205
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,480
Yeah.

206
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,260
She's really Seo Yeon.

207
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,200
Aigoo...

208
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,350
Aigoo...

209
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,480
My goodness!

210
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,570
Aigoo, Seo Yeon. Seo Yeon...

211
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,780
You were alive.

212
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,800
You were alive!

213
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,950
Where and how did you survive?

214
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,040
Aigoo...

215
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,190
Aigoo, thank you, God!

216
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,520
Thank you.

217
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,550
Aigoo, thank you, God.

218
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,960
My Seo Yeon!

219
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,770
Let me see you.

220
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,620
Let me see you, Seo Yeon.

221
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,860
Who do you take after?

222
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,370
My goodness.

223
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,040
You look like your grandfather.

224
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,250
Right, Jung Won?

225
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,260
She's tall and slender.

226
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,480
She's just like your father.

227
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,890
Aigoo, Seo Yeon. Seo Yeon...

228
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,110
Seo Yeon...

229
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,150
Calm down.

230
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,090
- Aigoo, Seo Yeon.
- Seo Yeon is taken aback.

231
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,710
Right?

232
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,400
Let's sit down, my granddaughter.

233
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,600
Come here.

234
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Come here.

235
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,750
Aigoo.

236
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,430
Aigoo...

237
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,580
Here. Come and sit down.

238
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,010
Aigoo, my goodness.

239
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,590
Your hands are so cold.

240
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,070
Ms. Jo, bring out something warm.

241
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,160
Aigoo.

242
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,410
You should call your mom first.

243
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,040
Tell her you arrived safely.

244
00:14:58,770 --> 00:14:59,760
Okay.

245
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,010
Mom?

246
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,130
You're the mom...

247
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,990
what mom?

248
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,560
Soon Jung.

249
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,180
Do you remember Soon Jung, Mom?

250
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,980
Soon Jung...

251
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,110
raised Chae Woon.

252
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,950
What, Soon... Soon Jung?

253
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,670
What is this I'm hearing?

254
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,210
Why did Soon Jung
 raise your daughter?

255
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,730
How could she dare 
raise your daughter?

256
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,770
Aigoo...

257
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,740
Aigoo, my gosh.

258
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,610
I'll call her first.

259
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,640
Okay.

260
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,370
Seo Ah.

261
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,480
Aigoo.

262
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,700
Gosh, is this a dream or for real?

263
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,660
 Grandma can't help it in the face
 of her own bloodline, huh? 

264
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,860
Aigoo.

265
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,450
 

266
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,290
Yes, Young Lady.

267
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,760
Soon Jung.

268
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,750
Seo Yeon...

269
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,540
Bit Chae Woon arrived safely.

270
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,950
Oh, I see.

271
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,940
She got there okay.

272
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,280
I'm sorry...

273
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,080
for sending Chae Woon...

274
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,040
out of the blue like that.

275
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,160
She thought her siblings 
would be sad if they knew,

276
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,280
so she just left dressed like that.

277
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,820
Yeah.

278
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,690
As for Chae Woon's 
clothes and things,

279
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,970
I'll pack up and send them over.

280
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,080
No, take your time, Soon Jung.

281
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,400
Here.

282
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,600
Drink.

283
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,000
Drink.

284
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,820
Slowly. Drink slowly.

285
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,700
Aigoo...

286
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,050
Aigoo, my granddaughter...

287
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,850
My blood...

288
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,200
Where and how did you live?

289
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,500
My goodness...

290
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,060
Your hands are rough.

291
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,450
What did you do to make a living?

292
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,090
You really don't know...

293
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,100
where and how I lived?

294
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What?

295
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,760
Wait. What are you talking about?

296
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,650
Gosh.

297
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,450
As for me...

298
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,320
I buried you...

299
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,550
in my heart a long time ago,

300
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,020
and I have never forgotten 
you since then.

301
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,880
You knew that I was living as

302
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,450
Lee Soon Jung's daughter.

303
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,700
What?

304
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,340
Gosh...

305
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,160
What are you talking about?

306
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,770
Thirty years ago,

307
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,840
Lee Soon Jung worked 
next door to you.

308
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,640
I know Soon Jung.

309
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,420
Earlier, Jung Won said...

310
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,250
Your mom said the same thing.

311
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,520
What is it you're saying?

312
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,050
Oh...

313
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,580
So...

314
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,430
Soon Jung...

315
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,750
She stole you back then, right?

316
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,500
Oh, my goodness.

317
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,790
My goodness, 
that wretched woman.

318
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,590
- Grandma.
- My gosh.

319
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,560
That's not true.

320
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,720
You know everything.

321
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,320
What?

322
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,820
Yes, Soon Jung.

323
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,350
A little later,

324
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,600
Bit Chae Woon will call you.

325
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,910
Right now, her grandma
 is talking to her

326
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,770
 and won't let her go. 

327
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,210
Madam...

328
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,850
is at your house?

329
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,990
 Yeah. 

330
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,910
I was so stressed out over
 Bit Chae Woon issue,

331
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,750
so I kept calling her

332
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,650
and bothered her.

333
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,330
 She came running. 

334
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,690
What does...

335
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,440
Madam say?

336
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,670
She's in shock.

337
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,590
She almost fainted earlier.

338
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,290
 But she's so happy right now. 

339
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,090
 She's so touched. 

340
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,960
Then Soon Jung...

341
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,670
Chae Woon will 
call you a little later.

342
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,620
Okay.

343
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,790
Talk to you later.

344
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,710
Madam is with 
Chae Woon right now?

345
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,880
What should I do?

346
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,920
By chance...

347
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,720
she wouldn't say something strange
 to Chae Woon, would she?

348
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,020
Wait, Madam had called?

349
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,850
 

350
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,480
 

351
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,950
When did she call?

352
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,220
My gosh, then...

353
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,370
My Chae Woon answered...

354
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,240
That's why...

355
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,430
That's why Chae Woon left.

356
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,690
That's why Chae Woon left.

357
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,810
What on earth 
are you talking about?

358
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,070
The phone call you made earlier...

359
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,700
I had answered it.

360
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,370
Because you said something
 so unbelievable,

361
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,760
I was in complete shock.

362
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,120
What?

363
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,100
What phone call 
are you talking about?

364
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,850
I lost contact with Soon Jung
 a long time ago.

365
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,260
"It'd be over if you take the blame."

366
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,940
That's what you said.

367
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,030
What?

368
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,750
What did you say?

369
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,960
That's why I came here.

370
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,800
Before my mom
 takes all the blame,

371
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,200
I wanted to make things right.

372
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,050
You...

373
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,240
How could you...

374
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,650
How could you say 
something so terrible?

375
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,960
I was...

376
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,330
going to say this
 in front of the CEO,

377
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,660
but I held back.

378
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,690
I didn't want to shock the CEO.

379
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,910
Gosh...

380
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,270
what...

381
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,510
what did I...

382
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,920
what did I say?

383
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,860
Aigoo...

384
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,670
Aigoo...

385
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,830
Grandma!

386
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,390
Grandma, what's wrong?

387
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,550
- Aigoo.
- Are you okay?

388
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,940
Aigoo, princess.

389
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,550
She's saying such 
a strange thing to me.

390
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,070
What strange thing?

391
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,880
Mom.

392
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,930
What's wrong?

393
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,510
She's not feeling well, Mom.

394
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,920
- Aigoo.
- Mom.

395
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,370
What's wrong?

396
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,560
Jung Won.

397
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,690
Are you sure she's your daughter?

398
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,740
She's saying such a reckless thing.

399
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,040
What did she say?

400
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,400
She received...

401
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,300
a strange call from someone,

402
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,820
and she's spewing nonsense to me.

403
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,910
Aigoo.

404
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,620
Aigoo, my head. Aigoo...

405
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,630
- Grandma, calm down.
- My head...

406
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,280
What do I do, my grandma?

407
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,510
Chae Woon.

408
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,310
Gosh.

409
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,950
What phone call?

410
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,640
Did you receive a phone call?

411
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,790
Huh?

412
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,480
My goodness...

413
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,690
Aigoo, my goodness...

414
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,000
Aigoo.

415
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,370
I must've been mistaken.

416
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,740
An elder had called 
my mom earlier,

417
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,390
and I thought it was Grandma.

418
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,410
Gosh, nonsense.

419
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,330
There's no way.

420
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,280
Mom, you knew nothing 
of Soon Jung.

421
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,810
That's right!

422
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,820
That's why I'm saying 
this is weird.

423
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,930
Aigoo.

424
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,290
Grandma...

425
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,210
Grandma, calm down.

426
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,100
What to do, my grandma...

427
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,690
Aigoo.

428
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,710
Aigoo, so weird.

429
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,460
There's something there.

430
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,650
Something is going on between

431
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,080
Grandma and Soon Jung ahjumma.

432
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,530
 Whoa! 

433
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,640
 For real. Daebak. Is this for real? 

434
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,910
 Unni. 

435
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,620
 There's a pond here. 

436
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,010
Lee Hae Deun.

437
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,010
She'd love to see this place.

438
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,140
Bit Chae Woon.

439
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,630
You're ridiculous.

440
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,850
How could you think of coming to
 our house dressed the way you are?

441
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,320
I wanted to dress nicely,

442
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,610
but I didn't want 
my siblings to notice.

443
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,990
They stick to me like gum.

444
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,450
Even by deceiving your siblings,

445
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,740
you wanted to move
 into our house?

446
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,180
And in a rush like this?

447
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,290
Yeah.

448
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,090
I had to take care of a matter.

449
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,340
Take care of what?

450
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,450
You'll find out later.

451
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,920
You're...

452
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,760
determined, huh?

453
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,150
You took away my mom and 
even Jae Hee oppa from me.

454
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,260
You're determined to take 
everything away from me, huh?

455
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,910
Seo Ah.

456
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,190
You weren't dating Jae Hee.

457
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,540
No!

458
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,810
We might as well have been dating.

459
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,860
Even before you got to
 know Jae Hee oppa,

460
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,090
I liked him ever since I was little.

461
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,170
If it weren't for you,

462
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,560
if you hadn't appeared,

463
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,090
we could be dating.

464
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,420
Only if it weren't for you!

465
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,680
Are you leaving now?

466
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,230
This late at night?

467
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,050
Rather than staying here

468
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,890
to get disappointed by
 that child and get sick,

469
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,170
I'd work on composure

470
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,580
and will come back.

471
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,090
Mom!

472
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:24,160
What exactly did 
Bit Chae Woon say to you?

473
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,380
It's not what she said.

474
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,760
Anyway,

475
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,720
I just don't like the air about her.

476
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,990
To look out for something to gain,

477
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,210
her eyes sparkle.

478
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,080
She's just like her father.

479
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,310
I get a bad feeling about her.

480
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,080
Gosh.

481
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,570
That's weird.

482
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,180
Bit Chae Woon seems to be
 holding something to herself,

483
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,390
and you're glossing over as well.

484
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,440
Since Bit Chae Woon is 
so thoughtful,

485
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,490
I'm sure she's not saying it.

486
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,950
Look at this.

487
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,880
You totally fell for her already.

488
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,850
So, Soon Jung raised that child?

489
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,550
Gosh.

490
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,340
Soon Jung, that lowly girl.

491
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,840
How did she educate the child?

492
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,900
Mom, don't you know 
how Soon Jung is?

493
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,150
You know.

494
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,530
From a long time ago,

495
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,350
you said there's no 
housekeeper like Soon Jung.

496
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,090
You wanted to take her 
away from Min Jae's.

497
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,780
You said that all the time.

498
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,300
Soon Jung is still the same.

499
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,700
She's still kind,

500
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,840
isn't calculative.

501
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,530
Aigoo! You fool!

502
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,490
- No wonder you fell for Park Pil Hong...
- Mom!

503
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,850
Aigoo.

504
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,750
Gosh, you scared me.

505
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,080
Please!

506
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,310
Please don't talk about that!

507
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,150
What's going on?

508
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,700
I'm right.

509
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,190
You're dating 
Jae Hee oppa on purpose.

510
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,580
To take revenge on my family.

511
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,770
You know I'm right!

512
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,120
Hey, Jang Seo Ah.

513
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,340
What kind of nonsense is that?

514
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,510
That's why you barged 
into my house!

515
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,930
I'm right! You know I'm right!

516
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,390
Aigoo.

517
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,300
- Aigoo, princess.
- Seo Ah!

518
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,560
Aigoo...

519
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,060
What's wrong, princess?

520
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,340
Grandma.

521
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,720
She's...

522
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,300
She's here to take revenge...

523
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,280
Thinking that my mom 
abandoned her!

524
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,710
She's here to take revenge.

525
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,850
She took my boyfriend, too!

526
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,560
Jang Seo Ah!

527
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,580
She's trying to take
 everything from me.

528
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,490
That's what she's 
doing, Grandma!

529
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,950
- That's what she's doing!
- Aigoo.

530
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,530
Get out!

531
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,840
- Calm down.
 - Seo Ah!

532
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,030
Seo Ah!

533
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,320
- Ms. Jo!
- My princess.

534
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,960
Seo Ah, Seo Ah!

535
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,190
Seo Ah...

536
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,380
Aigoo.

537
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,200
Wake up, Seo Ah.

538
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,770
Yes, Woo Jung Hoo.

539
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,680
I'll take care of you.

540
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,610
I'll make sure you 
get your memory back.

541
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,470
 

542
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,750
 

543
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,420
Woo Jung Hoo, you did try.

544
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,790
You must've been upset, 
miser Woo Jung Hoo.

545
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,940
You wasted an undershirt.

546
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,960
 It was nice to meet you. 

547
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,670
You're not an undershirt...

548
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,940
why do you have holes
 in your memory?

549
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,610
That Beautiful Woman...

550
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,340
Why did she look at me so sadly?

551
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,880
 Don't you remember this place? 

552
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,750
 This is my father's company. 

553
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,900
 Why are you here, Honey? 

554
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,910
I must look so similar 
to that Beautiful Woman's

555
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,990
husband she divorced.

556
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,250
If I have...

557
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,120
a wife...

558
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,510
would she be that sad?

559
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,040
 - Min Jae!
- What, Woo Jung Hoo? 

560
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,760
Oh.

561
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,680
 Because I liked you. 

562
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,850
 Because I loved you! 

563
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,010
 How can you cause so much 
trouble for one woman? 

564
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,670
 Do you think I called 
because I wanted to? 

565
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,310
 Woo Jae Hee! 

566
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,150
Woo Jae Hee?

567
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,170
So what you're saying is...

568
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,440
that I'm totally wrong?

569
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,020
Park Seo Yeon is someone

570
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,720
- when you were in Netherland...
- Spain.

571
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,400
She was your girlfriend while 
you were studying in Spain.

572
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,830
That ahjumma Hae Deun saw

573
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,480
at her sandwich shop is

574
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,890
someone you don't know.

575
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,410
That's right.

576
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,170
And finding Bit Chae Woon's cellphone

577
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,700
and dropping it off at 
your office is a coincidence.

578
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:51,880
 Headbutt, there's no answer for her. 

579
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,110
 Good day. 

580
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,990
 The cellphone, right? 

581
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,080
 What? 

582
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,330
 They say destiny can form
 from one encounter. 

583
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,110
Gosh, seriously.

584
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Wow.

585
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
You're a good actor.

586
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,660
If I were you, I couldn't hide it

587
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,480
and couldn't feign ignorance.

588
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,610
You're quite something.

589
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,440
That's the difference.

590
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,970
The difference between
 flowers in greenhouse

591
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,160
and weeds.

592
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,470
Hey, Hwang Na Ro.

593
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,380
Tell me everything 
you've done in the past.

594
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,690
Since there's no proof,

595
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,640
I know it's game over 
if you play innocent.

596
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,820
But...

597
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,910
we're both Samgwang residents.

598
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,500
You can't do this.

599
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,780
I thought we were...

600
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,690
starting to become friends, no?

601
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,570
I thought we were starting to.

602
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:41,640
Friends?

603
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,390
Not me.

604
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,180
Na Ro.

605
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,160
Leave Samgwang Villa.

606
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,370
Leave quietly like this.

607
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,630
If you don't leave,

608
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,230
I'll put you away with the police.

609
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,930
What exactly did I do wrong

610
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,150
- for you to do this?
- Park Seo Yeon.

611
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,900
No, you approached 
Lee Bit Chae Woon intentionally.

612
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,020
I don't know how you found out,

613
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,010
but you approached her knowing
 she's CEO Kim's real daughter.

614
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,420
That's why you were going to use
 that Byun Mi Ja ahjumma.

615
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,380
Lee Bit Chae Woon 
knows all this, man!

616
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,870
No! I said, no!

617
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,950
I said, no!

618
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,450
Do you think you're all that?

619
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,670
Do you think you know everything?

620
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,020
Having rich parents,

621
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,690
you lived all your life being happy.
 What do you know?

622
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,060
You get lost, a**hole.

623
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,430
You're really...

624
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,940
You're really an a**hole!

625
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,330
Think however you want to.

626
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,900
Hey, Hae Deun.

627
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,140
You're back to your room.

628
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,230
Yeah, Uncle.

629
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,950
Now that Cha Ba Reun is gone.

630
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,290
Yeah, right.

631
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,480
Cha Ba Reun moved out.

632
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,680
Cha Ba Reun moved out.

633
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,630
Geez, I shouldn't feel 
bad about this.

634
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,690
But I feel bad.

635
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,320
Of course, my room is coziest.

636
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,130
 The training camp will start soon. 

637
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,150
 Get ready. 

638
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,680
Gosh.

639
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,740
I'd have to leave soon when
 the training camp starts.

640
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,060
No, I should stay in my room, 
even for a day.

641
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,000
What do you mean, 
stay for a day?

642
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,320
Huh?

643
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,600
I meant I like my room.

644
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,500
What's this? Is it Cha Ba Reun's?

645
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,640
Gosh, look at her taste.

646
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,000
It looks just like her. 
She looks sly.

647
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,400
 Ba Reun. 

648
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,890
 How is your new place? 

649
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,370
 Yeah. 

650
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,760
 It's really nice. 
Their food is good, too. 

651
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,490
 Dad, are you feeling better now? 

652
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,750
 Of course. 

653
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,730
 I'm all better thanks to my daughter 
for paying for the surgery. 

654
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,330
 That's good. 

655
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,370
I miss Lee Ra Hoon.

656
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,430
Aigoo...

657
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,010
My princess Seo Ah 
must've been in shock.

658
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,920
Of course.

659
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,980
Even I'm in a state of shock.

660
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,150
This fragile child must've
 been so shocked.

661
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,020
Anyway,

662
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,170
rerun that girl's DNA test.

663
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,380
You must.

664
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Mom.

665
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,700
Just because you found 
your real daughter,

666
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,140
don't treat Seo Ah lightly.

667
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,060
It depends on what kind of 
bloodline you're talking about.

668
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,990
You're better off not having

669
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,420
a child from such a low class.

670
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,520
How can you say such a thing?

671
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,930
I'm scared Chae Woon 
would hear you.

672
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,580
Jung Won.

673
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,540
Your flourishing business,

674
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,860
and me becoming 
the chief executive...

675
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,970
It couldn't be possible 
without Seo Ah's family.

676
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:45,970
Who rebuilt our family
 that was failing?

677
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,870
It was Seo Ah's dad 
and Seo Ah's family.

678
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,500
Even now, Seo Ah's uncle 
and aunts are

679
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,730
vigilantly after your position. 
Don't you know that?

680
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,850
"When will that 
Kim Jung Won fail?"

681
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,720
Don't you know they're 
watching you like that?

682
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,750
What does that have to do
 with Chae Woon?

683
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,500
As long as I'm doing 
a good job, so what?

684
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,000
Look at you.

685
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,530
Seo Ah is a weapon for you.

686
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,030
That lowly 
Park Pil Hong's bloodline?

687
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,570
If the world finds out,

688
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,780
it won't benefit you at all.

689
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,500
Stay alert and keep that in mind.

690
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,220
 

691
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,020
Hi, Chae Woon.

692
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,330
Mom.

693
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,420
Were you sleeping?

694
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,190
Oh...

695
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,090
I was about to go to sleep.

696
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,910
I was putting out my matt.

697
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,140
How about you?

698
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,230
Me, too.

699
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,330
You must feel uneasy since you're 
sleeping in an unfamiliar place.

700
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,960
You know I can sleep
 just about anywhere.

701
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,700
Right.

702
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,730
So...

703
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,450
your grandmother...

704
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,470
Is the CEO happy?

705
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,410
Yeah.

706
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,900
She's nice to me.

707
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,450
 Okay. 

708
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,450
 How about Seo Ah there? 

709
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,740
Well, she's...

710
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,230
Don't worry, Mom.

711
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:48,830
No matter where I am, 
I don't get intimidated.

712
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,650
Of course.

713
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,900
Right, my daught...

714
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,000
 My Chae Woon, you're right. 

715
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,310
How are Hae Deun and Ra Hoon?

716
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,800
 I told them you're at a site. 

717
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,910
 I'll tell them that for now. 

718
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,850
Okay.

719
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,240
For now.

720
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,930
 Well... 

721
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,700
 Mom. 

722
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,370
Yeah, Chae Woon?

723
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,410
Well...

724
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,650
that Park Pil Hong...

725
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,920
Do you know anything 
about my father?

726
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,790
Oh, no.

727
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,870
I don't know.

728
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,390
 Mom, again... 

729
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,500
 You want to hide everything. 

730
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,990
Can I come in?

731
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,940
Yes.

732
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,640
CEO?

733
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,800
Okay, let's hang up, Chae Woon.

734
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,490
 - Goodnight. 
- Mom.

735
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
- Mom?
- Yes.

736
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,790
Why don't you talk to her?

737
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,980
Talk to her.

738
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,280
No, it's okay.

739
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,060
We're finished.

740
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,950
I just wanted to say goodnight.

741
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,810
 Soon Jung. 

742
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:28,170
 Do you think I'd sit back
 until you do that? 

743
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,370
 Right. 

744
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,000
 It's right for me to get 
close to my daughter
 

745
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,270
 and send her to Jung Won. 

746
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,090
That can't happen.

747
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,060
My Chae Woon...

748
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,410
shouldn't find out 
about Park Pil Hong.

749
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,730
That her dad is...

750
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,010
That he's such a terrible person.

751
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,710
She can't find out.

752
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,780
No.

753
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,120
Is Seo Ah feeling better?

754
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,340
She's much better now.

755
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,360
I saw her fall asleep.

756
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,130
Oh, yeah.

757
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,090
Grandma left just now.

758
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,130
I couldn't say goodbye.

759
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,870
She'll come back again.

760
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:20,250
It was tough because
 of Grandma, huh?

761
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,510
No.

762
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,280
Since you don't have
 any clothes,

763
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,880
I asked my regular shop.

764
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,500
They sent it over right away.

765
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,330
I'm okay.

766
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,930
It will be uncomfortable but 
sleep here for the night.

767
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:42,470
I'll hurry up and put 
your room together nicely.

768
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,570
I'm fine with this room.

769
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,080
No.

770
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,810
I want to decorate your 
room beautifully for you.

771
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,440
Thank you.

772
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,380
My daughter.

773
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,830
Ta-da!

774
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,500
My daughter's room.

775
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,110
How do you like it?
 Do you like it?

776
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,740
Gosh, I don't even attend school.

777
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,550
Why do I need a desk?

778
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,600
Gosh, a desk isn't only for students.

779
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,700
You stay up all night
 to study anyway.

780
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,520
I even have a bed.

781
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,030
All right!

782
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,300
Whoa, it's so fluffy.

783
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,880
Mom, did you spend
 a lot of money?

784
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,380
Gosh, no.

785
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,800
I didn't spend that much money.

786
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,510
I waited for the furniture
 complex to go on sale

787
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,040
and bought it there.

788
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,950
Mom, you worked at 
the restaurant for this, huh?

789
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,800
Gosh, no.

790
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,830
Young Ja's mom asked me...

791
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,170
to work for a day.

792
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,460
Gosh, thank you, Mom!

793
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,690
Aigoo.

794
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,810
I love it.

795
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,270
- You love it?
- Yeah!

796
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,660
I'm so glad.

797
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,210
I'm sorry it's not 
high-quality furniture.

798
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,610
Gosh, what are you saying?

799
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,690
For me, this is the 
highest quality bed

800
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,190
and the most expensive desk.

801
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,260
And the wardrobe is so pretty!

802
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,470
Aigoo.

803
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,200
I have my own room now.

804
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,550
My Chae Woon...

805
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,760
Now...

806
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,350
you should live
 in the best of places.

807
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,700
You should, my daughter.

808
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,300
My daughter Chae Woon...

809
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,810
 Lee Bit Chae Woon 
knows all this, man! 

810
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:45,270
 No! I said no! 

811
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,310
 I said no! 

812
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,930
I wonder what Moong-i is doing.

813
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,140
She didn't even text me.

814
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,180
 

815
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,120
 The customer can't
 answer the call right now. 

816
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:16,680
 Moong-i, are you home? 

817
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,900
 Sleeping? 

818
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,240
Is she asleep?

819
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:32,940
I'll text her one last time.

820
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:37,780
 Moong, I'm in front of your room. 

821
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,790
 Can you... 

822
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,760
Hi, Hae Deun.

823
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,010
Hi, Mr. Woo. Coming home now?

824
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,230
Yeah.

825
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:48,070
Is Chae Woon sleeping?

826
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,230
Unni is working late at the site.

827
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:52,850
Why doesn't her boyfriend
 know that?

828
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,910
Ah, that, that officetel.

829
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,350
I was busy.

830
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,410
I couldn't check my messages.

831
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:03,320
Aigoo, Chae Woon. 
She's working hard tonight.

832
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,080
She can't be at a site.

833
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:16,980
Moong-i...

834
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,820
Did she leave?

835
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,000
Who the hell was
 in here again? S***!

836
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,790
Was it you?

837
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,510
What?

838
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:15,490
Did you go through my room?

839
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,740
I didn't go through your room.

840
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,920
Why would I...

841
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,280
Hey, Hwang Na Ro.

842
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,620
He... hello?

843
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,520
Did someone go through 
Cunning Penguin's room?

844
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,070
I don't know.

845
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,250
That Cunning Penguin...

846
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,150
looks somber for some reason.

847
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,640
He seems to have a story.

848
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,280
Oh, Dad...

849
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,590
I mean...

850
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,080
Do you think so, too, James?

851
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,140
Yes.

852
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:46,930
Why?

853
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:52,550
I feel like someone took a jacket 
and hung it up nicely.

854
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,210
Why? What's wrong?

855
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,680
Are you all right?

856
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:04,850
Why?

857
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,600
Nothing.

858
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,670
You're not feeling well, right?

859
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,430
Go to the hospital with me 
tomorrow and get examined again.

860
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,240
You're busy, Yoo Jae Hee.

861
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,040
It's okay. I'm fine.

862
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,490
What do you mean you're fine?

863
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,920
I'm worried to death when 
you're even slightly sick.

864
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:26,920
I'm sorry.

865
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,670
What do you mean you're sorry?

866
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:32,980
You're just worried about me.

867
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,220
I'm grateful.

868
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,180
 Koala. 

869
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,380
 I'm sorry for contacting you late. 

870
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,850
 You might've noticed by now, 

871
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,620
 but I moved to CEO's house. 

872
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,000
Geez.

873
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,360
Moong.

874
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,250
Finally...

875
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,690
 The customer can't
 answer the call right now. 

876
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:23,820
 You'll be connected 
to the voicemail.  

877
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:29,630
 Go to sleep. 

878
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,420
 Let's talk tomorrow. 

879
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,850
 I'm outside. 

880
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,620
 I'm barefeet and 
wearing a thin shirt. 

881
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,960
 I'm freezing. 

882
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,160
 I won't go in until 
you answer my call. 

883
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,660
 The customer can't 
answer the call right now. 

884
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,760
 I just want to hear your voice. 

885
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,650
 How tough was your day? 

886
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,920
 I'm going nuts, Moong-i. 

887
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,360
 Bit Chae Woon. 

888
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,140
Moong.

889
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,230
 Geez. 

890
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,740
 How can you do this? 
Without even talking to me? 

891
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,120
Are you allowed to do this?

892
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,190
I told you.

893
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:25,050
I want to clear unfair 
accusations against my mom.

894
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,130
My mom being treated 
like a criminal,

895
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,410
and her behaving like a criminal...

896
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,470
I couldn't stand it.

897
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,090
I know, but...

898
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:38,280
still...

899
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,910
you could discuss it with me first 
before you make your move.

900
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,260
You have it tough, too, Koala. 
I can't put more load on you.

901
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,010
Do you know what's the

902
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:54,310
hardest thing for me in this world?

903
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,080
Bit Chae Woon...

904
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,100
suffering like this.

905
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,790
 Bit Chae Woon... 

906
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:04,080
 being absent from my side. 

907
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:12,530
Are you really barefeet?

908
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,310
Yeah. My feet are freezing.

909
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,730
They're bare.

910
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:19,530
You don't have a jacket on?

911
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:21,070
Just a shirt.

912
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,790
I can feel the wind blow
 right through.

913
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,530
Gosh, go inside already.

914
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:26,960
You'll catch a cold.

915
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,310
I don't want to.

916
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:29,790
You'll hang up if I go inside.

917
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,950
I won't hang up.

918
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,330
So go inside.

919
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,070
It's cold. Okay?

920
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,710
All right. Then, don't hang up.

921
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:41,760
Okay.

922
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:46,720
See? You're catching a cold.

923
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,330
Don't hang up. Never.

924
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:49,690
Just wait.

925
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:55,510
♫  This tearfully lonely night  ♫

926
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,200
So...

927
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,050
did anything happen over there?

928
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,270
Didn't Seo Ah throw a fit?

929
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:03,660
She tends to do that.

930
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:07,010
It was okay.

931
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,420
That's good.

932
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:10,920
Moong-i, seriously.

933
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,440
You're so stubborn.

934

♫  Life is so hard  ♫

935
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,800
You're tired.

936
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,970
Go to sleep now. 
Let's talk tomorrow.

937
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,060
Okay.

938
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,660
I'll hang up then.

939
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:25,940
Wait.

940
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,280
It won't do.

941
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,400
When I hear you sleeping,

942
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,210
I'll hang up then.

943
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:38,050
You might not be able to fall asleep
 since it's an unfamiliar place.

944
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,460
Just think that I'm next 
to you and go to sleep.

945
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,850
I'm okay.

946
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:46,360
 Just listen to me. 

947
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,610
 So stubborn. 

948
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:50,090
All right.

949
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:52,020
I'll go inside my room as well.

950
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:53,740
Okay.

951

 You were freezing, huh? 

955
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,840
Yes.

956
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,690
Close your eyes.

957
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,380
I'm closing them, too.

958
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,280
Okay.

959
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,960
 Just think... 

960
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,920
you're lying down

961
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,700
in your room in Samgwang Villa.

962
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,470
And just think...

963
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:27,120
I'm lying down next to you.

964
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,070

That's too...

 Why, why? Was it... 

967
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,570
too much for now?

968
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,010

Of course, you should be.

974

 You never reply.

00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,570
I heard everything 
from Chae Woon.

1020
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:13,960
I talked to her last night.

1021
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,760
Really?

1022
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,030
How do you think she's doing?

1023
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:19,570
She's energetic.

1024
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:22,090
She's very worried about you.

1025
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,540
Gosh, why worry about me?

1026
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,710
It's not like I'm sick 
or something.

1027
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,510
Mother, I'm here.

1028
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:31,070
So depend on me.

1029
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,960
I won't be as soon as Chae Woon,

1030
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,970
but as big as I am...

1031
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:36,020
I'll protect you well.

1032
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:39,180
Thank you, Mr. Woo.

1033
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,190
The soup is delicious.

1034
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,510
Hello. Good morning, everyone.

1035
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:49,430
 Good morning. 

1036
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:50,490
Sit here.

1037
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,350
Gosh, even Na Ro is sleeping in.

1038
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,420
I guess so.

1039
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,500
You know, ever since he fell

1040
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,570
and came home with 
all kinds of wounds,

1041
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:03,660
- he's been weak.
- Oh, no.

1042
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,070
Auntie.

1043
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:06,290
You said...

1044
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,530
you ran into Hwang Na Ro
 before, right?

1045
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,730
Did you remember 
where you ran into him?

1046
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,010
Yeah.

1047
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,460
I can't remember that.

1048
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,470
That's still a problem for me.

1049
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:18,280
Eat lots of nuts.

1050
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,150
You'll get your memory back.

1051
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:22,150
Ah, my memory?

1052
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,370
Ah-ha.

1053
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:25,500
Then, let's...

1054
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,020
eat them together, James.

1055
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,160
Ah...

1056
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,050
Okay. Let's do that.

1057
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:38,720
Did Joon Woo leave early again?

1058
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,940
He's always skipping breakfast.

1059
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:44,840
Yeah, Mom.

1060
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,700
Something came up at Kim Joon Woo's 
home in the country.

1061
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,250
He had to leave suddenly.

1062
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:51,830
Really?

1063
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,130
Hi, Ba Reun.

1064
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:56,340
Oh, my!

1065
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,970
Hey, you.

1066
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:04,300
Ra Hoon's girlfriend. Right?

1067
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,340
- She's not his girlfriend.
- She's not?

1068
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,620
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

1069
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,910
I came to return my key
 to the front door.

1070
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:13,390
I thought you'd all be
 here this morning.

1071
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:16,660
I wanted to apologize.

1072
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:19,970
Wait, no...

1073
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,130
I'll tell Noonim about 
everything later.

1074
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:23,520
Well...

1075
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,960
Apologize about what?

1076
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,140
Actually...

1077
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,720
I'm...

1078
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:33,060
I'm Kim Joon Woo.

1079
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,040
What?

1080
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,090
What are you saying?

1081
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:36,120
What?

1082
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,360
- What is she talking about?
- Oh, my gosh!

1083
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:41,660
Do you...

1084
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,790
Do you like Ra Hoon

1085
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:45,690
and moved in here as a guy?

1086
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,540
My gosh, look at her!

1087
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,280
That's a crime! A crime!

1088
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,620
Hey, you're a stalker.

1089
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,670
You look perfectly fine. 
What do we do about you?

1090
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:53,960
My gosh, what do we do?

1091
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,870
Auntie, don't scare her like that.

1092
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:56,840
What?

1093
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,600
Did you two know about this?

1094
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,690
No.

1095
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,010
Well...

1096
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:05,430
I had to move out of the room
 I was renting suddenly,

1097
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:07,740
so I needed to stay somewhere.

1098
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:12,060
But I couldn't find an empty room
 since school is still in session.

1099
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:15,580
But you only accepted
 a male student.

1100
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:19,560
And I liked it since
 it was Ra Hoon's house.

1101
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:22,720
I didn't have a choice...

1102
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,880
I'm sorry about everything.

1103
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,300
It's my fault.

1104
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,960
Hey, why are you crying?

1105
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,840
Ba Reun had to...

1106
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,880
get money for her father's surgery.

1107
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,210
She had to move out 
of her room in a rush.

1108
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,670
How did you know?

1109
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:40,840
She told me.

1110
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,860
Aigoo, you're in the know
 in Samgwang Villa, Eems hyung.

1111
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:47,430
You're involved with everyone here.

1112
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,630
Aigoo...

1113
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:56,710
Then you should've told 
me what's going on.

1114
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:59,850
I would've found 
another solution for you.

1115
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:03,730
Anyway, it's not right to lie.

1116
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:05,200
On top of that,

1117
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,700
a young man and a woman
 in the same room...

1118
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:12,680
Mom, no...

1119
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,260
Never, never.

1120
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,740
Nothing like that happened.

1121
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,530
We were very wholesome.

1122
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:19,640
It's true.

1123
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,820
So we set up our rules and...

1124
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,910
we never made 
eye contact in the room

1125
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:26,680
and didn't talk to each other.

1126
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:29,260
Hey, how is that possible?

1127
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:31,450
- You're lying.
- It's true!

1128
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:33,010
It's true.

1129
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,390
Aigoo.

1130
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:37,640
I'm so upset.

1131
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,180
I swear it on my dad.

1132
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,580
Oh, my gosh.

1133
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,370
All right. Don't cry.

1134
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:46,030
I'll guarantee it.

1135
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:48,010
Cha Ba Reun is...

1136
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:50,750
very, very upright. 
(Ba Reun means upright)

1137
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:53,570
And she couldn't use
 the bathroom freely.

1138
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,550
She struggled a lot.

1139
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:56,740
Hey...

1140
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,540
You didn't have breakfast, right?

1141
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,410
Stop crying, sit down, and eat.

1142
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:02,180
Yes, yes. Sit down.

1143
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:04,250
- Yes, sit.
- Over here.

1144
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,570
What do we do about her?

1145
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,100
Okay, okay. Don't cry.

1146
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,400
Sit down.

1147
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,620
Take off your backpack.

1148
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,690
Hey.

1149
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,660
Okay.

1150
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,940
Eat.

1151
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,460
Don't cry.

1152
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,950
I didn't know back then. 
That's why I did this.

1153
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:25,580
Aigoo, seriously.

1154
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:28,490
You must've struggled
 so much all this time.

1155
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,420
Stop crying. Don't.

1156
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,540
Eat.

1157
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,890
Aigoo...

1158
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,880
- Don't cry.
- Don't cry.

1159
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,210
Eat.

1160
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,640
Did you ask for me, Director?

1161
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:07,330
Are you feeling okay? 
You don't look too good...

1162
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:08,820
What's with you?

1163
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:10,520
Pardon?

1164
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,250
I told you to shake up
 Bit Chae Woon.

1165
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,660
But you made her move
 into my house.

1166
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:20,540
 Bit Chae Woon left as I suspected. 

1167
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,880
I'm sorry.

1168
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,490
It's a person's heart...

1169
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,610
so I couldn't change it 
the way I wanted to.

1170
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,010
You were so confident.

1171
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,610
Our deal is over.

1172
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:33,970
Leave.

1173
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,850
Go.

1174
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:46,230
Are you going to piss me off, too?

1175
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,680
I said, go.

1176
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,970
Go!

1177
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:58,010
If I bring out Bit Chae Woon, 
who moved into your house,

1178
01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:00,270
would you give me 
your permission?

1179
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,880
Permission for what?

1180
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,210
To be close to you, Director.

1181
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:06,810
I want to do that.

1182
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,020
What?

1183
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:21,550
Why isn't Moong-i 
answering my call?

1184
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:27,660
♫  Now we are going to 
like each other  ♫

1185
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:29,030
Did I scare you?

1186
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:30,020
Aigoo, sorry.

1187
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,500
I'm sorry.

1188
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:36,970
♫  When the time that has 
been passed comes back  ♫

1189
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,520
Why? Do you have 
a stomachache again?

1190
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,580
Long time no see.

1191
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,480
Right?

1192
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:45,530
It's been a while.

1193
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,270
I couldn't see you last night,

1194
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:50,370
and we slept in different places.

1195
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,660
It feels like a million years
 have passed.

1196
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:56,890
♫  To make sweet memories 
beautiful forever  ♫

1197
01:03:56,890 --> 01:03:58,510
So you met that elder.

1198
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,710
CEO's mother.

1199
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,360
So, the Chairwoman.

1200
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:05,820
I've met her a few 
times before, too.

1201
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,620
She's extraordinary.

1202
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,450
You should've told the CEO 
about talking to her on the phone.

1203
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:14,590
Even if I told her,

1204
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,730
Grandma would feign ignorance.

1205
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,060
CEO would be...

1206
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:22,680
upset on her own.

1207
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,760
She'd be in a bind.

1208
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,250
All because of me.

1209
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,610
Why is it your fault?

1210
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,210
 She took my boyfriend, too! 

1211
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,920
 Jang Seo Ah! 

1212
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,770
 Aigoo. 

1213
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,050
 Calm down. 

1214
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,640
 - Calm down.
- Seo Ah! 

1215
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,390
 Seo Ah! 

1216
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:47,000
 Ms. Jo! 

1217
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,180
 Because I'm dating you, 

1218
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,150
 that would put her in a bind. 

1219
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,050
What are you thinking?

1220
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:05,250
Gosh, seriously. What do we do 
about what's going on in your head?

1221
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,140
Why do you think so much and

1222
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,490
why do you make
 such quick moves?

1223
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,680
Is anyone in there?

1224
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,640
Is anyone...

1225
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:20,730
What are you doing?

1226
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:23,720
Moong-i.

1227
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,480
How about this?

1228
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:26,990
What?

1229
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,350
Because of this mom 
and that mom,

1230
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:31,270
you're going crazy.

1231
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:33,270
How about you flee
 to a third world?

1232
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:34,400
What?

1233
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,980
The third world. Right here.

1234
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:41,190
Gosh, seriously.

1235
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:42,980
Come in. Come in.

1236
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,250
Okay.

1237
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,420
 Koala. 

1238
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,560
 Maybe we might... 

1239
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,260
 Maybe... 

1240
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,560
That Hwang Na Ro...

1241
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,680
He'll date Seo Yeon?

1242
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,700
That lying bastard.

1243
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,120
As expected,

1244
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,520
my Seo Yeon picked the right man.

1245
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:21,160
 Really? 

1246
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:25,830

1261
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,520
 "Red Dragonfly."

What's wrong?

1265
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:10,660
Are you in pain?

 - Bye.
