1
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,240
Mom!

2
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,810
Mom, what's wrong? Is a debt collector came again?

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,810
We don't have debt anymore.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,000
Mom, are you okay?

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,400
Mom...

6
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,100
Why did you take mom over here?

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,400
I didn't mean to do that, but mom just stubbornly...

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,010
  - Mom. 
 - Mom.  

9
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,290
Mom!

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,200
  You guys were here!  

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,500
Mom, it's Mr. Woo.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,300
Oh, yes...

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,400
     

14
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,830
Mom.

15
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,330
Why don't we go out for a dinner, since you're here?

16
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,780
Yes, mom. I want Bossam.

17
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,300
We are not here to hang out.

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,600
Why don't you do that? The traffic will be bad since it's rush hour.

19
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,420
Let's just go home and eat. I already made dinner.

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,160
By the way, I'm sorry to bother you all of a sudden when you were getting off from work.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,200
I'm fine. Please get in the car.

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,500
What's this?

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,100
Now you can tell how much our Ms. Lee Soon Jung rushed, right?

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,900
Get on.

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,790
Chae Woon.

26
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,450
What happened?

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,510
Did the kids who framed you in middle school come back again?

28
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,500
Are they bothering you again?

29
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,760
  Yes, unni. We should know what's going on as well.  

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:19,000
Since you were looking for Park So Mi so badly, so I and Ra Hoon searched for her as well, but what happened?

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,260
I... just thought about it all of a sudden. About the unfair experience at the time.

32
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,710
  It wouldn't be all of a sudden for no reason.  

33
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,650
You said you're very busy that you don't even have time to go to the bathroom, but why would you think about that?

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,300
Chae Woon, maybe you...

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,700
met somebody in the office?

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,600
And isn't that person bringing the old stuff and bothering you?

37
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,000
No, it's not like that, mom!

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,240
I'm not going to be bothered even somebody wants to.

39
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,640
- Right, Mr. Woo? 
 - Yes, you wouldn't be bothered at all.

40
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,210
Right, you wouldn't be at all.

41
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,370
See?

42
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,170
  Please apologize right now, Chae Woon.  

43
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,470
  Chae Woon, you shouldn't be like this. Say sorry right now.   

44
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,940
  Teacher, I'm so sorry.  

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,040
  I'm sorry for everything.  

46
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,300
  I didn't do anything wrong!  

47
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:47,710
  If your mother was a better person, then you could've not to gone through that at that time.  

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,200
Don't worry, mom. There's nothing going on, okay?

49
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,670
Ah, I'm exhausted.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,700
Welcome home, chairwoman.

51
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,830
Mom!

52
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,220
I heard you met So Mi.

53
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:50,170
Bit Chae Woon is ridiculous. She even found So Mi.

54
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,000
Isn't Bit Chae Woon a real psycho?

55
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,440
What is she going to do by meeting So Mi? It's all in the past anyway...

56
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,290
What's wrong, mom?

57
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,200
Seo Ah.

58
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,000
I trust you, Seo Ah.

59
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,900
Because you're my daughter.

60
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,500
What are you talking about right now?

61
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm hungry. Let's eat dinner.

62
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,820
Mother, did you go out for something?

63
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,900
Yes. I'll get ready for the dinner right away.

64
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,530
Okay...

65
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,350
I just threw the trash out--

66
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,600
- Na Ro oppa! 
 - Ah, Hae Deun! Was there something going on? Everybody's face wasn't that good...

67
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,100
- Ah, it was-- 
 - Hey, Lee Hae Deun! Come in and help to get ready for dinner.

68
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,460
Okay!

69
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,800
- Where's mom and unni? 
 - They're having a conversation. You and I should get ready for dinner.

70
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,390
What the heck? Why are they talking to each other in secret all the time?

71
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,750
- I'll help you to get ready for di-- 
 - Let's do it together!

72
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,870
- What should I do, Hae Deun? 
 - Na Ro oppa! Mom already made all the food.

73
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,990
- First of all, let's go over there and put food in the plates, shall we? 
 - Shall we?

74
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,200
  Hwang Na Ro. Weirdly, I don't like him.  

75
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,670
- I can help you with that-- 
 - Ah!

76
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,200
Ah, I'm sorry.

77
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,170
Why the hell he's in my way...

78
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Why the hell I'm in your way? Excuse me!

79
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,700
- Hae Deun, should we play some music? 
 - That's a great idea!

80
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,500
Let's play a song that Hae Deun likes.

81
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,600
- What do you like, oppa? 
 - I like... hip hop.

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,800
What the hell...

83
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,800
It's really nothing, mom.

84
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,700
I'm hungry, let's go eat.

85
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,600
Bit Chae Woon.

86
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:31,210
Why are you always hiding stuff from me and take all the burden to yourself?

87
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,300
Because I can't be any help to you?

88
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,470
Why are you saying it like that!

89
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,670
You're very persistent.

90
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,200
I just don't want you to be upset.

91
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:49,290
But I'm upset when you do this to me!

92
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:56,090
Whenever you say 'mom, it's nothing,' 'mom, don't worry about it, I got this,'

93
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,100
do you know what kind of stupid thoughts I'm having, Chae Woon?

94
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,800
I'm doing my best with what I can do for you,

95
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:13,900
but I'm a useless mother to my daughter. That's how I feel.

96
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,300
How useless mother I look--

97
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,660
Mom.

98
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,100
You know Jang Seo Ah, right?

99
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,600
The girl who falsely accused me that I hit her back in the days.

100
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,700
Of course, I know her. How can I forget her?

101
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,300
She's my boss now.

102
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,180
What?

103
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:48,990
She keeps making a fuss out of the past incident. So, I'm going to make a clear closure.

104
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,690
My goodness. How can that happen?

105
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:58,000
That doesn't make any sense. How can she even make a fuss out of it?

106
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,670
How dare? I'll meet her.

107
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,600
I wanted to see her anyway.

108
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,560
Set up for me to meet her. Please, Chae Woon.

109
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,500
No, mom. I'll take care of it.

110
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,100
It's not because I can't trust you,

111
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,000
but I have to do this by myself to make myself feel better.

112
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,900
That I ran away, that I gave up on my own life back in those days,

113
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,000
I really regretted a lot.

114
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:38,800
So, I'm trying to make this right with my own power. Can you understand me?

115
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,080
  - Ta-da! 
 - Ta-da!  

116
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,950
- What is this? 
 - Is it a party?

117
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
Yes, a party!

118
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,100
It's a consolation party for Ms. Lee Soon Jung. Play music!

119
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,000
♫   Don't frown your face, you're making us sad   ♫

120
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:13,700
♫   You have a family to share for the day of joy   ♫

121
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,500
♫   When you feel alone, look around   ♫

122
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,090
I really have to lose some weight...

123
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,560
Let's go on a diet from tomorrow.

124
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,400
Finally. 
      

125
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,880
There's nobody but Hae Deun.

126
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,500
Ra Hoon and unni each called one time.

127
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,770
That rude Lee Bit Chae Woon never called me. If I were her, I wouldn't call as well.

128
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:16,190
Kim Hwak Se, this son of a gun. I said he should shut his mouth, but this betrayer, you are the worst. I'm going to revenge you, Kim Hwak Se.

129
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,400
Kim Hwak Se, I'm going to kick your ass tonight.

130
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,530
Why the hell are they looking at me?

131
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,160
Hey, get down from the stage.

132
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,300
I said, get out!

133
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,070
Hyungnim!

134
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,100
  Why the hell you're not getting out?  

135
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,900
That bastard...

136
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,600
Get out. Why are you ignoring me?

137
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,490
You're going to keep ignoring me?

138
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,800
Is this your concert or something?

139
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,360
You're just a mere nightclub singer!

140
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,300
Shut up!

141
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,790
I said, shut up!

142
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,000
I said, shut up! You bastard!

143
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:27,220
This bastard is not listening to me at all. I said, shut your mouth up!

144
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,440
Who the hell was that!

145
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,500
  Who is it!  

146
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,940
Aunt?

147
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,030
  It's that woman! Get her!  

148
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,940
Get her! Don't let her go!

149
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,510
That's what happened.

150
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,530
Bit Chae Woon must have been upset.

151
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,590
Don't say anything that you know about this to my mom and unni.

152
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,370
Of course. I'll zip my mouth.

153
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,000
We say that as 'shut the mouth' in our family.

154
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,150
Okay. I'll shut my mouth.

155
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,510
What needs to be shut the mouth?

156
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,700
It's a secret! Oh! Jinx!

157
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,110
- My goodness! 
 - We have good chemistry!

158
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,500
We have such good chemistry like this, maybe we're real siblings.

159
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,200
I know. Wait.

160
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,220
Yes?

161
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,400
Did I say to you that we're also adopted?

162
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:51,710
  - I got adopted to the Netherlands when I was young. 
 - I guess you were really meant to meet with us. We're also--  

163
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,200
  Ah, that's why you're good at Dutch.  

164
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,610
I don't think we said that.

165
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:05,260
I just said that for no reason, since we have good chemistry.

166
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,300
Then, did you get adopted as well?

167
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,610
Yes, all of us. My sister and him as well.

168
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,100
  Is that so.  

169
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,900
Hey, Lee Hae Deun, you... should shut your mouth.

170
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,100
What's the matter? We're all family now.

171
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,620
Of course, I'm a family of Samgwang villa now.

172
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,300
Right? We're all happy Samgwang villa family!

173
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,600
  - Mom, why are you... 
 - Let's go.  

174
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,700
  - It hurts! 
 - Mom!  

175
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,400
  Hurry up.  

176
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,700
Don't you get mosquito bites?

177
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,700
Why would I? Whenever they come at me, I snap them away like this.

178
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,650
Of course, you will.

179
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,310
Myeongseong middle school?

180
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm sorry?

181
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,840
That Ms. Park So Mi, I followed her earlier today,

182
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,440
and her car had a sticker named Myeongseong middle school. She seems to be a faculty there.

183
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,070
I thought you wouldn't know her phone number.

184
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,700
Thank you.

185
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,510
Wouldn't they all had their own reason?

186
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,430
They were all young as well.

187
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:39,780
You would've had your own reason, and the person who bullied you would have as well.

188
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Because I also know a kid like that from my middle school. There's always somebody like that everywhere!

189
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:49,200
Who always bully other kids, who everybody wondered if they are human.

190
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,860
Later on, I figured that kid had his own sorrows.

191
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,200
Because their own situation isn't good, so they are venting that out to other people.

192
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,110
I'm not saying that's a good thing.

193
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,600
What's that look?

194
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:11,070
Koala, you look like a little bit good person.

195
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,120
A little bit?

196
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:18,210
Why is it only 'a little bit?' You could've used better words like 'a lot,' 'very,' or something like that.

197
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,300
Ah, did the lady in her 50s came back home?

198
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,260
That's driving me crazy right now--

199
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,890
I guess she hadn't come back home yet.

200
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,600
  She might never come back home.  

201
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
     

202
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,400
How is that, sister? It's great, right?

203
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,150
I asked the best law firm in this country to write that.

204
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:52,800
If you do it as it says, not just the division of the property, but you'll get the highest alimony as well.

205
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:58,860
- And also you have some share of the company. You should bring all that together and-- 
 - Jung Min Suk.

206
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,200
Yes?

207
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,800
Are you happy?

208
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,400
Are you excited as hell?

209
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
No, it's not like I'm excited about this.

210
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:14,400
But my loving sister is getting out of suffering from the brother-in-law, and decided to start a new life,

211
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,850
so I'm happy for you.

212
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,300
I'll take care of my business. It's none of yours.

213
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,500
How can you take care of this? You only did housework.

214
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,670
I'll show you how the person who only did housework needs to be smart and wise

215
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:32,970
to take care of all of the family and only do housework every day.

216
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,860
You should go. I'm sleepy.

217
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,900
- Noona. 
 - And also, you.

218
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:44,300
You shouldn't think this is a chance. Don't get excited and think about something weird.

219
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,460
You were such a reckless lad.

220
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,700
Your brother-in-law made you who you are now.

221
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,130
You shouldn't forget about that. Do you understand me?

222
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,760
Are you not going to answer to me!

223
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,620
Yes...

224
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,450
Go.

225
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,880
  Mr. Kim Hwak Se, you shouldn't come to our club for a while.   

226
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,270
  Because of you, we're going to lose our regulars!  

227
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,800
I wonder if her foot is okay...

228
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,020
My goodness, it hurts.

229
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:46,800
Either he's going to die or not, why do I care about him?

230
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,560
What am I going to do with this? I barely wore them!

231
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,700
Uncle!

232
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,500
Hae Deun, what are you doing here?

233
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,130
I'm practicing. I have an audition tomorrow.

234
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,080
Why are you practice dancing in such a scary way?

235
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,130
I can't do it right. Tomorrow is the first audition to eliminate people.

236
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,830
Is that so?

237
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,600
- H-Hae Deun. 
 - Yes?

238
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,300
- I... 
 - Yes.

239
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,750
I'm a good dancer!

240
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,780
You're stiff at this part. Let's do it again!

241
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,200
     

242
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,920
Mr. Woo!

243
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,670
- Did you sleep well? 
   - Yes.  

244
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,200
Are you going to work already?

245
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,300
Oh, I'm going to drop by my parent's place.

246
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,100
You're making Geot-jeori. 
      

247
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,100
One second. Do you want to try it? Here.

248
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
Ah, yes.

249
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,380
- It's very good. 
 - Is it?

250
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,230
My father really likes this dish as well--

251
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,200
Oh, is that so? Then, I'll pack some for you! Give me one second.

252
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,600
- No, it's okay. I'll get going. 
 - No, no, Mr. Woo. Just give me one second.

253
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,010
  You shouldn't visit your parent's place with empty hands.  

254
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,500
  - Mr. Woo.   
 - Oh my god!

255
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,710
H-Hwak Se?

256
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,350
Oh, it's you. What are you doing in this early morning?

257
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
We stayed up all night.

258
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,280
Today is the first audition for the song.

259
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,860
Then you should've slept. You need to take care of your condition.

260
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,130
My condition is not important right now.

261
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,610
I couldn't do this move well.

262
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,900
You should keep going, Mr. Woo.

263
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,060
My goodness...

264
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,740
I thought you were a grim reaper!

265
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Did you sleep okay?

266
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,300
I slept well, but you ruined everything.

267
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,100
It's 6:30 in the morning... Are you crazy?

268
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,200
Did something happen to your mother?

269
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,000
Is she sick?

270
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,300
Are you worried about her at least?

271
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,300
I came here like this because you refused my calls and you refused to see me when I went to the company.

272
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,700
I should change the lock number. Why are you here?

273
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,600
- Wash your face and come to the living room. I need to talk to you. 
 - Just say what you want to say now and go!

274
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,000
By the way, why is it so dim right now?

275
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,500
It's because you have eye boogers in your eyes! Wash your face and come to the living room.

276
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,460
What the--!

277
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,760
You should apologize to mom.

278
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,760
Why do I have to?

279
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,390
She has to apologize to me. Look at the house right now.

280
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,210
She's not doing her duty as a housewife!

281
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,400
She's not going to be a housewife anymore. Not even going to be your wife anymore!

282
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,120
Then let her be whatever she wants to be! I'm not going to change my mind.

283
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:17,610
I had been fed her and dressed her. She doesn't know what she had until now.

284
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,800
You had been fed her and dressed her?

285
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,400
Father, did you take her as your housekeeper?

286
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,170
Then, did you just let her have me as an extra addition?

287
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,300
What's that?

288
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:32,480
Mom had to live with you, who has crazy mood swings, hot-tempered, and stubborn person.

289
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:39,200
And had to suffer for years under your parents, who are exactly like you, and took care of them when they were in a hospital.

290
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,300
Also, she almost raised your young siblings until they get married.

291
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,600
She did all of the ancestral memorial ceremonies of your family which happens once or twice every month and took care of all of the family events.

292
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:52,310
But even after all that, because you always complained about something, so she had a convulsion and went to an emergency room!

293
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,100
What am I suppose to do!

294
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,430
She chose that path!

295
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,030
She knew about everything, but she chose to jump into the fire.

296
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,200
I told her all about this before we got married. It would be a thorny path, a crappy path!

297
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,330
This is why I can't like you, father.

298
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:12,310
You're still so shameless and unrepentant to your spouse, who spent her entire life struggling in the fire pit and crappy life!

299
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,100
How dare you talk to me like that!

300
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,700
If you're going to be like this, then why did you get married to her?

301
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,100
Why are you making one woman's life so miserable!

302
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,280
Do you think I got married because I wanted to!

303
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,220
I heard that mom liked you more, so you got married.

304
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,800
I guess aunts were right.

305
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,750
Then, you didn't even want to get married, but you had to because she got pregnant with me.

306
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,300
That's why! You don't even consider me as your child!

307
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,510
How can I not consider you as my child? I spent tons of money on you.

308
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,380
You are the one who didn't want to be the son of Woo Jung Hoo and ran away!

309
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,570
Look at you. You had been going around to start a business or something, but you lost everything

310
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,900
and went around to rent small studios, motels, and now you're renting a room from a house, right?

311
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,410
You probably thought I didn't know anything about this. I know everything.

312
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,660
You're in the palm of my hand. So don't brag in front of me!

313
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,500
Even though you are going around as if you're the best,

314
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:22,170
I bet my precious penny to that you'll crawl back underneath me in a couple of years.

315
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,790
Do you think you can live without money?

316
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:33,400
You will be like 'father, father,' and lie flat on your stomach,

317
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,100
and you'll be waiting for my company and money to be yours.

318
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,080
Why? Did I get you?

319
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,450
I can look deep inside of your thoughts, so you got surprised, right?

320
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,140
You must be very very surprised.

321
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,400
What are you doing all of a sudden?

322
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,900
Did you say you can look deep inside of my thoughts? That's wrong!

323
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:07,910
You don't know anything about me. You're my biological father, but you don't know any damn thing about me!

324
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,700
Well, you didn't want to get married and got this unwanted son, so you would've not even bothered to know about me.

325
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:21,900
I totally agree to end the marriage between you and mom,

326
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,950
but I didn't want it to go to the extreme because you're my parents!

327
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:32,050
I'm here to ask you to reflect on yourself and sincerely apologize to mom. But!

328
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,980
I didn't know about you as well, father.

329
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:40,160
I forgot for a second that you are a person who never reflects on yourself and never make an apology.

330
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,640
About this, I'm going to notarize through a lawyer.

331
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,210
And I'll never come back to this house.

332
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,640
I wish you to have a healthy life.

333
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,810
What's wrong with him today?

334
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,680
A memorandum for the abandonment of one's property.

335
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:22,800
  I, Woo Jae Hee, promise never to inherit a single penny of my father, Woo Jung Hoo's property,  

336
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,480
  and never get involved in Woo Jung Hoo's company in the future.  

337
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,200
What the...

338
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,730
That punk!

339
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,010
They are all the same! All the same!

340
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,000
  This rude punk! How dare you scream in front of your father!  

341
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:43,610
That was unnecessary before breakfast! Ah, I'm starving.

342
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,760
Geot-jeori? Ha!

343
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,080
How dare he's trying to lure me with this kind of thing?

344
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,800
I'm leaving!

345
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,950
Hey! Why are you leaving so early?

346
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,390
I'm going early to practice more. I told you today's the first audition for elimination.

347
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,100
Hae Deun, wait! You should blow this before you leave.

348
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,410
This? You shouldn't use this precious thing for me.

349
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,560
Why are you saying it like that? You're my precious daughter.

350
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,100
- Let's blow it now. 
 - This really works.

351
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,600
- Of course! 
 - Thank you, mom.

352
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,000
Make a wish, and let's blow this!

353
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,200
Please let me pass the first audition!

354
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,250
- Gather together! 
 - Yes, gather together!

355
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,290
- Fighting! 
 - Lee Hae Deun, you got this!

356
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,500
Fighting!

357
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,900
- Okay, I'm leaving. Bye! 
 - Have a nice day!

358
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,500
     

359
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,000
     

360
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,700
  - Good morning! 
 - Good morning!  

361
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,000
Bit Chae Woon.

362
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,070
- Good morning! 
 - Good morning!

363
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,600
How can you think of coming all the way here?

364
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,690
The students are adorable.

365
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,260
We would've been pretty like them when we're at their age, right?

366
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,400
Even though they're pretty and cute on the outside,

367
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:28,500
will any of those kids harass and frame other kids?

368
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,100
And gives an indelible wound.

369
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,020
So what?

370
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,880
Are you here to reveal everything to my students?

371
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,510
To ruin my career?

372
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,780
I do have something to reveal.

373
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,500
So Mi.

374
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,300
Jang Seo Ah is my boss right now.

375
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,340
I wanted to have a good relationship with her and forget about everything in the past.

376
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,500
But she keeps making a fuss out of that, so I'm having a hard time.

377
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Other kids bullied Seo Ah, but she pointed me out.

378
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,100
I want to reveal that and make everything straight.

379
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,800
Can you help me with that?

380
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,200
I don't know anything about this.

381
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,700
Also, I don't want to be involved in you guys fight after all this time.

382
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,870
I have to go.

383
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,800
  - Teacher! Hello!   
 - Hello.

384
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,300
- Who's that? 
 - Kids, let's go.

385
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,200
- I'm your teacher's friend from middle school. 
    - Really? Amazing!  

386
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,800
Was our teacher this pretty when she was in middle school as well?

387
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:42,490
- Of course! She was pretty and kind, so she was popular in school! 
   - Oh! So Mi teacher!  

388
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:49,700
- She's really popular right now as well! 
 - Really? You guys are lucky to have such a great teacher.

389
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,000
So Mi, I should get going. Ah.

390
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,700
- I found this. 
 - Wow! Who are they?

391
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,470
  - Was this your school uniform, teacher? 
 - That uniform is pretty!  

392
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:09,450
So Mi, please think about this.

393
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,300
I'm leaving now!

394
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,480
- Good Bye! 
 - Listen to your teacher carefully, guys.

395
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,600
  - Teacher, you look super cute in the uniform! 
 - Look at their faces!  

396
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,970
     

397
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,500
  Okay, listen carefully.  

398
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,200
  - Whatever you do, it's important to take the lead first. 
 - Take the lead.  

399
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,500
  Stand in front of the judges like this,  

400
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,890
  - and give some gaze like this. 
 - Yes, gaze like this.  

401
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:59,880
  - Give the vibe that I'm going to eat this audition up. 
 - Eat this up!  

402
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,810
Take the lead, give the gaze, and eat this up!

403
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,042
- Next is group number four, Lee Hae Deun! 
 - Yes!

404
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:12,086
  Kim Ji Hye, Jang Hee Eun. Let's get ready.  

405
00:34:41,566 --> 00:34:43,566
Hello. Were you looking for me?

406
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:46,546
Yes. There's a new person who came today, so you should take them around with you today.

407
00:34:46,556 --> 00:34:48,406
- I should do that? 
 - Yes.

408
00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:53,336
- I'm barely taking care of my own self... 
 - You should help.

409
00:34:53,346 --> 00:34:56,786
Hey, kid! Follow this guy.

410
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:00,786
- Nice to meet you! 
 - Hey, you..!

411
00:35:00,796 --> 00:35:03,356
Did you get a job here?

412
00:35:03,386 --> 00:35:08,336
- It's fake employment. Because you were ignoring my calls! 
 - You are really--

413
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,566
I should wear that helmet, right?

414
00:35:14,766 --> 00:35:17,066
We need to talk.

415
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:30,006
What about it?

416
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:34,066
I... wasn't going to say something like this.

417
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,766
But I...

418
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:39,366
don't like you.

419
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:43,066
It's real!

420
00:35:43,216 --> 00:35:48,336
I mean I'm really sorry that I faked to be a college student, but this is a separate issue.

421
00:35:48,336 --> 00:35:50,876
I...

422
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:56,566
I don't have any feelings for you. So stop coming here to see me.

423
00:35:59,786 --> 00:36:02,936
  No, don't be weak, Lee Ra Hoon.  

424
00:36:03,056 --> 00:36:05,246
- So, from now on--! 
 - From now on!

425
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:07,166
Can't you try for me?

426
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:10,536
If you go out with me a couple of times, you might change your mind.

427
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:15,066
  Then, I have to bring out the killer move!  

428
00:36:15,076 --> 00:36:17,526
And I have a girlfriend!

429
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:21,166
  Is it too much of a shock?  

430
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:25,266
  Is she going to faint? No, no, I should be harsher, Lee Ra Hoon.  

431
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:28,266
Now you know that, then you should go home.

432
00:36:28,346 --> 00:36:31,536
  I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Cha Ba Reun.  

433
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:44,566
Hae Deun! How was your audition?

434
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:47,866
Hello?

435
00:36:47,966 --> 00:36:50,866
- Noona! 
   - Ra Hoon.  

436
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:55,016
  Ra Hoon. I... I didn't make it.  

437
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,166
Noona!

438
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:20,056
Lee Ra Hoon.

439
00:37:20,126 --> 00:37:22,016
What am I going to do now?

440
00:37:22,066 --> 00:37:26,856
- I screwed up. 
 - What happened? You practiced all night with uncle Hwak Se!

441
00:37:26,866 --> 00:37:33,876
It was useless! He told me to make this look to take the lead,

442
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:38,146
but the judges were saying if I had problems with them...

443
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:43,156
  And said my facial expression looked terrible.  

444
00:37:45,026 --> 00:37:46,966
Noona...

445
00:37:47,776 --> 00:37:50,426
Stop crying.

446
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:16,066
Hey, you!

447
00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:23,066
Is this your... girlfriend?

448
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,566
What's that?

449
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:27,766
Who are you..?

450
00:38:28,846 --> 00:38:31,876
- Yes, she's my girlfriend. 
 - What?

451
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,166
Hey! Who the hell are you?

452
00:38:37,266 --> 00:38:39,766
Me? I'm Cha Ba Reun.

453
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:42,266
- I'm the girl Lee Ra Hoon is seeing. 
   - What?  

454
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:44,016
Hey!

455
00:38:57,366 --> 00:39:00,066
- Oh, this part. 
 - We should request to revise.

456
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:01,766
Oh, I'm sorry.

457
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:05,396
Speaking!

458
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:12,336
Right now? Yes, I'll be there soon!

459
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,266
So Mi!

460
00:39:18,286 --> 00:39:20,006
Yes, Chae Woon.

461
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:22,176
Thank you.

462
00:39:22,216 --> 00:39:24,406
Thank you so much for coming.

463
00:39:24,956 --> 00:39:28,106
I called Seo Ah as well.

464
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:42,956
I'm now a teacher of middle school students.

465
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:49,966
Honestly, it has been on my mind the whole time.

466
00:39:51,376 --> 00:39:52,756
Seo Ah.

467
00:39:52,786 --> 00:39:54,596
We did it wrong.

468
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:59,566
Other kids bullied you, but you put everything on Bit Chae Woon.

469
00:39:59,576 --> 00:40:01,976
What are you talking about it?

470
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:06,436
If it was unfair, then she should've fought for it at that time.

471
00:40:06,466 --> 00:40:09,366
She dropped out of school, and why the hell she's bringing this up now?

472
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:12,066
The reason why it became a problem now is

473
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:15,766
that I'm going to be working in the same office as you.

474
00:40:17,756 --> 00:40:19,776
Seo Ah.

475
00:40:20,066 --> 00:40:22,866
Let's make it straight.

476
00:40:23,266 --> 00:40:25,066
Chae Woon.

477
00:40:25,266 --> 00:40:27,366
I had been sorry.

478
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:32,066
We were close friends from elementary school time, but I ended our friendship over nothing.

479
00:40:32,086 --> 00:40:36,326
I regretted it a lot. Will you accept my apology?

480
00:40:36,356 --> 00:40:40,046
Hey. You don't have to apologize to me.

481
00:40:40,496 --> 00:40:46,216
I understood your situation. And thank you for your courage.

482
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,256
I have to go to the executive meeting now.

483
00:40:48,366 --> 00:40:52,166
Seo Ah, you should be honest as well.

484
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:54,286
Good Bye.

485
00:40:54,366 --> 00:40:55,966
Park So Mi.

486
00:41:13,366 --> 00:41:16,766
There's a rumor that Ms. Bit Chae Woon hit the director before.

487
00:41:16,776 --> 00:41:18,716
- Really? 
 - Yes.

488
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:23,166
Lee Bit Chae Woon. Maybe she was a school bully?

489
00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:24,866
She doesn't look like that.

490
00:41:24,866 --> 00:41:27,166
Hello.

491
00:41:31,846 --> 00:41:33,946
Ms. Bit Chae Woon.

492
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:36,516
I heard you're a scary person.

493
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:42,096
Are you talking about the rumor of school violence?

494
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:47,746
  How can she do something to the director Jang Seo Ah...  

495
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:51,996
  That's a fake rumor.  

496
00:41:58,636 --> 00:42:02,126
I don't know how that rumor started,

497
00:42:03,866 --> 00:42:08,566
but there was nothing like that.

498
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:14,066
Ms. Lee Bit Chae Woon.

499
00:42:14,146 --> 00:42:16,666
She was popular among friends.

500
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:19,896
She wasn't friend with me.

501
00:42:22,836 --> 00:42:25,276
This kind of fake rumors,

502
00:42:26,766 --> 00:42:31,066
from now on, Supervisor Yoon should take responsibility and make it straight.

503
00:42:31,096 --> 00:42:32,946
Yes, director.

504
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:53,166
Thank you.

505
00:43:02,756 --> 00:43:05,066
I regret it, too.

506
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:10,066
That I ran away without making it straight at that time.

507
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:17,386
Back then, I was a little bit intimidated by the world.

508
00:43:17,756 --> 00:43:21,206
I mean, I still feel like that.

509
00:43:22,316 --> 00:43:24,376
'I regret it, too?'

510
00:43:26,486 --> 00:43:29,096
Do you think I'm regretting right now?

511
00:43:30,806 --> 00:43:33,416
I don't at all.

512
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:36,416
I don't regret anything.

513
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:45,166
I got it, director. Anyway,

514
00:43:45,186 --> 00:43:48,126
thank you.

515
00:44:03,626 --> 00:44:05,936
  Myeongseong middle school.  

516
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,056
  There was a Myeongseong middle school sticker on her car.  

517
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:13,266
Koala.

518
00:44:13,376 --> 00:44:15,396
Thank you.

519
00:44:18,366 --> 00:44:20,666
What did the doctor say? It's nothing serious, right?

520
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:23,266
Yes, it's just because I had some stress all of a sudden.

521
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:27,896
- My goodness. You had been fine for a while, I wonder why it acts up again. 
 - I know.

522
00:44:27,926 --> 00:44:30,866
- One second. I'm going to get the prescription. 
 - Okay.

523
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:39,566
  Because of you, everything got solved. I got an apology as well.  

524
00:44:41,256 --> 00:44:43,566
  Thank you, Koala.  

525
00:44:44,186 --> 00:44:47,046
Ah! She always makes an unnecessary step.

526
00:44:51,886 --> 00:44:55,036
Seo Ah must be not in a good mood then.

527
00:45:05,266 --> 00:45:07,866
     

528
00:45:20,066 --> 00:45:21,166
Yes.

529
00:45:21,196 --> 00:45:24,896
Ms. Jang Seo Ah? What's wrong with your voice?

530
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:29,566
I'm just a little bit tired.

531
00:45:29,666 --> 00:45:31,166
  Why did you call?  

532
00:45:31,266 --> 00:45:33,766
I was going to suggest going out for dinner with you.

533
00:45:33,786 --> 00:45:36,446
  We made a promise before as well.   

534
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:41,366
Oppa, can we do that next time?

535
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,476
  I'm a bit busy today.  

536
00:45:43,496 --> 00:45:47,506
Is that so? Okay, then there's a coupon waiting for you.

537
00:45:47,516 --> 00:45:49,306
  You can use it whenever.  

538
00:45:49,336 --> 00:45:51,026
Okay.

539
00:45:54,476 --> 00:45:57,466
I guess she's in a bad mood than I expected.

540
00:45:57,476 --> 00:46:01,436
Oh, well. She has to go through it.

541
00:46:03,686 --> 00:46:05,916
It's annoying...

542
00:46:10,546 --> 00:46:13,326
It's annoying!

543
00:46:14,736 --> 00:46:17,596
Director, is there something going on?

544
00:46:17,616 --> 00:46:19,756
Nothing.

545
00:46:27,766 --> 00:46:29,366
It's annoying.

546
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:39,166
     

547
00:46:44,266 --> 00:46:46,866
  If you're going to be like this, then why did you get married to her?  

548
00:46:46,886 --> 00:46:53,286
  - Why are you making one woman's life so miserable! 
 - Do you think I got married because I wanted to!  

549
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:01,166
This mouth! This mouth!

550
00:47:11,236 --> 00:47:13,086
Ms. Jung Won!

551
00:47:16,836 --> 00:47:20,406
- It's been awhile, CEO Woo. 
 - Why did you call me? Please, have a seat.

552
00:47:20,406 --> 00:47:24,196
Oh, I guess you called me because of our consortium.

553
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:35,066
My honest opinion is I want Min Jae to live on her own with freedom.

554
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,556
What?

555
00:47:37,766 --> 00:47:43,266
How can even you can betray me like that?

556
00:47:43,276 --> 00:47:44,716
I'm sorry?

557
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:53,546
But CEO Woo, no, Jae Hee's father.

558
00:47:53,566 --> 00:47:59,236
No, I'm going to call you in the old ways.

559
00:47:59,266 --> 00:48:02,816
It has been over 30 years since I met you, Jung Hoo oppa.

560
00:48:02,816 --> 00:48:08,566
But if you break up with Min Jae like this, I don't think it's a good decision.

561
00:48:09,466 --> 00:48:12,696
Please, change your mind for this time, oppa.

562
00:48:12,716 --> 00:48:16,166
Say 'I did wrong,' 'I'm sorry,' to her,

563
00:48:16,216 --> 00:48:19,656
and take care of Min Jae's feeling.

564
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:27,866
I'm... not that kind of person.

565
00:48:28,066 --> 00:48:31,966
Where's a person like that and a person not like that?

566
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:36,346
I know that you don't actually feel like that.

567
00:48:36,366 --> 00:48:40,546
Think of this is the last chance and give it a try.

568
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:44,406
If you break up like this, you're the only one who loses!

569
00:48:44,446 --> 00:48:48,566
Without Jae Hee's mother, how are you going to live by yourself from now on?

570
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:57,966
  Min Jae's going to shop for curtains today.  

571
00:48:57,986 --> 00:49:00,226
  You should go see her.  

572
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:11,376
Of course, I have a happy occasion. I'm moving to a new place.

573
00:49:11,376 --> 00:49:13,966
So I'm going to change the mood completely.

574
00:49:13,986 --> 00:49:17,566
Is that so? Congratulations!

575
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,986
Are you a person who chose to stay single?

576
00:49:21,566 --> 00:49:23,166
How did you know that?

577
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:27,366
- I knew it! You look like that. 
 - What? Choose to stay single?

578
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,346
Jae Hee's mother!

579
00:49:35,386 --> 00:49:38,786
I was trying to let you do what you want, but did you lose your mind?

580
00:49:38,826 --> 00:49:41,186
I believe you met my lawyer, did you?

581
00:49:41,766 --> 00:49:45,766
I have no choice but to meet you today, but from next time, please talk through my lawyer.

582
00:49:45,766 --> 00:49:48,466
Min Jae!

583
00:49:48,726 --> 00:49:51,206
It's nothing.

584
00:49:53,316 --> 00:49:56,336
What! Woo Jung Hoo!

585
00:49:58,726 --> 00:50:02,596
Don't scream, talk calmly.

586
00:50:02,606 --> 00:50:04,926
You don't know that my hearing got bad, do you?

587
00:50:04,976 --> 00:50:11,516
Because of your shouting over the last 30 years, my hearing got terrible.

588
00:50:11,526 --> 00:50:13,596
Like my feelings as well.

589
00:50:13,956 --> 00:50:18,076
Okay, I get that why you're being like this.

590
00:50:18,106 --> 00:50:20,986
I'll make an effort.

591
00:50:21,066 --> 00:50:25,366
I'll scream less and get angry less and--

592
00:50:25,386 --> 00:50:32,066
- Wait for the rooster drawn on the screen to go cock-a-doodle-doo. 
 - What?

593
00:50:32,716 --> 00:50:35,016
That's what my mom...

594
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:39,066
That's what my mom used to say.

595
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:44,266
And it's right. It's better to wait for the rooster drawn on the screen to make a sound.

596
00:50:44,266 --> 00:50:46,966
You'll never change.

597
00:50:46,966 --> 00:50:52,036
- You didn't change a bit for 30 years, so it doesn't make any sense. 
 - I said I'm going to try--!

598
00:50:54,406 --> 00:50:57,266
- I'm going to make an effort. 
 - No, it's fine.

599
00:50:57,296 --> 00:50:59,226
Don't even make an effort.

600
00:50:59,246 --> 00:51:04,806
Even if you change a tiny bit in a thousand or ten thousand chances, I don't like it anymore.

601
00:51:04,816 --> 00:51:08,086
I don't want to live as a married couple with you anymore!

602
00:51:10,366 --> 00:51:14,526
Then, you can hire a housekeeper again.

603
00:51:14,566 --> 00:51:18,866
I'll get you a new vacuum cleaner and a new fridge as well.

604
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:21,286
Look at this, look at this.

605
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:25,466
This is your limit.

606
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:31,166
You only think of me as a person who cooks, cleans, and does laundry for you!

607
00:51:31,266 --> 00:51:37,366
Have you ever considered me as an equal person to you?

608
00:51:37,566 --> 00:51:40,066
You never thought of me like that since the beginning of our marriage.

609
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:43,966
Probably you thought you got a maid for your house!

610
00:51:44,066 --> 00:51:48,566
That's why you didn't care about me at all when I was suffering from your mother and just said, 'you should take it!'

611
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:52,766
- and 'you did everything wrong!' 
 - Well then, why did you get married to me!

612
00:51:52,986 --> 00:51:57,656
You're a daughter of a rich family so you could've just married another wealthy family's son and be treated like a queen.

613
00:51:57,676 --> 00:52:06,656
Why did you marry me who have nothing but terrible parents and tons of young siblings to support and made your own life hard!

614
00:52:07,266 --> 00:52:09,766
Are you seriously asking me that?

615
00:52:10,066 --> 00:52:12,566
Because I liked you!

616
00:52:12,586 --> 00:52:15,376
Because I loved you!

617
00:52:17,206 --> 00:52:20,826
Is it all if you love me?

618
00:52:21,456 --> 00:52:25,956
You tricked me and held on to me and got married.

619
00:52:31,926 --> 00:52:33,946
This is it.

620
00:52:34,336 --> 00:52:39,376
Yes, this is why. This is why I want to get divorced.

621
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:45,966
You never loved me from the beginning to the end.

622
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:52,366
I have loved you all by myself stupidly for the last 30 years.

623
00:52:53,266 --> 00:52:55,966
That's why I'm going to end this.

624
00:52:55,986 --> 00:53:02,586
I want to clean up all of my horrifying past that I want to get rid of.

625
00:53:03,656 --> 00:53:09,236
Mr. Woo Jung Hoo. Let's never see each other again personally.

626
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,766
Sure.

627
00:53:15,866 --> 00:53:19,866
Go! Go away, Jung Min Jae!

628
00:53:25,926 --> 00:53:29,176
CEO, Ms. Seo Ah is coming in.

629
00:53:34,076 --> 00:53:38,106
  I asked the front desk, and it was a person named Park So Mi.  

630
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,466
  She seems to be school alumni of the director.  

631
00:53:40,566 --> 00:53:44,766
  Did they meet together with Ms. Lee Bit Chae Woon?  

632
00:53:44,816 --> 00:53:47,336
  Ah, how did you know that?  

633
00:53:47,836 --> 00:53:52,456
  It seems like Seo Ah did it wrong.  

634
00:54:01,576 --> 00:54:03,436
I'm home.

635
00:54:03,466 --> 00:54:06,226
Was there a lot to do at work today?

636
00:54:06,846 --> 00:54:08,026
A little bit.

637
00:54:08,066 --> 00:54:10,196
Seo Ah.

638
00:54:12,196 --> 00:54:15,556
Don't you have something to tell me?

639
00:54:17,866 --> 00:54:22,166
Did Park So Mi come to see you as well?

640
00:54:22,536 --> 00:54:26,526
Or was it Bit Chae Woon?

641
00:54:30,506 --> 00:54:33,956
Why is everyone doing this to me?

642
00:54:41,576 --> 00:54:44,556
It must have been hard for you today.

643
00:54:51,466 --> 00:54:54,166
I didn't mean to do that.

644
00:54:54,266 --> 00:54:59,666
But, at that time, I hated Bit Chae Woon.

645
00:54:59,986 --> 00:55:02,846
I hated her a lot.

646
00:55:04,246 --> 00:55:08,696
She wasn't good at studying than me, and she's poor.

647
00:55:08,696 --> 00:55:15,036
She looked like nothing, but she was really good at drawing.

648
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:19,666
We were in the same art club,

649
00:55:19,696 --> 00:55:26,366
but the teachers were all only praising Bit Chae Woon, that she's born with talent, she's a born-to-be artist.

650
00:55:26,966 --> 00:55:31,266
Every other kid is intimidated by me and treated me like a princess,

651
00:55:31,766 --> 00:55:35,666
but I don't know what's so better about her, but she didn't treat me like that.

652
00:55:38,266 --> 00:55:42,966
If you were that upset, then you should've told me.

653
00:55:43,076 --> 00:55:46,166
Why did you just keep that to yourself?

654
00:55:46,566 --> 00:55:49,136
How can I say that to you, mom?

655
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,656
It's embarrassing.

656
00:55:51,866 --> 00:55:54,766
What can be embarrassing to your own mom?

657
00:55:54,986 --> 00:55:57,346
I thought you might leave me!

658
00:55:58,866 --> 00:56:01,466
After father passed away,

659
00:56:01,556 --> 00:56:04,996
to me and my brother, we only had you.

660
00:56:05,006 --> 00:56:08,276
But I was worried that you might leave us because you're not our real mother.

661
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,966
So I wanted to be good at everything!

662
00:56:12,966 --> 00:56:17,166
I wanted to make you to like me as if I'm your real daughter...

663
00:56:18,296 --> 00:56:22,086
That's why, that's why I did that...

664
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:34,966
My baby, did you even think about that?

665
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:39,966
Why do I leave Joon Ah and Seo Ah? You guys are my children.

666
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:45,266
Seo Ah is my one and only daughter.

667
00:56:47,606 --> 00:56:49,436
Mom...

668
00:57:00,566 --> 00:57:03,266
I'm not leaving you, okay?

669
00:57:22,656 --> 00:57:25,846
  But what makes me suffer more is  

670
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:32,666
  that you're misunderstanding about me.  

671
00:57:48,546 --> 00:57:50,606
     

672
00:57:54,586 --> 00:57:56,896
Yes, CEO.

673
00:57:56,936 --> 00:58:00,206
I heard everything from Seo Ah.

674
00:58:01,856 --> 00:58:03,206
Ah, yes.

675
00:58:03,236 --> 00:58:07,166
I'm sorry that I misunderstood you.

676
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:12,516
- No, it's okay, at that time I was-- 
   - I'm glad.  

677
00:58:13,016 --> 00:58:18,116
That you're a nice person like I expected.

678
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:26,266
  Let's talk more in details at the office. Have a good night.  

679
00:58:27,766 --> 00:58:33,766
Yes... Yes, have a good night. Okay...

680
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:46,146
A nice person...

681
00:58:48,266 --> 00:58:50,466
A nice person.

682
00:58:54,296 --> 00:58:56,736
A nice person.

683
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:05,366
A nice person...

684
00:59:17,066 --> 00:59:18,706
Bit Chae Woon.

685
00:59:18,716 --> 00:59:21,046
What's wrong, is something going on?

686
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:25,146
Apparently, I'm a nice person.

687
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:29,266
A nice person... A nice person!

688
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,066
Anyway, it went well, right?

689
00:59:32,106 --> 00:59:35,356
That's great!

690
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:51,276
Chae Woon! What is it about?

691
00:59:53,186 --> 00:59:56,296
Do you guys have some good news?

692
00:59:57,456 --> 01:00:01,126
- I think her unfair thing got solved. 
 - Yes, uncle.

693
01:00:01,166 --> 01:00:08,166
My goodness! I'm so happy for you! Hold my hands and let's go around in circle!

694
01:00:13,216 --> 01:00:16,666
Lee Hae Deun, how did it go?

695
01:00:16,966 --> 01:00:18,776
  How was your audition?  

696
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:23,466
Hae Deun! I called you so many times today!

697
01:00:23,606 --> 01:00:28,016
- You should've called us! You made everyone wonder! 
 - Hae Deun!

698
01:00:28,036 --> 01:00:32,906
- How did it go? Is the result didn't come out yet? 
 - It hasn't come out--

699
01:00:32,936 --> 01:00:34,916
It came out.

700
01:00:35,016 --> 01:00:37,876
And I passed!

701
01:00:38,366 --> 01:00:42,566
  Let's go around like a circle!  

702
01:00:46,066 --> 01:00:49,666
- Also, I resolved my unfair case. 
 - That's great!

703
01:00:49,786 --> 01:00:52,086
Congratulations, noona!

704
01:00:52,116 --> 01:00:54,556
- Thank you, it's all because of you guys. 
 - Let's do a party.

705
01:00:54,556 --> 01:00:58,746
- Congratulation party! 
 - We're good at that! Let's do it now!

706
01:00:58,766 --> 01:01:02,666
- There must be hidden champagne somewhere! 
 - Hey, wait for mom to come home!

707
01:01:02,696 --> 01:01:05,056
She said she has to do overtime work tonight.

708
01:01:05,106 --> 01:01:06,756
Is that so?

709
01:01:06,866 --> 01:01:09,966
I didn't hear anything like that from her!

710
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:12,066
Then did she apologize to you?

711
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:14,566
Yes, well, sort of like that.

712
01:01:14,566 --> 01:01:17,766
- Hae Deun also passed the first audition today. 
   - Is that so?  

713
01:01:17,766 --> 01:01:19,716
  That's great...  

714
01:01:19,756 --> 01:01:24,046
Noonim! When are you coming home? If you had to work overtime work you should've asked for help from me!

715
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:29,666
I'm done now. It wasn't that much of hard work.

716
01:01:30,766 --> 01:01:34,836
I'm still at the workplace.

717
01:01:34,966 --> 01:01:39,566
You guys start the party first, I'll be home soon.  Where's Hae Deun?

718
01:01:39,766 --> 01:01:42,466
Hey, Hae Deun! Mom said congratulations to you.

719
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:44,566
  Hae Deun, congratulations!  

720
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:47,666
Yes, mom. Thank you!

721
01:01:57,626 --> 01:02:00,146
Everybody's doing great.

722
01:02:02,866 --> 01:02:05,436
Those adorable things.

723
01:02:06,016 --> 01:02:08,876
Those precious things.

724
01:02:23,566 --> 01:02:25,756
  Are you seriously asking me that?  

725
01:02:25,776 --> 01:02:28,456
  Because I liked you!  

726
01:02:28,486 --> 01:02:31,126
  Because I loved you!  

727
01:02:38,926 --> 01:02:41,576
- Let's stop the car for a second. 
   - Yes, sir.  

728
01:02:53,266 --> 01:02:56,266
Excuse me! I'm going through!

729
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:05,366
  Going through!  

730
01:03:07,246 --> 01:03:09,686
  Excuse me, I'm sorry.  

731
01:03:43,356 --> 01:03:45,296
  My apple...  

732
01:03:47,096 --> 01:03:50,506
  Honey, did you see the apple that I left in here?  

733
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:53,326
  The apple was pretty, so I gave it to my sister, Jung Ok.  

734
01:03:53,336 --> 01:03:56,456
  She's pregnant with her first child, so she should eat something pretty.  

735
01:03:58,566 --> 01:04:00,966
  What about me?  

736
01:04:00,996 --> 01:04:06,386
  I also thought of our child, so I kept that pretty apple to eat later.  

737
01:04:06,446 --> 01:04:09,896
  You're being loud! I'm busy with bookkeeping.  

738
01:04:37,066 --> 01:04:39,066
Thank you, thank you.

739
01:04:49,066 --> 01:04:50,666
  Can I have a bag?  

740
01:05:49,276 --> 01:05:53,116
  I came by to pick up the stuff that I left behind.  

741
01:05:53,146 --> 01:05:57,706
  I wrote down some tips for you that'll be helpful for you to live by yourself.  

742
01:05:57,746 --> 01:06:00,166
  You should keep this in mind.  

743
01:06:12,466 --> 01:06:14,466
     

744
01:06:15,946 --> 01:06:19,346
  Number four. The thing you must keep in mind.  

745
01:06:19,356 --> 01:06:22,206
  You should change your underwear every day.  

746
01:06:22,246 --> 01:06:26,546
  It stinks a lot even if you don't change your underwear for a day.  

747
01:06:26,546 --> 01:06:30,206
  You can't help it. It's the nature of your body.  

748
01:06:33,366 --> 01:06:37,486
  You know that your undershirts get yellow often, right?  

749
01:06:37,516 --> 01:06:43,306
  Don't just take it off and wash it right away, but soak it in lukewarm water with detergent.  

750
01:06:43,316 --> 01:06:46,426
  Don't think it's a hassle and do it this way.  

751
01:06:46,466 --> 01:06:49,066
  If you stink, then people will talk badly behind you.  

752
01:06:49,066 --> 01:06:54,176
  You're still my son's father, and I don't want anyone to look down on you.  

753
01:06:54,876 --> 01:07:04,916
♫  So we could fit the puzzle called life  ♫

754
01:07:09,356 --> 01:07:13,696
♫   When I see you, I can smile   ♫

755
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,456
Min Jae.

756
01:07:15,486 --> 01:07:23,546
♫   You became a place to rest after a hard day   ♫

757
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:29,766
♫   The rain called you is making me wet   ♫

758
01:07:29,866 --> 01:07:32,866
    
    

759
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:36,866
♫   I got soaked in an unexpected love   ♫

760
01:07:36,866 --> 01:07:43,766
♫   In my meaningless life you became the meaning   ♫

761
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:50,366
  - Jae Hee's mom! 
 - Mister! What are you doing, mister!  

762
01:07:50,396 --> 01:07:53,496
  - Let me go, I have a person to see in here. 
 - Mister!  

763
01:07:54,226 --> 01:07:56,866
  He just came in without any permission...  

764
01:07:56,876 --> 01:07:58,816
Honey.

765
01:08:07,646 --> 01:08:13,126
No, wait! Let's go out and talk. Let's go out--

766
01:08:18,116 --> 01:08:20,386
Jae Hee's mom.

767
01:08:24,876 --> 01:08:29,296
It's all my fault.

768
01:08:30,866 --> 01:08:33,266
I'm so sorry.

769
01:08:37,266 --> 01:08:41,336
Oh, no. This is not okay. Why don't you go home today and let's talk again tomorrow.

770
01:08:41,366 --> 01:08:44,166
I'll call you tomorrow--

771
01:08:46,266 --> 01:08:47,906
Honey...

772
01:08:48,766 --> 01:08:52,066
I'm so sorry, Min Jae.

773
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,866
Please don't go.

774
01:09:00,366 --> 01:09:05,166
Please don't leave me! Please don't leave me!

775
01:09:08,846 --> 01:09:16,406
♫  The rain called you is making me wet  ♫

776
01:09:16,436 --> 01:09:22,906
♫  I got soaked in an unexpected love  ♫

777
01:09:22,936 --> 01:09:29,796
♫  In my meaningless life, you became the meaning   ♫

778
01:09:29,816 --> 01:09:35,986
♫   The one who taught me love   ♫

779
01:09:35,996 --> 01:09:40,206
♫  is you   ♫
      

780
01:09:40,266 --> 01:09:42,166
  Na Ro oppa got a job! Same company as unni.  

781
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:43,766
  You guys meet each other in the office and at home.  

782
01:09:43,806 --> 01:09:47,176
  - Something might happen in between them! 
 - Maybe.  

783
01:09:47,186 --> 01:09:49,016
  Did they say maybe?  

784
01:09:50,006 --> 01:09:52,786
  I get that you're working hard, but I don't think this path is right for you.  

785
01:09:52,806 --> 01:09:53,716
  Noona...  

786
01:09:53,716 --> 01:09:56,266
  I guess Hae Deun didn't pass the audition? Then why did she act like that before?  

787
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:59,706
  - Jung Won! Our Jung Won. 
 - Don't call my name!  

788
01:09:59,726 --> 01:10:03,176
  What the hell is he doing with the job!  

789
01:10:03,186 --> 01:10:05,586
  Why was he next to the Chae Woon's room?  

790
01:10:05,666 --> 01:10:08,166
  I think Mr. Woo's parents are living separately.  

791
01:10:08,186 --> 01:10:10,966
  Ta-da! Are you surprised?  

792
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:13,626
  Mr. Woo. Is there something going on?
