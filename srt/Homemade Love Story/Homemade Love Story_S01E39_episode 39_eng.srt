1
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,910
 

2
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,060
Chae Woon.

3
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,550
Yeah?

4
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,700
Yeah...

5
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,640
You weren't sleeping?

6
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,940
Yeah.

7
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,140
You weren't sleeping, Auntie?

8
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,690
Did Mr. Woo go somewhere?

9
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,300
Well...

10
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,940
Yeah, he had to go to a site early.

11
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,740
He left.

12
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,410
It looks like he went somewhere far.

13
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,400
Yeah, a bit.

14
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,740
He said he has to stay there for a while.

15
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,340
Why did you cry?

16
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,120
Because he went far away?

17
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,640
I didn't cry.

18
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,030
There's a trace of tears on your face.

19
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,220
My gosh.

20
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,930
- What could it be?
- Stop lying.

21
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,410
Why weren't you sleeping?

22
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,210
Geez...

23
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,740
Chae Woon...

24
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Anyway, cheer up. I'm going to bed now.

25
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,250
Okay.

26
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,300
- Is something wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

27
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,780
 

28
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,300
Chae Woon.

29
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,640
Hi, Mom.

30
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,630
Whoa!

31
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,490
Did you iron this?

32
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,830
I couldn't find it to wear. Of course.

33
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,020
Thank you.

34
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,890
With this shirt...

35
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,490
should I tie my hair up?

36
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,760
Let me see.

37
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,500
No? Put it down?

38
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,600
I'll do that.

39
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,460
Aigoo.

40
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,010
Mom.

41
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,780
Mr. Woo and you didn't argue 
or anything, right?

42
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,250
No.

43
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,560
Jae Hee wants to focus on work 
for now and think things through.

44
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,450
Same with me.

45
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,810
Right.

46
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,890
You both need more time, I guess.

47
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,350
Some time to endure, right?

48
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,570
Yeah. I think so.

49
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,150
But still...

50
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,080
don't try to put on 
a bold face all the time.

51
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,480
Even an elastic band will break
 if you pull too hard.

52
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,730
Let it be known to me 
when you're struggling

53
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,490
and discuss it with me.

54
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,680
Okay?

55
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,750
Okay, Mom.

56
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,100
My gosh. You two must 
really love each other.

57
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,440
 Dad, I'm leaving for 
a construction site in Incheon. 

58
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,300
 I'll focus on work there and take care
 of my company problems. 

59
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:13,980
♫  When you look at me with your warm gaze  ♫

60
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,180
 Thank you for helping me out. 

61
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,330
 I'll work hard and pay you back. 

62
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,370
 I'm sorry for my harsh words. 

63
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,900
 Oh, yeah. 

64
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,840
 I'll call Mom and ease her mind. 

65
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,340
 Please look out for her, 
so she doesn't become anxious. 

66
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,810
 Stay healthy. 

67
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,230
 Love, Jae Hee. 

68
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,200
♫  Meeting like a fate, and stopped time  ♫

69
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,800
Geez, this guy.

70
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,740
He is hell-bent.

71
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,800
♫  I'm in love, I'm in love  ♫

72
00:06:50,820 --> 00:07:02,130
♫  I guess love changes everything  ♫

73
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:08,720
♫  You make me fill up my whole day 
with the thoughts of you  ♫

74
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,140
 Koala! 

75
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,400
 I'll savor this moment. 

76
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,210
 What in the world? 

77
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,960
♫  With you  ♫

78
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,090
♫  With you  ♫

79
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,040
Joon Ah.

80
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,370
Mother, I love you.

81
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,850
What's going on this early
 in the morning?

82
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,020
Mom, I have to confess 
something again.

83
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,920
- Again?
- Yes.

84
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,460
- Can you sit for a moment?
- Oppa!

85
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,840
Hi, Seo Ah. Good morning.

86
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,910
Thank you.

87
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,250
Well...

88
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,900
I'm working at your company
 these days, Mom.

89
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,120
What?

90
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,130
You know your online photography team?

91
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,630
I'm working with them.

92
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,430
Oppa, since when?

93
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,810
It's only been a few days. Be quiet.

94
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,770
Did you shut down your 
online shopping mall then?

95
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,820
No, no. I didn't shut it down.

96
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,250
The online photography 
team saw my mall

97
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,230
and suggested that we work together.

98
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,530
They said that we have good taste, and

99
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,090
they like our styling sensibilities.

100
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,000
Really?

101
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,620
I guess your shopping mall
 must be pretty good then.

102
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,900
Our online photography 
team is quite particular.

103
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,490
Rather than liking our shopping mall,

104
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,620
my stylist is pretty good.

105
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,050
Gosh.

106
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,920
Look at this guy. Because there's 
an event at work today,

107
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,390
he's afraid that we'll bump into 
each other. That's why you're here.

108
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,400
Right?

109
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,280
Mom, that's not it. Really.

110
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,110
You know the day I went to 
you see you at your office?

111
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,930
I went there to tell you this that day.

112
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,920
But because of that Mr. Sideburn.
 Is that his name?

113
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,630
No. Hwang... Hwang Na Ro?

114
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,600
Because of him, I totally forgot.

115
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,330
If I do bump into you at work,

116
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,340
just treat me like a professional at work.

117
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,710
Hey, you too, Seo Ah.

118
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,530
Of course, we will.

119
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,780
The employees might start talking.

120
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,310
Oh, yeah.

121
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,700
Oppa.

122
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,300
What do you think of Na Ro
 after meeting him?

123
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,080
What do you mean?

124
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,460
Na Ro? That guy?

125
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,230
Well? I don't know.

126
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,100
To me, he's...

127
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,590
Forget it if you'll say you 
don't like him. Don't say it.

128
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,020
Geez, unbelievable.

129
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,920
Seo Ah, you just asked me.

130
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,650
Then you should hear me out.

131
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,500
Will you only hear what you want to hear?

132
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,230
Are you a dictator or something?

133
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,080
What are you looking at? 
I'm talking to you.

134
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,160
Thank you.

135
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,400
Hello, CEO.

136
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,700
Hello. We meet again.

137
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,460
What brings you here this morning?

138
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,930
Na Ro is here to pick me up.

139
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,400
What?

140
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,860
What the heck...

141
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,290
Do you come by every morning 
to pick up Seo Ah like this?

142
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,950
I'm Director Jang Seo Ah's assistant.

143
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,010
Gosh, this is unbelievable. 
Hey, Jang Seo Ah.

144
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,600
Even Mom goes to work alone. 
What the heck are you doing?

145
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,880
Do you have a hard time
 walking or something?

146
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,700
Are you a baby?

147
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,960
Oppa, we'll go ahead if 
you're done talking.

148
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,870
What are you saying? Are you a baby? 
We're done talking?

149
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,910
CEO, we'll see you at work.

150
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,230
See you at work, Mom.

151
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,860
You, too, Oppa.

152
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,160
Hey, what? Jang Seo Ah, stop. Hey.

153
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,070
Hey, hey. One, two.

154
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,880
 - This one.
- Okay. 

155
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,620
Dae Won, is this the one?

156
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,210
 Yes. 

157
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,860
Bit Chae Woon, take this one, too.

158
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,230
Okay, I'll get it.

159
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,300
Chae Woon, check on the 
speaker's schedule again.

160
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,850
Okay, will do.

161
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,440
- It's okay. Please rush.
- I'm sorry.

162
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,100
Let's wrap this up today.

163
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,590
Unni!

164
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,150
Fighting!

165
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,400
Gosh, I feel so bad for my sister.

166
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,080
What's going on with Bit Chae Woon?

167
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,810
What? You're Mr. Woo's friend, 
and you don't know?

168
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,760
What?

169
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,430
I guess Mr. Woo's construction 
contract didn't work out.

170
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,210
So I heard he's hit hard.

171
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,560
Is that right? I had no idea.

172
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,720
So he went to another location to 
work to make up for his loss.

173
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,820
He's separated from my sister.

174
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,140
So how do you think my sister feels?

175
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,320
But in my opinion,

176
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,540
I think this is all Jang Seo Ah's fault.

177
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,420
That CEO Kim Jung Won's daughter.

178
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,300
I heard that vixen used to like Mr. Woo.

179
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,890
You must know since you're his friend.

180
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,880
I know a little bit about it.

181
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,010
Oh, then you must know Jang Seo Ah.

182
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,260
That obsessive, rude wench.

183
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,560
I do know a little bit about her.

184
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,870
Anyway...

185
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,730
I think that Jang Seo Ah 
played a trick on him.

186
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,210
Did I go too far?

187
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,020
No. I don't know about that.

188
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,470
Anyway, I hate both CEO Kim Jung Won
 and Jang Seo Ah. Hate them.

189
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,510
Director Lee, Director Lee.

190
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,440
We need one more model.

191
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,850
I'm supposed to be the model.

192
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,280
No, not that. We have too many
 outfits. We need one more model.

193
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,710
- What should we do?
- Really?

194
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,310
Let me call the models who
 used to model for my mall.

195
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,670
They're not...

196
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,900
Why won't they answer?

197
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,210
  The customer is not answering the phone. 

198
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,910
They're avoiding my call on purpose.

199
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,670
They don't think I'll pay them.

200
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,360
- What do we do?
- Oh, trust me with this.

201
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,800
What? Who? Who?

202
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,750
Ba Reun, are you almost ready?

203
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,700
 Yeah, I'm coming. 

204
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,090
Hurry, hurry.

205
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,590
It's too cold outside.

206
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,690
What the heck?
 How could you be so cute?

207
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,390
Are you a polar bear or something?

208
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,900
It's Hae Deun unni.

209
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,850
Hi, Unni.

210
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,990
Model?

211
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,760
Right now?

212
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,510
You said to model, right?

213
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,030
Could she do a good job?

214
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,560
Has she ever modeled?

215
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,840
Let's record some poses 
to show Ba Reun.

216
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,180
Looks good.

217
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,530
Gosh, so pretty.

218
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,050
Looking great.

219
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,020
Great. So pretty. That's good.

220
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,500
Good. Look at it.

221
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,940
Let's look.

222
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,070
As for your hand gestures, 
do it a little less.

223
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,400
- What a great recording.
- Your expression is excellent here.

224
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,980
- It's a work of art.
- What the heck?

225
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,200
Aren't you Bit Chae Won's sister?

226
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,080
Hello.

227
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,690
Jang Seo Ah. That rude wench.

228
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,960
Lee Hae Deun is working as a contractor
 for the online photography team.

229
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,630
Is that so?

230
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,090
- How about my oppa...
- Hey, hey...

231
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,920
Oh, not hey.

232
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,700
Gosh, I'm speechless. I misspoke.

233
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,600
I'm sorry. We work together. Hello.

234
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,660
I heard they selected a talented stylist.

235
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,420
Did they pick just anybody?

236
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,270
By chance, did you get hired 
through Bit Chae Woon?

237
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,520
It's not just anybody.

238
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,050
You'll find out when you
 talk to Chief Yoon.

239
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,490
The online photography team 
contacted our shopping mall first.

240
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,390
You're so clueless.

241
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,170
Why do you speak so bluntly?

242
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,040
Yes, hello.

243
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,300
We're not just anybody.

244
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,620
Our stylist has an incredible sensibility.

245
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,080
Should I show you our work?

246
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,870
Chief Yoon spoke very
 highly of Lee Hae Deun.

247
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,350
She doesn't have much 
experience as a stylist,

248
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,470
but she's very talented.

249
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,520
Well, we'll have to see about that.

250
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,700
Her contract isn't that long, right?

251
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,580
I'll check.

252
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,280
Hi, Unni.

253
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,170
Bit Chae Woon.

254
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,580
Gosh, seriously.

255
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,700
How can you carry them like this?

256
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,430
You're pressing this down.

257
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,510
That's the point here. 
Why are you so thoughtless?

258
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,290
If I don't carry them like this,
 this side gets flat.

259
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,210
I checked out everything.

260
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,450
Gosh, she would've put them away 
while talking like that.

261
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,060
Lee Hae Deun.

262
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,390
- What did you just say?
- I mean...

263
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,500
you must be bored, Director.

264
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,920
You're picking on my sister 
when she hasn't done anything.

265
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,960
No, wait. I'm the director here.

266
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,370
- She was talking to me. I'm the director.
- What are you talking about?

267
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,310
What the heck? It's so annoying.

268
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,750
They're all clinging to our company.

269
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,070
Director.

270
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,520
Clinging on?

271
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,550
How about you? Are you clinging here 
because you're the CEO's daughter?

272
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,120
What?

273
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,160
You're not, right?

274
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,600
We're not, either.

275
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,800
We proved our abilities 
and were hired fairly.

276
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,960
We're working hard.

277
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,060
I believe that's not something 
you should say as a director.

278
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,230
Hey, Bit Chae Woon.

279
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,920
Director, lots of people are
 watching. Let's go.

280
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,160
 So you won't see me anymore, right? 

281
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,480
 Fine. Let's break up. Let's end it. 

282
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,670
 Have a nice life, Kim Hwak Se. 

283
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,860
 

284
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,030

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,920
 Hwak Se, where are you? 

287
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,420
 I miss you so much. 

288
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,390
 Please answer my call. 

289
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,420
 Or just text me, Hwak Se. 

290

 Hwak Se, you do what you want to do. 

298
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,690
 I'll do whatever you say. 

299
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,270
 I was so happy all this time. 

300
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,920
 I was incredibly happy. 

301
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,790
 Because of you, Hwak Se. 

302
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,260
 Because you loved me so much. 

303
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,970
 That's all there is to it. 

304
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,770
 Be sure to keep seeing a doctor 
wherever you are. 

305
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,380
 So you could continue to sing.
 You love to sing. 

306
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,840
 Hwak Se, you're the coolest
 when you sing. 

307

Oh, there's a big hole.

317
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,770
Let me see.

318
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,820
Hello?

319
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,640
Hi, Seok Ho.

320
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,460
It's me, Soon Jung noona.

321
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,850
How have you been?

322
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,800
By chance...

323
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,000
have you talked to Hwak Se lately?

324
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,970
I'm sorry. We're not open yet.

325
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,600
Hwak Se.

326
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,990
Noonim.

327
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,820
What's this, Hwak Se?

328
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,000
You got me so worried.

329
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,480
Noonim...

330
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,940
How did you find out that I'm here?

331
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,450
Did you think I'd never find you?

332
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,810
I called everyone about you today

333
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,860
that I couldn't even go to work.

334
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,670
What will you do now?

335
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,220
I'm sorry, Noonim.

336
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,930
I just...

337
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,900
couldn't face you, Noonim.

338
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,300
And it pained me to see 
Man Jung so upset.

339
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,500
So it looks like...

340
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,930
you're extremely selfish in one sense.

341
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,240
What?

342
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,190
You couldn't face me...

343
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,210
and it pained you to see Man Jung.

344
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,520
You ran away because 
you couldn't stand it.

345
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,080
I'm disappointed in you, Hwak Se.

346
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,740
I hoped that you'd plead with me.

347
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,670
That you love Man Jung and
 that you'll make her happy.

348
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,700
Or argue with me confidently.

349
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,670
"Can't you believe in me?

350
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,070
Does our love seem that 
ridiculous to you?"

351
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,800
For me to do that, I felt...

352
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,580
so bad for you, Noonim.

353
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,860
If you had just...

354
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,390
slapped me across the face

355
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,850
or slap me in the back, 
I would've felt less sorry.

356
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,300
I mean...

357
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,660
"I didn't raise my Man Jung so hard

358
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,500
to give her to a guy like you.

359
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,850
How dare someone like you...

360
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,980
- my wonderful Man Jung..."
- Gosh, you're so foolish!

361
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,640
That's right.

362
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,610
I could've said that.

363
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,260
If I'm just Man Jung's older sister,

364
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,430
I could say that a thousand times over.

365
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,780
But I'm also Kim Hwak Se's older sister.

366
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,940
To see Hwak Se, looking so intimidated

367
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,420
in front of the woman he loves, 
really offended me.

368
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,960
Noonim...

369
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,350
How did I raise her? How about you?

370
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,720
How did we come to know each other?

371
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,170
You were so pitiful living 
in the streets like that,

372
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,790
and I brought you home and turned you 
into a wonderful little brother.

373
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:52,640
Such a special relationship is 
about to be ruined overnight.

374
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,430
How could I not be cautious?

375
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,680
Gosh.

376
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,970
So...

377
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,650
when will you take 
the rest of your stuff?

378
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,630
Noonim.

379
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,840
After you left the house on a whim,

380
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,190
did you think you could come back
 to Samgwang Villa on a whim?

381
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,090
Does Samgwang Villa seem
 that easy to you?

382
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,780
I heard you're preparing 
for a radio singing contest.

383
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,000
Man Jung told me before.

384
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,510
Yes.

385
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,360
Make sure you make it.

386
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,110
Don't even think about coming 
back before you make the cut.

387
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,890
You said you love Man Jung.

388
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,630
You know that Man Jung fell
 for you watching you sing.

389
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,530
What can't you do for your love?

390
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,430
If you really love her,

391
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,050
can't you pluck a star in the sky?

392
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,750
Geez.

393
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,190
Here are some side dishes 
and bellflower tea.

394
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,970
Eat it if you want or whatever.

395
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,420
I'm leaving!

396
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,700
Noonim.

397
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,000
Noonim...

398
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,900
Noonim...

399
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,800
Gosh, why aren't they here yet?

400
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,920
- Oh, Noona!
- Unni!

401
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,840
What took you so long?
 I was so worried.

402
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,440
There was so much traffic.

403
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,410
- Sorry, Unni.
- Let's hurry up!

404
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,620
Hurry.

405
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,960
 

406
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,000
And now...

407
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,200
let's bring out a lady and 
conduct a lesson.

408
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,400
Yes.

409
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,850
Please hold it.

410
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,760
Hold the driver flat for a backswing

411
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,520
and swing with your elbow 
close to your body.

412
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,100
Nice. Good.

413
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,300
Okay, the same way.

414
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,700
Hold it.

415
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:13,840
Again. Hold the driver flat
 on the backswing

416
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,790
and bring your right elbow
 close to your body

417
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,600
and swing all the way.

418
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,120
Whoa.

419
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,890
Wow, you look great, Ba Reun.

420
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,300
You're good at modeling.

421
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,440
Thank you.

422
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,580
Hey, Cha Ba Reun. You know this is 
all thanks to my styling, right?

423
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,100
Thank me.

424
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,000
Okay.

425
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,740
The way I see it, 
my Ba Reun is talented.

426
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,860
- Aigoo.
- So I was thinking...

427
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,210
How about work as a model 
every now and then?

428
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,610
Sounds great! We have to hire 
more models anyway.

429
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,640
Really?

430
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,510
I always wanted to work as a model.

431
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,850
Really? That's great!

432
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,720
Whoa, Cha Ba Reun, 
you're a model now.

433
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,820
- Good job today, everyone.
- Unni!

434
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,180
Good job to you, too.

435
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,870
Ba Reun, you looked great.

436
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,340
Thank you, Unni.

437
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,070
It was a lot of work today, huh?
 Great styling.

438
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,530
I didn't do much.

439
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,260
My stylist is the talented one.

440
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,720
Gosh, Chae Woon, You were great, too.

441
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,540
You were flying all over 
the place carrying heavy stuff.

442
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,270
Gosh, you were cool.

443
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,350
I'm pretty strong.

444
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,660
Whoa, I think I know 
why Jae Hee is so into you.

445
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,320
Jae Hee likes strong women.

446
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,740
He loves a woman who knows 
how to butt her head.

447
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,540
Gosh, really?

448
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,640
 But now I look at you, you look
 like my mom, Moong-i. 

449
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,610
 - My beauty?
- Your strength. 

450
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,950
I heard Jae Hee is struggling because

451
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,610
the contract he was 
working on fell through.

452
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,900
I heard from Hae Deun.

453
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,140
Yes.

454
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,200
He'll overcome it.

455
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,890
Yeah, of course. He'll overcome it.

456
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,300
Well...

457
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,030
Jae Hee's panic attacks...

458
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,570
Did you know about it, too?

459
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,310
You know about it, too, Chae Woon.

460
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,430
We had a really close friend 
back in high school.

461
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,380
His name is Beom Jin.

462
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,590
During high school, Beom Jin's 
father's business failed.

463
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,630
And his family was suffering financially.

464
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,990
Jae Hee saw all that and...

465
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,480
I guess he felt bad that

466
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,370
he asked his father to help them.

467
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,780
He pleaded with him for days, but

468
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,510
Jae Hee's father didn't help him.

469
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,670
I heard through the grapevine that

470
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:38,000
Beom Jin's father's health deteriorated

471
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,460
and passed away soon after.

472
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,460
After Jae Hee heard that, 
he blamed himself.

473
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,720
He was so tormented and 
shed tears. Gosh, really.

474
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,670
I saw him struggle
 back then. Seriously.

475
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,430
Jae Hee struggled a lot then.

476
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,260
Did his panic attacks resurface again?

477
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,190
He was fine for a while.

478
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,780
Yes.

479
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,910
I think so.

480
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,200
Gosh, he must be having 
a real hard time.

481
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,720
I should visit Jae Hee.

482
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,730
He's at a site in Incheon, right?

483
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,300
He sent me a text earlier. 
Would you like to go with me?

484
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,920
I have to work late.

485
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,490
You're working late?

486
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,570
What do you mean you're working late?

487
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,330
Why are you working nonstop?

488
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,230
Don't you go on dates with Jae Hee?

489
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,450
You should stay together,
 especially at times like this.

490
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,080
Are you two having some problems?

491
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,410
No.

492
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,920
We should get back to work. 
We've been away too long. Right?

493
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,450
Yeah, sure.

494
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,040
 

495
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,920
Hello?

496
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,880
By chance, have you found 
anything on Hwang Na Ro?

497
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,520
 Nothing shows that Hwang Na Ro
 was involved in the contract issue. 

498
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,060
All right.

499
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,350
Come in.

500
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,730
 

501
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:29,500
The fact that I'm working on 
the smart clothing project...

502
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,790
Did you hear that from Director Jang?

503
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,080
Yes.

504
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,980
So I researched the industry 
trend relevant to this project

505
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,290
and future direction.

506
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,330
It's a thorough analysis.

507
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,480
If you entrust me with this project,

508
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,040
- in the future...
- Good job.

509
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,400
But unless I've asked you,

510
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:55,050
I don't like anyone touching 
my project like this.

511
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,320
My apologies.

512
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,070
Hwang Na Ro.

513
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:16,880
You must be getting involved in this
 with your future with Seo Ah in mind.

514
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,800
I'll tell you this once and for all.

515
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,170
As Seo Ah's mother,

516
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,690
I will not accept you, Hwang Na Ro.

517
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:32,900
So, don't approach me 
this way again. Understand?

518
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,680
I'll keep that in mind.

519
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,240
But...

520
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,520
Director Jang Seo Ah is...

521
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,810
leading the company proactively lately.

522
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:47,260
She's less obsessed over 
Woo Jae Hee as well.

523
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,780
I may be out of line saying
 this to you, but

524
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:55,100
ever since Director Jang 
became close to me,

525
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,660
I believe she's changing for the better.

526
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:03,070
I'll work hard and continue 
to assist the director.

527
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,550
Chae Woon.

528
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,260
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

529
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
- Have some.
- Okay.

530
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,500
I didn't come to say anything special.

531
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,330
I just thought you'd feel down today.

532
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,700
I heard Jae Hee went to
 a site in Incheon.

533
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,980
He snuck into my house 
early in the morning.

534
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,020
Oh, really?

535
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,060
It's not like he's Santa.

536
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,950
He came, took out the trash,
 and left me a letter.

537
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,950
I heard that you helped out Jae Hee.

538
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,170
Thank you.

539
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,180
Geez, don't mention it.

540
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:20,850
You must feel down being 
apart from Jae Hee.

541
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,620
- Gosh...
- Oh, no.

542
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,930
Gosh, it's all wrinkled.

543
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,940
But it's clean.

544
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,140
Thank you.

545
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,900
- Wipe your tears.
- Okay.

546
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,920
After having lived some years,

547
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:52,660
you realize a person's depth 
when facing a hard time.

548
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,140
Someone you thought was strong

549
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:59,390
turns out that he's as flimsy as paper.

550
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:03,180
And someone who 
seemed weak and fragile

551
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:07,380
turns out he's dependable and strong.

552
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,510
Chae Woon, you're deep and strong.

553
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,230
I'm sure you'll overcome this just fine.

554
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,550
Holding onto Jae Hee's hands tightly.

555
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,310
That's how Jae Hee will 
overcome this as well.

556
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,500
Yes, I'll do that, Father.

557
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,700
Thank you. Thanks.

558
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,490
Do Hyun.

559
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:43,960
The company that intercepted your 
contract is CEO Kim's subsidiary?

560
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,650
Oh, my gosh.

561
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,080
Then it really is Seo Ah?

562
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,890
My goodness.

563
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,020
You must be so upset over what 
happened to Jae Hee oppa.

564
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,400
I contacted everyone and 
tried to do something.

565
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,980
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help.

566
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:21,330
Seo Ah...

567
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,150
Yes?

568
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,750
By chance...

569
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,280
was it you?

570
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,800
What do you mean?

571
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,270
I mean, did you...

572
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,960
get angry at Jae Hee and
 took it out on him?

573
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,280
I asked Chief Yoo, Jae Hee's partner.

574
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,900
The company that intercepted
 the contract is your subsidiary.

575
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,100
No, Mother.

576
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,090
That's a coincidence.

577
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,070
Even if they're our subsidiary company,

578
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,150
there's no way for me to know 
everything they do.

579
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,460
I'm sad that you're
 suspicious of me, Mother.

580
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,400
No, I'm not saying this
 to make you sad.

581
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,540
You know, I'm straight forward.

582
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,650
No matter how much I think about it,

583
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,930
you're the most suspicious person.

584
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,600
- Really, it's not you?
- Mother!

585
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,420
Oh, my. Seo Ah.

586
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,610
Did you just yell at me?

587
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,080
If you want to figure out 
who is in the wrong,

588
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,440
it's totally Bit Chae Woon's fault.

589
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,540
What about Bit Chae Woon?

590
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,220
Do you know who caused all this trouble

591
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,030
for Jae Hee oppa's project?

592
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,100
It's Park Pil Hong.

593
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,840
It's Bit Chae Woon's birth father.

594
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,420
Oh, my. Why bring up 
Park Pil Hong now?

595
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,496
How could that moron ruin 
Jae Hee's project?

596
00:36:40,995 --> 00:36:42,662
From what I hear,

597
00:36:42,662 --> 00:36:46,072
Park Pil Hong has been trying to 
hit it big using Bit Chae Woon.

598
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:49,002
He's been circling Bit Chae Woon.

599
00:36:49,002 --> 00:36:51,562
And when a competitor 
offered him money,

600
00:36:51,562 --> 00:36:54,692
he jumped for it and ruined 
Jae Hee's contract.

601
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:56,222
My gosh.

602
00:36:56,222 --> 00:37:00,512
He did that knowing that Jae Hee is 
his daughter's boyfriend?

603
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:01,882
He'll do...

604
00:37:02,812 --> 00:37:05,622
anything for money, 
whether it's his daughter or not.

605
00:37:06,562 --> 00:37:09,212
That ahjussi still lives like that?

606
00:37:09,212 --> 00:37:10,752
Then...

607
00:37:10,752 --> 00:37:12,462
that man back then was...

608
00:37:15,262 --> 00:37:16,982
Oh, my gosh!

609
00:37:16,982 --> 00:37:18,362
Oh, my.

610
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:20,862
Ever since then, he's been...

611
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:22,392
Oh, my goodness.

612
00:37:22,392 --> 00:37:24,272
- My gosh.
- On top of that,

613
00:37:25,122 --> 00:37:28,612
he found out that Bit Chae Woon's
 fiancé's family is wealthy,

614
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:30,712
and he's very happy about it.

615
00:37:30,712 --> 00:37:33,382
Because there's plenty for 
him to rip off.

616
00:37:33,382 --> 00:37:35,142
Rip us off?

617
00:37:35,142 --> 00:37:36,972
Oh, my gosh!

618
00:37:36,972 --> 00:37:38,402
What do I do...

619
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,742
Oh, my gosh.

620
00:37:51,742 --> 00:37:53,052
Hello, Mother.

621
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:55,362
Hi, Bit Chae Woon.

622
00:37:57,192 --> 00:38:00,362
I just came back from meeting Father.

623
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,972
Woo Jung Hoo? Why...

624
00:38:02,972 --> 00:38:04,602
I guess...

625
00:38:04,602 --> 00:38:07,532
he was worried about a lot of things.

626
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:11,952
Oh, it must be about Jae Hee.

627
00:38:11,952 --> 00:38:15,262
He was never like that before.

628
00:38:15,262 --> 00:38:16,892
Would you like some tea?

629
00:38:16,892 --> 00:38:18,052
No, no.

630
00:38:18,052 --> 00:38:20,682
I have a doctor's appointment 
today. Next time.

631
00:38:20,682 --> 00:38:23,112
Then I'll walk you out.

632
00:38:23,112 --> 00:38:25,602
No, no. That's too burdensome for me.

633
00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:28,262
Get back to work. I'll go.

634
00:38:32,662 --> 00:38:35,862
Bit Chae Woon, you know...

635
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:40,842
Nothing. Good day.

636
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:42,892
Yes, be careful, Mother.

637
00:38:43,702 --> 00:38:46,502
Gosh, I totally forgot about that.

638
00:38:46,502 --> 00:38:49,872
That Bit Chae Woon has 
a troublemaker birth father.

639
00:38:55,322 --> 00:38:58,652
If my Jae Hee marries her, he'll suffer.

640
00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:02,182
He'll have a troublemaker 
father-in-law and two mothers-in-law.

641
00:39:07,622 --> 00:39:09,032
 Park Pil Hong. 

642
00:39:09,032 --> 00:39:10,622
 Thanks to Woo Jae Hee's testimony, 

643
00:39:10,622 --> 00:39:13,112
 we'll let you go with lack of evidence. 

644
00:39:13,112 --> 00:39:16,672
 But remember we'll be watching you. 

645
00:39:16,672 --> 00:39:18,202
Geez.

646
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:20,732
I feel bad for Mr. Woo.

647
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:24,922
Geez, it's one thing to be sorry.

648
00:39:34,782 --> 00:39:36,612
  The customer is not 
answering the phone. 

649
00:39:36,612 --> 00:39:40,362
 You'll be connected to
 the voicemail after the beep. 

650
00:39:40,362 --> 00:39:42,182
That's right.

651
00:39:42,182 --> 00:39:44,582
Chairwoman Choon Suk 
feels ashamed, too.

652
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,052
She can't answer my call.

653
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:51,452
Then I'll have to counterattack.

654
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:57,402
 

655
00:40:06,762 --> 00:40:08,252
What now?

656
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:15,042
Seo Ah asked you for 
a favor about this, right?

657
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:18,212
To ruin Jae Hee and Seo Yeon, right?

658
00:40:18,212 --> 00:40:22,372
Please tell me honestly.

659
00:40:22,372 --> 00:40:25,432
Tell you honestly about what?

660
00:40:26,332 --> 00:40:31,422
The subsidiary company must've 
done it to take the contract.

661
00:40:31,422 --> 00:40:33,572
Are you sure?

662
00:40:33,572 --> 00:40:35,402
I'm sure.

663
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:38,482
I know nothing about it.

664
00:40:40,712 --> 00:40:44,072
You're going to insist on it then.

665
00:40:53,612 --> 00:40:55,372
What's this then?

666
00:40:56,302 --> 00:40:58,172
 Mother-in-law, you're too much. 

667
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:00,502
 Why won't you tell me 
where Seo Yeon is? 

668
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:02,272
 I'm Seo Yeon's dad. 

669
00:41:03,402 --> 00:41:05,942
 Watching you ruin my daughter's life... 

670
00:41:05,942 --> 00:41:08,232
 I can't stand it anymore. 

671
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:11,142
 I'll give you the money
 you love so much. 

672
00:41:11,142 --> 00:41:13,162
 Take it and leave. 

673
00:41:13,162 --> 00:41:16,362
 I'll tell Jung Won that Seo Yeon died. 

674
00:41:16,362 --> 00:41:19,612
 After Seo Yeon's funeral, get lost
 to somewhere far away. 

675
00:41:19,612 --> 00:41:21,122
 Got that? 

676
00:41:22,002 --> 00:41:24,342
Park Pil Hong, that jerk!

677
00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:25,572
So...

678
00:41:26,342 --> 00:41:28,252
he sent this to you?

679
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:31,032
Step down.

680
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:33,262
What?

681
00:41:33,262 --> 00:41:35,492
Step down?

682
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:38,542
Step down from 
the chairwoman position

683
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:41,182
and go back to the States.

684
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:43,042
Kim Jung Won.

685
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,502
Are you saying you'll push me out?

686
00:41:46,502 --> 00:41:51,452
I helped you in every way I can for 
you to get to your position.

687
00:41:52,832 --> 00:41:54,952
You didn't help me exactly.

688
00:41:54,952 --> 00:41:57,542
Because of your greed,

689
00:41:57,542 --> 00:42:00,422
I overcame several crises thus far.

690
00:42:00,422 --> 00:42:03,182
You abandoned Seo Yeon 
without my knowledge,

691
00:42:03,182 --> 00:42:05,782
and you acted as if you had no idea.

692
00:42:05,782 --> 00:42:09,372
You even blackmailed Soon Jung, 
who raised my daughter.

693
00:42:09,372 --> 00:42:11,522
Chairwoman Lee Choon Suk.

694
00:42:12,252 --> 00:42:14,332
I can't tolerate you any longer.

695
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:16,112
Please step down.

696
00:42:16,112 --> 00:42:17,232
What?

697
00:42:17,232 --> 00:42:19,312
Hey. You...

698
00:42:19,312 --> 00:42:22,502
Rather than getting dismissed in 
a shareholders' meeting,

699
00:42:22,502 --> 00:42:24,712
I think it would look better...

700
00:42:25,682 --> 00:42:27,992
if you step down on your own.

701
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:29,172
What?

702
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,662
What did you say?

703
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:32,882
Hey!

704
00:42:32,882 --> 00:42:34,552
Hey!

705
00:42:36,552 --> 00:42:38,472
I said to keep the meeting short.

706
00:42:38,562 --> 00:42:41,062
Why do they talk so much? Geez.

707
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,342
You and I must have a deep tie.

708
00:42:43,342 --> 00:42:46,042
We keep running into
 each other wherever we go.

709
00:42:46,042 --> 00:42:48,172
I know.

710
00:42:48,172 --> 00:42:49,592
Isn't this amazing?

711
00:42:51,462 --> 00:42:53,052
Seriously.

712
00:42:53,052 --> 00:42:54,732
Ms. Jung Min Jae.

713
00:42:54,732 --> 00:42:56,152
Yes.

714
00:42:57,002 --> 00:42:58,612
All right then.

715
00:42:58,612 --> 00:43:00,752
Have a nice session, Noonim.

716
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:02,362
Okay.

717
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:04,542
What? What the?

718
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:07,732
Woo Jung Hoo, why are you hiding?

719
00:43:15,282 --> 00:43:18,862
Why isn't that guy leaving?

720
00:43:27,382 --> 00:43:30,502
Oh, my. You didn't leave, Professor?

721
00:43:30,502 --> 00:43:31,802
Yes.

722
00:43:33,562 --> 00:43:37,632
By chance, did you wait for me?

723
00:43:37,632 --> 00:43:41,982
I felt so lonely going home
 after my therapy sessions.

724
00:43:42,062 --> 00:43:44,562
It looked like you came alone, too.

725
00:43:48,862 --> 00:43:50,262
Thank you.

726
00:43:59,062 --> 00:44:03,962
After my wife passed away, 
I struggled with depression.

727
00:44:06,382 --> 00:44:08,862
But I'm much better now.

728
00:44:08,862 --> 00:44:12,432
But I come in every 
six months for a session.

729
00:44:12,432 --> 00:44:15,092
And I bump into you here, Noonim.

730
00:44:15,092 --> 00:44:19,842
So we ran into each other like this 
when you come in every six months?

731
00:44:19,842 --> 00:44:23,782
That's why I said we have a deep tie.

732
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,812
When I first met my wife,

733
00:44:27,812 --> 00:44:31,432
we kept bumping into 
each other by accident.

734
00:44:31,432 --> 00:44:33,482
That's right.

735
00:44:33,482 --> 00:44:38,512
If you're meant to be, you keep
 running into each other.

736
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,912
- Ow!
- Ouch!

737
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:48,692
What? Jung Min Jae?

738
00:44:48,692 --> 00:44:51,002
Why do you keep following me around?

739
00:44:51,002 --> 00:44:53,252
I'm not following you, Oppa.

740
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:56,482
Yuck! I keep bumping into 
you wherever I go!

741
00:44:59,062 --> 00:45:00,362
Wait...

742
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:21,262
- Geez, so cold.
- Hey, you're here.

743
00:45:21,262 --> 00:45:23,472
Hey, I heard you're struggling.

744
00:45:24,842 --> 00:45:26,662
Let's talk.

745
00:45:32,592 --> 00:45:36,522
Hey, there are tea, coffee, 
even cup ramens.

746
00:45:36,522 --> 00:45:38,992
Yet you give me water?

747
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:43,372
Hey, Jae Hee.

748
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,552
I'm really sorry.

749
00:45:45,552 --> 00:45:47,892
It's Seo Ah, and my grandma's doing.

750
00:45:49,032 --> 00:45:50,562
Did you hear that?

751
00:45:50,562 --> 00:45:53,062
I pretty much heard it.

752
00:45:53,062 --> 00:45:56,922
Are you having problems with 
Chae Woon because of that?

753
00:45:57,772 --> 00:45:59,642
No, it's not like that.

754
00:45:59,642 --> 00:46:01,202
Did Chae Woon say that?

755
00:46:01,202 --> 00:46:02,442
No, no.

756
00:46:02,442 --> 00:46:05,842
No, it's just me. That's just how I felt.

757
00:46:08,222 --> 00:46:10,702
Is Chae Woon doing okay?

758
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:12,792
I'm not sure if you'd say
 that she's doing well.

759
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:15,282
She's so worried about you, man.

760
00:46:15,282 --> 00:46:18,232
I think she's putting all her 
worrying energy into her work.

761
00:46:18,232 --> 00:46:19,802
When I see her at work,

762
00:46:19,802 --> 00:46:22,512
gosh, she's working 
endlessly without a break.

763
00:46:22,512 --> 00:46:24,042
I asked her to come here with me.

764
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:25,792
But she said no, saying she's busy.

765
00:46:25,862 --> 00:46:29,162
That's when I felt that something is 
going on with you and Chae Woon.

766
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:31,232
What happened? Just tell me.

767
00:46:31,982 --> 00:46:33,642
It's not like that.

768
00:46:34,432 --> 00:46:37,322
We don't want to show 
our struggles to each other.

769
00:46:37,322 --> 00:46:40,602
"We don't want to show our 
struggles to each other."

770
00:46:40,602 --> 00:46:42,092
Is that how you say that?

771
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:46,162
Whoa, I guess my friend
 really is in love.

772
00:46:46,162 --> 00:46:49,882
Hey, man. You two should be together, 
especially at times like this.

773
00:46:49,882 --> 00:46:52,092
Anyway, you two are so tough.

774
00:46:52,862 --> 00:46:55,062
- Hey, Joon Ah.
- What?

775
00:46:55,122 --> 00:46:58,062
How are Seo Ah and 
Hwang Na Ro doing?

776
00:46:58,062 --> 00:47:01,592
Hey, that's right. I came to
 ask you about Hwang Na Ro.

777
00:47:01,592 --> 00:47:03,472
What's up with that guy Hwang Na Ro?

778
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:06,902
He's stuck to Seo Ah. It looks like
 they're about to get married.

779
00:47:06,902 --> 00:47:09,112
I get so nervous watching
 them together.

780
00:47:09,112 --> 00:47:10,122
Really?

781
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:12,282
You can't let them get close.

782
00:47:12,282 --> 00:47:14,732
Hwang Na Ro, that guy wants
 to become successful.

783
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:17,262
He's doing that by sticking
 to the CEO and Seo Ah.

784
00:47:17,262 --> 00:47:20,882
Hwang Na Ro is involved 
in losing my contract.

785
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:22,482
Really?

786
00:47:22,482 --> 00:47:26,262
Right? I have a bad feeling 
about that guy.

787
00:47:27,902 --> 00:47:29,712
Hey, whatever. 
Let's talk about that later.

788
00:47:29,712 --> 00:47:32,292
Do you remember 
Beom Jin from high school?

789
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:33,742
Do you stay in touch with him?

790
00:47:33,742 --> 00:47:35,462
- Beom Jin?
- Yeah.

791
00:47:35,462 --> 00:47:37,112
No, why?

792
00:47:37,112 --> 00:47:38,762
Just because.

793
00:47:38,762 --> 00:47:40,592
Can't I just ask?

794
00:47:42,622 --> 00:47:44,012
You don't stay in touch?

795
00:47:44,012 --> 00:47:45,452
I don't.

796
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,422
I have to go. I have lots of work to do.

797
00:47:48,422 --> 00:47:50,362
I'll leave for now. I'll call you.

798
00:47:53,682 --> 00:47:56,782
Good night. Come again.

799
00:48:01,102 --> 00:48:02,902
 You said you're smart. 

800
00:48:02,902 --> 00:48:04,812
 Why do you act as if 
you have amnesia 

801
00:48:04,812 --> 00:48:06,922
 whenever I bring up 
my friend Beom Jin? 

802
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:10,322
 I begged you. 

803
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:13,032
 I pleaded with you, asking you to 
help my friend Beom Jin's family. 

804
00:48:13,032 --> 00:48:15,272
 You ignored me. 

805
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:18,042
 And then Beom Jin's
 father passed away. 

806
00:48:20,722 --> 00:48:23,732
That Jae Hee, 
he has no idea how I feel.

807
00:48:23,732 --> 00:48:26,902
Should I have told him the truth?

808
00:48:26,902 --> 00:48:28,742
Gosh, no, no.

809
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:31,272
Why bother with excuses now?

810
00:48:32,902 --> 00:48:34,402
Ms. Lee.

811
00:48:34,402 --> 00:48:36,142
Mr. Woo.

812
00:48:36,142 --> 00:48:38,302
Did you go somewhere?

813
00:48:38,302 --> 00:48:39,642
Yes.

814
00:48:39,642 --> 00:48:41,962
To see Hwak Se.

815
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:44,122
Where is Hwak Se right now?

816
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:47,052
He didn't even tell me and left.

817
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:50,912
He's working at a friend's cafe.

818
00:48:50,912 --> 00:48:53,182
Actually...

819
00:48:53,182 --> 00:48:58,822
I found out that Hwak Se 
and Man Jung are dating.

820
00:48:58,822 --> 00:49:01,322
Oh, I see.

821
00:49:02,812 --> 00:49:06,002
By chance, did you know?

822
00:49:06,002 --> 00:49:07,832
Actually...

823
00:49:07,832 --> 00:49:12,062
Hwak Se was so worried about that.

824
00:49:12,062 --> 00:49:14,362
He felt so bad for you.

825
00:49:15,402 --> 00:49:17,362
I see.

826
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:23,172
Hwak Se... He's so kind 
and soft-hearted.

827
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:26,672
I went to see him and 
said some harsh words.

828
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:30,442
I feel so uneasy about it, though.

829
00:49:30,442 --> 00:49:34,802
Gosh, Hwak Se must be so hurt.

830
00:49:38,472 --> 00:49:40,062
Why?

831
00:49:40,962 --> 00:49:43,982
You might feel uneasy, but

832
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:46,532
not Hwak Se.

833
00:49:46,532 --> 00:49:52,982
Because he found out how 
much you care for him now.

834
00:49:54,892 --> 00:49:56,752
The way I see it...

835
00:49:56,752 --> 00:50:00,102
I think you're the soft-hearted one.

836
00:50:00,102 --> 00:50:02,032
Me?

837
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:05,212
Gosh. Oh, no.

838
00:50:05,212 --> 00:50:08,632
After living through tough times,

839
00:50:08,632 --> 00:50:13,852
I'm so glad to know that 
you're still so graceful.

840
00:50:15,142 --> 00:50:18,272
Since you see me in 
such a positive light,

841
00:50:18,272 --> 00:50:20,382
it comforts me.

842
00:50:23,642 --> 00:50:26,342
Woo Jung Hoo must be so miffed.

843
00:50:26,342 --> 00:50:28,002
He didn't even come to therapy.

844
00:50:29,262 --> 00:50:32,462
We're friends. So I should apologize.

845
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:34,702
- See?
- Oh, yes.

846
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:41,312
I think it'd be nice if you're nice to her.

847
00:50:41,312 --> 00:50:42,542
My goodness.

848
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:43,842
That's right.

849
00:50:43,842 --> 00:50:48,502
They may not be lovers, 
but they could be good friends.

850
00:50:48,502 --> 00:50:50,362
Good friends who connect.

851
00:50:50,362 --> 00:50:52,312
Hwak Se or Man Jung...

852
00:50:52,312 --> 00:50:54,872
They're in love with each other. 
What can you do?

853
00:50:57,712 --> 00:51:02,402
A true friend helps another 
friend smile like that.

854
00:51:02,402 --> 00:51:05,562
- What is it?
- Oh, no.

855
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,332
 Woo Jung Hoo's smile. 

856
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:09,772
 It's still the same. 

857
00:51:13,692 --> 00:51:16,832
 He only smiles at Soon Jung. 

858
00:51:31,112 --> 00:51:33,812
This could be a workout. If you do this...

859
00:51:33,812 --> 00:51:36,312
you could exercise your elbows.

860
00:51:38,802 --> 00:51:41,802
Is your heater still broken 
at your officetel?

861
00:51:41,862 --> 00:51:43,462
Yeah, it's still broken.

862
00:51:44,562 --> 00:51:48,762
Then how about you move into 
Samgwang Villa for a while?

863
00:51:48,812 --> 00:51:50,582
I'll ask my mom.

864
00:51:51,852 --> 00:51:55,532
But that could be impolite.

865
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:57,312
Well, forget it if you don't want to.

866
00:51:57,312 --> 00:51:58,582
I didn't say I didn't want to.

867
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:01,292
I'll think about it positively.

868
00:52:06,812 --> 00:52:08,262
 Yeah, right. 

869
00:52:08,262 --> 00:52:11,832
 Before I move in, I have to tell her
 CEO Kim Jung Won is my mom. 

870
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:14,762
- Wait, Director Lee.
- Huh?

871
00:52:14,762 --> 00:52:18,902
I meant to tell you this.

872
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,612
My mom is actually...

873
00:52:20,612 --> 00:52:23,192
Yeah, you said your mom runs
 a clothing store, right?

874
00:52:23,192 --> 00:52:25,592
Yeah, it is a clothing store. Right.

875
00:52:25,592 --> 00:52:26,762
Where are you going?

876
00:52:26,762 --> 00:52:28,462
- To the restroom.
- What?

877
00:52:28,462 --> 00:52:30,812
I'm trying to talk to you. 
Why go to the restroom now?

878
00:52:30,812 --> 00:52:33,052
I know. I want to go all of a sudden.

879
00:52:33,052 --> 00:52:35,962
I have to tell you something. 
Hurry back.

880
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,822
What the heck? 
Why isn't this opening?

881
00:52:40,822 --> 00:52:42,372
It must be broken.

882
00:52:42,372 --> 00:52:43,642
It's stuck again?

883
00:52:43,642 --> 00:52:47,072
That door was stuck earlier, 
and I had a hard time.

884
00:52:47,072 --> 00:52:49,282
- Do it like this.
- What do I do?

885
00:52:50,092 --> 00:52:52,082
It's not opening.

886
00:52:52,082 --> 00:52:54,522
It locks by itself.

887
00:52:54,522 --> 00:52:56,752
People are confused about this.

888
00:52:56,752 --> 00:52:58,902
- You have to use force.
- What?

889
00:53:06,272 --> 00:53:09,232
How can you pull it out?

890
00:53:09,232 --> 00:53:11,282
I said you can't use force 
for stuff like this.

891
00:53:11,282 --> 00:53:13,602
- I said that.
- How did you pull it out?

892
00:53:13,602 --> 00:53:15,152
It just came off.

893
00:53:15,152 --> 00:53:16,702
Put it back.

894
00:53:16,702 --> 00:53:18,212
Look at this...

895
00:53:18,212 --> 00:53:20,182
Put it back.

896
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:24,772
- Director Lee.
- Yes?

897
00:53:26,262 --> 00:53:28,202
Well...

898
00:53:29,362 --> 00:53:30,872
I think...

899
00:53:32,012 --> 00:53:35,722
I think I... you.

900
00:53:35,722 --> 00:53:37,642
What did you say?

901
00:53:38,352 --> 00:53:40,772
I think I... you.

902
00:53:40,772 --> 00:53:43,032
Come again? What did you say?

903
00:53:43,032 --> 00:53:44,992
I like you, Director Lee.

904
00:53:48,852 --> 00:53:51,312
Don't you like me, too?

905
00:53:52,682 --> 00:53:54,052
Well...

906
00:53:54,902 --> 00:53:57,862
I don't. Who says?

907
00:54:01,492 --> 00:54:03,032
You don't?

908
00:54:03,972 --> 00:54:06,262
You really don't? I thought...

909
00:54:08,022 --> 00:54:12,202
All this time, I thought
 you liked me, too.

910
00:54:12,202 --> 00:54:14,222
Geez, well...

911
00:54:14,222 --> 00:54:16,042
Well...

912
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,992
Are you crying?

913
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,752
Are you really crying?

914
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:26,472
How can you cry over this?

915
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:29,582
I like you, too. Why are you crying?

916
00:54:29,582 --> 00:54:31,112
I'm not crying.

917
00:54:31,112 --> 00:54:32,952
What did you just say?

918
00:54:32,952 --> 00:54:34,082
Huh?

919
00:54:34,082 --> 00:54:35,782
I never said such a thing.

920
00:54:35,782 --> 00:54:36,882
What?

921
00:54:36,882 --> 00:54:39,402
- I never said such a thing.
- What? Didn't you say you like me?

922
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:42,112
I never said that.

923
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,252
I like you a lot, Director Lee.

924
00:54:55,882 --> 00:55:01,082
♫  Now we are going to like each other  ♫

925
00:55:01,082 --> 00:55:03,122
Why are you closing your eyes?

926
00:55:03,122 --> 00:55:05,092
Why do you close your eyes? 
To do what?

927
00:55:06,062 --> 00:55:07,742
Geez.

928
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:14,992
♫  When the time that has been 
passed comes back  ♫

929
00:55:14,992 --> 00:55:19,212
♫  Now we are going to...  ♫

930
00:55:20,302 --> 00:55:22,072
Seo Ah.

931
00:55:26,182 --> 00:55:29,282
I thought you'd need some
 food and some things.

932
00:55:30,462 --> 00:55:32,732
I was about to order something.

933
00:55:32,732 --> 00:55:35,742
No. I wanted to choose them myself.

934
00:55:36,702 --> 00:55:38,552
- This and...
- Whoa.

935
00:55:46,002 --> 00:55:47,662
Isn't it pretty?

936
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:50,332
Thanks.

937
00:55:52,112 --> 00:55:55,042
This really makes me feel at home.

938
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,012
At home?

939
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:00,532
At home.

940
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:03,562
I've never done stuff like this.

941
00:56:05,442 --> 00:56:07,362
Me, neither.

942
00:56:07,362 --> 00:56:10,402
Housekeepers always did this for me.

943
00:56:10,402 --> 00:56:13,462
But it's fun to do stuff like this.

944
00:56:17,262 --> 00:56:19,162
When I see that,

945
00:56:19,162 --> 00:56:22,832
you and I have some common grounds.

946
00:56:24,872 --> 00:56:28,202
Although we grew up in
 entirely different environments.

947
00:56:40,202 --> 00:56:42,492
I parked it on level two of 
underground parking.

948
00:56:42,492 --> 00:56:43,872
Ride it.

949
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:51,192
Is it okay for me to accept this?

950
00:56:52,982 --> 00:56:54,982
Just accept it.

951
00:56:58,052 --> 00:57:00,162
I have something to give you as well.

952
00:57:08,752 --> 00:57:12,422
What does this mean?

953
00:57:12,422 --> 00:57:16,672
It means I love you, Seo Ah.

954
00:57:18,812 --> 00:57:21,132
I'm sorry, it's not a nice ring.

955
00:57:34,632 --> 00:57:36,812
I love you, Seo Ah.

956
00:57:40,942 --> 00:57:42,642
Really?

957
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:44,992
Do you really love me?

958
00:57:52,512 --> 00:57:55,232
Don't feel anxious anymore.

959
00:57:55,232 --> 00:57:57,612
And don't be lonely, either.

960
00:58:07,162 --> 00:58:09,672
 As Seo Ah's mother, 

961
00:58:11,052 --> 00:58:12,972
 I will not accept you, Hwang Na Ro. 

962
00:58:21,492 --> 00:58:23,612
Mother, you're home.

963
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:27,092
You're late, Unni.

964
00:58:27,092 --> 00:58:28,682
Are you busy?

965
00:58:28,682 --> 00:58:31,242
Yeah. I have a conference.

966
00:58:36,592 --> 00:58:38,082
Why?

967
00:58:39,462 --> 00:58:41,592
Just because.

968
00:58:44,002 --> 00:58:47,572
Unni, I might move to Cheonju.

969
00:58:47,572 --> 00:58:49,492
I got an offer from a general hospital.

970
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,452
I've waited for their offer,

971
00:58:51,452 --> 00:58:54,152
and I'll move if the terms are good.

972
00:58:54,152 --> 00:58:56,072
Sure.

973
00:58:56,072 --> 00:58:58,372
If the terms are good.

974
00:59:22,962 --> 00:59:26,342
You'll never call me, huh?

975
00:59:26,342 --> 00:59:29,072
He read all my texts, 
and he's ignoring me.

976
00:59:29,072 --> 00:59:31,972
If I ever date another man, 
I'm a moron.

977
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:33,832
See if I do.

978
00:59:33,832 --> 00:59:37,802
I'll never date another man. 
Ever again.

979
00:59:37,802 --> 00:59:41,792
I shouldn't be waiting for him 
like this at my age.

980
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:44,602
- Never in my life...
- Auntie?

981
00:59:44,602 --> 00:59:47,712
Who are you talking to?

982
00:59:47,712 --> 00:59:50,762
What? I wasn't talking.

983
00:59:50,762 --> 00:59:53,212
You were talking like this.

984
00:59:53,212 --> 00:59:56,752
No. Aren't you hungry? 
Do you want to eat ramen?

985
00:59:56,752 --> 00:59:59,232
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

986
00:59:59,232 --> 01:00:01,042
Hey, let's make some spicy ramen.

987
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:03,592
With some dumplings. 
Mix it up. How about it?

988
01:00:03,662 --> 01:00:06,062
Doesn't it sound good? Huh?

989
01:00:06,132 --> 01:00:07,992
Here you go. Enjoy.

990
01:00:07,992 --> 01:00:09,352
- Thank you.
- Have a good time.

991
01:00:09,352 --> 01:00:11,562
- Very, very... Yes!
- Excuse me.

992
01:00:11,562 --> 01:00:13,152
Give us menus and...

993
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:15,622
- another bottle of beer.
- All right.

994
01:00:15,622 --> 01:00:16,802
Thank you.

995
01:00:16,802 --> 01:00:19,472

♫  How was your day today?  ♫

997

Woo Jae Hee.

1001
01:00:56,772 --> 01:01:01,672
Why are you struggling like this 
being apart from Bit Chae Woon?

1002
01:01:01,672 --> 01:01:07,282
♫  Wherever you may be  ♫

1003
01:01:07,282 --> 01:01:10,232
I'm doing it for Chae Woon.

1004
01:01:11,362 --> 01:01:15,042
If Chae Woon is by my side,

1005
01:01:16,632 --> 01:01:19,912
she'll struggle because of me.

1006
01:01:21,262 --> 01:01:24,132
It's right that we stay apart like this.

1007
01:01:25,342 --> 01:01:28,712
♫  Could it be you?  ♫

1008

♫  Would it really be okay

1009
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,522
Hey, Chief Yoo.

1010

♫  Am I the only one holding on?  ♫

1011

That's what I'm willing to do.

♫  I couldn't tell you this  ♫

Geez...

1015
01:01:54,082 --> 01:01:56,052
I miss her so much.

♫  Is it a goodbye?  ♫

1017
01:01:59,652 --> 01:02:01,142
Geez, seriously.

Geez...

1019
01:02:38,032 --> 01:02:41,412
 What were you doing there
 together for so long? 

1020
01:02:41,412 --> 01:02:44,292
 Anyway, he's so nosy.

♫  Did you forget?
 Did you forget about me?  ♫

1022

 Are you jealous? 

1023
01:02:49,882 --> 01:02:52,622
 You're jealous. Jealous. 

1024
01:02:53,742 --> 01:02:55,352
 You're mine, though.

 Jae Hee, are you doing well? 

1034
01:03:46,512 --> 01:03:50,712
 I'm very busy and working so hard. 

1035
01:03:50,712 --> 01:03:54,422
 I'm working hard so I won't have
 a minute to think about you.

♫  I'm trying to erase it again and again  ♫

 I'm busy without a minute to breathe. 

1039
01:04:04,002 --> 01:04:05,492
All right.

1040
01:04:08,942 --> 01:04:11,262
 Even though I'm so busy, 

1041
01:04:11,262 --> 01:04:14,292
 I miss you from time to time, Jae Hee. 

1042

 Let's go. 

1046

Here you go.

1050
01:04:59,292 --> 01:05:01,682
Did you do all this last night?

1051
01:05:01,682 --> 01:05:02,992
Yes.

1052
01:05:02,992 --> 01:05:06,742
Bit Chae Woon, aren't you 
working too hard lately?

1053
01:05:06,742 --> 01:05:08,862
You might get sick at that rate.

1054
01:05:09,922 --> 01:05:11,872
No, I'm perfectly fine.

1055
01:05:12,852 --> 01:05:14,792
You did a good job.

1056
01:05:14,792 --> 01:05:17,762
We can use this for
 the design team report.

1057
01:05:17,762 --> 01:05:19,132
Thank you.

1058
01:05:19,132 --> 01:05:21,432
I'll go to the branches then.

1059
01:05:21,432 --> 01:05:23,832
- Okay. Good day.
- Okay.

1060

Jae Hee.

1061
01:06:27,452 --> 01:06:29,102
Jae Hee!

1062

♫  I say my goodbyes to you every night  ♫

1063

♫  I erased you from 
my drunkenness last night  ♫

1064

♫  The way you spoke and

♫  No matter how much I erase you,
 I keep remembering you  ♫

1066
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:21,382
♫  I got emotional late at night  ♫

1067
01:07:21,382 --> 01:07:27,052
♫  I stepped outside the house
 in a few days  ♫

1068
01:07:27,052 --> 01:07:28,822
 

1069
01:07:28,822 --> 01:07:31,122
 Where did you go? 
You left your things with us. 

1070
01:07:31,122 --> 01:07:33,582
 Oh, my. Joon Ah, 
what are you doing here? 

1071
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:34,722
 Mom... 

1072
01:07:34,722 --> 01:07:36,152
 Mom? 

1073
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,592
 Son Ba Wi, let's play at your house. 

1074
01:07:38,592 --> 01:07:40,232
 Your house is empty. 

1075
01:07:40,232 --> 01:07:41,772
 My mom is home. 

1076
01:07:41,862 --> 01:07:44,162
 - Ba Wi, what's going on?
- Mom! 

1077
01:07:44,172 --> 01:07:46,002
 Are you Ba Wi's mom? 

1078
01:07:46,002 --> 01:07:49,122
 Dad, ahjumma was my mom for the day. 

1079
01:07:49,122 --> 01:07:52,182
 Put anything fishy on Hwang Na Ro. 

1080
01:07:52,182 --> 01:07:54,202
 Grandma, how could you say that? 

1081
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:56,372
 Let's just get married. 

1082
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:58,102
 I want to live with you soon, Seo Ah. 

1083
01:07:58,102 --> 01:08:00,772
 What's going on with Chae Woon? 
She fainted? 

1084
01:08:00,772 --> 01:08:02,052
 Seo Yeon? 

1085
01:08:02,052 --> 01:08:04,752
 CEO, the executives are all
 gathered in the conference room. 

1086
01:08:04,752 --> 01:08:08,982
 Hwak Se is going to be on
 a radio singing contest today. 

1087
01:08:08,982 --> 01:08:12,662
 I'd like to dedicate this song
 to Lee Man Jung. 

1088
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:16,426
♫  My memory is...  ♫
