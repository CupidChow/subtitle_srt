1
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,100
Dad, what brings you here?

2
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,580
Why are you dressed like
 that at this hour?

3
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,090
Yoo Jae Hee.

4
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,650
Dad, not again...

5
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,810
Dad, did you lose your memory again?

6
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,730
How did this happen?

7
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,590
Let's go home, Yoo Jae Hee.

8
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,690
How did you lose your memory?

9
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,130
Did you get hurt? Let me see you.

10
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,480
- Let me see.
- Let's just go!

11
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,310
Dad?

12
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,060
  
You really scared me. I thought
 you lost your memory again.

13
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,970
Did I scare you?

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,440
It's hot.

15
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,070
I'm glad to hear that.

16
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,500
But why did you come dressed like that?

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,970
I have to do this so that you'll like me.

18
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,340
What?

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,000
You were nice to me when I was 
James dressed like this.

20
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,060
Well, you did complain quite a bit then, too.

21
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,890
But you looked at me with 
affection back then.

22
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,350
Gosh, what affection...

23
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,500
After I got my memory back,

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,050
I was reminded of living as James.

25
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,020
I missed it.

26
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,250
You said this last time.

27
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,900
That you liked me because I was 
James then, not your dad.

28
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,610
When I heard that, I was actually
 shocked, to be honest.

29
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,060
I thought I must've been such 
a bad father for you to say that.

30
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,150
You were shocked back then?

31
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,060
I didn't notice it at all.

32
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,020
Hey, man. You don't know me at all.

33
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,050
You think that my facial
 expression says it all.

34
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,070
So why don't you express
 what's in your heart?

35
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,720
Don't pretend to say "No" 
when you mean "Yes."

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,880
Don't exaggerate your "No's."

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,630
I'm going to do that from now on.

38
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,670
I've made up my mind.

39
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,360
Though, I'm not sure if 
I could do a good job.

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,720
Anyway, as the first step to my resolve,

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm here to reveal a secret to you.

42
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,130
A secret?

43
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,250
Sit over here.

44
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,070
I'll just sit here.

45
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,950
Come sit here.

46
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,560
Who are you calling?

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,000
 Yes. 

48
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,860
Beom... Beom... Beom Jin?

49
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,160
Beom Jin? Long time no see.

50
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,690
This is Jae Hee's dad.

51
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,620
 Yes, Mr. Woo, hello. 

52
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,350
 I heard from Joon Ah. 

53
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,690
Did you ask Joon Ah to find Beom Jin?

54
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,470
That's right.

55
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,170
Beom Jin, it's not bedtime there yet, right?

56
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,170
 Yes. 

57
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,670
Then, say hello to Jae Hee.

58
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,240
Hey, Beom Jin. Long time no see.

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,540
Where are you? Are you overseas?

60
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,900
 Jae Hee. 

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,830
 How have you been? 

62
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,710
 I'm in LA. 

63
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,720
 I've lived here over ten years. 

64
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,990
Hey.

65
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,960
Hey, what happened to you?

66
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,470
Are you doing well?

67
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,960
 Of course. 

68
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,020
 I'm married already with three kids. 

69
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,850
 I heard you're not married yet. 

70
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,610
Gosh, man.

71
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,520
You're doing well.

72
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,060
 Joon Ah told me that you're an architect. 

73
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,370
 - You fulfilled your dream. 
- That's right. I did.

74
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,280
- And you? What do you do?
 - I'm an accountant. 

75
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,660
Whoa!

76
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,640
Hey, Kim Beom Jin. That's fantastic.

77
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,650
 Your father helped us tremendously. 

78
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,890
 Your father cosigned for my dad... 

79
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,200
 and was even attacked. 

80
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,090
 You had no idea, huh? 

81
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,050
 Please spare me! I'll pay you back! 

82
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,700
 I'll pay you back soon! Please spare me! 

83
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,720
 - That's not it. Ahjussi, ahjussi...
- Spare me... 

84
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,630
 Actually, we were so embarrassed 
and felt so bad 

85
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,830
 that my family ran away. 

86
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,100
Dad, why didn't you tell me the truth?

87
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,080
I blamed you, misunderstood you, 
and was mean to you.

88
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,230
Why? Why didn't you tell me the truth?

89
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,300
Had I told you the truth, would you 
have liked me as a father?

90
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,450
Our relationship was rocky
 from way before.

91
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,590
But still! Why did you make 
me the bad guy...

92
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,090
Why are you a bad guy?

93
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,580
You were heartbroken over your friend.

94
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,160
And...

95
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,920
I was furious at myself then.

96
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Wondering if there was no way
 to save Beom Jin's father...

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,230
Was there another way?

98
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,960
I blamed myself a lot for it.

99
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,090
Why are you telling me this now? Huh?

100
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,030
Why are you revealing this now, even locating 
Beom Jin, who lives in the States?

101
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,910
So that I could score some points with you.

102
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,750
So that you'd listen to what I have to say.

103
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,430
What do you want to say?

104
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,940
To tell you to come home.

105
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,680
Don't leave behind Chae Woon, 
whom you love the most in this world

106
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,640
and don't be miserable and suffer here.

107
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,730
To convince you to come home,

108
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,770
I took out a hidden card of my own.

109
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,460
More than anything,

110
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,600
I can't stand to watch Chae Woon
 suffer being away from you.

111
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,480
You're not going to break up 
with Chae Woon, are you?

112
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,820
Chae Woon will become your wife soon.

113
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,830
Someone like that is hurting like that.

114
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,270
Will you leave her like that?

115
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,120
What kind of fortune are 
you going after that

116
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,100
two lovers are separated 
and going through this?

117
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,120
Life is short, man!

118
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,690
I'm off.

119
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,430
Wait, Dad. Dad...

120
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,830
Dad...

121
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,750
Koala.

122
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,420
Isn't the CEO stretching herself with this?

123
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,540
Manufacture smart clothing? 
That's nonsense.

124
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,310
On top of that, build a research center?

125
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,550
I heard all the executives
 are against the idea.

126
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,920
They say it will waste an
 enormous amount of funds

127
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,390
and destabilize the company.

128
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,410
I also don't think it's realistic.

129
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,520
Could I take a look at it, too?

130
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,320
- Yes, go ahead.
- Thank you.

131
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,530
 

132
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,380
It looks okay to me...

133
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,060
Ba Reun, looking good, 
but could we try another pose?

134
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,230
Another pose.

135
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,010
- Pretty.
- Yeah, so pretty.

136
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,300
Not the one that covers your side...

137
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,080
Director Lee, give her something 
that covers the top of her head.

138
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,730
Okay.

139
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,170
What are you looking at?

140
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,480
Director Lee, not that one.

141
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,000
Geez.

142
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,440
Give her this.

143
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,870
What the heck?

144
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,860
You should look straight ahead. 
Then this wouldn't happen.

145
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,600
What are you looking at?

146
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,290
It's not like you're a zombie.
 Why are you doing that?

147
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,420
There's someone I don't want to look at.

148
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,620
Someone you don't want to look at. Who?

149
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,310
- It must be me, of course.
- Don't talk to me.

150
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,770
- Should I do this?
- Yeah, it's cute.

151
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,460
What do you mean it's cute? That?

152
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,690
- No, it's cute.
- No...

153
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,350
- Ba Reun, you shouldn't...
- I said it's cute.

154
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,440
Okay, put it on. It's cute.

155
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,110
- Whoa, looking good.
- So pretty.

156
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,310
Looking good! You like that?

157
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,910
No! Not the scarf!

158
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,250
- What should I do?
- Cha Ba Reun.

159
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,260
- Ra Hoon, you're here.
- Lee Ra Hoon, what's up?

160
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,300
Ba Reun is almost finished. 
We're going to work together.

161
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,910
We need more time for her to finish.

162
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,460
You said I'd be done at 4 p.m.

163
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,150
Yeah, it was supposed to end at 4 p.m.

164
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,620
But it's going slower than we thought.

165
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,140
Wait here and go together later.

166
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,500
I can't. We have to go now.
 We don't have much time.

167
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,560
What do I do?

168
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,080
Well, we can't help it.

169
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,010
I'll go to work alone today.

170
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,150
It's okay.

171
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,820
- Good day.
- Sorry, Ra Hoon.

172
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,050
- It's okay.
- Bye. Sorry.

173
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,350
Let's take a few more in a different pose.

174
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,820
Give me a minute.

175
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,710
Lee Ra Hoon!

176
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,840
I'm sorry. You came all the way here.

177
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,960
We can't help it. Go back and work.

178
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,140
Hurry up and get back to work.
 I'm really fine.

179
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,280
Cha Ba Reun! Hurry and come.

180
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,740
Okay, Unni.

181
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,190
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,820
- See you at home.
- Okay. Fighting!

183
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,540
- Fighting! Fighting! 
- Let's do it right!

184
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,460
Gosh.

185
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,760
Honey is dripping out 
of your eyes, Jjung-a.

186
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,520
You caught me.

187
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,760
Whoa, we're home already.

188
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,370
Jjung-a, you have to get back
 to the hospital to work.

189
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,100
Thank you.

190
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,450
You took a half-day off 
because of me.

191
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,020
What in the world? Of course, I should.

192
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,310
You're coming back to Samgwang Villa. 
Of course, I should bring you home.

193
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,400
But you know...

194
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,640
last night...

195
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,190
well...

196
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,550
Sashimi was delicious.

197
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,080
- Sashimi. Sashimi was delicious.
- Right.

198
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,130
- And the sunrise.
- I know. The best sunrise at the ocean.

199
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,840
- And the ocean is...
- Ganghwado.

200
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,480
Ganghwado. Ganghwado.

201
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,210
It was so nice.

202
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,980
Ganghwado is the best, right?

203
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,810
- Right?
- Yeah, the best ocean.

204
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,450
Where did you go?

205
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,570
We went on a quick trip to Ganghwado.

206
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,050
I know.

207
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,160
So you spent the night 
together on your quick trip

208
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,940
and saw the sunrise this morning, huh?

209
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,060
- Yes, we saw the sun come up...
- Right.

210
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,430
Oh, my gosh!

211
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,870
Oh, my! What in the world?

212
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,070
- Oh, Unni!
- Aunt! Aunt!

213
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,080
Slow down! You'll fall!

214
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,720
- Oh, my gosh! Unni!
- Be careful!

215
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Eems hyung.

216
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,560
We just saw the sunrise...

217
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,120
and we just held hands 
last night and talked.

218
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,220
And it was time to see the sunrise. 
So we saw it together.

219
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,630
Yup.

220
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,280
Not like that.

221
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,680
Really. We held hands and talked. 
And the sun came up.

222
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,020
You're weird, Eems hyung.

223
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,450
Gosh. I'm glad you're back, Hwak Se.

224
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,740
I was so worried about you.

225
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,240
Don't go anywhere from now on.

226
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,560
Eems hyung.

227
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,420
Thank you, Eems hyung.

228
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,160
I missed you so much, Eems hyung.

229
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,590
It's okay. It's okay.

230
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,650
Noonim.

231
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,800
Did you sleep at the hospital
 again last night?

232
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,330
Yeah.

233
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,400
I saw patients last night.

234
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,100
I finished really late. 
So I had no choice.

235
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,730
See the patients late, my foot.

236
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,170
I called you last night, too.

237
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,200
Oh, you called, Unni?

238
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,720
I see.

239
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,810
I went to see Hwak Se.

240
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,410
You gave me his address so I could go.

241
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,200
Aigoo. You sure listen to me 
well at times like that.

242
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,160
I listen to you well, Unni.

243
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,570
I listen to you so well, Unni. 
Whatever you say...

244
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,760
We went to Ganghwado together.

245
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,490
Well, Noonim...

246
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,970
I'm... I'm sorry.

247
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,680
It's all my fault.

248
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,290
I was wrong. I was so foolish.

249
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,260
Noonim, please forgive me.

250
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,220
And Noonim...

251
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,020
I want to be Jjung-a's man.

252
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,740
Please give us your approval.

253
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,480
Please let me bow. I wish you 
good fortune in the new year.

254
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,500
Why are you bowing?

255
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,390
The floor is cold. You don't have to bow.

256
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,710
But still.

257
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,960
I won't approve.

258
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,950
What?

259
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,690
Unni, why are you changing your mind?

260
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,440
Why did you give me his address then?

261
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,990
Make the final cut at
 the end of the month.

262
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,120
Then I'll give you my approval.

263
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,780
Wait, Noonim.

264
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,190
Noonim, thank you.

265
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,600
Thank you, Noonim! Thank you!

266
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,750
Aigoo, hate you. Hate you.

267
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,620
Me, too. Me, too.

268
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,800
Aigoo, seriously.

269
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,990
- Unni...
- What are you guys doing?

270
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,150
Me, too!

271
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,220
 

272
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,860
It looks like a pretty good project.

273
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,360
What are you working on so hard?

274
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,690
Mom.

275
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,210
How do you feel? Are you okay?

276
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,480
Yes.

277
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,290
Don't get sick. Okay?

278
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,610
Okay.

279
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,290
Oh, this?

280
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,400
 
I'm working on this.

281
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,080
I wanted to discuss this with you anyway.

282
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,030
I saw the report from the meeting 
and thought it looked pretty good.

283
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,820
So I was looking things up.

284
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,740
Do you think it's pretty good?

285
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,770
Wow, you're the first one who 
showed a positive response on this.

286
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,110
Really?

287
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,660
Yeah.

288
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,290
If you're interested, I'd love your help.

289
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,700
Could I do that?

290
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,490
I want to research this.

291
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,090
I'd be so grateful if 
you'd do that, my daughter.

292
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,770
It's tough for you these days, huh? 
Since you can't see Jae Hee.

293
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,160
It's bearable.

294
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,610
Hello.

295
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,060
 

296
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,900
 - Welcome. 
- Welcome.

297
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,950
My daughter's neck hurts due to
 too much phone usage.

298
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,150
- She'll be a senior next year.
- Really?

299
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,530
She should be studying instead.

300
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,200
Please recommend a bed for her.

301
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,400
I was listening to an internet lecture.

302
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,670
Besides, I don't like their style. 
I won't buy theirs.

303
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,920
Come. Try lying down here.

304
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,380
Whoa, Mom, this feels so good.

305
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,560
Mom, try lying down.

306
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,020
- It feels good?
- Yeah, try it.

307
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,300
- It's great.
- Let me try.

308
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,790
Wel...

309
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,330
Oh, my.

310
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,790
Noonim, I'm here.

311
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,470
Professor, what brings you here?

312
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,380
I'm so grateful for you watching 
over Ba Wi last time.

313
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,550
I'd like to take you out to dinner.

314
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,250
Are you free tonight?

315
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,120
My gosh. You didn't have 
to worry about it.

316
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,490
Where is Ba Wi?

317
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,200
He's at his grandma's house. 
He'll be there for a few days.

318
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,520
I was always worried because 
Ba Wi has a sensitive personality.

319
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,720
But I'm so grateful for 
your warm, loving care.

320
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,600
Ba Wi is such a good, sweet child.

321
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,930
When I'm with Ba Wi,

322
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,840
I'm reminded of when I used
 to raise Jae Hee.

323
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,300
It puts me in a good mood.

324
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,370
I guess Jae Hee's warm heart 
takes after you, Noonim.

325
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,000
Ba Wi also takes after you,
 so he's cheery and kind.

326
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,080
Gosh, you're too kind.

327
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,400
Anyway, thank you for loving my Ba Wi.

328
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,830
Oh, yeah. Have you been to the 
hiking trail behind our apartment?

329
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,020
No, not yet.

330
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,840
I went a few days ago. It's pretty nice.

331
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,720
Since it's still winter, the trees are 
bare and the place feels empty.

332
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,440
But how should I say it...

333
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,080
It's quiet, and the atmosphere is nice.

334
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,200
It was nice to hear winter birds sing.

335
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,320
I should go there sometime. 
I love to hike.

336
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,520
Really?

337
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,260
I love hiking, too.

338
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,520
Then let's go together 
when you have time.

339
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,480
Okay.

340
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,310
Let's go with Ba Wi.

341
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,510
Yes, yes.

342
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,770
Ba Wi will love it.

343
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:29,570
I'm so happy to meet a good
 friend like you, Noonim.

344
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,820
Okay.

345
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,360
 It's been so long since
 I felt my heart flutter. 

346
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,020
- Gosh, you're right.
- I know.

347
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,760
Professor, thank you for tonight.

348
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,990
Next time, I'll treat.

349
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,690
That'd be nice.

350
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,620
I'm counting on it next time, Noonim.

351
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,280
Yes.

352
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,050
Go on.

353
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,250
After you.

354
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,720
Okay.

355
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,740
Oh, my gosh!

356
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,880
Kamjiki.

357
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,420
Geez.

358
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,940
Why am I reminded of Woo Jung Hoo
 at times like this? Geez!

359
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,140
See you all tomorrow.

360
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,500
 - Bye! 
- Good night!

361
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,260
 - I'm okay.
- Just put it on. 

362
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,270
 It's cold. You have to wear it. 

363
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,840
♫  Did you forget all those memories  ♫

364
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,550
 

365
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:43,780
♫  My heart is opening arms to you  ♫

366
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:49,610
♫  I'm barely going through today  ♫

367
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:55,090
♫  When the memories are fading  ♫

368
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:00,850
♫  I stand on the street 
where we walked together  ♫

369
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:06,330
♫  I'm trying to erase it again and again  ♫

370
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,190
♫  But I can still hear you 
breathing on my ear  ♫

371
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,180
I wonder if Seo Yeon is
 feeling better now.

372
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,040
She looks gaunt.

373
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,790
Because of me...

374
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,950
♫  I'm still waiting for you  ♫

375
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:27,800
♫  My love is crying  ♫

376
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:34,720
♫  My heart is filled with tears  ♫

377
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,290
♫  I'm trying to erase it again and again  ♫

378
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:46,090
♫  But I keep thinking of your face  ♫

379
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,450
♫  I'm trying to erase it again and again  ♫

380
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:04,220
♫  But I keep thinking of your face  ♫

381
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,120
Hi, Mom.

382
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,470
Well...

383
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,520
I'm still at the office.

384
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
How about dinner?

385
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,100
I ate.

386
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,550
Yes. A lot.

387
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,060
I see.

388
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,850
We're eating right now.

389
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,380
Oh, Chae Woon.

390
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,270
We have great news today.

391
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,360
Earlier...

392
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,820
Chae Woon, I'm back!

393
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,670
Uncle!

394
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,470
I'm glad you came back.

395
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,420
You had us worried.

396
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,940
Do you know how much
 Auntie worried about you?

397
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,220
Gosh, I know.

398
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,260
Geez, Mr. Woo should come 
back soon just like I did.

399
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,420
Right?

400
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,160
 Why are you saying that? 

401
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,470
 Uncle must be in pain. 

402
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,080
 Okay, Chae Woon. 

403
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,750
Don't be too late tonight.

404
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,670
Chae Woon noona, 
tell me if you're coming late.

405
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,630
 I'll wait for you at the bus stop. 

406
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,490
Oh, okay.

407
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,340
Chae Woon, see you later.

408
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,720
Joon Ah, you're there, too.

409
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,210
Yes, enjoy your dinner. Okay.

410
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,280
- Did you hang up?
- Ma'am.

411
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,590
Shouldn't Chae Woon call me "oppa"?

412
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,600
Oh, my. You're right.

413
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,350
Doesn't Chae Woon call you "oppa"?

414
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,620
Huh?

415
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,770
Not yet.

416
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,780
I think that's because she feels awkward.

417
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,500
That's right. She could feel awkward.

418
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,340
"Oppa" could feel awkward. 
"Unni" is more comfortable.

419
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,980
Wow, that's so neat, though.

420
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:56,510
Joon Ah, you're Chae Woon's 
older brother and Mr. Woo's friend.

421
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,910
That's right.

422
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:01,500
And Hae Deun's boss at the same time.

423
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,880
Whoa!

424
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,090
Gosh.

425
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,800
Hae Deun noona.

426
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,170
Why are you so quiet tonight?

427
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,060
What? What do you mean?

428
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,990
- You argued with someone, huh?
- No.

429
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,720
I see.

430
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,950
Hae Deun argued with someone here.

431
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,260
- I said no.
- No?

432
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,080
You guys, eat.

433
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,170
- Joon Ah.
- Yes?

434
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,110
Do you like the food?

435
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,930
The side dishes. Ma'am, 
all the side dishes are so good.

436
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,170
I gained 2 kgs already after I moved in.

437
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,930
- Really?
- Yes.

438
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,630
You can never relax living here
 in Samgwang Villa.

439
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,690
Noonim's food is so delicious that
 if you eat whatever she serves,

440
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,070
you'll get fat in no time.

441
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,560
- Aigoo.
- That's right!

442
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,770
Gaining 5 kgs a week is so easy.

443
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,090
Aigoo, forget it. Stop it.

444
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,400
Eat.

445
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,320
Joon Ah.

446
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,130
- Yes?
- Eat a lot.

447
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,700
Thank you, ma'am.

448
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,690
Thank you for the meal.

449
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,240
Hey, Hae Deun, why...

450
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,940
Why is she leaving in
 the middle of the meal?

451
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,830
 Ta-da! 

452
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,370
 Put this on, too. 

453
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,870
 It looks good on you. 

454
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,870
 Whoa! Wait, wait! 

455
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,520
 - It's not time yet.
- Not yet! 

456
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,960
 Chae Woon. 

457
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,150
 I love you. 

458
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,630
Who's there?

459
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,460
Jae Hee?

460
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,710
 It's me, Seo Yeon. 

461
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,380
 It's your dad. 

462
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,990
Did you follow me here again?

463
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,430
Wait, well, I...

464
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,500
Oh. Ah... can you hear me?

465
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,530
I can hear you.

466
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,840
 You went to the ER and all. 
I was so worried. 

467
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,500
 Are you okay now? 
You're not dizzy anymore? 

468
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,570
The doctor said that you have 
symptoms of anemia, too.

469
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,260
I'm fine.

470
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,760
 I'm really sorry about Mr. Woo's contract. 

471
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,990
I just wanted to...

472
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,880
Just...

473
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,430
It's cold. Go home.

474
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,780
Let's make plans to meet next time.

475
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,050
The reason I'm not opening
 the door is that...

476
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,600
I don't want to let you into

477
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,410
Jae Hee's office when he's not here.
 I feel bad for Jae Hee.

478
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,930
Yeah.

479
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,250
Okay. I understand.

480
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,030
I'll leave after I say this.

481
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,500
No, no. Don't open the door.

482
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,990
I'm too ashamed to go inside.

483
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:31,040
Well, I did that because...

484
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,450
I wanted to be a good dad to you for once.

485
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,990
 I had no idea that Mr. Woo was 
connected to that contract. 

486
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,520
You don't have to try to be
 a good dad to me, Park Pil Hong.

487
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,010
I lived well without a good dad all this time. 
I've worked through it alone.

488
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,480
So, please...

489
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,770
please don't think like that.

490
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,590
 I don't... 

491
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,690
expect anything from anyone.

492
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,940
Now and going forward.

493
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,280
I'm just doing my best to live well.

494
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,900
I can make it on my own.

495
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,610
I don't need anyone, so...

496
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,540
I will be fine alone, so Dad...

497
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,560
You, too, Park Pil Hong...

498
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,030
I hope you live a life you won't 
be ashamed of in my eyes.

499
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,140
I just wanted you to see me...

500
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,690
 with a good job... 

501
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,140
Go home. It's cold, so go home.

502
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,470
 Okay. 

503
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,250
I'll go.

504
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm leaving.

505
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,300
Mr. Woo.

506
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,340
I'm sorry, Mr. Woo.

507
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,960
I'm sorry about everything.

508
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,490
Did you leave?

509
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,770
It's cold outside today.

510
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,010
Jae Hee.

511
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,310
Chae Woon.

512
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,020
When did you get here?

513
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,810
Did you run into Park Pil Hong, too?

514
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,820
He left.

515
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,300
We weren't going to break down.

516
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,890
No.

517
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,920
I came to break it all down.

518
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,320
Jae Hee.

519
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,360
I'll tear it all down...

520
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,600
and I'll stay by your side, Chae Woon.

521
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,730
I won't leave you alone...

522
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,010
anymore.

523
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:09,470
I'll always be with you.

524
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,140
Together...

525
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,540
We'll endure together.

526
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,810
I'm sorry.

527
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:29,780
♫  I'm going toward you slowly  ♫

528
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:37,790
♫  Take one step toward me for me  ♫

529
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:47,980
♫  Don't say anything  ♫

530
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:54,640
♫  What will you need? You have me  ♫

531
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:01,280
♫  I feel bad for having 
nothing to give you  ♫

532
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,000
♫  Don't you cry, I love you  ♫

533
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,550
Seo Yeon...

534
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,300
My Jung Won...

535
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,360
Did you discuss this with 
our legal team leader?

536
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,040
Yes, I did discuss it.

537
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:29,180
I don't think the Chairwoman and 
Director Jang could avoid police investigation.

538
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,730
Mr. Woo Jae Hee's company subsidiaries
 are preparing a lawsuit as well.

539
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,790
Yes.

540
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,290
I did ask Grandma for a favor.

541
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:50,080
I wanted to destroy Jae Hee oppa
 because I hated him.

542
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,600
Seo Ah, are you out of your mind?

543
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,960
Is this some kids' play?

544
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,880
Because of you...

545
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,900
do you know how many people are in 
a terrible predicament, including Jae Hee?

546
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,000
I didn't know things would
 get this bad, either.

547
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,620
I didn't know Jae Hee oppa's company
 would suffer such a huge blow.

548
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:14,430
Hwang Na Ro helped you
 with this, too, right?

549
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:17,530
Everyone should go in for 
an investigation voluntarily.

550
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,800
Ask Jae Hee for forgiveness as well.

551
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,260
Mom.

552
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,580
Aren't you too harsh?

553
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,210
You should cover up for your 
daughter, who is cornered.

554
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:34,010
This isn't something
 I should cover up for you.

555
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,870
You need to fess up and
 ask for forgiveness.

556
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:40,250
I'm sure you'd be different if 
Bit Chae Woon were in the same situation.

557
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:47,020
If it were Bit Chae Woon, she wouldn't 
have done something so stupid.

558
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,950
That's right.

559
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,490
It was stupid.

560
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,060
But have you thought about 
how I've come to this?

561
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,650
No matter how hard I try,

562
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,360
you don't even see me anymore, Mom.

563
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,550
Seo Ah...

564
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,120
Why do you think that?

565
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,590
I won't depend on you anymore, Mom.

566
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:25,860
I'll depend on someone who
 truly likes me and trusts me.

567
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,750
By chance, are you talking 
about Hwang Na Ro right now?

568
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,830
No, never. Not Hwang Na Ro.

569
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,560
Do you understand?

570
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,340
Seo...

571
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,540
Gosh, I feel like I'm dreaming.

572
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,560
I can't believe I'm walking 
this street with Koala again.

573
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,890
I feel like I'm dreaming, too.

574
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,550
If things were going as planned, we'd 
be preparing for our wedding right now.

575
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,390
We can prepare for the
 wedding starting now.

576
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,110
Really?

577
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,780
What? Why?

578
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,980
Did you change your mind
 already, Koala?

579
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,250
No, no. I really want to get married. 
I'd marry you tomorrow.

580
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,650
But as you know, Moong-i...

581
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,250
My situation got worse.

582
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,790
Let's not consider our situation 
and circumstances anymore.

583
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,600
We can have a simple wedding.

584
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,830
I want to be with you as 
soon as possible, Koala.

585
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,720
Moong-i...

586
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,250
Gosh, I think I'm getting ahead of myself.

587
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,920
I'm begging you to marry me. 
I should play hard to get. Right?

588
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,140
No, no. I just feel bad.

589
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,020
I couldn't bring it up because I feel so bad.

590
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,890
Who said to let's live together 
as soon as possible?

591
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,780
Let's go ahead as planned.

592
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,710
Let's cheer up and pull 
ourselves together, okay?

593
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,410
Thanks, Moong-i.

594
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,160
Auntie.

595
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,770
- Mr. Woo!
- Auntie.

596
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,150
- How have you been?
- Oh, my goodness! I'm glad you came!

597
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,830
 - Unni! Mr. Woo is here!
- No, don't. 

598
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,400
- Mr. Woo?
 - Koala is here. Come out, everyone! 

599
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,710
 Mr. Woo is here! 

600
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,660
- Hey! Koala is here!
- Auntie!

601
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,390
- Auntie!
- Everyone, come out!

602
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,170
- Gosh!
- Mr. Woo! Mr. Woo!

603
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,950
- I'm back.
 - Oh, my goodness! 

604
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,910
 Welcome! 

605
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,440
Hey, Woo Jae Hee! You're back!

606
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,270
How are you?

607
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,440
You've been through a lot, Mr. Woo.

608
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,670
- Did you get some time off?
- I'm back for good.

609
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,740
Really? You're back for good?

610
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,050
Yes, Mother.

611
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,460
Aigoo! That's great, Mr. Woo!

612
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,850
That's wonderful! That's great!

613
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:03,030
We thought you left for good. 
We were so sad!

614
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,060
We were so sad.

615
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,220
We thought you left for good, Uncle. 
We were so sad.

616
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,840
Oh, I see.

617
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,270
I'm sorry. So sorry.

618
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:14,590
Gosh, I'm so happy that you're back.

619
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:17,030
You've been through a lot.

620
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,360
I'm sorry for making you worry, Mother.

621
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,460
Gosh, don't be sorry.

622
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,710
I feel like the house is
 full now that you're back.

623
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:29,270
Seeing you, Mother...

624
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,770
makes me so happy.

625
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,120
And...

626
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,760
well...

627
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,550
Mom.

628
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,460
You know how we were
 going to get married?

629
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,340
We're thinking of moving 
forward with it.

630
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,430
What do you think, Mom?

631
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,440
Get married?

632
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,560
I'm sorry to bring up the wedding 
under the circumstances.

633
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,060
So you two talked it out?

634
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,710
Yes.

635
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,020
Yeah.

636
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,650
Even though we're struggling, 
we thought we'd just go for it.

637
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,540
So I brought it up.

638
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,000
I feel shameless, but if you'd approve,

639
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,930
we'd like to get married. 
But make it simple.

640
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:20,240
My gosh. Mr. Woo...

641
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,610
What's there to be shameless about?

642
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,330
How can you say that?

643
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:29,250
I know full well how much
 you love each other.

644
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,700
Yeah.

645
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,740
When you stay together as a family,

646
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,980
you'll gain more strength.

647
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,210
Gosh, Chae Woon. I'm glad 
you decided to do that.

648
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,700
I'm glad you decided to 
do that, Mr. Woo.

649
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,150
- Thank you, Mother.
- Thank you.

650
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,080
 What? 

651
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,780
- Are you getting married now?
- Scared me.

652
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,660
 - Congrats, Unni! 
- Congratulations!

653
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,800
Congratulations, Mr. Woo!

654
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,330
You have to stick together 
during hard times.

655
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,480
- I'm so happy for you.
- That's right!

656
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,990
I could sing you a 
congratulatory song, right?

657
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:05,090
- Really?
- Thank you.

658
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:09,340
Okay, I'll take care of the health exam. 
A must-to-do before getting married.

659
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,200
Then I'll take care of your 
wedding photos!

660
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,720
Me, too!

661
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,590
Then I'll do your styling as a bride, Unni.

662
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,940
I'll just congratulate you.

663
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,870
- Gosh, congrats, Bit Chae Woon.
- Congrats.

664
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,320
- Thank you.
- Congrats, Hyung.

665
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,230
Congratulations.

666
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,420
Then from now on...

667
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,060
Whoa!

668
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,290
Hey, you changed the room completely.

669
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,030
It's late, but welcome, my friend.

670
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,900
What? Why are you talking like that? 
Are you from North Korea or something?

671
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,060
Geez.

672
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,810
Never mind.

673
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,620
- Joon Ah.
- What?

674
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,150
Thanks for finding Beom Jin, man.

675
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,280
What are you saying? So cringey.

676
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,340
If your father hadn't asked me,
 I wouldn't have looked for him.

677
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,450
Hey, did you talk to Beom Jin?

678
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,780
Yeah. He's totally successful 
in the States.

679
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,700
Right?

680
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,620
Beom Jin is so grateful to your father.

681
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,580
I'm thankful to him.

682
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,150
How are Seo Ah and Hwang Na Ro?

683
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,720
Geez, why are you asking me
 about them?

684
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,870
Don't ask me. It stresses me out.

685
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,190
In any case, now that I'm in this house,

686
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,650
I'll go home often and
 pay attention to Seo Ah.

687
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,320
That's what I mean. What are 
you up to these days?

688
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,380
What are you doing?

689
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,040
Act like Seo Ah's older brother.

690
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,770
Jae Hee, you take care of yourself. 
That's all you have to do. You do you.

691
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,840
- Okay? Jae Hee...
- Yeah, I'll do a good job.

692
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,930
Hey, I heard this used to 
be Hwang Na Ro's room?

693
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,060
Right.

694
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:44,290
But I can't believe that I'm the one 
who moved into this room.

695
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,980
It's a nice room, though.

696
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,950
Right? Do you want to switch rooms?

697
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,720
The heater isn't working well here. 
It's so cold here. I'm off.

698
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,320
What? Hey...

699
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,020
I'm asking you to duke it 
out officially. Hey.

700
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,410
Seo Ah.

701
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,170
Where is she...

702
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,660
Seo Ah.

703
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
What's going on...

704
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,590
Mom keeps disapproving of you.

705
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,290
So I'll just do this.

706
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,790
I'll stay here for now.

707
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,580
This isn't a good solution.

708
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,230
Then what's a good solution?

709
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,400
If I don't do this,

710
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,080
Grandma will accuse you 
of doing everything.

711
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,330
And Mom won't just sit back, either.

712
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,550
Seo Ah, you promised to listen to me.

713
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,340
You're all I have, Na Ro.

714
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,330
So don't tell me to leave. Please?

715
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,930
Give me a minute.

716
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,800
 

717
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,390
Aren't you happy now that
 Mr. Woo is back?

718
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,020
Yeah.

719
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,970
Aigoo, my daughter finally
 looks happier.

720
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:35,090
I felt so bad to watch you 
from the sideline.

721
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,850
I'm sorry for making you worry, Mom.

722
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,940
Aigoo, gosh.

723
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,410
Thank you for giving us your blessings.

724
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,780
Chae Woon, look at this.

725
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:55,750
I've been making your wedding plans.

726
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,980
Mom...

727
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,540
When did you do all this?

728
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,540
You're so detail-oriented.

729
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,310
Oh, Mom.

730
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,710
Well, actually...

731
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,410
I brought up getting married first 
with Jae Hee this time.

732
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,730
I said, let's just go for it.

733
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:19,420
But gosh, did I look too pathetic?

734
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,730
No.

735
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:27,360
Why bother playing games 
and be calculated now?

736
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,920
You both love each other so much.

737
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,350
Mr. Woo probably couldn't have brought 
it up first under the circumstances.

738
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:39,180
I'm glad you reached out to him first.

739
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:48,470
Then I'll have to start discussing 
your wedding details with the CEO.

740
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,320
Okay.

741
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,610
A phone call.

742
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:54,250
 

743
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,150
- It's the CEO.
- Answer it.

744
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,290
I wonder what's up.

745
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,840
Joon Ah... Jung Joon Ah...

746
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,450
Why did you fall in love?

747
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:07,290
Geez, I don't usually fall for it. 
Why did I...

748
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:08,810
Geez...

749
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,950
What's this?

750
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,960
Hwang Na Ro?
 

751
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,230
What's with him?

752
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,470
Wait. I never saved his number.

753
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,410
Oh, it's him.

754
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:26,410
Should I answer or not? Should I or not?

755
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,720
Hello?

756
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,080
Mom.

757
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,350
Hi, Seo Yeon.

758
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,460
I'm sorry to call you over so late.

759
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,980
It's okay.

760
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,470
Where did Seo Ah go?

761
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,700
To Hwang Na Ro's officetel.

762
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,380
I just talked to Hwang Na Ro.

763
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,500
Where is that? Let's go right now.

764
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,120
Let's do that.

765
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,770
My heart is shaking so much.

766
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,470
I wanted to go with you.

767
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,510
Seo Yeon...

768
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:04,000
What do I do with Seo Ah?

769
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,190
I have no idea how she's 
come to be like that.

770
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,970
Hwang Na Ro won't let her in that easily.

771
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,970
If he wants to be on your good side.

772
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,790
CEO, you have a guest.

773
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,650
Hwang Na Ro.

774
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,890
How could you do this?

775
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,090
Mom.

776
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,860
My apologies.

777
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,330
I thought you'd be worried, CEO.

778
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:51,620
I came right away as soon
 as I got your call.

779
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,300
Seo Ah is fine.

780
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:58,970
I called Joon Ah to stop by.

781
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,330
You called Joon Ah?

782
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,060
- I should go.
- CEO.

783
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,330
I think it's better if you don't
 meet Seo Ah right now.

784
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,340
I was able to calm down Seo Ah finally.

785
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,800
Hwang Na Ro.

786
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,010
Are you able to control Seo Ah's
 emotions that easily?

787
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:24,060
It's not that.

788
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,180
It's just that...

789
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,020
Seo Ah trusts me and 
depends on me a lot. And...

790
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,440
we genuinely love each other.

791
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,850
What did you say?

792
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:44,850
CEO, I'll spend the night
 elsewhere tonight.

793
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:47,400
Joon Ah will stay with Seo Ah.

794
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,920
So I hope you're not too anxious.

795
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,860
How can I not be anxious?

796
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,180
My Seo Ah has lost her head over 
a guy like you and is like that!

797
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,700
Hwang Na Ro.

798
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,810
Talk to me.

799
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,030
Do you really like Seo Ah?

800
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,450
I love Seo Ah.

801
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,600
Genuinely.

802
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,150
You're so brazen.

803
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,040
Bit Chae Woon.

804
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,260
Just for once...

805
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,450
can't you trust me and help me?

806
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,560
Must you cling on and not let go?

807
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,160
I should cling on.

808
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,120
In any case, Seo Ah is my sister.

809
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,870
I can't let her go down the wrong path.

810
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,200
And for me to trust and help you,

811
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,860
too many things have 
happened between us.

812
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:07,240
If you genuinely like Seo Ah,

813
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,910
be honest and tell her everything.

814
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:14,390
How you moved into Samgwang Villa 
and approached me,

815
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,720
and why you moved out 
of Samgwang Villa.

816
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,450
What kind of person you are...

817
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:23,990
Tell Seo Ah and my mom honestly.

818
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:26,250
And if I tell them honestly,

819
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:30,740
do you think CEO Kim will accept me?

820
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:33,390
No way.

821
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:36,040
Can't help it then.

822
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,460
If you really love her, shouldn't 
you be able to do that?

823
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,650
If you really love her,

824
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,420
shouldn't you be ready to leave?

825
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,540
Why should I do that?

826
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,030
For someone like me, 
I don't deserve to love

827
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,270
nor be loved? Because of such 
a standard that you set?

828
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,600
I can't do that.

829
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,430
Then I can't help you, either.

830
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,150
Na Ro.

831
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,450
Na Ro, my foot. Hey.

832
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,930
What are you doing this late at night?

833
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,760
Did Na Ro call you?

834
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,620
Yeah. Na Ro called me.

835
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:37,160
Hwang Na Ro is with Mom right now.

836
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,210
He said he'd go out for a moment.

837
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,820
What?

838
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,960
Gosh, look at her.

839
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,520
Come out. I'll take you home.

840
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,170
I don't want to.

841
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,900
- I'll stay here.
- Hey, Seo Ah.

842
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,790
Why are you doing this?

843
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:57,850
- Jae Hee said that Hwang Na Ro...
- Don't tell me!

844
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:00,480
Why are you doing this to me, too?

845
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,120
At least, you should side with me!

846
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,360
Hey, stop yelling.

847
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,890
I'll side with you only if
 it makes sense to do so.

848
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,410
You know?

849
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,450
Hurry up and come out.

850
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:16,540
CEO must be so worried 
because of Seo Ah.

851
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,940
Okay.

852
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,170
Then sleep there tonight, Chae Woon.

853
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:24,780
Yes, Mom.

854
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,630
Go to sleep.

855
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,820
Yeah, okay.

856
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,240
Thanks, Joon Ah.

857
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,950
Okay.

858
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,610
Yeah.

859
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,500
Is Seo Ah okay?

860
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,360
Yeah. Joon Ah will stay with her tonight.

861
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:58,830
But are you really going to 
sleep here tonight?

862
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,380
Yes.

863
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,220
I feel bad leaving you here alone.

864
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,580
And we promised last time.
 I'm supposed to sleep over like this.

865
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:10,170
Gosh, girl. Thanks.

866
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:14,600
You're so reliable at times like this.

867
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,660
Oh, yeah.

868
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,140
Jae Hee is back.

869
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,700
Really?

870
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,160
- Is he well?
- Yes.

871
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,420
I'm relieved. Really.

872
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,940
What is he going to do now?

873
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,400
He said he'll rebuild as 
though he's starting anew.

874
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:34,970
I'll help him wholeheartedly, too.

875
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,200
I'm so glad that Jae Hee is 
gaining his strength back.

876
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,180
But all this happened 
because of Seo Ah...

877
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,310
I can't bear to face you.

878
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:50,540
Why would you feel that way, Mom?

879
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:56,580
I know what Seo Ah means
 to you, Mom.

880
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:01,280
As my mom raised me with 
everything on the line,

881
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,040
you must've done the same.

882
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,100
Seo Ah will know how you feel, too.

883
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,050
Do you think so?

884
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,110
Of course.

885
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,250
Oh, yeah.

886
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,800
We're thinking of moving 
forward with our wedding.

887
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,530
Really?

888
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,950
True. You should resume.

889
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,800
 My Seo Yeon is getting married soon. 

890
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,000
 I'll have to make a decision now. 

891
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:48,150
I lost.

892
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:49,830
Geez.

893
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,180
 I think I'm a big part of the blame 

894
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:58,110
 for you becoming so anxious. 

895
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:05,210
 I should've looked after
 my one and only sister. 

896
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:31,720
Oh, my.

897
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,010
Oh, my...

898
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,580
What's wrong with me?

899
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,530
Gosh.

900
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,520
Geez!

901
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,120
Why do I keep thinking of Woo Jung Hoo

902
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,620
whenever my heart flutters?

903
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:06,050
I feel bad, too.

904
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:07,800
Geez.

905
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:18,100
Yeah.

906
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:22,690
The branches have done well 
this month as well.

907
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:27,130
The branch that my sister
 runs is doing the best.

908
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:31,970
Wow! I had no idea my sister would 
be so good at running a business.

909
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:35,880
I had no idea she was like that.
 My goodness...

910
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,240
Pardon?

911
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,850
Oh, never mind.

912
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,380
Hi, Jae Hee.

913
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,000
Hello, Uncle.

914
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,080
You went through a lot.

915
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,500
Don't mention it.

916
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:59,160
 
I prepared the memorandum 
of financial obligation.

917
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,600
- Take a look.
- Okay.

918
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,010
Are you feeling all right?

919
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,980
Yes.

920
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:19,760
I'm fine. I'm strong since I take after you.

921
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,960
I gave you a great inheritance.

922
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,860
Yes. Thank you.

923
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,820
The memorandum looks good.

924
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,420
- Should I sign?
- Yeah.

925
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,070
Here.

926
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,870
Thank you so much again, Dad.

927
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:47,810
Be sure to pay the principal 
and interest every month.

928
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:51,060
If you're late, even for a day, 
I'll add on the late fee.

929
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,180
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

930
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,620
- Oh, Dad, we're...
- Yeah.

931
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,370
I heard you're moving ahead 
with your wedding plans.

932
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,170
I spoke to Chae Woon.

933
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,970
Oh, you did?

934
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,740
Are you happy?

935
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,830
Yes, I'm happy.

936
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,120
Then I'll get going. I have 
a lot to take care of.

937
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,060
Okay. Wait.

938
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,830
I looked into it a bit.

939
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:25,800
Did Chairwoman Lee Choon Suk
 interfere with your contract?

940
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,050
Seo Ah's grandmother.

941
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:30,820
I think so, but I don't have any proof.

942
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:38,320
Then, does it mean that Seo Ah
 did that out of anger toward you?

943
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,210
Well, I'm not sure.

944
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:02,130
- Seo Ah, last night...
- I heard you slept over at my house.

945
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,420
You're so funny.

946
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,560
You run over to my house as soon 
as I'm out of the house.

947
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,260
Will you continue to stay at 
Hwang Na Ro's place?

948
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,390
Yeah. I'll live there from now on.

949
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:18,100
- Why are you doing this?
- Don't butt in.

950
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,650
I guess you'll go over to 
my house whenever you want.

951
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:24,250
Well? Do as you please.

952
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,590
I don't care about you anymore.

953
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:41,290
I was going to visit you anyway. 
I'm sorry to make you come.

954
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:42,820
There's a board of directors' meeting.

955
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,720
No worries.

956
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,180
I was thinking of visiting you anyway.

957
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:53,160
Let's have fun preparing for 
Chae Woon's wedding.

958
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,580
Okay.

959
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:57,610
CEO.

960
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:07,590
About putting Chae Woon on 
my family registry?

961
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:09,440
Yes.

962
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,540
I actually heard about it from Chae Woon.

963
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:18,370
I heard that Chae Woon told you

964
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:20,840
she doesn't want to go on your registry.

965
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,720
She did.

966
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,230
 I'd rather not be acknowledged
 as your daughter. 

967
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:31,830
 Even if I'm never acknowledged 
as your daughter,  

968
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:33,910
 I'd rather go back to before 

969
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,710
 and prove my ability 
as Lee Bit Chae Woon 

970
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,630
 and get rewarded proudly. 

971
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:44,110
It breaks my heart when
 I think about that time.

972
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:46,200
I feel so bad.

973
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:52,050
The reason Chae Woon said 
that to you is

974
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:55,590
probably because you were 
struggling so much.

975
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,830
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

976
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,590
And also, CEO...

977
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:05,790
I know things are very difficult
 for you right now, but

978
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:10,450
I think now may be the last chance.

979
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,640
Open it.

980
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:32,100
Without any trace or proof in this world,

981
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,900
this is the money you can have.

982
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:43,760
You have to do something for 
me before you take this money.

983
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:54,000
 

984
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,000
The board of directors' 
meeting will start soon.

985
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:12,060
It's a meeting that convened to 
discuss my dismissal.

986
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:17,680
 A reporter will be waiting 
for you in the lobby. 

987
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,720
 Meet him and tell him everything. 

988
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,350
 That you're Jung Won's ex-husband, 

989
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:27,520
 and you share a daughter with Jung Won. 

990
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:32,570
Say that CEO Kim Jung Won left you
 and abandoned your daughter.

991
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:37,900
Say that she's afraid that the story will

992
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,550
be revealed.

993
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:42,290
Chairwoman, that's not true, though.

994
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:44,710
That's why I'm giving you 
this money to do that.

995
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:48,070
 Your interview will be posted 
on the internet right away. 

996
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:50,710
 The directors will see it 
in the meeting as well. 

997
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:55,720
 After that, Mr. Nam will 
give you this briefcase. 

998
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:00,830
 Then the deal between you 
and I are over. 

999
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:02,860
Are you Park Pil Hong?

1000
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,940
 I'm sorry, Seo Yeon. 

1001
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:13,780
It took so much for me to come this far.

1002
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:18,720
I can't give up my position!
 I can never give it up.

1003
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,890
I can't give up my position!

1004
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,680
 
Then...

1005
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:31,460
we'll start the meeting to discuss 
Chairwoman Lee Choon Suk's dismissal.

1006
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:36,590
CEO Kim Jung Won proposed this agenda.

1007
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:40,230
 I know things are very difficult
 for you right now, but 

1008
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:44,590
 I think now may be the last chance. 

1009
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:47,450
Excuse me, Director Jang.

1010
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:50,430
Yes?

1011
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,160
Before we begin our meeting,

1012
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,880
I'd like to reveal something to you all.

1013
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:08,950
Yes.

1014
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,720
Yes, I got it.

1015
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,480
Bit Chae Woon.

1016
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,160
Yes, Chief.

1017
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:20,100
I have...

1018
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:26,260
a daughter that I could not 
reveal to the world.

1019
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,650
I'm sorry.

1020
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,770
I'm sorry, Director Jang.

1021
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:51,960
You came over to my house 
last time about this.

1022
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,230
But I couldn't tell you the truth then.

1023
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,920
I apologize.

1024
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:04,760
As for the penalty for not 
revealing this matter to you...

1025
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,310
I'll accept it wholeheartedly.

1026
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:16,290
Lee Bit Chae Woon.

1027
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:18,980
Yes, CEO.

1028
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,890
Come to the front.

1029
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:43,260
Everyone.

1030
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:45,990
This is my biological daughter...

1031
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:49,390
Lee Bit Chae Woon.

1032
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,020
CEO.

1033
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,340
 What's going on? 

1034
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:56,560
 What's she talking about? 

1035
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:02,500
This is my long-lost daughter that 
I found after about 20 years.

1036
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,640
Mom.

1037
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:21,090
 Soon Jung, I got up the courage. 

1038
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:23,990
 I revealed that Seo Yeon is my daughter. 

1039
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,520
 Thanks for giving me the courage. 

1040
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,160
My gosh.

1041
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:32,000
Gosh...

1042
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,320
You did great.

1043
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,230
Gosh, you did great, CEO.

1044
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:39,610
 What is she saying? 

1045
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:41,440
 What in the world? 

1046
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:50,670
 What's going to happen now? 

1047
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:03,290
Gosh, thank you.

1048
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:12,320
♫  I say my goodbyes to you every night  ♫

1049
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:18,030
♫  I erased you from 
my drunkenness last night  ♫

1050
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:24,640
♫  The way you spoke and
 the way you looked at me  ♫

1051
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:31,830
♫  No matter how much I erase you,
 I keep remembering you  ♫

1052
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:35,130
♫  I got emotional late at night  ♫

1053
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:37,150
 

1054
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:40,310
 - Do you stay in touch with Park Pil Hong?
- Seo Yeon! 

1055
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:41,660
 Trust me, Mother. 

1056
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,760
 Did you cause trouble again? 

1057
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,150
 Come out. Hurry. 

1058
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:46,450
 - Mr. Makjang!
- Talk to me for a minute. 

1059
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:50,820
 Legally or on paper, you and 
Bit Chae Woon are not related. 

1060
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,820
 That's right. You're right! 

1061
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:54,240
 Are we dating again then? 

1062
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,750
 - I'll think about it.
- What's there to think about? Hae Deun! 

1063
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,290
 Let's rent upstairs of your father's house. 

1064
01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:59,100
 Upstairs room? 

1065
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,420
 How can you live in 
your father-in-law's house? 

1066
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:04,280
 Hey, it's a big house. It's livable. 

1067
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,120
 Did you know, Soon Jung? 

1068
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,680
 Mom, how could you do this? 

1069
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,700
 You'll have to be
 investigated by the police. 

1070
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:10,560
 Mom! 

1071
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,970
 Let's... 

1072
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:14,380
 - get married.
- Seo Ah. 

1073
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,380
 Marry Jang Seo Ah? 

1074
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:18,240
 I'll be the son-in-law of LX...
