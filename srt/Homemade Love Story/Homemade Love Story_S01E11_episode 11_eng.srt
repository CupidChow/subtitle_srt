1
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,110
- Jae...
- Jae...

2
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,770
Jae...

3
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,790
Im...

4
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,920
Se?

5
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,420
James?

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,010
 
The patient...

7
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,640
isn't entirely alert yet.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,350
We'll keep an eye on him for now.

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,500
Yes.

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,680
Then, I'll get going now.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,000
I paid for the hospital bill.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,350
You'll have to stay longer.

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,960
If he doesn't gain consciousness, 
we'll have to report this to the police.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,380
We'll need the witness testimony.

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,050
My goodness.

16
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,580
It's so weird.

17
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,530
Why...

18
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,380
do I keep thinking of him?

19
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,450
 
 It's a gift. 

20
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,860
 To be a good writer, 
you have to know Korean well. 

21
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,010
Gosh...

22
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,020
He can't be.

23
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,100
He has a different name, too.

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,120
 

25
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,540
 

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,800
LX...

27
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,420
 Oh, you didn't know about it? 

28
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,540
 It is our CEO's brand. 

29
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,470
 And she's the director of the company. 

30
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,410
 

31
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,010
Hi, Chae Woon.

32
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,900
Mom, where are you?

33
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,130
 
Well...

34
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,570
I'm at...

35
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,490
I'm at work.

36
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,940
I'm at Yeonhuidong madam's house.

37
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,000
Why?

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,220
Well...

39
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,640
I saw you still in bed this
 morning when I left.

40
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,240
It was bothering me.

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,360
I told you I'm doing fine.

42
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,970
Aren't you at work right now?

43
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,070
Get back to work.

44
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,310
Mom, you're really okay, right?

45
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,770
 Yeah. 

46
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,510
All right then.

47
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,150
Mom, I love you!

48
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,050
Chae Woon.

49
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,350
Yeah?

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,830
Well...

51
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,530
you know the company
 you're working for?

52
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,370
Yeah, what about my workplace?

53
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,030
 Would it be... 

54
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,070
 - okay if you quit that job?
- Hello? 

55
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,310
 Mom? 

56
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,340
Oh, no.

57
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,750
I love you, too, my daughter.

58
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,110
I know.

59
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,390
Okay, I'm hanging up.

60
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,760
You looked much better then.

61
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,540
Geez, I look the same.

62
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,280
Dae Won, I'm done.

63
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,250
Okay.

64
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,740
Kim Dae Won as a baby.

65
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,280
Isn't he so cute?

66
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,540
Whoa.

67
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,530
- I see your face there.
- Totally the same.

68
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,130
- And this is you, Choi Hyo Jung?
- Yes.

69
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,850
Gosh, your pudgy cheeks are so cute.

70
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,920
- You look exactly the same.
- Na Ro.

71
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,730
Show us your baby picture, Na Ro.

72
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,770
I don't have any.

73
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,630
Gosh, how can you not have any?

74
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,470
And you're the only son.

75
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,020
Let us see it.

76
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,360
It's true, though.

77
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,640
Then why don't you look at mine?

78
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,880
Yes, I wanted to see it.

79
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,980
Wait a minute. Where was it?

80
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,030
Here it is.

81
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,230
So cute!

82
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,030
Your cheeks are so pudgy.

83
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,460
- You look exactly the same.
- Totally the same.

84
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,670
I look much better now.

85
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,750
Anything exciting?

86
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,530
Hello.

87
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,720
- Hello.
- What is it?

88
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,100
Your baby picture, Bit Chae Woon?

89
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,500
Gosh, you were adorable.

90
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,250
Director.

91
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,120
Could you take a look at this?

92
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,730
Shall we get back to work?

93
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,820
Ah, yes.

94
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,100
As for this...

95
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,580
 I'm totally adjusting to the workplace. 

96
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,110
 Of course, Samgwang Villa, too. 

97
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,270
Lee Bit Chae Woon?

98
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Who am I?

99
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,990
She's falling for me already.

100
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,120
Okay. Hang up then.

101
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,810
 - Hey, get him!
- Get him! 

102
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,580
 Stop right there! Get him! 

103
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,890
Stop right there!

104
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,260
Hey, man!

105
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,040
Stop! Hey!

106
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,550
Oh, my.

107
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,100
Are you awake?

108
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,310
Let me get the doctor.

109
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,290
Please save me.

110
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,520
You're alive.

111
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,420
You are alive.

112
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,930
You're okay.

113
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,820
Please lie down.

114
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,560
Those guys are chasing me.

115
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,280
Gosh.

116
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,610
By chance, are they creditors?

117
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,350
Please help me.

118
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,910
Help me.

119
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,480
Please save me.

120
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,240
You still need to be treated.

121
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,970
Let's get up...

122
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,470
Ahjussi!

123
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,100
Gosh.

124
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,200
Excuse me!

125
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,990
Ahjussi!

126
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,100
My gosh.

127
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,490
Where did he go already?

128
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,100
Ahjussi!

129
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,100
My goodness.

130
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,770
Oh, my!

131
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,380
Ahjussi!

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Ahjussi!

133
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,700
Ahjussi!

134
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,050
Ahjussi!

135
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,300
Mr. James!

136
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,480
Aigoo.

137
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,860
Aigoo.

138
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,150
Ahjussi!

139
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,230
Ahjussi!

140
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,460
Mr. James!

141
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,480
Wait.

142
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,830
My gosh.

143
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,600
Aigoo...

144
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,750
Gosh, wait.

145
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,730
No one is chasing after you.

146
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,510
Walk slowly.

147
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,920
You're not even well.

148
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,800
Your number.

149
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,490
Please give me a phone number.

150
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,620
I'll call your family.

151
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,710
Well...

152
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,070
don't you remember the number?

153
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,830
Of course, everyone saves
 their contacts on their phone.

154
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,310
But still, think carefully.

155
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,420
You must remember 
your wife's number.

156
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,420
This won't work.

157
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,210
I'll call the police station.

158
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,030
No, you can't.

159
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,240
No.

160
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,120
They'll take me away.

161
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,960
They'll take me away.

162
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,700
 Is he on the run because of his debt? 

163
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,690
Are you hungry?

164
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,100
Gosh.

165
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,760
What should I do? Where is 
a restaurant around here?

166
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,110
Let me see.

167
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,320
Well...

168
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,860
the growling was coming from you.

169
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,610
No, it didn't.

170
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,570
My goodness.

171
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,500
I guess so.

172
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,200
These are the only shoes I can find.

173
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,500
Please wear these for now.

174
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,840
Thank you.

175
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,180
Thank you. Enjoy.

176
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,250
Take your time eating.

177
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,270
- Take your time.
- Thank you.

178
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,100
Thank you. I appreciate it.

179
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,980
 I guess he's all right, 
seeing how well he's eating. 

180
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,800
I knew someone who used to make
 delicious noodles a long time ago.

181
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,520
Your wife?

182
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,690
Excuse me?

183
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,300
Well...

184
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,130
you still don't remember...

185
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,550
your wife's phone number?

186
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,030
Yes.

187
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,270
 It's so weird. 

188
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,090
 Why is my head blank? 

189
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,550
 I can't remember anything at all. 

190
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,830
 He looks so much like him. 

191
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,900
So...

192
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,570
you said you're James, right?

193
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,750
Pardon?

194
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,650
Earlier, you said your name is...

195
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,010
James.

196
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,650
Yes.

197
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,820
 Did I say that? 

198
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,920
Are you from overseas?

199
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,390
No.

200
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,100
 Am I from overseas? 

201
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,810
Then what is your Korean name?

202
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,490
Oh, yes...

203
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,260
My Korean name...

204
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,290
 My Korean name... 

205
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,100
 I can't remember. 

206
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
By chance...

207
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,070
you're not Woo Jung Hoo...

208
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,370
are you?

209
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,690
Oh Jung Hoo?

210
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,900
You must not be.

211
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,320
Well...

212
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,020
Please eat.

213
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,530
Eat and...

214
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,230
let me know if you want more.

215
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,000
Please eat.

216
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,060
Yes.

217
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,820
Thank you for this food.

218
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,560
Well, what should I have for dessert?

219
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,770
Please give me some ice cream.

220
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,390
There is no more ice cream.

221
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,470
Eating again when we're full already?

222
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,990
I'll eat this.

223
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,760
I'm gonna eat it.

224
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,860
Aigoo.

225
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,240
Why are you acting so fragile?

226
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,110
I know you can crack it in half.

227
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,850
What does being fragile
 have to do with this?

228
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,190
Give it to me.

229
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,670
Gosh, so cool.

230
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,110
Na Ro oppa, you're so strong.

231
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,850
Hae Deun, doing this has nothing
 to do with one's strength.

232
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,230
You said it does.

233
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,590
What's with this...

234
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,310
This is all about the method.

235
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,330
Geez, I haven't washed my hands.

236
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,880
Do it.

237
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,310
Eat what he cut already. 
Why break more?

238
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,530
I'll eat them. Do it.

239
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,760
To do that,

240
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,210
you have to do this, like this.

241
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,690
Like this...

242
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,380
Geez.

243
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,680
Geez, you lack technique.

244
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,130
Do you have bear claws?

245
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,750
Whoa!

246
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,610
Oh, my!

247
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,350
Geez, man. Why are 
you cutting so many?

248
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,550
We'll all share them.

249
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,950
Wow, you split it so nicely.

250
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,640
Wow, the line is so crisp and perfect.

251
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,550
Na Ro, you're so delicate.

252
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,510
He's the best.

253
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,050
Let's compete in something else.

254
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,170
Whoa, challenging me?

255
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,920
May the best man win.

256
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,630
Now, now. Let's be fair and square.

257
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,980
You can't cheat. Are you ready?

258
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,160
Are you ready?

259
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,640
Then sit down.

260
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,860
All right.

261
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,250
Start!

262
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,560
Oh, you know this.

263
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,270
Let me see. Over here?

264
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,720
Over here. There.

265
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,360
Go, Na Ro oppa!

266
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,730
Go, Jae Hee hyung!

267
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,100
- Go, Na Ro oppa!
- Go, Jae Hee hyung!

268
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,350
- Na Ro oppa, go!
- Go, my hyung!

269
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,120
Go, my hyung!

270
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,630
- Don't do that.
- Hyung, hyung.

271
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,150
Turn and kick.

272
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,310
Okay!

273
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,480
What are you guys doing?

274
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,670
- Hyung!
- Wow, look at them!

275
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,110
- Playing a game?
- Go, Na Ro oppa!

276
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,660
Go, Na Ro oppa!

277
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,600
Turn him around right here.

278
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,550
- Turn, turn.
- Kick him.

279
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,170
Then push him on the back.

280
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,900
Wait, wait, wait!

281
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,480
Wait. You're not as strong as him.

282
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,980
Na Ro, let's make a winning move.

283
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,270
Your winning move.

284
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,800
Does that work?

285
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,240
I'm telling you it works.

286
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,040
I was a champion in this 
before. Listen to me. Do it.

287
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,340
Do it. Begin.

288
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,960
Ready, begin.

289
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,670
- Okay.
- How can you teach him?

290
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,660
Go, go!

291
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,930
Go, go!

292
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,560
Go, go!

293
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,080
All right!

294
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,400
I won!

295
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,790
Hyungnim, what's up with this? 
You said you were a champion!

296
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,360
- I was a champion.
- When?

297
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,890
Back in elementary school.

298
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,680
Come here.

299
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,550
Come here.

300
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,850
Let's do it.

301
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,210
I don't want to play you.

302
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,510
Do it with me.

303
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,480
- Let's play with me.
- That's even worse.

304
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,670
Forget it. Have fun!

305
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,220
Hwak Se, stop right there!

306
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,050
He ran away.

307
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,690
Young man, play me this time.

308
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,870
Play me this time.

309
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,040
Na Ro, play with me.

310
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,500
When did you do that?

311
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,900
Will you really be okay?

312
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,140
Yes, well...

313
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,170
A friend lives in this area.

314
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,700
I'll go to his house.

315
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,040
Please go.

316
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,490
Well...

317
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,630
this is all the cash I have.

318
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,190
You never know.

319
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,190
Gosh, no thank you.

320
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,570
I'm fine.

321
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,100
Please...

322
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,580
Then, take care.

323
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,690
Thank you.

324
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,450
 Who am I? 

325
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,780
 This face... 

326
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,060
 seems unfamiliar... 

327
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,030
 and familiar... 

328
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,540
 I'm handsome, though. 

329
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,950
 Wait. 

330
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,790
 My name is Jae... 

331
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,930
 Jae... 

332
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,290
 Oh, that ahjumma said it was James. 

333
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,750
 Am I really from overseas? 

334
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,290
 Gosh. 

335
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,770
 Why can't I remember anything? 

336
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,330
Mr. James.

337
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,690
Please be honest with me.

338
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,770
You're not feeling well, right?

339
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,760
No.

340
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,920
Please go.

341
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,750
Your bus will leave.

342
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,540
I can't leave you like this.

343
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,080
They say destiny can form
 from one encounter.

344
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,420
How can I leave you 
like this, James?

345
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,260
Even though I say I'll take you to 
the police station, you say no.

346
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,680
You seem to be on the run...

347
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,000

It's blank up here.

Pardon?

351
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,610
I can't...

352
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,200
remember anything.

353
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,600
What should I do?

354
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,950
Oh, my.

355
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,350
Yes, Noonim.

356
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,460
You're still working late? 
Should I pick you up?

357
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,310
What?

358
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,560
So...

359
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,580
I don't know what to do.

360
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,410
Noonim, still...

361
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,510
you don't know what kind of person 
he is. Why are you with him?

362
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,180
Hurry up and come home.

363
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,370
I don't think he's a bad man.

364
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,780
Then...

365
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,000
does a bad man put a sign that 
says, "I'm bad" on his forehead?

366
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,100
Well, the way I see it...

367
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,830
I think he's in dire straits.

368
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,950
Let's help him out, Hwak Se.

369
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,050
Let's think together what is 
the best thing to do.

370
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,860
Geez, Noonim. Seriously.

Oh, really?

I can't find him when I need him.

392

Did he take his car?

393
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,360
Probably so.

394
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,930
Geez, this is nuts.

00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,650
Seriously.

396
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,990
It's noisy. Why are you so chatty?

 Don't say anything to 
Man Jung or my kids.

Where are you going? To sing?

401
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,040
What's wrong with him?

402
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,470
Sing what? He got fired 
from all the bars.

403
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,500
Is he going on a date?

404
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,880
A date, my foot.

405
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,080

They're asking for it by 
tomorrow morning suddenly.

409
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,200
What can I do? Here.

410
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,860
So why don't you 
hire an engineer?

411
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,430
Do you think I'm not 
hiring one on purpose?

412
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,100
I just can't find a good person.

True.

Who'd want to work under
 a cheapskate boss?

What? A cheapskate?

What's with her?

448
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,730
Did your mother say 
she's doing all right?

449

Oh, yes.

450

Well...

451
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,200
She sounds good. She sounds energetic.

452
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,920
But why do you look so uneasy, Koala?

453
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,100
What?

454
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,000
Well, no. I'm fine.

455
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,430
If you feel uneasy, 
check on her tomorrow.

456
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,860
Geez, she'll get upset saying I don't 
trust her and went to see her.

457
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,010
Sons don't know

Yeah, right. What did 
you say earlier?

465

Cheap, cheap, cheapskate.

466

- Okay.

468

Look at this.

469

This...

470
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,870
seals the Headbutt.

471
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,100
What's this?

472
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,430
- What? Am I a zombie?
- A zombie...

473

Put this on, too.

481

That looks good.

482

 Wouldn't it be too noisy?

483
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,480
That's why I moved 
into the first floor.

484
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,120
The second-floor unit is empty.

Why?

508

What?

509
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,060
Shouldn't we take him
 to the police station?

510
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,530
Gosh.

511
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,240
I told you.

512
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,840
I think his creditors 
are chasing him.

513
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,160
Inadvertently, I've been 
through that myself.

514
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,190
You know that well.

515
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,630
Just until he regains his health,

516
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,320
let's help him out.

517
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,800
But what if he's not someone
 who is in dire straits,

518
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,650
but what if he's a weirdo?

519
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,680
What if he's into crime or...

520
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,840
there are people who are serial...

521
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,150
My gosh! Hwak Se!

522
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,100
I don't think he's like that.

523
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,520
Noonim, how would 
you know that?

524
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,540
I'm not sure.

525
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,990
I just...

526
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,390
feel that way.

527
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,190
Gosh, that feeling again.

528
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,070
I get so nervous whenever you 
move based on that feeling.

529
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,500
Come in. Watch your head.

530
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,890
Geez.

531
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,170
Be careful.

532
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,310
- Be careful.
- I'm sorry.

533
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,750
Be careful.

534
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,520
Gosh, I guess you 
can't see in the dark.

535
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,250
I'm sorry.

536
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,030
Gosh, no. It's okay.

537
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,250
Wait, wait a minute.

538
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,970
About me...

539
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,110
staying here...

540
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:18,220
I'd like to keep it
 a secret from others.

541
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,410
I'm so nervous.

542
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,370
Yes, that'd be nice, but...

543
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,980
our Samgwang Villa isn't 
set up to keep a secret.

544
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,450
Is that so?

545
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,590
Well, then...

546
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,050
I'll get going now.

547
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,560
- Oh, my.
- Goodbye.

548
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,340
- Yes, be careful going home.
- Gosh.

549
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,910
Mr. James.

550
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,670
Aigoo, you've come all this way.

551
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,910
Where do you think you're going?

552
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,440
I got it.

553
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,420
Don't worry.

554
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,630
We'll keep it a secret.

555
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,370
- Noonim...
- Hwak Se.

556
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,400
- Lead the way.
- Okay.

557
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,700
Let's go in.

558
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,100
Come in.

559
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,970
Be careful.

560
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,800
- I'm sorry.
- Please be careful.

561
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,130
I'll take him to my room, Noonim.

562
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,430
- Let's go.
- Thanks, Hwak Se.

563
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,650
Be careful going upstairs 
and get some rest.

564
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,970
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yes.

565
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,370
Yes.

566
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,690
Wow, so detailed 
about stuff like this.

567
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,930
Please go up and rest.

568
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,150
Thank you.

569
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,110
Aigoo, seriously.

570
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,930
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

571
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,600
Here are the stairs.

572
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,670
Be careful.

573
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,480
- Unni!
- Aigoo!

574
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,980
- Unni, come here.
- Man Jung.

575
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,530
You didn't sleep yet?

576
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,350
What happened, Unni?

577
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,880
Why didn't you answer your 
phone? I was worried.

578
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,190
Aigoo.

579
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,330
You didn't tell my kids, did you?

580
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,280
You told me not to.

581
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,790
Why did you go to 
brother-in-law's grave?

582
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,460
Just because.

583
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,800
Aigoo, I'm so tired.

584
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,630
Hey, let's talk tomorrow. Goodnight.

585
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,910
- Ahjumma!
- Mom!

586
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,920
You're back. Why so late?

587
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,100
Mom, did you just get home?

588
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,050
Why are you working so late?

589
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,540
Well, it just worked out that way.

590
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,250
Where did you two go?

591
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,820
Something urgent 
came up at my office.

592
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,690
I reviewed his floor plans.

593
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,170
I see.

594
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,300
Gosh, you worked so hard.

595
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,240
Did you help him with work or 
go on a date this evening?

596
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,610
 - Auntie! 
- Listen to you.

597
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,420
- Go to your rooms.
- Okay.

598
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,190
Go to sleep, too.

599
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,160
Unni, goodnight.

600
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,270
- Good job, Mom.
- Goodnight.

601
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,420
Sure.

602
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,560
- What's wrong with mom?
- Your mom?

603
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,770
I don't know what's up with her.

604
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,710
Your reactions are over the top.

605
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,180
Mr. Woo, pay Bit Chae Woon overtime.

606
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,580
Ah, yes, Auntie.

607
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,990
Don't you worry.

608
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,280
You two are the same
 at times like this.

609
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,560
Geez.

610
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,290
Goodnight.

611
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,570
Is he home?

612
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,520
Hey.

613
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,170
Are you home?

614
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,070
Hey!

615
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,020
I'm home.

616
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,690
Where did you go this late at night?

617
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,180
- None of your business.
- "None of your business."

618
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,320
You were going to say that, huh?

619
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,020
Where did you go?

620
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,880
Well...

621
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,720
I went to see someone.

622
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,240
Man Jung, goodnight.

623
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,560
So, who? Who did you see?

624
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,870
Did he really go on a date?

625
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,680
Who cares if he did? 
What do I care?

626
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,510
Geez, don't be like that. Just...

627
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,880
take the bed. You're injured.

628
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,910
No, how can I?

629
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,900
I'll just sleep on the floor.

630
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,020
Gosh, James. I'd be uncomfortable.

631
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,350
Please sleep on the bed.

632
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,880
- No thanks.
 - Hyungnim! 

633
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,140
Geez, what's with today?

634
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,070
 Yeah, what? I'm changing. 

635
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,670
I missed several of 
your calls earlier.

636
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,686
Was something the matter?

637
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:24,446
 Oh, that? Everything is fine. 

638
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:25,826
 Go to sleep. 

639
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:27,516
Yes, Hyungnim. Goodnight.

640
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:32,296
What's this?

641
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:35,906
Geez, where did he go?

642
00:34:36,696 --> 00:34:38,456
Look at this dirt.

643
00:34:51,396 --> 00:34:53,596
Mr. Woo, seriously...

644
00:34:53,606 --> 00:34:55,136
You disappear when I need you,

645
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:57,136
and I'm the one who is suffering.

646
00:35:00,356 --> 00:35:02,156
James.

647
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:03,936
It's okay now.

648
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,656
It's the young man next door.

649
00:35:05,656 --> 00:35:08,166
He's not a bad guy. 
He has a legit job, too.

650
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:09,576
James.

651
00:35:10,596 --> 00:35:13,556
Geez, what a scaredy-cat.

652
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:14,876
Excuse me...

653
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:19,086
Look at this ahjussi.

654
00:35:21,056 --> 00:35:26,126
He seems to be in quite a bind...

655
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:30,286
yet he seems so innocent.

656
00:35:30,286 --> 00:35:32,456
So innocent.

657
00:35:32,456 --> 00:35:34,856
Geez, this is nuts.

658
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:42,696
♫  On the day, even the
 hope gets shaken  ♫

659
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:46,996
♫  Like the star that's shining
 like a jewel in the night sky  ♫

660
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:48,626
 I've been busy all day. 

661
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:50,406
 I was all over the place. 

662
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:57,496
♫  The shining day will come  ♫

663
00:35:58,196 --> 00:36:00,996
Aigoo, Mommy...

664
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:05,796
♫  I'm comforting myself  ♫

665
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:11,626
♫  This tearfully lonely night  ♫

666
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:15,406
♫  Love is so difficult  ♫

667
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:19,716
♫  Life is so hard  ♫

668
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:22,446
Gosh...

669
00:36:23,276 --> 00:36:25,346
I have enough on my plate.

670
00:36:26,576 --> 00:36:28,516
And now that ahjussi, too.

671
00:36:28,516 --> 00:36:34,366
♫  Well, just living with 
that in my heart  ♫

672
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:35,746
Mom?

673
00:36:35,746 --> 00:36:37,726
Oh, hi.

674
00:36:38,736 --> 00:36:40,336
Gosh.

675
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:43,246
Mom, why do you get 
startled so easily lately?

676
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:46,456
Should you go for a physical?

677
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:48,346
Gosh, no.

678
00:36:48,346 --> 00:36:50,796
It's okay. I did it in the spring.

679
00:36:50,796 --> 00:36:51,996
Why?

680
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:56,336
When I talked to you 
this afternoon,

681
00:36:56,336 --> 00:36:59,526
I remembered you started to say 
something about my work and stopped.

682
00:36:59,526 --> 00:37:00,756
What is it?

683
00:37:05,546 --> 00:37:07,166
It's nothing.

684
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:10,036
What is it?

685
00:37:14,936 --> 00:37:16,576
I was wondering...

686
00:37:18,096 --> 00:37:21,396
if it would be okay...

687
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:25,096
if you quit your current job.

688
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:26,496
Huh?

689
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:29,346
Why?

690
00:37:30,506 --> 00:37:32,446
Before you get much older,

691
00:37:32,446 --> 00:37:35,906
I thought it'd be good for 
you to study abroad.

692
00:37:35,906 --> 00:37:39,226
I have some savings.

693
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:40,966
With that...

694
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:43,736
If I do a good job at the company,

695
00:37:43,736 --> 00:37:45,616
I can go to the US to study.

696
00:37:46,676 --> 00:37:49,566
What if you don't get it?

697
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:52,586
If I don't get it by any chance,

698
00:37:52,586 --> 00:37:54,676
I'll just keep working here.

699
00:37:54,676 --> 00:37:56,986
They said I could stay 
as a contractor.

700
00:37:56,986 --> 00:38:00,126
I really like my company.

701
00:38:03,056 --> 00:38:04,436
You like it?

702
00:38:04,436 --> 00:38:05,736
Yeah.

703
00:38:05,736 --> 00:38:08,566
I think I'll get along 
with Jang Seo Ah,

704
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:12,846
and the CEO completely
 fell for my charm.

705
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:18,826
Gosh, I'm joking.

706
00:38:18,826 --> 00:38:22,566
Anyway, I'll work really hard here,

707
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,076
and I'll go to the US to study.

708
00:38:24,076 --> 00:38:26,106
I'll get the full-time 
position for sure.

709
00:38:26,106 --> 00:38:29,766
So, don't worry, Mom. Okay?

710
00:38:32,096 --> 00:38:33,296
All right.

711
00:38:56,196 --> 00:38:58,096
This is different.

712
00:38:58,096 --> 00:38:59,326
Whoa, this is nuts.

713
00:39:14,066 --> 00:39:17,716
This is somewhat of 
a familiar sound.

714
00:39:18,896 --> 00:39:20,126
Geez.

715
00:39:20,796 --> 00:39:25,396
Wow, I must be getting
 used to Auntie's snoring.

716
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:28,706
Human beings sure have
 a remarkable ability to adapt.

717
00:39:28,706 --> 00:39:30,036
Aigoo.

718
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:32,896
My goodness...

719
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,086
I couldn't sleep last night, either.

720
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,916
Gosh, how nice is this, though.

721
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:52,986
I get to stay in bed at this hour.

722
00:39:52,986 --> 00:39:55,406
Gosh, I'm so happy.

723
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:07,466
 
 Friend, did you sleep well? 

724
00:40:07,466 --> 00:40:10,266
 I said, I'd clean up 
with you before I left. 

725
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:12,456
 You kept pushing me to leave. 

726
00:40:12,456 --> 00:40:13,876
 Sorry. 

727
00:40:13,876 --> 00:40:15,996
 How do you feel? 

728
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,846
 I cleaned up the house 
already and am exercising. 

729
00:40:24,846 --> 00:40:26,566
 I'm feeling very good. 

730
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:28,296
 Thanks, my friend. 

731
00:40:40,726 --> 00:40:42,966
 

732
00:40:45,596 --> 00:40:48,496
I don't think she's feeling "very good."

733
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:15,496
♫  Even if I'm reborn 
a thousand more times   ♫

734
00:41:15,496 --> 00:41:21,946
♫  There will not be
 another person like you  ♫

735
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:29,726
♫  The person who warmed
 up my sad life  ♫

736
00:41:29,726 --> 00:41:36,196
♫  I'm grateful for that person  ♫

737
00:41:36,196 --> 00:41:39,916
♫  For that person  ♫

738
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,596
Is it leaking?

739
00:41:43,986 --> 00:41:49,856
♫   My heart could hurt indefinitely  ♫

740
00:41:49,856 --> 00:41:56,266
♫   Even if I cannot tell 
you that I love you  ♫

741
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:00,556
I bought some macarons for you.

742
00:42:00,556 --> 00:42:01,996
Why did you come again?

743
00:42:01,996 --> 00:42:04,346
I was at a construction site nearby.

744
00:42:06,446 --> 00:42:08,236
Mom, did you cry?

745
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:10,376
No, I didn't.

746
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:12,236
I slept all this time and yawned.

747
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:14,536
Gosh, what do I do? It's a mess.

748
00:42:14,536 --> 00:42:16,466
Wait. Mom.

749
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:20,696
Mom...

750
00:42:22,096 --> 00:42:23,836
It's nothing serious.

751
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:27,316
I'm just a bit depressed.

752
00:42:27,316 --> 00:42:29,196
Did you go to a hospital?

753
00:42:29,196 --> 00:42:32,266
Of course. I'm free at last.

754
00:42:32,266 --> 00:42:36,546
I'll take care of my body and
 my heart. I'll live boldly.

755
00:42:37,796 --> 00:42:40,856
Geez, why are you sick? Come on.

756
00:42:42,616 --> 00:42:45,386
I wrapped up half a century 
of personal history.

757
00:42:45,386 --> 00:42:48,026
It won't be too easy.

758
00:42:49,326 --> 00:42:51,886
But I'll become strong. Okay?

759
00:42:51,886 --> 00:42:54,456
Be sure you work with me, okay?

760
00:42:55,216 --> 00:42:56,466
Of course.

761
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,796
It's your uncle. 
We're supposed to meet.

762
00:43:03,806 --> 00:43:05,266
Uncle? Why?

763
00:43:05,266 --> 00:43:06,576
For business.

764
00:43:06,576 --> 00:43:08,246
I'll live diligently.

765
00:43:08,246 --> 00:43:09,946
Hi, Min Suk.

766
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:19,296
I took lunch over to 
James hyungnim.

767
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,696
- You did?
- Yes.

768
00:43:20,696 --> 00:43:21,986
Good job.

769
00:43:21,986 --> 00:43:23,386
- But...
- Yes?

770
00:43:23,386 --> 00:43:25,446
does he seem like 
he's hurting anywhere?

771
00:43:25,446 --> 00:43:27,206
I think he's fine.

772
00:43:27,206 --> 00:43:32,336
Noonim, I've been looking through
 the police station missing person's site.

773
00:43:32,336 --> 00:43:36,466
But I don't see anything reported 
about James hyungnim.

774
00:43:36,466 --> 00:43:38,746
- Really?
- Yes.

775
00:43:38,746 --> 00:43:40,986
In my opinion,

776
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:43,036
either he has no family,

777
00:43:43,036 --> 00:43:45,996
or his family has turned
 their backs on him.

778
00:43:45,996 --> 00:43:48,326
Gosh, no way.

779
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:52,266
Noonim, how long are you
 thinking of having Eems hyung?

780
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:53,846
What do you mean, how long?

781
00:43:53,846 --> 00:43:54,936
Gosh.

782
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:58,066
Hey, you didn't go to work yet?

783
00:43:58,066 --> 00:43:59,996
I'm working afternoon today.

784
00:44:07,696 --> 00:44:08,996
What the heck?

785
00:44:09,056 --> 00:44:11,176
You two are acting very 
strange right now.

786
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:14,786
Look at you. What do 
you mean strange?

787
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:16,106
Gosh. Seriously.

788
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:18,796
You're acting strange. 
Very strange.

789
00:44:18,796 --> 00:44:20,796
Is something there?

790
00:44:25,756 --> 00:44:28,286
Who am I?

791
00:44:33,756 --> 00:44:36,586
Why can't I remember anything?

792
00:44:37,696 --> 00:44:38,896
Why...

793
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:47,076
You haven't eaten yet.

794
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:51,116
I have no appetite.

795
00:44:51,116 --> 00:44:53,786
I see. Then...

796
00:44:53,786 --> 00:44:56,166
try this.

797
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:58,116
You'll get your appetite 
back right away.

798
00:44:58,116 --> 00:45:00,266
I don't feel like...

799
00:45:06,096 --> 00:45:07,296
It's good, huh?

800
00:45:07,316 --> 00:45:09,656
I knew it.

801
00:45:09,696 --> 00:45:12,796
Okay, eat a lot with this.

802
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,236
So that you'll become healthy,

803
00:45:14,236 --> 00:45:16,726
and you'll get your memory
 back when you get healthy.

804
00:45:16,726 --> 00:45:18,056
Whoa...

805
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,906
This is very good.

806
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:31,306
I feel like I've tasted this before.

807
00:45:31,306 --> 00:45:32,806
Really?

808
00:45:32,806 --> 00:45:37,346
Maybe your wife makes good 
geotjori, too, Eems hyungnim.

809
00:45:43,496 --> 00:45:46,096
Hyungnim, eat more. Here, eat.

810
00:45:57,896 --> 00:45:59,596
As for this launch showcase,

811
00:45:59,596 --> 00:46:03,896
I'd like to have Kim Dae Won and 
Bit Chae Woon to be in charge.

812
00:46:03,926 --> 00:46:06,816
It will be part of your evaluation 
for the full-time position.

813
00:46:06,816 --> 00:46:08,466
So, please work hard.

814
00:46:10,086 --> 00:46:11,606
Bit Chae Woon...

815
00:46:12,346 --> 00:46:13,866
Are you confident?

816
00:46:13,866 --> 00:46:16,626
Yes. I'll work hard.

817
00:46:18,716 --> 00:46:20,896
Where is Hwang Na Ro?

818
00:46:20,896 --> 00:46:23,536
He was in the reference room.

819
00:46:28,056 --> 00:46:30,596
 It might not be the same person, 

820
00:46:30,596 --> 00:46:32,886
 but the shoes are the same. 

821
00:46:39,706 --> 00:46:41,336
 
Portugal?

822
00:46:43,596 --> 00:46:45,296
How unique.

823
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:59,816
- I'm sorry. Are you all right?
- Yes.

824
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:02,176
- I'm sorry.
- I'll do it.

825
00:47:03,406 --> 00:47:04,956
Ms. Goo.

826
00:47:06,606 --> 00:47:09,396
Did the design team 
start the meeting?

827
00:47:09,396 --> 00:47:10,776
Yes, CEO.

828
00:47:11,956 --> 00:47:13,376
Hello.

829
00:47:13,376 --> 00:47:15,816
I'm Hwang Na Ro, a contractor
 for the design team.

830
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:17,896
He's working on the Spain project.

831
00:47:17,896 --> 00:47:19,296
Oh, really?

832
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:21,296
Thank you in advance.

833
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,506
Sure.

834
00:47:23,896 --> 00:47:26,196
- Here's another one.
- Yes.

835
00:47:27,076 --> 00:47:28,556
- Let's go.
- Okay.

836
00:47:38,776 --> 00:47:40,856
Those are cute sneakers.

837
00:47:40,856 --> 00:47:42,716
What brand is it?

838
00:47:42,716 --> 00:47:44,846
These?

839
00:47:44,846 --> 00:47:46,926
I'm not sure. What were they?

840
00:47:46,926 --> 00:47:48,806
No, it's okay.

841
00:47:48,806 --> 00:47:50,686
I thought I saw them somewhere.

842
00:47:50,686 --> 00:47:52,026
Carry on.

843
00:47:52,026 --> 00:47:53,646
Thank you!

844
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:01,466
Where would you see them?

845
00:48:02,656 --> 00:48:04,556
They don't sell them here.

846
00:48:04,556 --> 00:48:06,366
Five, six, seven, eight.

847
00:48:06,366 --> 00:48:08,296
 One, two, three, four. 

848
00:48:08,296 --> 00:48:10,196
 Five, six, seven, eight. 

849
00:48:10,196 --> 00:48:12,066
 One, two, three, four. 

850
00:48:12,066 --> 00:48:13,996
 Five, six, seven, eight. 

851
00:48:13,996 --> 00:48:15,806
 One, two, three, four. 

852
00:48:15,806 --> 00:48:17,596
 - Five, six, seven, eight. 
- Do it strong!

853
00:48:17,596 --> 00:48:19,346
 One, two, three, four. 

854
00:48:19,346 --> 00:48:21,416
 Five, six, seven, eight. 

855
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:23,256
 - One, two, three, four. 
- Do it again!

856
00:48:23,256 --> 00:48:25,116
Is this a school play or something?

857
00:48:25,116 --> 00:48:26,976
Five, six, seven, eight.

858
00:48:26,976 --> 00:48:28,826
 One, two, three, four. 

859
00:48:28,826 --> 00:48:30,346
 Five, six, seven, eight. 

860
00:48:30,346 --> 00:48:32,506
- Gosh, you can't do it like that.
 - One, two, three, four. 

861
00:48:32,506 --> 00:48:34,616
One, two, three, four.

862
00:48:34,616 --> 00:48:36,406
Five, six, seven, eight.

863
00:48:36,406 --> 00:48:38,076
 Five, six, seven, eight. 

864
00:48:38,076 --> 00:48:39,906
 One, two, three, four. 

865
00:48:39,906 --> 00:48:41,776
 Five, six, seven, eight. 

866
00:48:41,776 --> 00:48:44,116
Five, six, seven, eight.

867
00:48:44,116 --> 00:48:46,036
 One, two, three, four. 

868
00:48:46,036 --> 00:48:48,056
 Five, six, seven, eight. 

869
00:48:48,056 --> 00:48:49,956
 - One, two, three, four. 
- Yes?

870
00:48:49,956 --> 00:48:51,856
 - Five, six, seven, eight. 
 - Ms. Lee Hae Deun? 

871
00:48:51,856 --> 00:48:53,266
Is this spam?

872
00:48:53,266 --> 00:48:54,926
- I'm not buying.
 - Hello. 

873
00:48:54,926 --> 00:48:57,806
 I'm Manager Joo Man Dae 
from Production Million Big. 

874
00:48:57,806 --> 00:48:59,016
Excuse me?

875
00:48:59,016 --> 00:49:01,756
 One, two, three, four. 

876
00:49:01,756 --> 00:49:03,656
 Five, six, seven, eight. 

877
00:49:03,656 --> 00:49:05,676
 

878
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:07,826
 Five, six, seven, eight. 

879
00:49:07,826 --> 00:49:09,756
 - One, two, three, four. 
 - Hello? 

880
00:49:09,756 --> 00:49:11,916
 - Five, six, seven, eight. 
- Yes!

881
00:49:31,356 --> 00:49:32,636
Hi...

882
00:49:34,016 --> 00:49:37,966
♫  The yellow cafe I see over there  ♫

883
00:49:37,966 --> 00:49:41,986
♫  I'm meeting her for
 the third time today  ♫

884
00:49:41,986 --> 00:49:46,826
♫  I'm running toward that place  ♫

885
00:49:46,826 --> 00:49:48,206
Why do I keep...

886
00:49:48,206 --> 00:49:50,786
♫  500 meters before I see you  ♫

887
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:52,706
 Don't disappear from my sight. 

888
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:54,036
 Because I like you. 

889
00:49:55,096 --> 00:49:58,626
♫  How should I say it?  ♫

890
00:49:58,626 --> 00:50:00,686
 

891
00:50:02,896 --> 00:50:04,526
What am I doing? What?

892
00:50:04,526 --> 00:50:06,636
What are you doing, Lee Ra Hoon?

893
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,036
I've done all kinds of stupid things.

894
00:50:09,036 --> 00:50:11,336
♫  Is the cloud in the 
sky cotton candy?  ♫

895
00:50:11,396 --> 00:50:12,596
Geez.

896
00:50:13,396 --> 00:50:17,236
♫  Should I try jumping into it?  ♫

897
00:50:17,296 --> 00:50:19,596
- It's this house.
- I see.

898
00:50:20,686 --> 00:50:22,556
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

899
00:50:22,596 --> 00:50:26,526
♫  I'll be bold  ♫

900
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:28,496
- Hello.
- Yes, hello...

901
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:30,536
Who are you...

902
00:50:32,766 --> 00:50:34,536
Ahjussi.

903
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:37,626
Geez, I said there is 
no room available.

904
00:50:37,626 --> 00:50:40,916
I beg you. I want to
 eat delicious food.

905
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:45,886
No, it won't work.

906
00:50:45,886 --> 00:50:47,126
Sorry.

907
00:50:47,126 --> 00:50:48,926
I can share a room.

908
00:50:48,926 --> 00:50:50,506
Please look into it for me, please?

909
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:53,066
- Please.
- Geez, I told you.

910
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:55,416
There is no room.

911
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:56,936
- Ahjussi. 
- Hurry up and leave.

912
00:50:56,936 --> 00:50:58,346
Sorry, sorry.

913
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,976
- Please.
- Leave now.

914
00:51:09,056 --> 00:51:12,376
Noona, will you be okay?

915
00:51:12,376 --> 00:51:14,696
If you run our company 
store branch,

916
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:17,016
you can bump into Jung Hoo.

917
00:51:17,016 --> 00:51:19,616
It's okay. It's not like
 we're enemies.

918
00:51:19,616 --> 00:51:21,646
I want to do this line of work.

919
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:23,746
I prepared for a long time.

920
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,676
Is Woo Jung Hoo doing well?

921
00:51:26,676 --> 00:51:27,726
Huh?

922
00:51:27,726 --> 00:51:29,856
Yeah, of course.

923
00:51:29,856 --> 00:51:31,936
What a relief. Let's go in.

924
00:51:34,296 --> 00:51:37,866
 

925
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,476
This bed is a popular item.

926
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:42,396
I see.

927
00:51:42,426 --> 00:51:44,296
I'll show you other products.

928
00:51:45,826 --> 00:51:48,226
- As you can see, do this...
- Oh, my.

929
00:51:49,046 --> 00:51:50,966
and put it around your waist.

930
00:51:50,966 --> 00:51:53,986
There are various products.

931
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,646
You can't reach Jung Hoo yet?

932
00:51:57,836 --> 00:51:59,416
Yes.

933
00:52:00,796 --> 00:52:04,596
President told me not to contact 
him while he's on vacation.

934
00:52:04,656 --> 00:52:06,606
I'll wait and see.

935
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:08,616
Yes.

936
00:52:13,626 --> 00:52:16,026
 
This is weird.

937
00:52:25,746 --> 00:52:28,146
- James.
- Yes.

938
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:31,556
Do you feel better with
 some fresh air?

939
00:52:31,556 --> 00:52:33,606
Yes. It's nice.

940
00:52:34,466 --> 00:52:36,376
Drink this.

941
00:52:36,376 --> 00:52:39,856
I ground some nuts in milk.

942
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:42,596
Thank you.

943
00:52:48,196 --> 00:52:50,296
It tastes wonderful.

944
00:52:50,296 --> 00:52:52,376
Do you like it?

945
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,206
James.

946
00:53:01,206 --> 00:53:06,776
Do you still not remember
 anything at all?

947
00:53:08,266 --> 00:53:09,636
Yes.

948
00:53:10,846 --> 00:53:15,206
Except for being 
chased by creditors.

949
00:53:15,206 --> 00:53:16,996
My apologies.

950
00:53:16,996 --> 00:53:19,446
No need to apologize.

951
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:23,246
It's not like you don't 
remember on purpose.

952
00:53:23,246 --> 00:53:27,426
Just relax.

953
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,696
Thank you.

954
00:53:31,026 --> 00:53:34,636
You've done a great
 job with flowers.

955
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:38,496
I really love the flowers.

956
00:53:38,556 --> 00:53:40,006
I see.

957
00:53:40,006 --> 00:53:42,846
- Then stay and enjoy.
- Okay.

958
00:53:42,846 --> 00:53:44,366
Thank you.

959
00:53:45,876 --> 00:53:48,686
Aigoo, too bad.

960
00:54:21,696 --> 00:54:24,196
Wait...

961
00:54:27,496 --> 00:54:30,496
Do you have something to say?

962
00:54:31,526 --> 00:54:33,336
Well...

963
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:36,066
No matter how much
 I think about it,

964
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:40,786
you're so similar to him.

965
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:47,426
- Are you sure...
 - Geez, I'm sure it won't work. 

966
00:54:47,426 --> 00:54:49,256
Please be careful!

967
00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:51,186
Are you okay?

968
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:53,806
Aigoo, Noonim.

969
00:54:53,806 --> 00:54:55,576
I'm glad you're home.

970
00:54:55,576 --> 00:54:57,466
Who is this...

971
00:54:57,466 --> 00:54:58,976
I mean...

972
00:54:58,976 --> 00:55:02,056
this student really wants to 
move into our Samgwang Villa.

973
00:55:02,056 --> 00:55:04,046
He says he's willing to share a room.

974
00:55:04,046 --> 00:55:06,516
Hello. I'm Kim Joon Woo.

975
00:55:06,516 --> 00:55:07,956
Yes, hello.

976
00:55:07,956 --> 00:55:10,186
But what can I do...

977
00:55:10,196 --> 00:55:11,596
No room.

978
00:55:11,606 --> 00:55:13,966
See? No room.

979
00:55:14,796 --> 00:55:15,896
No room.

980
00:55:22,806 --> 00:55:24,956
It's not a creditor.

981
00:55:43,576 --> 00:55:45,586
Where was the room?

982
00:55:52,696 --> 00:55:54,676
This isn't it.

983
00:56:11,876 --> 00:56:14,316
Is it this room's tenant?

984
00:56:16,686 --> 00:56:18,836
He's handsome.

985
00:56:22,566 --> 00:56:24,176
Hello.

986
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:26,076
I got a call from Jung Min Jae.

987
00:56:26,076 --> 00:56:27,606
She said her son 
would pay me a visit.

988
00:56:27,606 --> 00:56:29,316
I see.

989
00:56:29,316 --> 00:56:33,416
How is my mom's condition?

990
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:35,636
It's not that serious.

991
00:56:35,636 --> 00:56:37,726
Don't worry too much.

992
00:56:48,736 --> 00:56:52,036
 What Jung Min Jae needs 
the most right now 

993
00:56:52,036 --> 00:56:55,246
 is the family's constant
 attention and love. 

994
00:56:57,776 --> 00:56:59,306
The family...

995
00:57:05,996 --> 00:57:12,746
 

996
00:57:23,426 --> 00:57:25,206
 
Whoa...

997
00:57:25,206 --> 00:57:27,386
Is this your first time
 at our agency?

998
00:57:27,386 --> 00:57:29,936
Yes. I did see your 
company website.

999
00:57:29,936 --> 00:57:31,436
It's so nice here.

1000
00:57:31,436 --> 00:57:32,916
I have to go up soon,

1001
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:35,686
so I'll get to the point.

1002
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:37,226
I'd like to scout you

1003
00:57:37,226 --> 00:57:40,986
for a girl group that we're 
producing, Hae Deun.

1004
00:57:40,986 --> 00:57:42,226
What do you think?

1005
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:43,156
Excuse me?

1006
00:57:43,156 --> 00:57:44,996
There are lots of frauds
 in this industry.

1007
00:57:44,996 --> 00:57:46,916
So just in case you're suspicious,

1008
00:57:46,916 --> 00:57:49,756
I called you over to our agency.

1009
00:57:52,196 --> 00:57:53,846
Over here.

1010
00:57:55,046 --> 00:57:56,436
Aren't you going to say hi?

1011
00:57:56,436 --> 00:57:58,666
 Hello. 

1012
00:57:59,966 --> 00:58:03,296
I told them so many times,
 yet they're not courteous.

1013
00:58:03,296 --> 00:58:05,636
Oh, it's them.

1014
00:58:05,636 --> 00:58:08,316
Once you approve, you'll 
get to work with them.

1015
00:58:08,316 --> 00:58:10,706
Without an audition?

1016
00:58:10,706 --> 00:58:13,796
We'd be so grateful if 
a gem like you would join us.

1017
00:58:13,796 --> 00:58:15,636
What audition?

1018
00:58:15,636 --> 00:58:18,026
They work very hard, but...

1019
00:58:18,026 --> 00:58:21,536
we don't have a center who's 
got the moves and looks.

1020
00:58:21,536 --> 00:58:24,266
It'd be perfect 
if you'd be the center.

1021
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:25,406
Me?

1022
00:58:26,556 --> 00:58:27,796
Center?

1023
00:58:31,746 --> 00:58:33,406
Room share?

1024
00:58:33,406 --> 00:58:35,326
Share my room?

1025
00:58:35,326 --> 00:58:38,836
Geez, that student was
 totally begging me.

1026
00:58:38,836 --> 00:58:41,406
I asked Na Ro and Mr. Woo,

1027
00:58:41,406 --> 00:58:42,976
but they both said no.

1028
00:58:42,976 --> 00:58:45,656
- Even if I want to do it, I just...
- Wait...

1029
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:47,976
Not Ra Hoon, Hwak Se.

1030
00:58:47,976 --> 00:58:51,646
He's splitting upstairs and
 downstairs with Hae Deun.

1031
00:58:51,646 --> 00:58:54,646
How can we put a 
young man up in the attic?

1032
00:58:56,286 --> 00:58:59,196
If we assign new rooms...

1033
00:58:59,196 --> 00:59:00,846
Aigoo, no way.

1034
00:59:00,846 --> 00:59:02,716
He needs to focus on his studies.

1035
00:59:02,716 --> 00:59:04,066
Gosh.

1036
00:59:04,066 --> 00:59:06,246
Gosh, what's this?

1037
00:59:06,246 --> 00:59:08,356
Gosh, your feet stink.

1038
00:59:08,356 --> 00:59:11,766
- Go and wash your feet.
- My feet...

1039
00:59:11,766 --> 00:59:13,566
- Okay. 
- Geez.

1040
00:59:13,566 --> 00:59:15,856
- My gosh!
- They stink.

1041
00:59:19,446 --> 00:59:20,836
 I'd like to scout you 

1042
00:59:20,836 --> 00:59:24,546
 for a girl group that 
we're producing, Hae Deun. 

1043
00:59:24,546 --> 00:59:25,696
 What do you think? 

1044
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:27,266
Of course.

1045
00:59:27,266 --> 00:59:29,496
They say every cloud 
has a silver line.

1046
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:35,556
Not "line." It's "lining."

1047
00:59:35,556 --> 00:59:37,946
There's a light at 
the end of the tunnel.

1048
00:59:37,946 --> 00:59:40,106
Geez, so ignorant.

1049
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:44,096
Hey, you're home early.

1050
00:59:44,096 --> 00:59:45,576
Aren't you seeing
 Cha Ba Reun today?

1051
00:59:45,576 --> 00:59:46,836
I'm not.

1052
00:59:46,836 --> 00:59:48,326
Hey, wait.

1053
00:59:48,326 --> 00:59:49,996
A daebak incident.

1054
00:59:51,096 --> 00:59:52,396
Really?

1055
00:59:52,486 --> 00:59:53,886
Really.

1056
00:59:53,886 --> 00:59:55,096
It's not a scam?

1057
00:59:55,096 --> 00:59:56,466
My gosh.

1058
00:59:56,466 --> 00:59:59,836
 
Look. Production Million Big. 
Manager Joo Man Dae.

1059
00:59:59,836 --> 01:00:02,466
I asked around through my 
friends. He's a manager there.

1060
01:00:02,466 --> 01:00:05,056
I even went to the agency earlier.

1061
01:00:05,056 --> 01:00:05,976
Really?

1062
01:00:05,976 --> 01:00:08,236
- Daebak. Wait.
- Hey!

1063
01:00:08,236 --> 01:00:11,606
I still haven't told them I didn't 
make the Trot Girls audition.

1064
01:00:11,606 --> 01:00:14,916
I'll reveal it after I sign the contract.

1065
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:16,366
You zip it until then.

1066
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:21,646
Hey, Lee Hae Deun. 
I'm so happy for you.

1067
01:00:21,646 --> 01:00:23,996
When I heard that you 
didn't pass the audition,

1068
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:26,976
I was so sad...

1069
01:00:26,996 --> 01:00:29,896
Hey. Are you crying?

1070
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:31,396
Hey.

1071
01:00:32,206 --> 01:00:33,386
It's a lie.

1072
01:00:35,916 --> 01:00:37,986
A lie, lie, lie.

1073
01:00:41,746 --> 01:00:43,786
I'm starving.

1074
01:00:43,786 --> 01:00:47,206
I ate dinner earlier.
 Why am I hungry again?

1075
01:00:47,206 --> 01:00:48,706
Right?

1076
01:00:50,796 --> 01:00:52,696
Since we're hungry,

1077
01:00:52,746 --> 01:00:55,296
- let's have snack time.
- Sounds great!

1078
01:00:55,296 --> 01:00:56,936
Let's play a game for the snacks.

1079
01:00:56,936 --> 01:00:58,196
How about Snakes and Ladders?

1080
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,666
Great. Draw lots?

1081
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:01,746
Draw lots? Let's do it.

1082
01:01:01,746 --> 01:01:03,686
Then I'll write it out.

1083
01:01:03,686 --> 01:01:05,856
Is it kimchi dumplings?

1084
01:01:06,516 --> 01:01:09,436
- Write out the names and...
- Then I'll fold the papers...

1085
01:01:09,436 --> 01:01:12,286
All right, thank you
 for working late.

1086
01:01:12,286 --> 01:01:13,516
Work after eating some snacks.

1087
01:01:13,516 --> 01:01:15,516
- Whoa, thank you!
 - Thank you! 

1088
01:01:15,516 --> 01:01:17,236
 So great. 

1089
01:01:17,236 --> 01:01:19,986
How should we 
arrange the VIP seats?

1090
01:01:19,986 --> 01:01:24,056
For now, place Mr. Joo 
and Ms. Park to the back.

1091
01:01:25,646 --> 01:01:27,526
 It's delicious! 

1092
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,066
 - So good!
- I was craving this. 

1093
01:01:32,066 --> 01:01:33,696
CEO, do you like this 
type of food?

1094
01:01:33,696 --> 01:01:34,826
Of course.

1095
01:01:34,826 --> 01:01:37,436
I love tteokboki and dumplings.

1096
01:01:38,386 --> 01:01:39,816
I didn't think you'd like that.

1097
01:01:39,816 --> 01:01:41,586
You seem like you'd 
only like steaks.

1098
01:01:43,096 --> 01:01:44,876
It's so tasty.

1099
01:01:44,876 --> 01:01:47,136
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

1100
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,686
Geez, that's no fun.

1101
01:01:49,686 --> 01:01:52,216
Should we do rock-paper-scissors?

1102
01:01:52,216 --> 01:01:54,576
- Oh, then...
- Sounds like fun.

1103
01:01:54,576 --> 01:01:56,516
- Right?
- Whoever wins three rounds.

1104
01:01:56,516 --> 01:01:58,216
- Okay.
- Good? All right.

1105
01:01:58,216 --> 01:01:59,896
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

1106
01:01:59,896 --> 01:02:01,336
Rock-paper-scissors!

1107
01:02:03,716 --> 01:02:06,396
Rock-paper-scissors!

1108
01:02:06,396 --> 01:02:08,066
 Oh, my gosh! 

1109
01:02:08,066 --> 01:02:09,746
Rock-paper-scissors!

1110
01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:14,486
One win.

1111
01:02:14,486 --> 01:02:15,676
CEO, you're the best.

1112
01:02:15,676 --> 01:02:16,976
Don't let your guard down.

1113
01:02:16,976 --> 01:02:18,306
I'll go.

1114
01:02:18,306 --> 01:02:20,726
Rock-paper-scissors!

1115
01:02:21,896 --> 01:02:23,756
 It's a practice. 

1116
01:02:23,756 --> 01:02:25,406
Rock-paper-scissors!

1117
01:02:27,606 --> 01:02:30,366
Rock-paper-scissors!

1118
01:02:31,596 --> 01:02:33,406
No, no, wait.

1119
01:02:33,406 --> 01:02:35,756
Rock-paper-scissors!

1120
01:02:40,146 --> 01:02:41,696
Okay, then.

1121
01:02:41,696 --> 01:02:43,256
I have to win one more round.

1122
01:02:43,256 --> 01:02:44,616
- Last chance.
- Yes.

1123
01:02:44,616 --> 01:02:46,776
- I'll go. Rock-paper...
- Wait a minute!

1124
01:02:46,776 --> 01:02:48,526
Wait. Wait a minute.

1125
01:02:54,516 --> 01:02:55,946
Then, I'll do it, too.

1126
01:02:58,226 --> 01:03:00,436
- Geez.
- No way.

1127
01:03:00,436 --> 01:03:01,636
Okay, okay.

1128
01:03:01,636 --> 01:03:03,056
I see it.

1129
01:03:03,896 --> 01:03:05,696
Rock-paper-scissors!

1130
01:03:10,196 --> 01:03:11,716
This is mine.

1131
01:03:11,716 --> 01:03:13,256
Okay.

1132
01:03:16,466 --> 01:03:18,016
You want it?

1133
01:03:18,896 --> 01:03:20,796
Thank you.

1134
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:25,996
Me-rong.

1135
01:03:27,066 --> 01:03:28,916
You're so mean.

1136
01:03:30,396 --> 01:03:31,976
Everything is so tasty.

1137
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:35,556
Yes, thank you.

1138
01:03:35,556 --> 01:03:37,676
- Dumplings are the best.
- Director.

1139
01:03:37,676 --> 01:03:39,566
Come and join us.

1140
01:03:41,956 --> 01:03:43,676
Director Jang, come in.

1141
01:03:43,676 --> 01:03:45,186
Did the meeting go well?

1142
01:03:45,186 --> 01:03:47,796
Yes, we'll meet once
 more next week.

1143
01:03:47,796 --> 01:03:49,216
Good job.

1144
01:03:49,216 --> 01:03:52,686
Oh, no. What do we do? 
We ate by ourselves.

1145
01:03:52,686 --> 01:03:55,756
We already ate dinner on our way.

1146
01:03:55,756 --> 01:03:57,576
Good job, everyone.

1147
01:03:57,576 --> 01:03:59,006
 Thank you. 

1148
01:03:59,006 --> 01:04:00,416
Bit Chae Woon.

1149
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:02,556
Did you organize the styling files?

1150
01:04:02,556 --> 01:04:04,116
Yes, I finished it.

1151
01:04:04,116 --> 01:04:05,926
If you're finished, 
bring it to my office.

1152
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:08,496
- Let's review together.
- Yes, got it.

1153
01:04:10,266 --> 01:04:13,006
CEO, I'll get back first.

1154
01:04:18,316 --> 01:04:20,186
 

1155
01:04:20,186 --> 01:04:21,576
Come in.

1156
01:04:23,306 --> 01:04:25,356
I brought you the file.

1157
01:04:25,356 --> 01:04:27,036
Have a seat.

1158
01:04:30,126 --> 01:04:32,436
How far did the 
afternoon meeting go?

1159
01:04:32,436 --> 01:04:33,836
We talked about the
 upcoming event.

1160
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:35,336
I posted it on the team site.

1161
01:04:35,336 --> 01:04:36,656
You did?

1162
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:43,746
 Our design team family from 
some twenty years ago. 

1163
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,686
 Oh, my gosh, look at the cuties. 

1164
01:04:45,686 --> 01:04:47,446
 Bit Chae Woon, 
why don't you post yours? 

1165
01:04:47,446 --> 01:04:48,506
 You were so cute. 

1166
01:04:48,506 --> 01:04:50,636
 So embarrassing. 
I'll keep it for myself. 

1167
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:53,256
 Oh, no. Baby Bit Chae Woon
 was the best. 

1168
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:55,596
 Post yours since we 
posted ours, Chae Woon.

01:04:55,596 --> 01:04:57,446
 That's right. Post it. 

1170
01:04:58,866 --> 01:05:00,676
Bit Chae Woon.

1171
01:05:00,676 --> 01:05:02,736
You must've been
 adorable as a baby.

1172
01:05:03,596 --> 01:05:05,896
Yes, I guess I was.

1173
01:05:05,946 --> 01:05:07,636
Let me see it.

1174
01:05:22,906 --> 01:05:24,266
Here you go.

1175
01:05:29,106 --> 01:05:30,986
It's cute.

1176
01:05:30,986 --> 01:05:33,206
You look different, though.

1177
01:05:33,206 --> 01:05:35,366
Thank you.

1178
01:06:02,036 --> 01:06:03,746
 It's the same kid. 

1179
01:06:10,296 --> 01:06:12,096
Are you sure...

1180
01:06:12,996 --> 01:06:15,146
this is you, Bit Chae Woon?

1181
01:06:15,146 --> 01:06:16,506
Yes.

1182
01:06:18,276 --> 01:06:20,616
I guess I must look 
so different, huh?

1183
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,466
I'm sorry.

1184
01:06:31,316 --> 01:06:32,836
Excuse me for a moment.

1185
01:06:50,336 --> 01:06:53,276
Director Jang, I'll go home first...

1186
01:06:55,556 --> 01:06:57,536
Is something wrong?

1187
01:06:58,836 --> 01:07:00,216
Mom.

1188
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:01,676
Yeah?

1189
01:07:05,906 --> 01:07:07,406
Who...

1190
01:07:08,266 --> 01:07:09,936
is this child?

1191
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:23,826
You...

1192
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:27,836
had this?

1193
01:07:29,956 --> 01:07:31,616
Who is it?

1194
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:42,186
Director, please go to 
the reference room...

1195
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:57,206
♫  You don't need to force love  ♫

1196
01:07:57,206 --> 01:08:05,246
♫  Like passing time, 
you can't stop the heart  ♫

1197
01:08:05,246 --> 01:08:11,736
♫  We're drawn to each 
other like the magnets  ♫

1198
01:08:11,736 --> 01:08:18,266
♫  So that we can fill in
 a hole in our heart  ♫

1199
01:08:18,266 --> 01:08:20,076
 

1200
01:08:20,076 --> 01:08:21,786
 Do I get to perform
 internationally, too? 

1201
01:08:21,786 --> 01:08:24,396
 - Just sign here, right?
- Wait. 

1202
01:08:24,396 --> 01:08:26,126
 You have to deposit 
your training fee first. 

1203
01:08:26,126 --> 01:08:27,436
 Just succeed. 

1204
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,256
  
This will be chump change. 

1205
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:32,716
 
 Hold it. 

1206
01:08:32,716 --> 01:08:35,116
 Geez, come on, carry some weight. 

1207
01:08:35,116 --> 01:08:36,966
 Gosh! Oh, my goodness! 

1208
01:08:36,966 --> 01:08:39,196
 My goodness! 

1209
01:08:39,196 --> 01:08:42,906
 Aigoo, I don't know if I should
 continue to live in this house. 

1210
01:08:42,906 --> 01:08:45,846
 Aunt, how can I live 
seeing stuff like this? 

1211
01:08:45,846 --> 01:08:47,846
 - Aunt!
- Oh, my gosh! 

1212
01:08:47,846 --> 01:08:49,626
 The model can't make it? 

1213
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:51,276
 She went to the ER 
for a stomachache. 

1214
01:08:51,276 --> 01:08:52,956
 - I just got a call.
- What should I do? 

1215
01:08:52,956 --> 01:08:54,366
 Bit Chae Woon. 

1216
01:08:54,366 --> 01:09:00,566
♫  You became the meaning  ♫

1217
01:09:00,566 --> 01:09:02,969
♫  The one who taught me love  ♫
