1
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,980
What did I see just now?

2
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,060
Koala, this is a dream, right?

3
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,110
It's not a dream.

4
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,460
It's not a dream. They were hiding out...

5
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,980
and they're acting crazy to scare us.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,450
Is that what they're doing?

7
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,690
That's it.

8
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,450
Geez, you scared me.

9
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,710
How could you be with Hae Deun...

10
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,890
Lee Hae Deun, I almost misunderstood this.

11
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,210
Jang Joon Ah.

12
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,950
Hey, Lee Hae Deun.

13
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,320
Yeah, right. You're right.

14
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,690
About what?

15
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,060
You're right, Unni.

16
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,510
About what?

17
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,890
We're dating!

18
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,500
What?

19
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,170
I'm dating your younger sister, Chae Woon.

20
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,060
Moong-i, Moong-i!

21
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,920
Lee Hae Deun.

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,220
Lee Hae Deun!

23
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,010
- Lee Hae Deun!
- Oh, my.

24
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,110
Chae Woon, you came to see your mom.

25
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,470
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

26
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,760
Yeah, you guys look great together.

27
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,610
Thank you.

28
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,270
Please don't go...

29
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,200
Hey, this isn't a good spot. Let's go 
somewhere else and talk.

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
Go where? To the jokbal place?

31
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,690
Are you crazy? My dad's there.

32
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,900
- Also Uncle Hwak Se.
- Also some jokbal.

33
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,440
- Whoa.
- Jokbal!

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,270
Oh-ho?

35
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,800
Honey, where should we go? 
To an open field?

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,330
Ko-bong, it's all the same.

37
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,260
- There's a spot.
 - Where? 

38
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,500
Where?

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,370
Where is it? Where?

40
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,230
Oh, my. I feel like we're taping
 a film or something.

41
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,040
The light is on. Mother must be home.

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,330
Mom must be in the kitchen.

43
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,590
Let's go in as quietly as possible.

44
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,220
Okay. Let's go.

45
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,080
What are they up to?

46
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,840
Geez.

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,630
Chae Woon, let's go.

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,830
Aigoo, where is my head?

49
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,360
What was I doing that I couldn't 
even collect dry clothes?

50
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,160
Unni.

51
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,390
Hi, Man Jung. You're home.

52
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,710
- Aigoo, did you have a long day?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,600
Where are the kids?

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,150
Well? No one is home yet.

55
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,540
- No one is home yet?
- Yeah.

56
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,870
- I see.
- Aigoo, weren't you cold?

57
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,650
Aigoo, my unni...

58
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,940
The sun came down a while ago. 
You forgot to collect the laundry?

59
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,240
- Let's go, let's go.
- Aigoo...

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,860
Man Jung, you're so quick.

61
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,050
- Let's go in.
- Unni, I'm hungry.

62
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,270
Oh, yeah? Let's go inside.

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,350
 

64
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,190
So how long have you two been dating?

65
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,580
Well, I'm not sure.

66
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,480
Well...

67
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,450
It's a bit vague.

68
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,260
From the moment we met each other, 
we fell in love at first sight.

69
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,230
We were acting all proud as if 
we weren't interested.

70
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,870
We just kept flirting, you know.

71
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,010
It's vague.

72
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,740
That's not true. I never fell 
for you at first sight.

73
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,280
Gosh, she's shy in front of people.

74
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,870
What do you mean you didn't fall for me?

75
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,790
When I asked for meatballs at the
 sandwich shop, you fell for me right away.

76
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,230
I noticed it right away. 
What are you saying?

77
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,280
What? Notice right away? 
Do you have prince syndrome?

78
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,400
You fell in love with me at first sight.

79
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,610
That's why you're wearing this ring.

80
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,880
This yarn string wouldn't come off 
my finger at some point.

81
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,510
Hae Deun is the one with 
princess syndrome.

82
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,840
Hey, man!

83
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,120
Be quiet...

84
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,940
What are you going to do now?

85
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,100
"Hey, man"? Geez, you scared me, man.

86
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,660
Geez, you came at me all of a sudden.

87
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,360
What do you mean what will I do?

88
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,010
We'll date.

89
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:06,620
You know, this isn't just going to
 end at you two dating.

90
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,570
Joon Ah and I are siblings...

91
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,240
and Hae Deun and I are sisters.

92
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,660
I know. I'm aware of that.

93
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,950
I know.

94
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,870
So I did think about this 
quite a bit. And this is...

95
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,070
Look. If you look on the surface, 
the family tree is all messed up.

96
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,200
But unexpectedly, it's not that bad.

97
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,130
Right, right. We did think 
this through as well.

98
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,380
That's right. We've talked about this already.

99
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,100
Hae Deun, good thinking. 
Let's hold hands.

100
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,110
So Chae Woon, listen to me carefully.

101
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:52,230
My mom, CEO Kim Jung Won, will put you 
on her family registry as her birth daughter.

102
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,370
Then you and Hae Deun are clear
 as far as paperwork goes.

103
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,270
From that point on, you two aren't related,

104
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,360
and you're siblings only with me.

105
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,490
Do you understand?

106
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,470
That's right. So there's 
no problem with us dating.

107
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,880
Right.

108
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,400
So there aren't any problems 
on paper, but...

109
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,140
it's not like that from 
the perspectives of elders.

110
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,130
It won't be like that. The elders could 
be shocked momentarily, but

111
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,000
we should work together 
at times like that.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,540
You and Unni could work on our behalf.

113
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,900
- Isn't that right, Brother-in-law?
- Geez, well...

114
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,500
That's that, but...

115
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,880
No.

116
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,720
- You can't.
- No, you can't.

117
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,620
We could cheer you on, but...

118
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,700
what if things don't work out 
between you two?

119
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,300
We'll be seeing each other 
as a family for life.

120
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,700
What will you do then? Huh?

121
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,070
Well, yeah. That's true, too.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,580
I mean...

123
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,620
It looks like Bit Chae Woon tends to 
be slightly pessimistic.

124
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,280
There's no problem on paper. 
Why do you make it so complicated?

125
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,590
Yeah, you're right.

126
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:06,270
Complicated? You can't look
 at this simply, Joon Ah.

127
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,320
Joon Ah... Joon Ah?

128
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,690
I feel so weird. I mean...

129
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,960
I've wanted to point this out 
to you, Chae Woon.

130
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
I feel this way. Honestly...

131
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,340
when you address me as just "Joon Ah,"

132
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,380
I feel a bit taken aback.

133
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,390
If you're worried about paperwork 
and family tree and all.

134
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,390
I'm your older brother, 
yet you call me "Joon Ah..."

135
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,010
- I'm a bit offended.
- That's true.

136
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,810
Gosh, well...

137
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,240
I know.

138
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,720
I know it, but well...

139
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,510
I can't really say it.

140
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,560
That's right, man.

141
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,160
Act like an older brother if 
you want to be called that.

142
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,610
Chae Woon doesn't tend to
 call anyone "oppa."

143
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,030
She didn't call me that, either. 
Why would she call you that?

144
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,300
So what about it?

145
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,270
Jae Hee, what should I do about it?

146
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,530
What about it?

147
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,980
Do you want to be called "oppa"?
 I'll call you that.

148
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,970
Oppa, Oppa. Is that good?

149
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,210
I mean, it's true.

150
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,610
You shouldn't lecture us about 
messing up the family tree.

151
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,330
You should straight out 
how you address him first.

152
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,400
Call him "oppa."

153
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,960
- Right? Right?
- Yup.

154
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,140
- Lee Hae Deun.
- It's Jang Joon Ah.

155
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,690
All right. Forget it.

156
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:15,420
On the other hand, am I not 
your senior now, Unni? Right?

157
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,920
- I'm dating your older brother.
- Exactly.

158
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,790
Right? Right? Am I your 
sister-in-law now?

159
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,920
You've married already in your mind.

160
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,070
- You're already married.
- Sister-in-law...

161
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,770
You can't do that. That's wrong.

162
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,370
- Say he's wrong.
- What are you saying...

163
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,810
Joon Ah...

164
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,180
Whoa. So...

165
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,050
you and he are dating?

166
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,530
Auntie, since when were 
you standing there?

167
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,520
- For a while.
- You heard everything?

168
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,150
Yeah, I was all ears.

169
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,220
- Well...
 - Yup.

170
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,180
So you guys are 
Samgwang Villa's couple #4?

171
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,590
Please lower your voice.

172
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,950
Are you guys Samgwang Villa's 
couple #4?

173
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,540
You jerk!

174
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,400
My apologies, Auntie. 
I should've told you first.

175
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,020
So, when will you tell your mom?

176
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,200
- As for that...
- Auntie, Auntie!

177
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,380
As for that, let us gather 
our thoughts first...

178
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,790
Hey, there's no need to gather 
thoughts and whatnot.

179
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,310
Just reveal it at once.

180
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,070
If you don't, you can't sleep,

181
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,940
you can't swallow food. 
I've done all this. I know.

182
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,460
Okay, I'll tell her for you.

183
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,820
No, no, no.

184
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,810
Let go of me! I'll tell her for you.

185
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,750
- No.
- Let go of me.

186
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,360
What are you all doing here? Oh, my.

187
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,650
Jae Hee, you came.

188
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,800
What are you all doing here
 in this small room?

189
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,960
Man Jung, you said you'll help me fold 
the laundry. What are you doing here?

190
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,110
Yeah, Unni.

191
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,460
Unni, you know. Let's see...

192
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,100
What?

193
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,690
It's nothing. I heard some noise 
and was wondering

194
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,340
if Bit Chae Woon was here. 
And here she is.

195
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,300
They were having fun.

196
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,450
- Let's go fold clothes.
- Okay.

197
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,610
Come to the living room. 
What are you doing in this small room?

198
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,850
- Yes, Mother.
- I'll step back for now.

199
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,770
- Come out.
- Yes, Mother.

200
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,940
Come out. You come out.

201
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,120
Unni.

202
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,420
Lee Hae Deun.

203
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,270
Do you really like Joon Ah?

204
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,340
Aigoo...

205
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,120
 You keep following me around lately. 

206
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,380
 I think you're obsessed with me. 

207
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,920
Cha Ba Reun, what an idiot.

208
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,930
I did that because I'm running 
out of days to see you.

209
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,260
Ra Hoon!

210
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,420
Uncle.

211
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,250
- Are you off work?
- Yeah.

212
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,310
Are you worried about something? 
Why do you look down?

213
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,610
No, nothing's going on.

214
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,730
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

215
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,000
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

216
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,300
♫   It's good! It's very, very good   ♫

217
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,670
Aigoo...

218
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,310
Jae Hee, go and sit down.

219
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,960
Gosh, no, Mother.

220
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,060
- I can do this.
- Mother!

221
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,080
- I'll do this.
- Oh, no.

222
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,460
When I lived in London,
 I worked at a restaurant.

223
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,720
I peeled 3,000 apples a day there.

224
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,320
Oh, really? 3,000?

225
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,110
Hey, why are you lying to Mother?

226
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,930
Jae Hee, memorize what this says.

227
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,120
 Okay, peel the apples then. 

228
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,690
 Do you know how? 

229
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,220
 All right. 

230
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,000
 Do it then. 

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,580
What's wrong with this atmosphere?

232
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,860
Did you guys argue in that room?

233
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,310
- No.
- No, no, no.

234
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,320
Hae Deun, did you get
 in trouble with your sister?

235
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,950
You must've done something wrong.

236
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,210
I didn't.

237
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,290
Am I a troublemaker? Mom, I'm hurt...

238
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,280
Aigoo.

239
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,250
My Hae Deun, did it hurt your feelings?

240
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,360
- I'm sorry.
- I noticed that...

241
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,860
Chae Woon was disciplining Hae Deun.

242
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,310
Telling her to be good to you 
and me in the future.

243
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,740
Right?

244
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,670
Gosh, I'm glad you did.

245
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,370
You should've disciplined her hard.

246
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,120
Yeah, I did. Right, Auntie?

247
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,480
Yup.

248
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,200
- Mom.
- Huh?

249
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,420
I have something to tell you.

250
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,270
- Director Lee.
 - Lee Hae Deun!

251
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,810
Hae Deun, sit here.

252
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,990
I'll do this. Sit over there.

253
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,270
Sit. Sit down.

254
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,730
What, Hae Deun?

255
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,140
We're home!

256
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,450
- We're home.
- We're home!

257
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,130
- Welcome!
- Aigoo, Chae Woon is here.

258
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,090
Uncle, did you get off work already?

259
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,720
Of course.

260
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,450
How about Father? We're here
 to go home with him.

261
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,680
Eems hyung?

262
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,010
He went home already.

263
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,840
He's probably still walking 
down the street.

264
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,280
Lee Hae Deun, this is your fault.

265
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,850
Why is it my fault?

266
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,800
Look at this. Something is 
going on between you two.

267
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,630
No, Mom.

268
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,420
We'll go now. Jae Hee.

269
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,080
- Okay.
- Wait, Noona.

270
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,970
Sorry, Ra Hoon. Next time.

271
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,280
No, no. I have to tell you now.

272
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,350
I'll say it.

273
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,090
Let's hear him out.

274
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,420
Lee Hae Deun, never mind you.

275
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,360
Ra Hoon, sorry. Next time.

276
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,640
- Mom, we're off. Let's go, Jae Hee.
- Mother, we're leaving.

277
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,980
- Okay...
- Mom, actually...

278
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,230
I'm going to the military! 
To the military!

279
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,600
 What? 

280
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,340
What?

281
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,240
You're going to the military?

282
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,480
Aigoo, Ra Hoon...

283
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,850
To the military?

284
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,000
Did you receive an enlistment
 notice? When?

285
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,390
A few days ago.

286
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,620
I couldn't tell you because of 
Chae Woon noona's wedding and all...

287
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,520
I thought I'd tell you 
since everyone is here.

288
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,090
Gosh, my nephew!

289
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,650
My Ra Hoon is going to the military.

290
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,410
Hey, Lee Ra Hoon...

291
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,680
When are you leaving? When?

292
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,190
I have less than a month left.

293
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,540
Ra Hoon...

294
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,160
Our youngest...

295
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,890
Lee Ra Hoon...

296
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,350
It's okay. Calm down.

297
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,470
Mom.

298
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,860
Oh, hi.

299
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,690
Aigoo...

300
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,310
Aigoo, my son.

301
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,580
You're feeling down, huh, Mom?

302
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,900
No.

303
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,750
I do feel bad that we have to be apart.

304
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:23,990
But I'm so proud of you for growing up 
so well and going to the military.

305
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,060
Actually, I always thought of you as a baby.

306
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,640
I'm at a loss as to how I'll go on 
without you here, my baby.

307
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,540
But Ra Hoon...

308
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,500
all the moms with sons
 go through this.

309
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,030
Maybe I should...

310
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,120
What's it called? A boot camp cafe.

311
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,980
Maybe I should join one.

312
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,170
I saw Ji Hoon's mom
 next door join a group.

313
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,420
Let me see. What more should I prepare?

314
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,570
I feel like when I used to prepare 
for your sister's wedding.

315
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,600
Gosh...

316
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,920
Chae Woon noona left home 
after getting married.

317
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,370
And I'll leave home to join the military.

318
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,350
What will you do, Mom? Huh?

319
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,280
Aigoo...

320
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,000
You're not leaving for good.

321
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,840
Look how Chae Woon
 came back tonight.

322
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,840
She'll come to visit often.

323
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,710
I'm okay, Ra Hoon.

324
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:36,380
My son grew up so well and 
will be a brave soldier.

325
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,520
You're awesome, my son.

326
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,400
- Aigoo, my mother...
- Aigoo...

327
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,810
Gosh, hey. Hey...

328
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,720
You're so strong. You'll be fine.

329
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,870
Okay? Ra Hoon, you'll be fine.

330
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,070
- I'll do well and come home.
- Of course.

331
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,100
Gosh, I can't believe Ra Hoon 
is going to the military.

332
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,260
Unni, I'm home.

333
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,010
Hi, you're home.

334
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,060
Unni, is something wrong?

335
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,640
Why are you crying?

336
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,590
You must've known.

337
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,130
Know what?

338
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,340
What else? That.

339
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,310
We found out tonight.

340
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,460
What are you talking about?

341
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,560
Why are you pretending not to know? 
About Ra Hoon joining the military.

342
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,890
What?

343
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,270
Ba Reun, I have to tell you something.

344
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,300
Hey, Lee Ra Hoon, 
are you going to the military?

345
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,700
Huh?

346
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,780
You heard.

347
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,200
I was just about to tell you.

348
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,620
Hey, Cha Ba Reun, didn't you know?

349
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,680
How could your girlfriend not know?

350
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,940
Is that why...

351
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,150
Is that why you wanted to 
stick around me so much?

352
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,630
Well, Ba Reun, it's not like that...

353
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,910
You should've told me sooner. 
I thought...

354
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,520
I had no idea.

355
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,390
Well, I'm sorry, Ba Reun.

356
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,170
I just couldn't tell you. I'm sorry.

357
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,490
Cha Ba Reun, why are you crying?

358
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,520
Gosh...

359
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,530
Why are you crying?

360
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,550
Why is everyone crying?

361
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,840
I'm the one going to the military. 
Why are you crying?

362
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,900
It will be tough in the military.

363
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,080
Hey.

364
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,440
Why are you crying?

365
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,160
- Why are you crying?
- Why? Why cry?

366
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,720
Why? Are you crying 
because of Ra Hoon?

367
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,810
Hey...

368
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,560
Hey, don't cry.

369
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,060
What's wrong?

370
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,480
Hey, Ra Hoon.

371
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,060
I told you.

372
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,750
You'll start your military 
service in the spring.

373
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,990
And then it will be summer soon.

374
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,940
- Then it's fall, then winter.
- That's right.

375
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,080
And it's spring again.

376
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,540
- Uncle, that's like...
- And it's summer again.

377
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,100
Then it's evening time.

378
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,950
Aigoo, Chae Woon.

379
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,870
- You're home now?
- Father.

380
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,950
Father.

381
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,330
I just got home, too.

382
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,310
We went over to the store
 to come home with you.

383
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,140
You did?

384
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,480
Hey, man. You should've called me.

385
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,500
Aigoo.

386
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,930
I was going to call you, 
but something big came up.

387
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,280
What big thing?

388
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,920
Did something happen at your office?

389
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,440
Oh, no. It's not that.

390
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,860
Oh, Ra Hoon is going to the military.

391
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,090
What?

392
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,870
Ra Hoon is?

393
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,210
Aigoo, In-law must be so sad.

394
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,690
You, too, Chae Woon.

395
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,720
Yes.

396
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,530
Father, did you have dinner?

397
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,130
Yeah, I ate.

398
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,320
- How about you?
- I ate, too.

399
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,450
Oh, good. Go on up. You must be tired.

400
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,330
- We'll go up, Father.
- Okay.

401
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,090
We'll come down to chat with you later.

402
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,720
All right.

403
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,490
Aigoo. The house feels so full now.

404
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,240
It's warm in here, even without a heater.

405
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,660
But...

406
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,800
I wonder if Jung Min Jae is
 lonely since she's all alone.

407
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,140
- Noonim.
- Oh, my.

408
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,830
Are you coming home for the night?

409
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,680
Ah, yes.

410
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,430
Isn't Ba Wi not back from
 his grandmother's?

411
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,020
Yes. He'll be home
 the day after tomorrow.

412
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,180
I see.

413
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,040
I miss Ba Wi.

414
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,000
Ba Wi said he misses you, too.

415
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,400
Oh, my. Really?

416
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,240
He's so cute.

417
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,460
All right then.

418
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,180
Good night.

419
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,190
Wait, Noonim.

420
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,690
When are you going to work tomorrow?

421
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,640
In the afternoon tomorrow.

422
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,400
Then how about we go hiking behind 
our apartment in the morning?

423
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,330
Oh, you mentioned last time that
 there's a nice hiking trail.

424
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,080
Oh, sure.

425
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,420
Then I'll call you in the morning.

426
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,650
Oh, okay.

427
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,040
Good night.

428
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,120
Good night.

429
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,940
Good night.

430
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,270
My gosh!

431
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,040
What's wrong with me?

432
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,540
This emotion...

433
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,860
What could it be?

434
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,600
Jae Hee.

435
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,250
Hae Deun has never cause 
problems with her dating life.

436
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,900
But I think she really likes him 
by the way she's acting now.

437
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,800
I think so, too.

438
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,980
Gosh, I can't tell them to break up 
just because our family tree is tangled.

439
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,240
I know.

440
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,740
Both of my mothers went through so much 
because of me. And now it's Hae Deun.

441
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,920
Aigoo, what should I do?

442
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,070
Oh, how is the Chairwoman doing?

443
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,050
I heard she's much more stabilized.

444
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,500
I heard you were trying to 
visit her at the hospital.

445
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,910
Yeah.

446
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,600
But Chairwoman didn't 
want to see me yet.

447
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,790
I see.

448
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,300
She must feel bad toward you 
and feels uncomfortable.

449
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,980
What's this?

450
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,980
I'll go wash up.

451
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,400
Jae Hee.

452
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,300
Huh?

453
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,730
Did Park Pil Hong give you this?

454
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,660
What?

455
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,170
Did you meet him today?

456
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,610
Why? Did he come to you? Did he 
cause some problem again?

457
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,770
It's not like that. 
I asked him to meet me.

458
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,600
I just wanted to check up
 on him, and...

459
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,500
he brought that with him.

460
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,970
He said it's your wedding gift.

461
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,860
Why did you meet him again?

462
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,040
He'll just drag you down. 
Why did you meet him?

463
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,190
Don't think like that.

464
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,170
He's your father, Chae Woon.

465
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,620
I want to look after him now.

466
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,940
You're good to my father, too.

467
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,520
So I want to be good to him, too.

468
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,400
And...

469
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,030
I know full well that's not how you feel.

470
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,500
Don't force yourself to hate him.

471
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,130
I'm not forcing it.

472
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,160
I don't like Park Pil Hong. 
I really hate him.

473
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,590
I'll wash up.

474
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,540
Na Ro.

475
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,770
You're working so hard on your proposal.

476
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,940
What if my mom doesn't 
even look at it?

477
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,880
I'll have to make sure she looks at it.

478
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,520
Make it look sharp.

479
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,760
But I'm not doing this just to 
be on the CEO's good side.

480
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,650
Harder I work at it,

481
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,920
you'll shine more, Seo Ah.

482
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:38,480
♫  Even if I close my eyes  ♫

483
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,910
What?

484
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,220
I'm so weird, huh?

485
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,900
What do you mean?

486
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,980
When I'm by your side,

487
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,270
I feel at peace.

488
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,260
I haven't felt like this that 
much before.

489
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,860
I always felt anxious...

490
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,580
and annoyed.

491
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,810
I was always like that.

492
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,140
You'd take it out on people

493
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,570
and get even more annoyed 
because you feel bad?

494
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,910
♫  I will find you  ♫

495
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,270
♫  I love you  ♫

496
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,490
You won't be like that anymore, Seo Ah.

497
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,030
I'll always be with you...

498
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,360
and I'll always protect you.

499
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,190
♫  Please love me  ♫

500
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,120
Oh, yeah. Come here.

501
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,480
Give me a minute.

502
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,770
Wait.

503
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,840
Ta-da!

504
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,360
A gift.

505
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,610
♫  Wherever you are  ♫

506
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,240
Open it.

507
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,820
♫  I will find you  ♫

508
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,960
♫  I love you  ♫

509
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,400
You said people seem more classy
 carrying a handkerchief.

510
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,020
Isn't it nice?

511
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,480
 People carry stuff like this nowadays? 

512
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,850
 Carrying stuff like this 
makes you look classy. 

513
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,250
 It feels like you're loved at home. 

514
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,360
Thank you.

515
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,670
It suits you well.

516
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,810
 

517
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,450
Who is it?

518
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,990
A friend.

519
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,760
Excuse me.

520
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,360
What?

521
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,850
Hwang Na Ro.

522
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,100
I heard you went in for 
a police investigation.

523
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,280
Gosh, you freak out when
 you hear of police.

524
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,360
 You must really want to 
score points with Jang Seo Ah. 

525
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,640
Get to the point.

526
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,900
You know what my point is.

527
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,120
Money.

528
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,940
I told you to wait.

529
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,010
 That's right but look. 

530
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,530
You told me to wait until 
you marry Jang Seo Ah.

531
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,020
But if you're put away even 
before you get married,

532
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,750
 what happens to me then? 

533
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,400
 For some reason, I feel like
 that's what's going to happen. 

534
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,960
 So... 

535
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,440
show me your appreciation 
before it's too late.

536
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,960
If not, I don't know how 
I'll show myself to you.

537
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,780
Gosh, I can't guarantee it.

538
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,150
Hey.

539
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,840
Try butting in.

540
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,560
Then you and I both die.

541
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,770
Na Ro.

542
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,480
What? When did you wake up?

543
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,150
A little bit ago.

544
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,450
But why?

545
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,960
This is so neat.

546
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,230
I was just looking at you, Moong-i.

547
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,020
How could this pretty Moong-i

548
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,350
be sleeping next to me?

549
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,200
What in the world?

550
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,990
Why are you looking at me sleeping? 
It's embarrassing.

551
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,720
You were sleeping so soundly, 
snoring away with this pretty nose.

552
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,880
I don't snore, though.

553
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,000
The person snoring usually
 doesn't know.

554
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,550
Our bedroom was ringing.

555
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,310
Really?

556
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,920
Oh, my God!

557
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,270
I'm kidding. Just kidding.

558
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,800
What the heck?

559
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,170
See? I don't snore.

560
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,760
- I really don't, right?
- No, you don't.

561
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,320
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

562
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,360
It's our turn.

563
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,370
It's our turn to cook.

564
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,290
- It's our turn.
- Yeah, right.

565
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,220
Just a minute.

566
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,500
Five more minutes.

567
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,940
- Could we?
- Sleep longer.

568
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,210
All right.

569
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,220
Where is the olive oil?

570
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,410
Aigoo.

571
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,870
 
Father must've practiced 
making breakfast with this.

572
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,000
This is my mom's handwriting.

573
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,130
Gosh, my mom trained my dad.

574
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,600
Whoa.

575
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,600
Good morning!

576
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,210
Aigoo. I got caught.

577
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,560
Father, I'm so touched.

578
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,010
You are?

579
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,580
Wow, I'm so glad that you're touched.

580
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,510
Did you take a photo and 
send it to Mom?

581
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,880
What you made for breakfast.

582
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,210
Geez, why bother sending
 a photo of that?

583
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,980
Geez, you should've sent it.

584
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,980
I'm sure Mom was curious.

585
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,790
Father, never mind the photo.

586
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,780
Should we make them and 
show them to her?

587
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,320
Make them ourselves?

588
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,490
Your pancakes were super delicious.

589
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:13,730
So we could make them 
and deliver them to her.

590
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,540
That's right. Mom likes pancakes.

591
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,900
Geez, forget it. Why bother?

592
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,380
Father!

593
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,790
Then go with me.

594
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,950
I'll hand it to her, Father.

595
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,210
It was really delicious.

596
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,530
Good morning, Mother.

597
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,670
Hi, Joon Ah. Did you sleep well?

598
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,340
- Yes.
- Was the room warm?

599
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,140
Yes, I slept so warmly, thanks to you.

600
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,340
That's good.

601
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,660
- Should I help you?
- No, it's okay.

602
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,400
I'll help you. What should I do first?

603
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,480
- My goodness.
- Which one?

604
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,270
Well...

605
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,490
- Joon Ah.
- Yes?

606
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,470
Visit your mother often.

607
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,780
I want to, but I can't seem
 to do it as often.

608
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,200
Gosh, I'm so bad.

609
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,140
You are.

610
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,290
Your mother seems to 
be strong on the outside, but

611
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,260
she must be so lonely.

612
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,360
As a leader of a huge company like that,

613
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,160
she must have lots to endure.

614
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,650
Right.

615
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,510
My gosh.

616
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:32,280
Oh, yeah, Seo Ah and Na Ro...

617
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,120
Are they really dating?

618
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,900
I saw them at the wedding, 
and they seem to be.

619
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,800
Right.

620
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,880
I think so.

621
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,920
My mother is very concerned 
about them right now.

622
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,440
As you know, Na Ro is a bit, 
you know...

623
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,880
Well...

624
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,590
He was involved in messing up
 Jae Hee's contract.

625
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,250
Of course, it was Seo Ah's fault as well.

626
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,360
Oh, my.

627
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,340
Then Na Ro was...

628
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,550
involved in that terrible incident?

629
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,060
Yes.

630
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,330
I heard Jae Hee and Chae Woon mistrusted 
Na Ro when he used to live here.

631
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,610
You didn't know, Mother?

632
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,640
I mean...

633
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,370
why would Chae Woon and 
Jae Hee mistrust Na Ro?

634
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,410
Did he do something terrible 
to deserve that?

635
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:30,550
Oh, no. You didn't know.

636
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,880
Gosh, what's going on...

637
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,230
Mom, good morning!

638
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,660
Gosh, seriously.

639
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,460
Did you tell my mom?

640
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,290
What?

641
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,480
No, it's not about that, Hae Deun.

642
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,570
Mom, I'm sorry.

643
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,210
You struggled a lot all this time, 
and on top of that, I'm...

644
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,010
Hae Deun, it's not about that.

645
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,740
- What, what?
- Hae Deun.

646
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,400
Did you know about what Na Ro did?

647
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,700
What?

648
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,420
What about Na Ro oppa?

649
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,580
What?

650
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,720
What?

651
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,280
What's for breakfast?

652
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,280
Unni, what's wrong?

653
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,770
- What is it?
- Nothing. It's nothing.

654
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,560
Then...

655
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,920
That's why Na Ro moved 
into Samgwang Villa?

656
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,490
Knowing that Chae Woon 
has a rich birth mom?

657
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,050
I think he was in the same 
prison as Park Pil Hong.

658
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,100
That's how he found out.

659
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,660
Come to find out, I had met Hwang Na Ro
 when I served as a medical volunteer.

660
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,140
That's why I kept saying I feel like
 I had seen him somewhere.

661
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,120
My gosh...

662
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,960
That's what happened then.

663
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,650
I'm sorry we didn't tell
 you sooner, Noonim.

664
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,760
You liked Na Ro so much.

665
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,710
We couldn't bear to tell you.

666
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:59,260
And Na Ro also begged us
 not to tell you.

667
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,170
Na Ro did that?

668
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,270
My gosh.

669
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,200
- Aigoo.
- I actually told him to move out.

670
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,340
I said he doesn't deserve to
 live in Samgwang Villa.

671
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,290
I took on the tough task.

672
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Mom, should we go ahead
 and set the table?

673
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,260
Oh, no.

674
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,670
I'm coming.

675
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,140
- Hey, let's do it together.
- Let's go.

676
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,530
I'll help you.

677
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,600
Let's go.

678
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,400
Gosh...

679
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,690
My gosh, how could Na Ro do that?

680
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,140
Ba Reun, are you ready?

681
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,330
Hey, what happened to your face?

682
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,340
You cried all night, huh?

683
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,100
Aigoo, your eyes are all swollen.

684
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,710
No, I didn't.

685
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,640
What do you mean, no?

686
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,970
Gosh...

687
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:14,760
Sorry I didn't tell you about the 
enlistment notice right away.

688
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,440
Although I could tell everyone else,

689
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,190
I just couldn't tell you.

690
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,390
You don't have to tell me. 
I know how you feel.

691
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:28,010
We've been through a lot to get here.

692
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,330
I'll spend time with you 
productively before you enlist.

693
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,020
 
Ta-da!

694
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,290
This is a bucket list for us to do
 together before you enlist.

695
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,440
Lee Ra Hoon, you must cooperate.

696
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,910
Geez...

697
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,030
When did you make this? 
Of course, I'll cooperate.

698
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,510
This is why you couldn't sleep, huh?

699
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,690
We have about 500 hours left.

700
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,420
We can't waste time.

701
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,640
Look carefully.

702
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,160
Kiss every day. Hug.

703
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,750
You have to do these things 
every day before you enlist.

704
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,660
Of course, I could do those things.

705
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,060
From here, these are things 
we have to do together.

706
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,130
We'll go see the stars

707
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,950
and eat cup ramen.

708
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,660
Go to a comic book cafe...

709
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,500
and sit there holding our hands 
as we read everything.

710
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,990
Close our eyes and draw 
each other's faces.

711
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:25,570
Go to the spot we first met and 
take a photo in the same pose.

712
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,510
And take an overnight trip.

713
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,920
An overnight trip?

714
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,710
Geez, where should we go
 in this cold weather?

715
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,790
There's a place.

716
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,000
It's very, very cold, 
but it's also very warm.

717
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,580
Where is that?

718
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,250
My home in Gangwondo.

719
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:46,490
I want to introduce you to my dad.

720
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,580
Let's go! I want to greet your father, too.

721
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,080
And this...

722
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,950
- Let's be sure to do them together.
- Okay.

723
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,490
If so, what should you do right now?

724
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,000
Right now?

725
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,200
What could it be?

726
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,960
- Hey!
- This?

727
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,050
It's not that.

728
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,570
Then...

729
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,570
Is this it?

730
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,450
- This isn't it, either.
 - Ra Hoon, Ba Reun. 

731
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,850
- Yes?
 - Aren't you going to work? 

732
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,480
Coming!

733
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,100
- Outside of Samgwang Villa.
- Yeah...

734
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,640
Let's go outside of Samgwang Villa.

735
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,840
Let's go.

736
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Gosh...

737
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,350
Mom.

738
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:34,920
Jae Hee wanted to visit you today. 
So we came together.

739
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,990
Aigoo, I said he didn't have to come.

740
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,200
Chairwoman.

741
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,680
Thank you for taking care
 of such a difficult task.

742
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,830
I'm sorry for...

743
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,670
making you struggle inadvertently.

744
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,280
I told the board of directors that
 I'd step down voluntarily.

745
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,660
You did well, Mom.

746
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,930
For a while...

747
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,480
I'll go to Jeju Island.

748
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,510
I need to cultivate my mind and heart.

749
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,210
Yes, Mom.

750
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:17,810
I'll take care of things, 
so you're comfortable there.

751
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,070
I get to hold Seo Yeon's hands
 for the first time.

752
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,440
The wound in your heart...

753
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,530
won't go away completely.

754
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,980
But I wish you could forget it.

755
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,300
Yes.

756
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,490
I'll try, Grandma.

757
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,400
My greed was crooked.

758
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,350
I only saw my daughter Jung Won.

759
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,030
I was blinded by my ambition.

760
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,950
As if I'll live a thousand years.

761
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,320
Mom.

762
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,380
I'm so sorry.

763
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,400
For making you step down this way.

764
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,910
No.

765
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,940
You were wise.

766
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,660
Thanks for letting me keep
 my dignity, Jung Won.

767
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,990
Seo Yeon, support 
your mother well at work.

768
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,940
Yes, Grandma.

769
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Take good care of my Seo Yeon
 and her mother.

770
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,010
Yes, Chairwoman.

771
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:09,860
 I heard Hwang Na Ro is actively 
resolving matters regarding this incident. 

772
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:14,020
He also submitted a thorough 
explanation to the police.

773
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,910
Even though he knows that I used him,

774
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,720
he's choosing to take
 everything on himself.

775
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,860
Hwang Na Ro. That guy has 
some audacity.

776
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,740
I heard she hasn't left for work yet.

777
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,700
She must be home then.

778
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:59,000
It's about time my 
daughter-in-law is here.

779
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,200
Hi, Chae Woon, are you on your way?

780
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,660
Oh, no, Father.

781
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,240
I thought I'd be working offsite, and
 that's why I set up the time with you.

782
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,680
But I'm not finished with work here.

783
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,020
That's too bad.

784
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,160
Focus on your work.

785
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,270
Okay, I'm sorry, Father.

786
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,150
Let's go to Mother's place 
together next time.

787
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,140
Okay, Father.

788
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:36,170
Moong-i, you're quite the expert.

789
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:39,290
Did you do this while dating me? 
Like a master at playing games?

790
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,550
Well? I can't say I didn't.

791
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,030
Daebak.

792
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,040
- Geez.
- No...

793
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,090
I should let Father and Mother
 enjoy the pancakes

794
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,620
and have a cozy time.

795
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,570
Never mind a cozy time.

796
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,500
It'd be nice if they don't fight.

797
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,900
No. I don't think they will.

798
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,210
So why are you doing this, Moong-i?

799
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,530
Are you trying to get them 
back together?

800
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:05,890
No, I haven't thought that far.

801
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:10,720
I thought it'd be nice if they see 
each other comfortably as friends.

802
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,180
They both look lonely.

803
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,900
Right. They both do.

804
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,510
Geez, I'm in a bind.

805
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,970
If I tell her I made them myself,

806
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,900
she'll ask me if I'm sick or something.

807
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,100
Geez...

808
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,580
No.

809
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,350
I'll leave it at the door

810
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,760
and run away after ringing the bell.

811
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,400
Huh?

812
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,130
Geez, why do I bump into that tall guy?

813
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,290
Geez.

814
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,380
Noonim.

815
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,510
Wow, you look like a young girl.

816
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,680
Gosh, come on.

817
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,260
- Let's go.
- Okay.

818
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,390
Wow, it must be spring soon.

819
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,930
 - It's getting warm. 
- Why that guy...

820
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,210
Geez.

821
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,570
Geez...

822
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,040
I brought this over for nothing.

823
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,200
What the heck?

824
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,610
- I wanted to get a young haircut...
- Why are they coming this way?

825
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,600
 That place is actually a good salon. 

826
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,500
 For a young hair style... 

827
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,860
I asked for that, but she cut it 
straight across.

828
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,370
- Like an idiot. A comedian.
- Then...

829
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,780
 You should've gotten a refund. 

830
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:48,130
My students laughed at me so hard.

831
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,810
Oh, my God!

832
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,730
What was that?

833
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,710
Are you okay?

834
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,300
A cat came out of nowhere.

835
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,340
I got startled, too.

836
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,190
- Oh, my gosh!
- Be careful.

837
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,110
You're scared of cats.

838
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,260
No, I'm not scared of them, but...

839
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,020
Bad cat.

840
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,310
I'm okay.

841
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:19,780
What beautiful weather.

842
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,280
No dust.

843
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,970
It's clear.

844
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,470
That's right...

845
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,880
 - Is that so? 
- Jung Min Jae...

846
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,760
She needs someone kind like
 him by her side now.

847
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,100
Recently, the R&amp;D of smart clothing
 has been progressing globally.

848
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,810
We recognize that the market is expanding.

849
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:19,050
Many brands are already 
cultivating smart clothing.

850
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,970
When LX Fashion acquires this technology,

851
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,110
you can see that the effects are maximized.

852
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:27,370
You can classify smart clothing 
under five major categories.

853
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,830
Consumer and retail,

854
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,560
distribution, information and defense industry,

855
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,890
industry and commerce,

856
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:33,940
medical, emergency, and public health.

857
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,990
Smart clothing is already being
 cultivated in a variety of industries.

858
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:39,670
When LX Fashion is involved...

859
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,570
CEO.

860
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:49,770
I think the executives are finally 
showing interest in your project.

861
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,790
They are, right?

862
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:57,850
I hope you recognize how hard 
Hwang Na Ro worked on it.

863
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:00,190
He prepared the presentation well,

864
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,060
and he persuaded the executives.

865
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,750
It seems like Hwang Na Ro did
 study very hard this time.

866
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,100
Yes.

867
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,700
CEO, did you ask for me?

868
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,460
Hwang Na Ro.

869
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,060
Your presentation was excellent.

870
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,180
Good job.

871
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,960
Thank you.

872
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,060
I've been thinking.

873
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,180
Why don't you lead this project

874
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,740
and take charge of the development team?

875
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,950
- CEO...
- Mom.

876
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:43,120
I also heard that you're taking the lead
 in resolving Jae Hee's company incident.

877
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,960
Thank you for your work.

878
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,390
I'll take charge and 
work hard on this project.

879
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:00,570
Na Ro, did you see Mom's face?

880
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:03,230
My mom is different than before.

881
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,180
I think she started to trust you more.

882
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,530
I should tighten up more and 
work harder at times like this.

883
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:11,670
Yeah, you should.

884
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:14,830
I'm so happy. What do I do?

885
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:18,340
We just have to be happy now. 
Don't you think?

886
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,410
I owe all this to you, Seo Ah.

887
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,710
- Thank you.
- I feel the same way.

888
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,980
Mother.

889
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,800
Hi, Na Ro.

890
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,310
How have you been?

891
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,760
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

892
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,990
Are you here to see Bit Chae Woon?

893
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,470
No.

894
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,760
I came to see you, Na Ro.

895
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,740
So...

896
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:01,110
is everything I've said true?

897
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,570
I'm so curious.

898
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,890
I just couldn't believe it.

899
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,630
I wanted to confirm with you as well.

900
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,150
Yes.

901
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,380
It's not true, right?

902
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,470
There was some 
misunderstanding, right?

903
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,620
That's right.

904
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,020
That has to be.

905
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:27,070
Man Jung and the kids heard 
some strange story from somewhere.

906
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:29,360
They all misunderstood you.

907
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,530
When they saw you getting 
close to Seo Ah,

908
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:35,210
I'm sure it looked more like it to them.

909
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,030
A relationship between 
a man and a woman

910
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:41,670
could develop somehow.

911
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,030
It's not true, right?

912
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,870
Right, Na Ro?

913
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,130
As for that, Mother...

914
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:06,450
Everyone misunderstood me.

915
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:12,320
Then why didn't you deny and
 explain yourself more adamantly?

916
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,500
It's also my fault for behaving in 
a way for them to misconstrue.

917
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,910
If you say so, Na Ro...

918
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,490
You must be telling the truth.

919
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,270
I'll believe you, Na Ro.

920
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,000
Mom is finally starting to see
 Na Ro in a positive light.

921
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,820
She can't hear negative 
things from others.

922
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,740
Did you ask for me, Director?

923
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:48,170
Yeah.

924
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,230
Well...

925
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:56,260
I have a favor to ask you.

926
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,400
Mom is starting to see 
Na Ro in a positive light.

927
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,890
I don't think she started to
 see him in a positive light.

928
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,830
Because you depend on Na Ro so much,

929
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:17,330
I'm sure she's deciding to give in.

930
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,030
She's your mother.

931
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:22,480
Chae Woon.

932
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,420
Help me out.

933
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:31,220
I know that you know 
what kind of person Na Ro is.

934
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,380
But don't tell Mom any details for now.

935
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,280
I asked you to come in to say this.

936
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:48,930
Don't you think Mom knows
 about Na Ro, too?

937
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:52,690
There's no way Mom wouldn't 
have looked into his background.

938
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,730
But still, help me.

939
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:58,740
I'm sure Mom will discuss him with you.

940
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,830
If you say positive things 
about Na Ro then,

941
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,720
that would be a great help to me.

942
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,510
I can't do that, Seo Ah.

943
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:16,190
I know what kind of person Na Ro is. 
How can I say good things about him?

944
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,280
I'm asking you.

945
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,070
I've never asked you for anything before.

946
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,320
I'm...

947
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,760
getting better, thanks to Na Ro.

948
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,740
I'm counting on your help.

949
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:37,590
I beg you.

950
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,790
Here? It's where the 
dry cleaner used to be...

951
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,000
Hi, Jae Hee.

952
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,180
It's here.

953
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,440
Geez.

954
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,890
How can you buy a store here? 
Samgwang Villa is right next door.

955
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:53,160
I couldn't help it.

956
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,670
When I came here to meet 
Soon Jung last time,

957
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:57,360
I saw this place was on sale 
at a good price. So I got it.

958
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,810
I'm good at sewing.

959
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:02,420
What if Chae Woon catches you here?

960
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,310
That's why I'm fessing up
 to you, Jae Hee.

961
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:08,260
I'll look outside like a hawk

962
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,240
and hide if Seo Yeon walks by.

963
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,140
When Soon Jung and 
Seo Yeon's siblings walk by, too.

964
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,190
Geez...

965
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,880
 
It's Chae Woon.

966
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,420
Hi, Moong-i. I'm at a site.

967
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:28,100
Park... Park... Park Pil Hong?

968
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,970
No, I don't want to. No.

969
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:32,690
Yeah, I want to meet Park Pil Hong.

970
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:35,020
Why do you want to meet Park Pil Hong?

971
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,600
I'm scared of my Seo Yeon. I'm scared.

972
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,530
I want to discuss Hwang Na Ro with him.

973
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:45,480
Seo Ah seems to depend 
too much on Hwang Na Ro.

974
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,970
Oh, really?

975
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:53,790
Wow, Hwang Na Ro is Jang Seo Ah's 
boyfriend officially?

976
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,070
That dude hit it big.

977
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:57,450
Father.

978
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,730
All right. I'll ask my guys.

979
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:03,240
I'll find out if Hwang Na Ro 
is up to no good these days.

980
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,740
Yes, please find out.

981
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:08,760
Did you just call me "Father"?

982
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,960
Did I? When?

983
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,480
You did. I definitely heard it.

984
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,960
You heard wrong.

985
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,630
Is there a leak in the ceiling? 
What's with that?

986
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,840
Yeah, there must be a leak. 
It's discolored.

987
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,690
Why? Will you fix it for me?

988
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:24,050
No.

989
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:25,610
Jae Hee?

990
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,610
What brings you here?

991
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:33,090
He's inspecting the leak in my store.

992
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,110
- Yes, the leak.
- You have a leak?

993
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:38,040
Are you the new owner here?

994
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,350
Hello. I'm opening up a tailor shop 
starting today. I'm Lee Dong Chool.

995
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:43,260
Oh, yes. Hello.

996
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,470
I'm Kim Hwak Se, and I work 
at the jokbal place.

997
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:49,190
I lived in the same house with Mr. Woo

998
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:52,810
and Mr. Woo's mother-in-law's sister...

999
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,590
Her sister is a doctor.

1000
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:57,440
I'm talking to her about 
our future together...

1001
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,470
and I could become his uncle.

1002
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,650
Pardon?

1003
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,200
What I mean is...

1004
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,480
Yes. Anyway, I look forward
 to getting to know you.

1005
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,800
Yes.

1006
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,870
- Why?
 - Sir?

1007
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,050
Sir, take a look here...

1008
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:13,020
 What? Oh, Mother, you're here. 

1009
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,180
Jae Hee.

1010
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,930
What are you doing here today?

1011
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:18,900
I came to see my father 
at the jokbal place.

1012
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,260
I see.

1013
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,170
Why do you look so drained, Mother?

1014
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,120
Oh, it's nothing.

1015
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,560
But when did a tailor shop open here?

1016
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,170
Is it open yet?

1017
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,060
 It's not open yet. 

1018
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,890
 I think it is open. 

1019
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,920
I was just talking to the owner.

1020
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,390
The owner just ran inside 
all of a sudden.

1021
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:40,590
- Why?
- He got a phone call, so he went in.

1022
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:42,000
- He got a phone call?
- Yes.

1023
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,650
Mother, let's go. I'll walk you over.

1024
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,700
The house is right here. 
Why walk me over? It's okay.

1025
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,330
Jae Hee, I heard Eems hyung would 
be late to work tonight.

1026
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,700
Really? Something must've come up.

1027
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,870
Mother, please go.

1028
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,460
That's not it.

1029
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,770
He said he's stopping by somewhere.

1030
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:58,730
Really? He must be stopping
 by somewhere.

1031
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,400
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

1032
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:15,870
 Oh, my God! 

1033
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,370
 What was that? 

1034
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,950
 Are you okay, Noonim? 

1035
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,700
That's right.

1036
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,160
I should let her fly away.

1037
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,580
Pancakes?

1038
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,760
I never got that.

1039
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,160
Your father didn't even come by.

1040
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,350
Really?

1041
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:46,870
Father followed the manual 
you gave him

1042
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:50,810
and made a fantastic breakfast.

1043
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:52,540
And since you love it,

1044
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:56,830
he made pancakes to bring them 
over to you in the morning.

1045
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:58,130
Really?

1046
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,550
That didn't happen.

1047
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:01,800
Your father didn't even call me.

1048
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,830
But why...

1049
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,870
Did something urgent come up at work?

1050
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,410
Take your time.

1051
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,730
Noonim!

1052
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:20,200
Professor.

1053
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,170
By chance, did you come
 out to greet me?

1054
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,360
What?

1055
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,920
My goodness...

1056
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,500
Well, this is my daughter-in-law.

1057
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,760
Oh, I see.

1058
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,460
Hello.

1059
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,710
This is Jae Hee's college professor.

1060
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:43,260
Oh, I see.

1061
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,960
Hello.

1062
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,590
I get to meet you finally. 
Nice to meet you.

1063
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:48,760
Yes.

1064
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,510
I live across from her.

1065
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:54,410
Oh, I see.

1066
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:57,700
I'll get going, Mother.

1067
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,720
Oh, yeah. I'll walk you out.

1068
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,460
Noonim, it's cold outside.

1069
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:06,940
Oh, Chae Woon.

1070
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,490
Father.

1071
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,790
What did you say?

1072
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:17,060
What?

1073
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,830
Do what? Remarry?

1074
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:20,140
That's right.

1075
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:22,450
My gosh.

1076
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,410
Are you dating someone?

1077
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,790
By chance, Soon Jung...

1078
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:32,180
It couldn't be.

1079
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:35,070
I'll actively look for 
someone from now on.

1080
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,250
I should've known.

1081
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:41,830
Gosh, I wonder if anyone would
 marry you, Woo Jung Hoo.

1082
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:45,030
In any case, I'll start anew.

1083
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:47,910
You begin your new life, too.

1084
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:50,930
For me, living like this
 in itself is a new life.

1085
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:53,570
If someone approaches you, 
don't stop him.

1086
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,560
And don't mind the kids.

1087
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,890
Just date him.

1088
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:00,460
I won't come by this place anymore.

1089
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,320
So don't think about me.

1090
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,310
Aigoo, you're overreacting.

1091
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:07,780
Who's thinking about you?

1092
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,760
I got it.

1093
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,330
For example,

1094
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:19,750
if that tall guy across from 
you asks you out,

1095
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,670
don't turn him down. Go out with him.

1096
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:25,790
Geez, I'll take care of it.

1097
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,500
But Ba Wi's dad across from me.

1098
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,830
Do you know that 
his name is Jung Hoo, too?

1099
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:34,900
Son Jung Hoo.

1100
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,390
What?

1101
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:39,120
Aigoo, you should've 
brought me those pancakes.

1102
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,700
I wanted to taste them.

1103
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,490
 Is she really his destiny? 

1104
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:45,730
 - With that tall guy? 
- Don't you feel bad...

1105
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,560
for eating everything?

1106
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,840
Wait, wait, wait.

1107
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,540
Eat something before you go.

1108
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,750
You're heading to
 your part-time work, right?

1109
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,230
It's okay.

1110
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:01,450
Be well, Jung Min Jae.

1111
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,280
Gosh, eat something before you go.

1112
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,380
I'll make you some fried rice. Okay?

1113
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,530
Woo Jung Hoo.

1114
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,490
Gosh, that Jung Seo Ah pisses me off.

1115
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:15,800
She rejected all the photos we took.

1116
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,100
Seo Ah said she'd bring
 in other models,

1117
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,570
but she didn't. I'm relieved about that.

1118
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:23,790
Your sister got you wrapped 
around your finger, Mr. Makjang.

1119
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:26,620
No wonder she becomes ruder.

1120
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:32,160
Gosh, Hae Deun, she's still my sister. 
Calling her rude is a bit much.

1121
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,040
See? Look at this.

1122
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,230
You said you like me, 
but you end up taking her side.

1123
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:38,070
- I'm not taking a side...
- Forget it.

1124
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,350
I'm leaving.

1125
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,100
Geez, Hae Deun.

1126
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,390
Hae Deun...

1127
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:47,660
Geez, she always takes off first.

1128
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,390
I have to give her something.

1129
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:55,200
Geez, I shouldn't have acted all cool.

1130
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,610
No, no, Woo Jung Hoo. You did well.

1131
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:02,610
You're a cool man.

1132
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,450
Hello.

1133
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:08,950
- Hi.
- Do you have good news?

1134
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:10,370
No.

1135
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:12,700
- Heading home?
- Yes.

1136
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,750
- Going to work now?
- Yes.

1137
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:18,970
♫   It's good! It's very, very good   ♫

1138
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:21,230
Hi, Eems hyung! Hi, Jjung-a.

1139
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:23,950
Why do you call him "Eems hyung"?

1140
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,330
He's In-law now.

1141
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,030
Is that right?

1142
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,540
No, no.

1143
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,350
I like "Eems hyung."

1144
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:33,490
Please call me "James," Aunt.

1145
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,490
- Could I do that?
- Yes.

1146
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,500
Hwak Se, the song you 
were just singing.

1147
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:41,570
Are you practicing for the contest?

1148
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:42,700
Yes.

1149
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,740
The monthly final is coming up soon.

1150
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,210
I'm so nervous right now.

1151
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:51,780
Hwak Se, I'm sure you'll make it.

1152
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:55,040
Make it for sure, pass the 
monthly final, and

1153
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,210
go all the way to your debut.

1154
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:59,850
I should go all the way to my debut.

1155
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:01,440
- Go all the way.
- All the way to debut.

1156
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,060
- I should do that.
- Excuse me.

1157
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,850
Oh, yes.

1158
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:06,650
Yes, excuse you.

1159
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:07,720
Yes.

1160
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,290
I heard there's a jokbal place 
around here.

1161
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,590
Yes, jokbal place?

1162
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:13,760
It's over here.

1163
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,840
By chance, are you the kitchen help?

1164
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,160
Yes.

1165
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,700
Nice to meet you.

1166
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,640
I work there. Follow me.

1167
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,390
By chance...

1168
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,410
are you Eun Ji?

1169
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:29,670
Yes, I am.

1170
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,500
By chance, Hwak Se oppa?

1171
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:39,820
I'm Hwak Se.

1172
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:42,390
I'm Hwak Se! I used to live up the street. 
That Kim Hwak Se!

1173
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:43,680
Oppa!

1174
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,730
Hwak Se oppa!

1175
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:53,430
Oh, they must know each other well.

1176
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:55,240
I guess so.

1177
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:01,100
Gosh, was I too mean to Mr. Makjang?

1178
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:06,470
I guess no one likes it when
 someone badmouths their sister.

1179
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:14,850
 Director Lee, can we see 
each other for a moment? 

1180
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:21,620
 Mr. Makjang. 

1181
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,680
Whoa!

1182
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,200
Mr. Makjang.

1183
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:38,100
Director Lee, I'm really sorry about earlier.

1184
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,380
No, I feel worse.

1185
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:43,790
What in the world?

1186
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:46,640
You're smiling. Smiling.
 Director Lee is smiling.

1187
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,410
Are you feeling better?

1188
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:52,670
Gosh, when did you prepare all this?

1189
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:55,990
I just farted my way
 thinking of you, Hae Deun.

1190
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:57,880
What the heck?

1191
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,010
Yeah, right. This.

1192
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,620
Shoot!

1193
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:04,490
Mr. Makjang, for me?

1194
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:07,860
I'll put it on for you.

1195
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,400
Really?

1196
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,780
♫  My love  ♫

1197
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,980
- Soon Jung!
- CEO.

1198
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:20,220
Why are you standing outside? 
It's cold.

1199
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,720
I came out to greet you when 
you said you were coming.

1200
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,400
I'm sorry to come out of the blue.

1201
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,910
I wanted to talk to you about Seo Ah.

1202
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,940
Yes. I'm glad you came.

1203
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,990
- Come in.
- Let's go in.

1204
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,690
Oh, yeah. Is Joon Ah home?

1205
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,020
Yes, I think he came in earlier.

1206
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,900
Should we see what 
he's doing and surprise him?

1207
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,390
Should we?

1208
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,800
Go in.

1209
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,250
It's pretty. Do you like it?

1210
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,520
Yeah. It's so pretty!

1211
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,700
- Really?
-  Yeah.

1212
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,700
Director Lee, I love you.

1213
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:58,960
What in the world? Me, too.

1214
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,240
Kiss me.

1215
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,960
- No way.
- Just once.

1216
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,710
- I can't.
 - Joon Ah! 

1217
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:05,300
 Are you inside? 

1218
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,350
 - Joon Ah. 
- Yes?

1219
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,500
- What do we do?
- Oh, no.

1220
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:11,700
- Oh, no. What do I do?
- Yes, just a moment.

1221
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,320
- Hide, hide.
- Hide where?

1222
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,530
Wait.

1223
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:16,080
Aigoo.

1224
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,870
Oh, my!

1225
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:18,990
Hey...

1226
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:20,330
You're here.

1227
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,350
My gosh!

1228
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:27,300
Mom... Mom...

1229
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:31,950
What are you guys doing right now?

1230
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,180
- Joon Ah.
- Lee Hae Deun.

1231
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,960
- Yes, Mom.
- Mom...

1232
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,750
♫   Honey, baby, sweetie, darling, good!   ♫

1233
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:47,550
♫   It's good! It's very, very good   ♫

1234
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:54,780
♫   I totally fell for you   ♫

1235
01:04:54,780 --> 01:05:01,090
♫   It's perfect! You're truly perfect   ♫

1236
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:08,510
♫   It's a destiny like a present   ♫

1237
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:16,000
♫   The pretty face with a big big smile   ♫

1238
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,280
♫   It makes this man's heart to flutter   ♫

1239
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,200
 

1240
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,590
 I don't like you.
 My mom doesn't like you, either. 

1241
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:25,850
 I feel like reconsidering dating
 Jang Joon Ah, too. 

1242
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:27,740
 You. The director is talking to you. 

1243
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:30,080
 Why did you grab my hair? 

1244
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,880
 - I grabbed it by mistake!
- Switch! Switch! 

1245
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,870
 Chae Woon, you must be cold. 
Put this around your neck. 

1246
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:36,740
 Geez, I want a father-in-law, too. 

1247
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:38,460
 The jokbal place ahjussi is so lucky. 

1248
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:40,180
 Geez, I'm so jealous. 

1249
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,750
 Are you married? Do you have kids? 

1250
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,160
 I'm still single. 

1251
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,380
 - Oppa, do you live around here?
- I live in Samgwang Villa. 

1252
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:46,870
 Right over there. 

1253
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:49,300
 I think Mr. Woo noticed. 

1254
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:52,040
 That I want to get closer to you, Noona. 

1255
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,860
 How can you say that to Professor Son? 

1256
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:56,230
 Professor Son... 

1257
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:57,520
 Son Jung Hoo? 

1258
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,450
 - You a**hole!
- Na Ro. 

1259
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:02,410
 Seo Ah. 

1260
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:03,200
♫   Honey, baby, sweetie, darling, good!   ♫
