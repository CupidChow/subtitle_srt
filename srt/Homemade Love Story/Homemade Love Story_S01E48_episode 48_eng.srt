1
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,680
 Ahjumma! 

2
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,600
- Jung Hoo.
- Chae Woon.

3
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,700
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

4
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,630
Ouch.

5
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,220
Chae... Chae... Chae Woon.

6
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,510
Mother.

7
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,700
What? Did you two come together?

8
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,890
No.

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,660
Gosh.

10
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,510
I told you not to worry 
about my birthday!

11
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,190
Mother, it's not like that.

12
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,980
We ran into each other here.

13
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,820
We were both going to drop off 
our gifts at your door,

14
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,530
and we bumped into each other here.

15
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,420
Gosh, it's cold! Let's go!

16
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,580
Gosh, it's freezing!

17
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,340
Let's go in somewhere. 
Where should we go?

18
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,650
 
Oh, my. Who sent these?

19
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,620
It must be from Jae Hee.

20
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,040
Anyways, you guys are too much.

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,640
Why are you guys making
 a big fuss this year?

22
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,080
Now that you're here, what can I do?

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,900
Come in. Come in, Chae Woon.

24
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,150
Oh, well...

25
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,400
Look at the time. I have to 
get back to the office.

26
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,240
What do you mean?

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,530
I know you're trying to 
let us be alone. Come in.

28
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,190
No, for real.

29
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,140
This is your birthday gift from me.

30
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,300
Happy birthday, Mother.

31
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,800
- Be happy!
- Chae Woon!

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,660
- Chae Woon, be careful!
- Okay!

33
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,110
Be careful!

34
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,600
My gosh.

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
I feel bad sending her back like this.

36
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,980
You said you'd never come back here.

37
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,310
Well, plans could be modified.

38
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,880
Let's go inside.

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,050
Gosh.

40
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,890
- Hold these.
- Okay.

41
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,150
Aigoo.

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,580
Ouch...

43
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,040
Ow...

44
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,860
Your birthday gift.

45
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,870
I made it myself.

46
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,600
What?

47
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,800
Oh, my.

48
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,450
What in the world...

49
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,230
Aigoo, look at the stitches.

50
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,160
Look how crooked they are.

51
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,990
I didn't know.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,430
Didn't know what?

53
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,920
I had no idea that...

54
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,570
you kept a stuffed animal that 
I picked out of an arcade

55
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,210
as your birthday gift.

56
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,400
Gosh...

57
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,940
I was so happy back then.

58
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,880
I was happy because
 it was the first birthday gift

59
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,690
that you gave me.

60
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,040
But seeing how you were

61
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,540
so focused on trying to 
get that stuffed animal

62
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,100
was so unforgettable to me.

63
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,830
I thought, "It's not his fault 
that he's such a cheapskate.

64
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,730
It's because he grew up so poor,

65
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,580
and that's what made him that way."

66
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,540
I felt sad for you.

67
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll call this one Kamjiki 2.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,440
Stay together, you two.

69
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,790
I have a request.

70
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,470
What now?

71
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,280
Please...

72
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,330
give me one more chance.

73
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,870
What chance?

74
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,960
A chance for me to treat you better.

75
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,060
Oh, my.

76
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,010
You said you don't care 
about me anymore.

77
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,750
You told me to find a good man 
and have a nice life.

78
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,660
I did, but I changed my mind.

79
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,110
No...

80
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,830
Now, I know what I really think.

81
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,230
My heart wants to hang onto you.

82
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,730
My heart wants to
 try harder once more.

83
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,240
My gosh. Well...

84
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,210
You said you even have a girlfriend.

85
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,130
You know that's not true.

86
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,070
I won't put on a show anymore.

87
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,300
I...

88
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,800
don't want to lose you.

89
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,820
My goodness.

90
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,690
Well...

91
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,300
What now...

92
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,870
Please lose me.

93
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,430
I want to fly away.

94
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,240
Jung Min Jae.

95
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,890
Give me one last chance.

96
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,810
I want to try harder.

97
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,980
I won't hurt your feelings.

98
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,660
If you don't like me even after I tried,

99
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,920
I'll give you up completely.

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,490
So...

101
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,000
give me one more chance.

102
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,790
My gosh...

103
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,740
This is better.

104
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,410
Trying to appeal to me by saying,

105
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,590
"Please fly away..."

106
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,110
This is easier for me to reject you.

107
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,560
Reject?

108
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,210
Thank you for Kamjiki 2.

109
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,510
Oh, my. Your fingers...

110
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,230
Did you hurt yourself 
while making this?

111
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,180
Well, I'll get going now.

112
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,900
Min Jae, happy birthday.

113
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,640
Thanks, Oppa.

114
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,460
What in the world?

115
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,590
What's that noise?

116
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,140
Ouch...

117
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,220
Ouch...

118
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,800
Aigoo, Joon Ah!

119
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,590
What's wrong?

120
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,780
Aigoo...

121
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,930
I'm sorry, Mother. 
I was cleaning the ceiling.

122
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,860
Joon Ah!

123
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,220
Why are you doing this?

124
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,730
I told you not to do this.

125
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,030
I'm really sorry...

126
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,730
If you don't approve of us,

127
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,000
I won't leave until 
you give us your blessings.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,040
I apologize in advance. I'll be 
sorry in the future. I'm sorry.

129
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,960
Gosh, he keeps spewing nonsense.

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,330
Whoa. What is all this?

131
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,880
This?

132
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,270
I noticed that you were 
running low on kimchi.

133
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,410
So...

134
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,120
I thought I'd make some kimchi...

135
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,670
On my way here,

136
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,990
I bought some produce 
at the wholesale market.

137
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,120
To make some kimchi.

138
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,110
Joon Ah...

139
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,390
Do you even know how
 to make kimchi?

140
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,670
No. I don't know. I'll learn from you.

141
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,660
Seriously! Why are you doing this?

142
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,420
Get out, Joon Ah.

143
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,740
- Get out.
- I can't, Mother.

144
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,670
- I can't.
- Get out right now.

145
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,610
I can't, Mother.

146
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,020
Mother, how about these 
cabbages if I leave now?

147
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,590
Mother, even if I leave later,

148
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,140
I'll be sure to turn these 
cabbages into kimchi.

149
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,270
I'll rule over these cabbages and
 make them into kimchi.

150
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,010
I'll be in charge of providing 
kimchi at Samgwang Villa.

151
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,100
Please let me try just once.

152
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,200
Then I'll give you my entire life and...

153
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,060
I'll become the master kimchi maker.

154
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,570
I'll be the kimchi president, Mother!

155
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,130
I can't leave. I can't.

156
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,770
Geez, Joon Ah! Seriously!

157
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,710
What's wrong with you?

158
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,330
 

159
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,980
 I'm working hard at Samgwang Villa. 

160
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,250
 Are you doing a good job, Director Lee? 

161
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,180
 Of course, I'm doing a good job. 

162
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,390
 I'm getting closer to the CEO. 

163
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,370
 

164
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,310
Lee Hae Deun.

165
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,650
Were you waiting here all this time?

166
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,500
Yes. Chief Goo told me 
that you picked me.

167
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,550
Thank you! I'll do my best!

168
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,640
I reviewed the styling book
 that you slipped in,

169
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,970
and I thought you were pretty good. 
That's why I picked you.

170
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,090
No other reason.

171
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,350
Yes.

172
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,650
I'll do my best.

173
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,600
I'll be your shadow...

174
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,240
They don't look alike.

175
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,030
They don't look alike at all.

176
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,980
Let's just go.

177
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,770
That's too rude. 
What would I say to her?

178
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,410
I have to hold back. Just go to work.

179
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,780
Auntie must miss Uncle Hwak Se.

180
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,550
I don't think so.

181
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,360
- Looks like she wants a fight.
- Again?

182
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,500
Let's go.

183
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,050
I think there's one remaining 
from yesterday. Right?

184
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,290
Green onions, potatoes, and...

185
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,090
Oh, Jjung-a.

186
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,150
Hello.

187
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,250
Well, I'm not...

188
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,360
the type to ignore things 
or hide my feelings.

189
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,370
I'm not the type to play coy.

190
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,180
I'd like you two to be 
honest and tell me.

191
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,720
Wait...

192
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,000
Jjung-a, I told you last time.

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,750
- Eun Ji and I are...
- Yes, you told me!

194
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,630
You said nothing is going 
on between you two.

195
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,860
- Yes.
- Yup.

196
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,310
I believed you, but...

197
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,570
Let's just go.

198
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,670
We have to stop them
 if they get into a fight.

199
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,380
Yeah. Okay.

200
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,780
But I heard you came here
 to find your son, Eun Ji.

201
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,490
Yes.

202
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,790
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,100
I pestered my sister so much

204
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,460
that she had no choice but to tell me.

205
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,070
And I promised my sister that 
I wouldn't talk about this with you here.

206
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,550
But I'm breaking that promise, and...

207
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,650
I know full well that 
this is out of line, but...

208
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,860
Hwak Se.

209
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,150
You really had no idea that 
Eun Ji had a baby?

210
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,680
I did know something about that, but...

211
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,450
Eun Ji, I didn't know you came
 here to look for your son.

212
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,690
I'm sorry, Oppa. I just couldn't tell you.

213
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,460
Why would you be sorry about that?

214
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,040
When you two are nothing. 
Is that something to be sorry about?

215
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,330
Huh?

216
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,540
You really didn't know?

217
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,650
I really didn't know.

218
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,760
You didn't know the one 
she's looking for is Ra Hoon?

219
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,800
 Ra Hoon... 

220
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,770
 Ra Hoon? 

221
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,500
 Hey, Eun Ji. 

222
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,320
 Tell me. Ra... Really? 

223
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,800
Is Ra Hoon your son?

224
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,970
It's not definite yet.

225
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,140
At the time, there were two boys 
who came to Sunny Orphanage.

226
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,460
I heard one of them was Ra Hoon.

227
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,960
Then Ra Hoon could be 
your son. Isn't that right?

228
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,530
 - Hwak Se.
- Yes? 

229
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,080
How come you look just like Ra Hoon?

230
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,100
What in the world are you talking about?

231
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,740
Then Jjung-a...

232
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,840
Jjung-a, you think that I'm...

233
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,150
Are you saying I'm Ra Hoon's dad...

234
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,150
You look so much alike.

235
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,180
Jjung-a...

236
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,860
It's a shock to me that Eun Ji 
came to look for Ra Hoon.

237
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,370
Are you asking if I'm his dad?

238
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,580
Isn't he?

239
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,020
Are you sure he's not the one? 
Just say it. Is he?

240
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,620
He's not, Man Jung.

241
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,350
Hwak Se oppa and I 
are not like that. Never.

242
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,410
We're just hometown friends. 
So we were close.

243
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,780
The baby's dad is...

244
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,790
someone Hwak Se oppa knows as well.

245
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,470
You know him, too?

246
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,650
I'm really sorry...

247
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,210
I apologize.

248
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,580
I know this is a crazy thing
 for me to do, but...

249
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,110
I couldn't even sleep and...

250
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,230
Hwak Se and Ra Hoon seem
 to look so much alike.

251
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,060
I couldn't stop thinking about it,

252
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,200
and I couldn't focus on work.

253
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,590
I came here because
 I thought I was going crazy.

254
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,930
I'm really sorry, Eun Ji.

255
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,010
I'm really, really sorry.

256
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,600
No. Don't be...

257
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,280
Don't be. I understand.

258
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,270
It's okay.

259
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,960
Gosh, I'm really sorry.

260
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,990
Hwak Se, I'm really sorry.

261
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,990
Gosh, no.

262
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,420
But...

263
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,160
Then...

264
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,140
shouldn't you get 
a DNA test with Ra Hoon

265
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,290
and move things along?

266
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,300
- That's right.
- No.

267
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,260
No, I'd feel...

268
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,920
too ashamed to face 
Ra Hoon to do that.

269
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,690
I can't face him at all.

270
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,090
I just came...

271
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,780
because I wanted to see him.

272
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,610
 So please... 

273
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,740
 keep this a secret. I beg you. 

274
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,370
 We should keep this secret. 

275
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm really sorry.

276
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,700
It was really my bad.

277
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,640
You two look so much alike.

278
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,850
Once I started thinking that, 
I just went nuts.

279
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,730
You two seemed like father and son.

280
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,910
I'm sorry...

281
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,430
It was really wrong of me.

282
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,940
My Jjung-a...

283
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,460
you're so suspicious and 
worry so much.

284
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,830
It's all because of 
your love for me, right?

285
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,360
Of course, it's because I love you.

286
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,680
I love you so much, and I'm 
afraid you might go away.

287
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,180
Even if Ra Hoon is your soon,

288
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,330
I was ready to accept that 
when I brought that up.

289
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,020
I just wanted you to tell me the truth.

290
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,930
Whether I'm an aunt 
or mom, it's similar.

291
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,740
That's how I felt when
 I brought that up.

292
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,280
- I'm sorry...
- All right.

293
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,360
I understand everything.

294
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,070
So from now on, trust me...

295
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,310
and stay with me and trust me.

296
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,380
Got it?

297
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,150
So you'll forgive me?

298
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,680
Of course.

299
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,130
Thank you.

300
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,820
Lee Ra Hoon.

301
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,450
Are you okay?

302
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,330
Ba Reun.

303
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,720
Yeah.

304
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,730
What we heard earlier...

305
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,210
Let's keep it to ourselves.

306
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,140
Let's not tell my mom, Auntie, and Uncle.

307
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,360
Got it?

308
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,330
But still...

309
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,880
shouldn't we talk to
 your mother and that lady?

310
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,930
She said it's not for sure.

311
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,100
I'm sure that's why my mom 
hasn't said anything to me.

312
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,990
Chae Woon noona...

313
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,240
also went through this a lot 
before, and she struggled a lot.

314
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,050
Mom must be worried about that.

315
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,080
I do, too.

316
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,050
Okay.

317
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,850
Are you crying?

318
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,600
No...

319
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,200
Don't cry.

320
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,490
It's okay.

321
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,270
You came fast, Chae Woon.

322
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,790
Did dad say that?

323
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,520
Yeah. I was so shocked.

324
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,600
How did Mom react?

325
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,680
Did they argue or anything like that?

326
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,730
No. Don't worry. They didn't argue.

327
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,800
But Jae Hee.

328
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,550
This is just my hunch.

329
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,680
It didn't seem like Mother disliked it.

330
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,780
Since Father barged in 
while she was on the spot,

331
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,960
it seemed like she was relieved.

332
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,760
Gosh...

333
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,200
There's just no way to 
know how they both feel.

334
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,210
It'd be nice for us to help them out.

335
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,440
When are you going to
 see your father?

336
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,250
Aren't you going to stop
 by the store?

337
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,640
Why should I go? I don't
 really want to go there.

338
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,320
Geez. Come on. What do you mean
 you don't want to go there?

339
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,350
I mean it. I...

340
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,530
just left that jacket there because
 the weather was so cold.

341
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,200
Anyways...

342
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,990
You and my parents are so similar.

343
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,680
You say "No way," 
but you don't really mean it.

344
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,510
You're like that, too, Jae Hee.

345
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,940
Geez. No, I'm not.

346
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,530
Yes, you are.

347
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,180
Wait.

348
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,180
Yes, leave it there!

349
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,200
Ta-da!

350
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,600
What?

351
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,030
I thought you'd be hungry, Moong-i.
 I ordered it in advance.

352
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,890
Whoa, so sensible.

353
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,400
There.

354
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,130
Thank you.

355
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,900
I'm starving.

356
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,850
- So tasty.
- Is it?

357
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,800
Geez...

358
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:12,190
Gosh, for the sake of 
Chae Woon and Jae Hee,

359
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,840
I should stop hating Park Pil Hong

360
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,890
and embrace him.

361
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,800
Gosh, he's so pitiful.

362
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,740
Right...

363
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,650
I was also thinking...

364
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,610
that I should take him out 
for dinner sometime.

365
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,500
And here you are calling me about it.

366
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,670
Gosh, why go out?

367
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,480
Just come here.

368
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,690
I'll prepare dinner tonight.

369
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,480
It'll be too much work for you.

370
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,890
I feel bad.

371
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,930
It's not too much for me at all.

372
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,210
I even have a helper in my house.

373
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,020
Yes, Mother, I'll work hard.

374
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,660
Gosh, this is so fun.

375
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,270
Gosh.

376
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,020
Hello.

377
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,650
Aigoo, Soon Jung.

378
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,630
Is the store doing well?

379
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,820
Yes, I'm getting more orders 
thanks to word of mouth.

380
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,860
That's good.

381
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,490
I brought you some side dishes.

382
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,200
Enjoy them when you 
have your meals.

383
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,060
Aigoo, you didn't have to.

384
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,800
Gosh, thank you.

385
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,080
And are you free later tonight?

386
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,560
Of course, I have so much 
time in my hands.

387
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,130
Since you live in the neighborhood,

388
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,700
I'd like to have you over for dinner.

389
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,600
If you have time, come and 
have dinner with us.

390
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,760
Gosh, it's okay, Soon Jung.

391
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,210
I'm grateful for this.

392
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,300
Actually...

393
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,050
it wasn't an easy decision

394
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,570
for me to invite you over.

395
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,490
But now that you run your store here,

396
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,280
we should try to get along
 for the sake of our kids.

397
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,280
If Seo Yeon finds out...

398
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,820
I'm scared.

399
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,990
In-law, don't be like that 
and go with me. Okay?

400
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,640
Mr. Woo.

401
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,240
Do that, okay?

402
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,740
So...

403
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:28,550
I'm thinking of letting Hwang Na Ro 
and Seo Ah get engaged.

404
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,650
Mom...

405
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,810
Why don't you give it more 
time to think about it?

406
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,420
Seo Yeon.

407
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,850
You're worried, too, right?

408
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
Well...

409
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,910
I...

410
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,540
- Mom, Hwang Na Ro is actually...
- I know, too.

411
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,320
There are some questionable
 aspects about Hwang Na Ro.

412
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,130
That's why I hesitated for a long time.

413
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,690
But as long as he doesn't cause
 any problems in the future,

414
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,260
and as long as Seo Ah can be happy...

415
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:10,020
I decided to bury it all and move on.

416
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,800
Joon Ah.

417
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,180
Aigoo, are you feeling all right?

418
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,330
You look tired.

419
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,040
No, Mother. I'm not tired at all.

420
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,740
I'm full of energy, Mother.

421
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,160
Gosh, really.

422
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,580
You got me, Joon Ah. I give up.

423
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,590
- Gosh.
- Really?

424
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,180
 I did it. 

425
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,750
 I'm almost there. 

426
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,230
 Mother's heart is starting to waver. 

427
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,760
 Let's try harder, Joon Ah. 

428
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,690
Mother, since you're giving in...

429
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,790
why don't you hug me and like me?

430
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,350
My gosh.

431
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,080
I don't think so.

432
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,370
Please make it happen for us, Mother.

433
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,680
In-law, we're here.

434
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,190
Aigoo...

435
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,100
You're here. Welcome.

436
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,600
We must've come too early.

437
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,860
Aigoo, no.

438
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,260
It's nice that you came early.

439
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,690
Father.

440
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,620
Joon Ah, what are you doing here?

441
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,030
What are you wearing?

442
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,260
I'm training as Mother's assistant.

443
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,880
What?

444
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,220
Hello. I've heard a lot about you.

445
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,120
You're Bit Chae Woon's father.

446
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,950
Aigoo, no wonder we kept bumping 
into each other because of our connection.

447
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,060
Yeah, I know.

448
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,640
I'm still hurting from the time
 you flipped me over.

449
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,830
Really?

450
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,090
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

451
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,670
I'm kidding.

452
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,860
Gosh.

453
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,910
Joon Ah is perfectly fine.

454
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,640
Come and sit down over here.

455
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,880
Yes...

456
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,340
Bring us some tea.

457
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,450
Tea?

458
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,760
Tea! I'll bring it out right away.

459
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,420
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

460
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,900
We got it.

461
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,510
In-law...

462
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,900
You still enjoy reading novels?

463
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,600
Yes, I still love it.

464
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,830
Do you enjoy reading novels?

465
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,990
- Yes.
- Of course.

466
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,090
In-law used to dream of becoming
 a novelist at one time.

467
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,670
Oh, I remember it, too.

468
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,310
My Jung Won told me.

469
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,200
That you used to dream of 
becoming a writer as a girl.

470
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,690
My goodness.

471
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,340
How embarrassing.

472
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,490
So did you give up on that dream?

473
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,190
Of course.

474
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,120
What would I do now?

475
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,490
Why not?

476
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,830
Go for it even now.

477
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,520
That's right, Mother.

478
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,860
Lots of people become writers
 late in years nowadays.

479
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,980
Go for it. I think you'll do great.

480
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,090
Gosh, no.

481
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,550
Try it, Soon Jung.

482
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,120
I still sew, you know.

483
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,690
Yes.

484
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:35,510
So that it was worth buying you
 a Korean dictionary way back when.

485
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,920
You gave her a Korean dictionary?

486
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,320
Here comes your tea.

487
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,140
Mother, we're here!

488
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,440
- Mom, I'm here.
- Hi, Jae Hee, you're here.

489
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,690
- Aigoo, a long day, huh?
- Welcome, Chae Woon.

490
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,310
Hi, Father.

491
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,120
- Hi, Chae Woon.
- Hi.

492
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,200
You had a hard time prepping
 for dinner, huh, Mother?

493
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,490
Gosh, it was okay since
 I had an assistant.

494
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,390
But what are you doing here?

495
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,820
Don't talk to me. Please.

496
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,490
Aigoo...

497
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,840
Mom.

498
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,680
Why did you invite him 
without talking to me?

499
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,630
Chae Woon...

500
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,320
Had I asked you,

501
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,710
I'm sure you would've opposed the idea.

502
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,380
That's right.

503
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,120
Chae Woon.

504
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,000
Park Pil Hong now lives
 in our neighborhood.

505
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,650
We can't just ignore him.

506
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,540
Chae Woon.

507
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,080
I know your heart is split.

508
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,500
I know that you really hate him, but

509
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,630
you feel sorry for him 
on the other hand.

510
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,850
Since he came over tonight,

511
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,400
let's have him relax and 
enjoy dinner. Okay?

512
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,760
And Hae Deun happened to 
be cleaning up all by herself.

513
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,400
When I saw that, I was so touched.

514
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,430
She's so pretty and has
 a heart of gold...

515
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,450
I've never seen anyone
 like her before.

516
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,830
Stop it now. How much 
more will you brag?

517
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,030
How much more, huh?

518
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,390
Are you going to be like that? Father, Jae Hee
 called me up all drunk recently

519
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,110
- and said he loves you so much...
- Hey, hey...

520
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,900
- but he doesn't know how to express it.
- Hey, hey!

521
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,660
- Do you know about that?
- Did he?

522
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,490
Aigoo, thank you for dinner, In-law.

523
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,200
Thank you.

524
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,950
- I'll serve tea.
- Okay.

525
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,500
Well, I'll get going first.

526
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,610
Why? Have some fruit and go with me.

527
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,100
Yes, please.

528
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,490
Yes, have some fruit before you go.

529
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,400
I left the store empty too long.

530
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,740
Thank you so much for dinner.

531
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,780
Thank you.

532
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,490
Thanks, Jae Hee.

533
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,310
Good work, Joon Ah.

534
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,780
Goodnight, Father.

535
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,600
In-law...

536
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,910
- Chae Woon.
 - No, no.

537
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,820
Jae Hee, don't come out. It's cold.

538
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,360
Bye now.

539
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,770
Chae Woon...

540
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,940
Um...

541
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,470
Seo Yeon.

542
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,870
Why don't you have
 some fruit before you go?

543
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,700
No. I'm stuffed. 
I don't have to eat fruit.

544
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,920
And thank you so much for this.

545
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,660
I never wore a nice jacket 
like this. It's so warm.

546
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,990
It's so warm that it makes me sweat.

547
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,520
And...

548
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,760
thanks for inviting me
 to dinner tonight.

549
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,150
Go in. It's cold.

550
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,780
Wait...

551
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,300
I'll have you over...

552
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,210
to our house sometime as well.

553
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,990
No, tonight was enough.

554
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,260
I'm so grateful and feel bad that 
you even had me over tonight.

555
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,160
Be sure not to skip meals.

556
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,700
Okay, thanks.

557
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,180
You, too.

558
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,870
Dad...

559
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,350
This is crazy.

560
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,930
 

561
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,540
Oh, my God!

562
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,680
Hae Deun.

563
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,430
CEO, are you finished with everything?

564
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,950
Hae Deun, why are you
 sitting here like this?

565
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,410
I told everyone to go home earlier.

566
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,450
You have two meetings
 offsite tomorrow.

567
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,310
You have a magazine interview, too.

568
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,080
I wanted to select your outfits.

569
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,020
I'm your stylist, you know.

570
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,720
How about dinner? Did you eat?

571
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,090
No. I'm hungry.

572
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,970
Whoa, you have a separate 
dressing room?

573
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,420
I love clothes.

574
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,190
It will be convenient for you to stylize.

575
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,320
I don't think so.

576
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,920
Why not?

577
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,340
All your clothes are so
 high quality and distinctive.

578
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,890
It could be difficult to stylize.

579
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,070
But it's not consistent in style concepts.

580
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,190
I thought you were good
 with expressions, but

581
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,140
you just prefer expensive items...

582
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,870
Select a few items for my outfit

583
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,540
and let's eat.

584
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,860
Okay.

585
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,720
 Don't come tomorrow. 

586
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,290
 - Understand? 
- Yes? No.

587
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,720
I don't know what you're talking about. 
See you tomorrow.

588
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,260
Geez, I'm so tired.

589
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,790
Ow, it stings. What's this?

590
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,580
It must be eczema.

591
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,170
Wait a minute.

592
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,270
Since I'm here, should I wait 
and see Director Lee?

593
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,760
She should be here soon.

594
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,800
Thank you for dinner.

595
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,380
- Where is the CEO?
- She's in the library.

596
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,680
She said she's working. She said 
to go ahead without saying bye.

597
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,840
- Ah, okay.
- She said to go in her car.

598
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,520
No, it's okay. I can take a taxi.

599
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,610
- Good night.
- Bye.

600
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,700
Should I wait and see Mr. Makjang
 since I'm here already?

601
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,590
Okay, raise your glass...

602
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,950
and to Ra Hoon's healthy military life!

603
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,950
 Cheers! 

604
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,000
Hey, Cha Ba Reun.

605
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,720
You can't turn your back on him, okay?

606
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,490
Lee Ra Hoon, you know what happens
 if you betray me, right?

607
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,300
- I won't.
- Oh, that could happen, too.

608
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,000
That's right. Stay alert.

609
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,400
- He could turn his back.
- No, Auntie.

610
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,620
No?

611
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,420
Ra Hoon would never do that.

612
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,120
Thank you, Uncle.

613
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,400
Thanks, Auntie.

614
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,620
I'm sure you'd want to spend
 every minute together.

615
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,910
Sorry to take away your time together.

616
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,870
No, Auntie. We love this.

617
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,000
You love this? Oh, really?

618
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,130
Gosh, my Ra Hoon.

619
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:17,070
Gosh, our youngest. He's the cutie pie. 
He's just a baby. What do we do?

620
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,720
Gosh, I didn't get to treat you well.

621
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,530
Auntie, what do you mean?

622
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,130
You were so good to me.

623
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,890
I know everything, Auntie.

624
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,770
Gosh, when he was little...

625
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,000
What's wrong with me?

626
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,340
When Ra Hoon was little,

627
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,640
he used to get sick so often.

628
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,430
The family was so worried about you.

629
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,780
Now you're all grown up. 
You're going to the military now.

630
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,000
My gosh...

631
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,700
I was exhausted from
 buying him medicine.

632
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,060
That's right.

633
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,670
Thank you, Uncle.

634
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,190
All right, all right. No more tears.

635
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,060
Now, now. Let's have fun tonight.

636
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,490
Let's have fun and be happy.

637
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:03,560
To that end, I'll sing a song.

638
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,130
Kim Hwak Se!

639
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,020
Kim Hwak Se!

640
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,330
♫  As I leave my home...  ♫

641
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,740
Geez, Uncle.

642
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,020
All right. I'll sing on stage.

643
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,000
- Really?
- Wow, Uncle.

644
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,650
This is a special event for you.

645
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,410
Kim Hwak Se!

646
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,570
Hello, everyone. I'm Kim Hwak Se.

647
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,600
My nephew Ra Hoon is 
going to the military.

648
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,780
Thanks to your understanding,

649
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,670
I get to dedicate this song
 to my nephew.

650
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,040
Thank you!

651
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:43,200
♫   It's good! Ra Hoon is very good   ♫

652
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:51,090
♫  You're really a handsome nephew  ♫

653
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:58,300
♫   The handsome face is 
Ra Hoon's face  ♫

654
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,900
♫  As you wait...  ♫

655
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,840
Ra Hoon.

656
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,589
- Hello.
- Hello.

657
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:39,669
Thank you for the coffee.

658
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:41,369
Sure.

659
00:34:49,229 --> 00:34:53,889
 Could she be my birth mom? 

660
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:56,379
 If she really is, 

661
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:59,409
 this is what my birth mom looks like. 

662
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:02,499
 I was dying to know. 

663
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:14,299
I'm going to the military soon.

664
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,799
Yes, I heard from your mother.

665
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:19,799
It's still winter...

666
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:21,659
It will be so cold.

667
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:24,199
It's okay.

668
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,799
I heard you used to get...

669
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,999
sick a lot as a kid.

670
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:36,579
I was frail.

671
00:35:37,989 --> 00:35:40,019
I'm very healthy now.

672
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:41,729
Is that so?

673
00:35:41,729 --> 00:35:43,749
That's good.

674
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:52,209
Ra Hoon, you're so handsome.

675
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:55,339
You make a great impression.

676
00:35:56,569 --> 00:35:58,219
Thank you.

677
00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:05,159
I should close up the store.

678
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:10,979
Thank you for the coffee.

679
00:36:10,979 --> 00:36:12,739
- I'll get going now.
- Okay.

680
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:14,679
Go home safely, Ra Hoon.

681
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:22,859
Excuse me...

682
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:25,739
If you're going to the bus stop,

683
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:28,199
it's good to walk by the 
convenience store.

684
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,339
Lots of people are there. It's safer.

685
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:31,479
Okay.

686
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:35,599
- Would you like me to walk you?
- No thanks.

687
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,399
I'm okay.

688
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:38,769
Go on.

689
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:40,529
Thank you.

690
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:42,879
Sure.

691
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:44,459
Good night.

692
00:37:46,499 --> 00:37:49,199
Oppa, have breakfast.

693
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,089
Oppa!

694
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:54,799
Geez...

695
00:37:57,089 --> 00:37:58,759
Jang Joon Ah.

696
00:37:59,669 --> 00:38:01,859
Geez, I said eat!

697
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:05,459
Lee Hae Deun!

698
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:07,069
What are you doing here?

699
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:09,789
Oh, I must've dozed off.

700
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,199
Dozed off?

701
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,949
It's morning!

702
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,279
Lee Hae Deun.

703
00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:17,509
It's morning?

704
00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:19,269
Gosh, I'm sorry!

705
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:20,499
I'm sorry!

706
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:23,469
♫   It's good! It's good!   ♫

707
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,729
Oh, my God! Oh, my!

708
00:38:25,729 --> 00:38:27,499
Joon...

709
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:29,739
Why are you coming out 
of there, Joon Ah?

710
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,309
Good morning, Uncle.

711
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,479
- I'll go now.
- Wait...

712
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:38,889
Joon Ah, what are you doing here?

713
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:42,799
By chance, did you sleep
 in there last night?

714
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:45,039
I wanted to see Hae Deun before I go, 
and I was waiting.

715
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,169
I dozed off.

716
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:48,389
Gosh, come on.

717
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,729
Hush. It's your mom.

718
00:38:55,819 --> 00:38:57,849
Yes, CEO.

719
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:00,159
Hae Deun slept over there?

720
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,739
 - Mom! 
- Is it Hae Deun?

721
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,959
 Hae Deun noona didn't
 come home last night! 

722
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:05,199
Be quiet.

723
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:07,729
 Yeah. 

724
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:11,039
Hae Deun came to my house for work

725
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:13,959
and fell asleep while 
waiting for Joon Ah.

726
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:16,009
Director Lee! You fell 
asleep there, Hae Deun!

727
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:18,279
I fell asleep here, Hae Deun! 
What do we do?

728
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:21,719
Mr. Makjang! I wanted to 
see you before I leave...

729
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,299
- Aigoo...
- Really? Don't cry. Don't cry.

730
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:28,889
Hae Deun, don't cry. Don't cry.

731
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:30,799
Never cry. We'll meet again soon. Okay?

732
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:33,449
Don't cry. Don't cry, Hae Deun.

733
00:39:33,499 --> 00:39:35,199
Dad...

734
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:38,019
Father, then...

735
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:41,129
did you have a complete
 change of heart?

736
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,569
Yes.

737
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:44,419
Starting today, I'll start over

738
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:49,189
from the starting point and work 
on holding onto Jung Min Jae's heart.

739
00:39:49,189 --> 00:39:53,049
But don't you think you're 
in over your head?

740
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:55,729
Punk, you should be cheering me on.

741
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:58,379
Father, I cheer you on passionately.

742
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:01,469
But you know...

743
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:04,139
since you've made up your mind,

744
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:08,899
I think you need a different 
strategic approach.

745
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:12,399
What type of strategic approach?

746
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:14,499
Well, I guess...

747
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:17,449
you need to show her that

748
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,639
you've completely changed.

749
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:24,619
So what disappointed Mother
 about your behavior in the past?

750
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:28,069
And what attracted her to that 
professor across the hallway?

751
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:31,209
We should thoroughly 
analyze those points.

752
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:33,749
I see...

753
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:36,069
Gosh, Chae Woon, I think that's 
too much, in my opinion.

754
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:38,889
There's no end to that 
analysis because...

755
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:41,679
Father's behaviors, 
eating habits, personality.

756
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,309
- Too many things that Mom hates.
- Hey, you!

757
00:40:45,499 --> 00:40:47,219
Now...

758
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:48,979
let's not make this too hard.

759
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:52,109
Just think, "A journey of a thousand miles
 begins with a single step."

760
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:54,779
I think you could start today.

761
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:58,689
Then will you help me, Chae Woon?

762
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,269
Of course, Father!

763
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:01,309
Let's go!

764
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:02,609
Let's go!

765
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:04,969
Saying "Let's go" isn't going
 to resolve this.

766
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:06,199
Hey, man.

767
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:08,169
Eat.

768
00:41:08,169 --> 00:41:09,419
Gosh. Okay.

769
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:21,849
I should dress in brighter 
colors like that tall guy.

770
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:24,319
How come everything is so gloomy?

771
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:30,479
 Father. 

772
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:33,169
Yeah. Come in, Chae Woon.

773
00:41:39,149 --> 00:41:43,229
Father, you were thinking about 
what to wear today, right?

774
00:41:43,229 --> 00:41:45,569
How did you know that?

775
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:48,359
That's why I brought you these.

776
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:51,079
These are Jae Hee's old clothes.

777
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:52,299
Huh?

778
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:54,769
Aigoo.

779
00:41:56,109 --> 00:42:00,329
Would I... would I be able to
 look good in these?

780
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:04,059
You must look good, Father.

781
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:06,209
Do you know what a great 
dresser Professor Son is?

782
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:07,679
Got it, man.

783
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:10,009
Aigoo.

784
00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:12,809
Wow, I'm embarrassed...

785
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:14,379
You'll look good in this.

786
00:42:14,379 --> 00:42:16,059
- How bright.
- Aigoo...

787
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:21,109
- Oh, my!
- Good morning!

788
00:42:22,259 --> 00:42:24,739
Oh, my. Jung Hoo...

789
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:27,049
What are you doing this
 early in the morning?

790
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:30,449
Jung Min Jae, I'll drive 
you to your store.

791
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:34,159
It's okay. I'll just go.

792
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:37,719
From now on, I'll drive you 
to work every morning.

793
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:41,039
I want to do everything for you 
that I haven't done before.

794
00:42:42,399 --> 00:42:44,529
I'm fine, though...

795
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:49,999
I'm regretting a lot all the
 wrongs I've done to you.

796
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:52,369
I'll do much better than
 that from now on.

797
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:56,899
Just as I gifted you Kamjiki 2,

798
00:42:56,899 --> 00:43:00,879
just think of me as the 
newborn Woo Jung Hoo 2.

799
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:04,799
So give me one more chance.

800
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,329
What the heck?

801
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:11,239
Let's go, Jung Min Jae.

802
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,099
Oh, my goodness.

803
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:15,679
♫  I love you  ♫

804
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:17,879
- Let's go.
- My gosh.

805
00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:21,539
♫  I only trust you  ♫

806
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:23,359
My gosh.

807
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,839
♫  As we change as the time passes  ♫

808
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,199
Jung Min Jae.

809
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:28,919
Let's have lunch together.

810
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,099
Did you wait for me here?

811
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:34,199
- It's freezing.
- It's not freezing.

812
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:37,409
What do you mean? You're shivering.

813
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:39,849
I'm not shivering because I'm cold.

814
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:44,199
- Gosh.
 - Let's go.

815
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:46,599
All right.

816
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:48,149
I'll go separately.

817
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:50,599
Enjoy your lunch.

818
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:51,869
Let's go.

819
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:53,209
My goodness...

820
00:43:57,739 --> 00:43:59,209
- Hwak Se.
- Yes.

821
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:01,139
Eun Ji left?

822
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,429
Yes.

823
00:44:02,429 --> 00:44:03,609
My gosh...

824
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:07,199
It looks like she left you a letter.

825
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:18,089
 Ms. Lee, I'm sorry for
 not saying goodbye. 

826
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:20,799
 I got a call earlier. 

827
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:23,469
 I think the boy who was
 adopted to the US 

828
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:26,229
 is probably my birth son. 

829
00:44:27,229 --> 00:44:29,879
 I'm sorry for disturbing you 
while I was there. 

830
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:34,009
 I don't know how to
 repay the debt I owe you. 

831
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:36,699
 I'm sorry... 

832
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:38,719
 and thank you. 

833
00:44:39,879 --> 00:44:42,299
My gosh. That's so strange.

834
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,819
I know.

835
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:47,539
She says another boy has 
been confirmed as her son.

836
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,679
Why would she feel bad, be thankful to you,
 and be sorry? I don't get it.

837
00:44:55,819 --> 00:44:57,139
Ra Hoon.

838
00:44:59,669 --> 00:45:01,119
Ra Hoon.

839
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:04,909
The lady who used to work here...

840
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:06,769
Did she leave?

841
00:45:09,689 --> 00:45:11,219
Yeah.

842
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:14,059
I think she left for another job.

843
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,459
Ra Hoon.

844
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:26,209
By chance...

845
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:28,959
Mom...

846
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:33,199
Ra Hoon...

847
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,159
Mom.

848
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:37,959
- Ra Hoon.
- Mom...

849
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:47,509
Mom...

850
00:45:53,399 --> 00:45:57,869
So are we beginning the construction 
of the smart clothing research center?

851
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:00,519
Yes, I think it's possible to begin 
as soon as next month.

852
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:03,439
I contacted all the researchers 
who are top in this field.

853
00:46:03,439 --> 00:46:06,759
Everyone is showing 
positive responses.

854
00:46:06,759 --> 00:46:10,369
Our stock prices are going up as people
 are finding out about our project.

855
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:12,799
Our corporate image is 
improving as well.

856
00:46:12,799 --> 00:46:14,719
I heard this morning.

857
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:16,309
That's great.

858
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:19,819
Good job, Hwang Na Ro.

859
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,119
Thank you.

860
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:28,099
What?

861
00:46:34,979 --> 00:46:36,119
Um...

862
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:38,399
Mom.

863
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:39,689
Yeah?

864
00:46:46,149 --> 00:46:48,549
 
 About our engagement party...

865
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:52,409
I was wondering how this
 place would be for it.

866
00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:55,509
Only with your permission, Mom.

867
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:03,639
I'd like to keep it simple.

868
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:05,579
As a family gathering.

869
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,629
I think it's nice.

870
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:22,669
Mom...

871
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,009
Then...

872
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:29,799
you approve?

873
00:47:37,919 --> 00:47:39,999
Thank you, Mom.

874
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:42,909
Thank you so much.

875
00:47:44,439 --> 00:47:46,209
Thank you, CEO!

876
00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:09,779
Bit Chae Woon.

877
00:48:14,249 --> 00:48:16,309
CEO...

878
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:19,119
gave us her blessings for 
our engagement party.

879
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,429
Really?

880
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:24,699
Well...

881
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:29,399
thank you for covering up for

882
00:48:29,399 --> 00:48:30,959
various incidents.

883
00:48:33,769 --> 00:48:35,799
I didn't cover up for you.

884
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:37,409
I'm keeping an eye on you.

885
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,839
I'll be good to the CEO.

886
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:52,899
Yes, CEO.

887
00:48:52,899 --> 00:48:54,639
Yes.

888
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:02,879
 

889
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:10,199
 Hwang Na Ro? 

890
00:49:11,269 --> 00:49:12,579
You...

891
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:14,769
 Are you shocked? 

892
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:20,609
 You're shocked. 

893
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:23,469
You thought I'd be sitting in jail 
after you snitched on me,

894
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:25,139
but I'm perfectly fine.

895
00:49:26,019 --> 00:49:27,649
What happened to you?

896
00:49:28,729 --> 00:49:30,149
What do you mean?

897
00:49:30,149 --> 00:49:32,859
I used my guys and faked you out.

898
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,669
 Hey. 

899
00:49:34,669 --> 00:49:37,169
 Do you think I'm a moron? 

900
00:49:37,169 --> 00:49:39,649
 Do you think I'd get caught that easily? 

901
00:49:39,649 --> 00:49:40,909
Hey, Prof. Kim.

902
00:49:40,909 --> 00:49:43,299
Where are you right now? Let's meet.

903
00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:46,329
Forget it, man. The ship has sailed.

904
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:48,519
Only brutal punishment...

905
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:52,259
awaits you.

906
00:49:53,609 --> 00:49:54,839
Hey, Prof. Kim.

907
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:55,989
Hey!

908
00:49:58,179 --> 00:49:59,489
S***.

909
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:01,089
 

910
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,569
S***...

911
00:50:08,349 --> 00:50:10,089
  The customer is not answering the phone. 

912
00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:11,479
Na Ro.

913
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:15,249
Seo Ah.

914
00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:18,019
What's wrong? Is something the matter?

915
00:50:18,819 --> 00:50:19,959
No.

916
00:50:19,959 --> 00:50:21,609
Are you going to your office?

917
00:50:21,609 --> 00:50:23,119
Let's go. I'll walk you over.

918
00:50:26,179 --> 00:50:27,549
 

919
00:50:31,659 --> 00:50:34,839
I lost in the end.

920
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:38,639
After I approved Seo Ah's relationship,

921
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,939
I thought of you.

922
00:50:40,939 --> 00:50:45,359
I thought I'd feel better 
when I see your face.

923
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,369
That's why I asked you to come.

924
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:52,089
You did well.

925
00:50:53,689 --> 00:50:56,399
I'm sure Seo Ah knows how you feel.

926
00:50:56,399 --> 00:50:59,289
She knows what a tough 
decision it was for you.

927
00:51:00,379 --> 00:51:02,799
Seo Ah will try hard, Mom.

928
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:11,149
Yes.

929
00:51:15,419 --> 00:51:19,049
 
This came for you, CEO.

930
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:25,159
What could it be?

931
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:21,039
Seo Yeon...

932
00:52:22,429 --> 00:52:23,849
What, Mom?

933
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:54,879
Ttak Bae.

934
00:52:54,879 --> 00:52:57,469
Do you know where Prof. Kim is or not?

935
00:53:01,099 --> 00:53:02,499
Got it.

936
00:53:04,479 --> 00:53:05,729
S***...

937
00:53:12,779 --> 00:53:13,759
 

938
00:53:13,759 --> 00:53:16,069
 Come to my office right now. 

939
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:17,859
 Don't tell Seo Ah. 

940
00:53:22,379 --> 00:53:23,649
Yes.

941
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,669
Did you call me in, CEO?

942
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:44,289
I just...

943
00:53:49,419 --> 00:53:51,629
received a package.

944
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:53,879
Hwang Na Ro!

945
00:53:53,879 --> 00:53:56,699
You've been circling me
 for a long time.

946
00:53:58,289 --> 00:54:00,629
You've been circling the
 office building for a while.

947
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,899
You checked up on the CEO's 
whereabouts, looked up her assets.

948
00:54:06,419 --> 00:54:08,079
Even before you moved 
into Samgwang Villa,

949
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,089
you've been plotting with 
Prof. Kim for a long time.

950
00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:13,669
You've been plotting with 
Prof. Kim all this time

951
00:54:13,669 --> 00:54:15,649
and approached Seo Yeon.

952
00:54:17,059 --> 00:54:19,529
You're the one who 
called me saying that

953
00:54:19,529 --> 00:54:22,049
my daughter Seo Yeon is alive.

954
00:54:23,479 --> 00:54:26,389
What part of all this were you genuine?

955
00:54:27,939 --> 00:54:30,229
Was any of it genuine?

956
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:37,889
I'm sorry, Bit Chae Woon.

957
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:40,759
I apologize, CEO.

958
00:54:40,759 --> 00:54:42,109
At the time...

959
00:54:43,129 --> 00:54:45,559
I had crooked intentions.

960
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:46,869
I'm truly sorry.

961
00:54:46,869 --> 00:54:48,089
But now...

962
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:49,959
While living in Samgwang Villa,

963
00:54:49,959 --> 00:54:52,259
if things had worked out
 for you with Seo Yeon,

964
00:54:55,699 --> 00:54:59,999
you would have no reason to
 approach my Seo Ah, right?

965
00:55:00,729 --> 00:55:02,359
Isn't that right?

966
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:03,959
Huh?

967
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:13,449
I'm sorry...

968
00:55:14,729 --> 00:55:16,029
Yes.

969
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:21,709
I approached Bit Chae Woon 
with ill intentions at first.

970
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:25,819
But while living in Samgwang Villa,

971
00:55:27,729 --> 00:55:31,469
I realized how shameful 
my actions were.

972
00:55:33,859 --> 00:55:36,189
And while dating Seo Ah,

973
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,759
I regretted it a lot as I fell 
in love with Seo Ah.

974
00:55:42,929 --> 00:55:44,669
Now...

975
00:55:44,669 --> 00:55:47,879
I want to wash away 
all my past sins, and

976
00:55:47,879 --> 00:55:49,969
I really want to work 
at leading a good life.

977
00:55:49,969 --> 00:55:52,089
So, CEO, just once...

978
00:55:52,089 --> 00:55:53,349
Please forgive me just once.

979
00:55:53,399 --> 00:55:56,399
- If you forgive me just once...
- Stop.

980
00:55:57,539 --> 00:55:59,989
When the CEO settles down a bit, 
let's talk again then.

981
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,169
No.

982
00:56:01,169 --> 00:56:03,079
No need to do that.

983
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:06,659
Hwang Na Ro, get out right now.

984
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:09,199
Get out of my sight.

985
00:56:10,479 --> 00:56:12,549
Don't let Seo Ah know...

986
00:56:13,189 --> 00:56:16,019
and quietly get out of...

987
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:17,909
my company right now!

988
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:19,629
If I could have it my way,

989
00:56:19,629 --> 00:56:22,979
I'd put you away for fraud!

990
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:25,209
But I'm too embarrassed to do that.

991
00:56:25,209 --> 00:56:26,969
No, more than that...

992
00:56:27,999 --> 00:56:30,309
my... my...

993
00:56:31,409 --> 00:56:33,269
my Seo Ah...

994
00:56:33,269 --> 00:56:35,999
When I think of her pain...

995
00:56:35,999 --> 00:56:37,749
I...

996
00:56:37,749 --> 00:56:39,169
Mom...

997
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:45,899
My poor Seo Ah...

998
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:51,129
I'll tell...

999
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,499
Seo Ah that you went on
 a business trip in a rush.

1000
00:56:55,539 --> 00:56:58,569
Now... get lost now.

1001
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:03,299
And don't ever show up 
in front of Seo Ah again.

1002
00:57:04,249 --> 00:57:07,309
I beg you.

1003
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:09,639
Please I beg you.

1004
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:11,909
Please get out, Hwang Na Ro.

1005
00:57:45,739 --> 00:57:47,339
Mom, Mom...

1006
00:57:48,489 --> 00:57:49,869
Mom...

1007
00:57:50,829 --> 00:57:52,189
What do I do...

1008
00:57:55,169 --> 00:57:57,079
It's all my fault.

1009
00:57:59,759 --> 00:58:01,239
What do I do?

1010
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:03,279
What do I do about my Seo Ah?

1011
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,489
- Mom, Mom...
- Seo Yeon, what do I do?

1012
00:58:06,489 --> 00:58:07,639
What do I do...

1013
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:11,309
My poor Seo Ah. What do I do...

1014
00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:15,249
What should we do?

1015
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:19,809
Hi, Na Ro.

1016
00:58:27,989 --> 00:58:30,569
And place them like this.

1017
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:32,369
- Right?
- Okay.

1018
00:58:37,409 --> 00:58:39,599
Director, look at this.

1019
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,619
Would the design and color
 be okay like this?

1020
00:58:43,949 --> 00:58:45,139
Yes.

1021
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:04,239
 Mom... 

1022
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:05,479
 Then... 

1023
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:08,349
 you approve? 

1024
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:47,319
 

1025
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:54,929
Hi, Seo Ah.

1026
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:57,739
Na Ro, where are you right now?

1027
00:59:59,899 --> 01:00:02,199
I'm outside for a meeting.

1028
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:06,199
Nothing's up, right?

1029
01:00:07,049 --> 01:00:08,629
Everything is fine.

1030
01:00:08,629 --> 01:00:10,109
Where are you?

1031
01:00:11,209 --> 01:00:13,899
I'm on my way to your officetel.

1032
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,439
To the officetel? Why?

1033
01:00:18,379 --> 01:00:20,969
I was offsite and had some extra time.

1034
01:00:20,969 --> 01:00:22,909
I bought a few things.

1035
01:00:22,909 --> 01:00:24,809
 I want to drop them off at the officetel. 

1036
01:00:24,809 --> 01:00:26,539
Seo Ah.

1037
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:29,229
CEO was looking for you earlier.

1038
01:00:29,229 --> 01:00:31,289
- Mom?
 - Yeah. 

1039
01:00:31,289 --> 01:00:33,229
 Don't go to the officetel... 

1040
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,779
 and go back to the office. 

1041
01:00:34,779 --> 01:00:36,939
 And if you get a call from 
a number you don't recognize, 

1042
01:00:36,939 --> 01:00:38,079
don't answer it.

1043
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,659
Stay at the office and go 
home straight. Got it?

1044
01:00:40,659 --> 01:00:42,669
Na Ro.

1045
01:00:42,669 --> 01:00:44,449
Is something wrong?

1046
01:00:45,499 --> 01:00:47,099
Something's up, huh?

1047
01:00:48,139 --> 01:00:50,249
No. Nothing's up.

1048
01:00:50,249 --> 01:00:52,569
Anyway, do what I said, Seo Ah.

1049
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:55,219
Na Ro, you're at the officetel, right?

1050
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:57,649
 I'll come. Wait for me. 

1051
01:00:57,649 --> 01:00:59,199
I'm not.

1052
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:01,199
I have to go to the meeting.

1053
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,689
I'm hanging up.

1054
01:01:06,819 --> 01:01:08,439
Seo Ah.

1055
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:21,379
I'm sorry.

1056
01:01:27,979 --> 01:01:29,349
Na Ro!

1057
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:30,829
Na Ro!

1058
01:01:50,879 --> 01:01:52,549
Geez, you scared me!

1059
01:01:52,549 --> 01:01:54,019
What are you doing here?

1060
01:01:54,099 --> 01:01:56,879
Hyungnim, do you know 
where Prof. Kim is?

1061
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,569
I do. He's sitting behind bars right now.

1062
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,299
They fooled us.

1063
01:02:02,299 --> 01:02:06,429
The guys lied to us, saying Prof. Kim 
was at the police station.

1064
01:02:06,429 --> 01:02:07,769
What?

1065
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:10,899
Wow, these a**holes. That's f***ed up.

1066
01:02:10,899 --> 01:02:13,329
No matter how people ignore the 
order of ranks or loyalty,

1067
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:15,759
how dare they deceive
 Jirisan Tiger hyungnim?

1068
01:02:15,759 --> 01:02:17,309
A**holes...

1069
01:02:17,309 --> 01:02:19,579
So what happened to you?

1070
01:02:19,579 --> 01:02:21,249
What else?

1071
01:02:21,249 --> 01:02:22,909
Everything is ruined.

1072
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:24,159
What?

1073
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:26,879
You ended up like me from back then?

1074
01:02:26,879 --> 01:02:27,979
Hyungnim.

1075
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:31,699
How could this happen?

1076
01:02:31,699 --> 01:02:34,229
How could this happen...

1077
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:38,249
Aigoo, Na Ro...

1078
01:02:41,369 --> 01:02:43,499
This is life.

1079
01:02:43,499 --> 01:02:45,779
You're like a moth to the flame.

1080
01:02:45,779 --> 01:02:48,289
So where are you going?

1081
01:02:48,289 --> 01:02:49,909
Are you on the run?

1082
01:02:49,909 --> 01:02:51,509
No.

1083
01:02:51,509 --> 01:02:53,459
I'll catch Prof. Kim first.

1084
01:02:53,459 --> 01:02:56,329
I won't let him off the hook.

1085
01:02:57,549 --> 01:03:00,649
If you find out where Prof. Kim is, call me.

1086
01:03:00,649 --> 01:03:02,139
I'm leaving.

1087
01:03:02,139 --> 01:03:03,549
Hey, Hwang Na Ro.

1088
01:03:04,469 --> 01:03:07,379
Don't do this. Turn yourself in.

1089
01:03:07,379 --> 01:03:10,109
Combining you blackmailing 
my Jung Won and other things,

1090
01:03:10,109 --> 01:03:11,899
that's more than enough
 for fraud charges.

1091
01:03:11,899 --> 01:03:13,569
Na Ro.

1092
01:03:13,569 --> 01:03:16,009
Turn yourself in for a brighter future.

1093
01:03:16,009 --> 01:03:17,929
That's the only way you'll live.

1094
01:03:17,929 --> 01:03:20,119
I'll turn myself in when it's time.

1095
01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:22,279
But not now.

1096
01:03:22,279 --> 01:03:26,039
I'll catch him myself and 
put him away behind bars.

1097
01:03:26,939 --> 01:03:28,989
And you'd better watch, too, Hyungnim.

1098
01:03:28,989 --> 01:03:32,369
That a**hole knows that you 
told on them all his crimes.

1099
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:34,539
So what if he knows?

1100
01:03:34,539 --> 01:03:35,939
Don't you know Prof. Kim?

1101
01:03:35,939 --> 01:03:38,009
You don't know how that 
a**hole would take revenge.

1102
01:03:38,009 --> 01:03:39,999
He could even hurt Bit Chae Woon.

1103
01:03:39,999 --> 01:03:42,499
What? My Seo Yeon?

1104
01:03:42,509 --> 01:03:43,949
Anyway...

1105
01:03:45,169 --> 01:03:46,939
watch out, Hyungnim.

1106
01:03:46,939 --> 01:03:48,559
I'll be in touch.

1107
01:03:56,289 --> 01:03:59,969
Hey! You really don't know
 where Prof. Kim is?

1108
01:04:01,169 --> 01:04:02,649
All right.

1109
01:04:05,799 --> 01:04:09,039
Geez, I feel nervous for some reason.

1110
01:04:11,149 --> 01:04:12,259
 

1111
01:04:12,259 --> 01:04:14,149
Detective Park?

1112
01:04:16,359 --> 01:04:18,639
Yes, this is Park Pil Hong.

1113
01:04:28,609 --> 01:04:31,919
 Now that I think about it, there is 
someone I feel uneasy about. 

1114
01:04:31,919 --> 01:04:33,289
 Who? 

1115
01:04:33,289 --> 01:04:35,079
 There's this guy named "Professor Kim." 

1116
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,239
 He used to pull tricks 
with Hwang Na Ro... 

1117
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:38,919
 I mean, he used to work with him. 

1118
01:04:38,919 --> 01:04:41,069
 He's dying of jealousy. 

1119
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:49,499
 

1120
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,509
 Park Pil Hong. 

1121
01:04:59,509 --> 01:05:02,029
 I have some questions
 on Kim Dae Hak. 

1122
01:05:02,029 --> 01:05:04,349
 Please come into the station right now. 

1123
01:05:12,689 --> 01:05:14,199
 Don't you know Prof. Kim? 

1124
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:16,369
 You don't know how that a**hole 
would take revenge. 

1125
01:05:16,369 --> 01:05:18,489
 He could even hurt Bit Chae Woon. 

1126
01:05:20,859 --> 01:05:24,129
Gosh, what if something
 happens to Seo Yeon?

1127
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:29,199
 

1128
01:05:30,399 --> 01:05:31,799
No.

1129
01:05:31,819 --> 01:05:35,149
I'll meet my Jung Won and Seo Yeon
 and talk to them in person.

1130
01:05:38,249 --> 01:05:39,759
 

1131
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:43,339
Hey, Prof. Kim, where are you right now?

1132
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:45,279
Thanks, Hyungnim.

1133
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:48,679
Since you revealed all the 
crimes I've committed,

1134
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:51,229
I'm on the Wanted List.

1135
01:05:51,229 --> 01:05:54,529
Hey! What do you mean
 I revealed everything? I didn't!

1136
01:05:57,029 --> 01:06:00,689
Hyung, you're not on your way
 to see the cops, are you?

1137
01:06:00,689 --> 01:06:01,999
What?

1138
01:06:03,099 --> 01:06:06,479
Geez, I won't stay put 
if that's the case, Hyung.

1139
01:06:07,649 --> 01:06:11,419
My target could end up being
 someone else besides you.

1140
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:14,429
What? Prof. Kim!

1141
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:15,789
Hey!

1142
01:06:15,789 --> 01:06:17,129
Hey, man!

1143
01:06:39,309 --> 01:06:40,719
Seo Yeon!

1144
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:42,019
Seo Yeon!

1145
01:06:43,379 --> 01:06:44,639
Seo Yeon!

1146
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:51,529
Seo Yeon!

1147
01:07:07,409 --> 01:07:09,359
Seo Yeon!

1148
01:07:15,879 --> 01:07:19,199
