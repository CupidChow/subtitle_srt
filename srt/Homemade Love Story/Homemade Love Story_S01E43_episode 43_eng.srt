It's so lovely here. Don't you think?

3
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,250
What's with you?

4
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,720
Hey, you still haven't 
memorized the move yet?

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,390
How do you do it?

6
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,080
- Look. Like this.
- How? Like this?

7
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,700
- Am I doing it right?
- No, not like that.

8
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,540
No?

9
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,940
How do I do it then?

10
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,200
- Jung Won.
- Hi, Min Jae.

11
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,450
- Hello.
- Hi, you're here.

12
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,360
Hello, In-law.

13
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,430
It's a wonderful day.

14
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,140
Yes, it really is a wonderful day.

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,800
- The weather is lovely, too.
- Yes.

16
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,590
Oh, go ahead and talk.

17
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,830
- Okay.
- All right then.

18
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,080
Soon Jung, no...

19
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,780
In-law.

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,460
Did you have a nice dream last night?

21
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,240
Gosh, I'm not sure. I couldn't sleep at all.

22
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,130
You, too? Me, too.

23
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,690
I was tossing and turning, 
and it was already morning.

24
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,120
I don't think my makeup went on well.

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,820
You look so beautiful, In-law.

26
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,780
- Really?
- Yes.

27
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,810
This place is cozier than
 I thought. Don't you think?

28
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,710
Yes. I think they picked a good place.

29
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,610
But still, there are lots of places
 that are better than here.

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,910
Mom.

31
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,050

Yeah. A little bit.

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,490
Chae Woon...

46
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,600

became my daughter.

Aigoo, I knew from way before.

149

Chae Woon is pretty because
 she takes after my Jjung-a.

What else? You caught it, 
so you should get married.

156
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,710
Guys, don't you have to get married 
within six months if you catch this?

157
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,810
- Yes, of course!

A stem. Do I have to get married, too?

Hey, you have a boyfriend, huh?
 Be honest.

00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,960
What are you talking about, Auntie?

164
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,140
- What?
- You're so funny.

165
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,570
- Joon Ah.
- Yes?

166
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,540
It was tiring today, huh?

167
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,880
Gosh, no, ma'am. I came out
 for some water.

168
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,230
Wait. Your face is bright red.

169
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,210
Did you get sunburn? What's wrong?

170
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,910
- What? Me?
- Yeah, you're red.

171
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,470
- What are you saying?
- You're flushed.

172
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,680
- Wait a minute.
- Nothing.

173
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,150
Gosh, you scared me.

174
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,300
- Oh, wait. Thank you.
- Thank you.

175
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,980
What's with those two?

176
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,390
Did you meet for the first time today?

177
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,910
Everyone, you all worked so hard today.

178
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,620
Everyone, go to your own rooms now.

179
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,120
- Get some rest. 
- Unni, you went through a lot.

180
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,830
- Right. Good job.
- Everyone, good job!

181
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,750
Let's get some rest. Disperse!

182
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,130
Gosh...

183
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,340
Aigoo...

184
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,240
My gosh.

185
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,210
My Chae Woon left for good now.

186
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,330
You didn't have to drive me home.

187
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,220
Today is a special day. 
So it's a special treatment.

188
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,960
Have some tea then.

189
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,900
I noticed how handsome 
my Jae Hee was earlier.

190
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,960
Of course, he takes after me.

191
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,890
- Chae Woon was pretty, too.
- Aigoo.

192
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,410
My legs.

193
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,900
Of course, Bit Chae Woon 
was pretty, too.

194
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,790
But my Jae Hee looked better.

195
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,850
You only see your son, huh?

196
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,470
But...

197
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,880
I wonder if Park Pil Hong came.

198
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,670
I don't think I saw him.

199
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,610
Chae Woon's father?

200
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,210
You've never met 
Park Pil Hong, have you?

201
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,390
Well? I don't know what he looks like.

202
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,940
Right.

203
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,340
You couldn't make it to 
Jung Won's wedding.

204
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,960
Because you had to work.

205
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,970
You couldn't make it to
 her housewarming, either.

206
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,670
I guess so.

207
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,330
It looks like...

208
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,020
all you did was work so hard 
all your life. Isn't that right?

209
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,310
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable living 
with your son and daughter-in-law?

210
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,020
Well, it won't be comfortable 
all the time, but

211
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,100
we'll have some fun as well.

212
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,920
Oh, wait.

213
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,900
Aigoo.

214
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,670
Here.

215
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,020
What is this?

216
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,070
Another manual?

217
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,140
These are quick breakfast recipes.

218
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,420
Don't just wait for them to
 make food for you.

219
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,510
Look at this and make breakfast 
a couple of times a week.

220
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,920
I don't think I can do this.

221
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,540
Gosh, even if you don't think 
you can't, you should try.

222
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,590
You were able to sit and wait 
because I took it from you.

223
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,880
You can't do that with 
your daughter-in-law. Okay?

224
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,890
 

225
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,710
You can read it easily, huh?

226
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,350
So you could read it easily.

227
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,890
Practice them while they're 
away on their honeymoon.

228
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,240
You have to do this to be loved
 by your daughter-in-law.

229
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,840
 True. 

230
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,150
 The tall guy living across from her is a 
master homemaker who makes dumplings. 

231
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,350
 Yes, I could do this, too. 

232
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,160
All right, Jung Min Jae.

233
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,100
Aigoo...

234
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,520
Gosh...

235
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,300
Gosh, I knew you'd be here, Mom.

236
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,870
- Mom!
- Why are you guys here?

237
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,630
We thought you'd be lonely.

238
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,580
Mom, you have Ra Hoon and me.

239
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,290
Gosh, I know.

240
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,840
I have you guys.

241
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,050
I'm not lonely at all.

242
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,530
Ra Hoon and I will be
 better to you. Right?

243
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,020
Yeah, of course! I'll be so
 good to you, Mom.

244
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,130
Aigoo.

245
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,380
Gosh, I'm touched even 
hearing those words.

246
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,220
I'm tearing up.

247
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,850
Aigoo, my Hae Deun.

248
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,980
Here, you, too.

249
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,210
Aigoo, thank you.

250
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,630
 What will my mom do once 
I go to the military, too? 

251
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,260
Aigoo...

252
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,180
Ra Hoon, why do you look so down?

253
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,650
Aigoo, you're feeling sad, my son.

254
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,510
- Since your older sister is out of the house.
- Oh, no...

255
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,110
Gosh, Lee Ra Hoon. 
You sure are the youngest.

256
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,520
Let go. You're dead.

257
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,820
- Were you sad?
- I'll use my strength on you.

258
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:29,540
♫  When you look at me 
with your warm gaze  ♫

259
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:36,390
♫  My weary heart melts away  ♫

260
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,610
♫  Without any reason  ♫

261
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,160
Am I dreaming?

262
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,640
You're not dreaming.

263
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,240
I'm not.

264
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,990
I think there is such 
a thing as destiny.

265
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,490
Why?

266
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,970
The first time I saw you 
at the construction site,

267
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,980
you didn't feel like a stranger.

268
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,740
- You seemed so familiar.
- You, too, Moong-i?

269
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,910
The moment I butt your head,

270
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,970
I came to. As if you
 crashed into my heart.

271
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,480
Finally, my destiny...

272
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,740
I thought I finally met my destiny.

273
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Gosh, that's too...

274
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,300
What do you mean?

275
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,970
♫  You make me fill up my whole 
day with the thoughts of you.  ♫

276
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,120
Did you arrive okay, Chae Woon?

277
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,160
Yes, Mother.

278
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,460
 Jung Won, no... 

279
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,170
 Did you call your mothers? 

280
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,570
I'm about to.

281
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,540
You should've called them first.

282
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,750
I'll call Dad.

283
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,960
 Okay. Chae Woon, have a good time and... 

284
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,720
have a relaxing time.

285
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,540
Okay. Thank you.

286
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,920
I'll let you talk to Jae Hee.

287
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,760
 Wait, Chae Woon. 

288
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,110
I felt terrible about last time.

289
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,340
I shouldn't have
 brought up Park Pil Hong.

290
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,120
I'm so sorry.

291
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,160
No, Mother.

292
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,140
What?

293
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm still so childish
 even though I'm older.

294
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,190
I regretted it a lot.

295
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,990
 I'm really sorry. 

296
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,620
It's okay. I'm really fine, Mother.

297
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,280
At Father's company?

298
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,440
Yeah.

299
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,050
The business division made a formal offer 
for me to work on a project for a year.

300
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,810
Father must've ordered them, huh?

301
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,620
Probably.

302
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,750
Dad helped me out with 
my company a lot recently.

303
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,330
I think I should help him, too.

304
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,370
But I'm worried that my relationship with 
him would worsen while working on the project.

305
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,390
The project is one thing, but...

306
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:58,170
don't you think Father suggested it 
because he wants to work with you?

307
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,970
Father reached out to you first. 
Why don't you muster up the courage?

308
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,510
Should I?

309
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,670
I finally feel like 
we're starting out together.

310
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,210
Our adventure.

311
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,450
Gosh, we went through tough 
adventures all this time.

312
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,530
You had some tough times, Moong-i.

313
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,240
I did.

314
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,330
But the future adventures
 are different, though.

315
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,960
It's a heart-fluttering, happy adventure.

316
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,520
I'm sure we'll face some 
difficulties, but

317
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,430
I'm not afraid at all.

318
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,900
Thanks to this.

319
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,750
Moong-i.

320
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,980
Let's live delightfully.

321
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,680
Let's grow old gracefully...

322
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,010
and let's be happy for a very long time.

323
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,480
Okay.

324
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,430
I'll be your good friend and a good wife.

325
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,250
I'll be your dependable husband.

326
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,500
I love you, Chae Woon.

327
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,860
Thank you so much for 
becoming my wife.

328
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,200
Thank you so much for 
marrying me, too.

329
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,120
I love you, Jae Hee.

330
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,380
 Please look over here. 

331
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,370
Are you sure Director Jang Seo Ah

332
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,690
didn't order you the job 
with an intention?

333
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:18,700
Director Jang Seo Ah has nothing
 to do with construction affiliates

334
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,160
personally nor for business.

335
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,230
And she did not interfere with 
Woo Jae Hee's contract intentionally.

336
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,390
Don't be scared.

337
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,980
It will be okay.

338
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,020
Drink this tea.

339
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,100
It was rough, huh?

340
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,320
I was scared until I got 
to the police station.

341
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,650
But I feel more relieved now.

342
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,350
Thank you.

343
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,250
I got over a hurdle thanks to you, Na Ro.

344
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,770
Let's resolve one thing at a time together.

345
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,300
Gosh, it looks delicious!

346
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,510
Taste it.

347
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,720
 Put it there. 

348
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,480
- I'll wipe here.
- Over here.

349
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,950
It's really good.

350
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,450
 I'm going to do this. 

351
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,930
 Go away. 

352
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,350
What's that?

353
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,010
Is Bit Chae here already?

354
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,330
I don't think so.

355
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,890
- Come on.
- I'm trying.

356
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,660
- Why are you trying to be close to me?
- Joon Ah.

357
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,670
Move.

358
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,180
- You were here, too, Joon Ah.
- Mom.

359
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,930
My gosh, Unni!

360
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Oh, my.

361
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,500
CEO, what are you doing here?

362
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,890
They said they're going
 over to your house.

363
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,540
I talked to Chae Woon.

364
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,420
She said to meet everyone
 here altogether.

365
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,840
I see.

366
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,080
Gosh, why did you bring 
so much stuff, Unni?

367
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,380
Aigoo, it's nothing.

368
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,140
Take these. They must be heavy.

369
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,820
Thank you for bringing them.

370
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,560
- Aigoo.
- Oh, my goodness.

371
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,030
Aigoo...

372
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,380
- Thank you.
- My goodness.

373
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,870
Hae Deun.

374
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,410
Hi.

375
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,250
Hello, CEO.

376
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,020
Hae Deun, you've been acting 
strangely since last time.

377
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,460
Pardon?

378
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,180
You're so nice to me all of a sudden.

379
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,790
- I know.
- She's so wild.

380
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,890
Yeah. I mean, you're awkwardly
 gentle right now.

381
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,350
I'm gentle, to begin with.

382
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,610
What? She's not awkward at all.

383
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:56,200
Actually, I'm enforcing manners
 with Director Lee.

384
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,300
Our company policy is to be gentle.

385
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,270
Aigoo, aigoo.

386
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,050
You should try harder.

387
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:08,320
Soon Jung, how can I help you? 
What should I do?

388
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,710
Gosh, no. Just have a seat.

389
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,100
- No, I want to help out.
- Ra Hoon.

390
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,810
- Get some tea.
- No, no.

391
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,600
Don't get me any tea. I'm not a guest.

392
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,560
Mother, we need to peel these, right?

393
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,140
Yeah, Ba Reun.

394
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,880
Oh, Soon Jung, I'll peel garlic.

395
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,620
Aigoo, gosh.

396
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,890
Hae Deun, should we peel 
garlic together?

397
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,200
Me, me?

398
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,210
Go ahead.

399
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,110
Sure. I mean...

400
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,670
- Let's peel them together.
- Unni, do you know how?

401
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,410
- Do you know how?
- I'll work hard at it.

402
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:45,910
I haven't done kitchen work in a while.

403
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,570
I'm not doing this well.

404
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:51,260
You can't dig into the
 garlic clove like that.

405
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,620
Look. Just peel the skin like this.

406
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,410
I see. Like this?

407
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,110
Gosh, you're so bad at this, CEO.

408
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,260
Peel the skin gently like this. 
Don't use your nails. Do it like this.

409
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,500
Like this.

410
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,440
Hae Deun, you're so good at this.

411
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,660
- Do it all then.
- Gosh, you can't leave like this.

412
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,280
We have to peel all these. 
Hurry. Let's do it.

413
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,880
Peel the skin like this.

414
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,730
Don't scratch it with your nails.

415
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,080
Gosh, my eyes sting.

416
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,480
CEO, your hands are so slow.

417
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,980
So funny.

418
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,910
Your hands are golden, I meant.

419
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,020
I'll peel them all, CEO. Go over there.

420
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,210
No, I'll peel them.

421
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,900
You're so good.

422
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,050
 Mother, we're here! 

423
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,700
Seo Yeon is here.

424
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,200
Oh, my.

425
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,700
Sorry, Hae Deun.

426
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,560
Whoa, back from honeymoon.

427
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,400
Did you have fun?

428
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,920
Hey!

429
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,080
Did you have fun?

430
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,450
Whoa, looking good.

431
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,880
Unni, Brother-in-law.

432
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,190
I heard you were here, Mother. 
So we came straight here.

433
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,450
Yeah, it's so lovely to celebrate 
with everyone gathered here.

434
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,860
I know.

435
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,640
Mothers, we'll bow.

436
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,990
Aigoo, so pretty.

437
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,560
- Unni is so pretty.
- Right?

438
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,590
Did you have fun on your honeymoon?

439
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,950
Yes.

440
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,970
Did you have a nice dream?

441
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,500
A dream?

442
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,090
Well, not sure. Did you dream?

443
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,590
Soon Jung.

444
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,920
Go ahead.

445
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,050
Yeah?

446
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,820
All you have to do is be happy.

447
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,420
Right?

448
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,420
Jae Hee, love Chae Woon a lot.

449
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,430
Yes. I'll love her very much.

450
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,060
Chae Woon, be good to Jae Hee as well.

451
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,030
Always don't lose your first love.

452
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,160
Yes. I'll do that, Mom.

453
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,830
Okay. Now that you're back
 from your honeymoon,

454
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,530
you're stepping out first as a married couple, 
Woo Jae Hee and Lee Bit Chae Woon...

455
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,390
Gosh, it's so weird to 
call them "a married couple."

456
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,490
Hae Deun, I forgot what
 I was going to say.

457
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:43,130
All right. To wish them happiness
 and joy for the couple.

458
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,890
For the happiness of 
our Samgwang Villa family

459
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,630
and first steps for the newlywed.

460
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,070
 Cheers! 

461
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,460
Wait, wait a minute.

462
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,350
On a happy day like today, shouldn't 
we hear a song from our newlyweds?

463
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,220
- Hey, what are you saying?
- Sounds good!

464
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,510
Sounds great.

465
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,110
I want to hear you sing, Jae Hee. 
You, too, Chae Woon.

466
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,590
Mother, I can't sing at all.

467
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,260
- No, no.
 - Sing a song! 

468
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,190
 - Sing a song! 
- Eat, eat!

469
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,810
 If you can't sing, you can't get married. 

470
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,540
But you're married.

471
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,580
One more time still.

472
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,140
All right, all right.

473
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,590
Then we'll sing a song.

474
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,210
Let's go.

475
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,830
So cool.

476
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,390
Good, good.

477
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,040
Okay, okay.

478
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,940
I can't do that.

479
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,470
We can't wait!

480
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,300
 One, two, three, four. 

481
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,410
♫   It's good! It's good! It's good!  ♫

482
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,590
♫   It's very, very good   ♫

483
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,910
♫   It's perfect! It's perfect! It's perfect!    ♫

484
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,940
♫   You're the perfect one   ♫

485
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,590

♫   Okay!  ♫

487
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,710

♫  ♫   You're very, very good!   ♫  ♫

490
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,770
Gosh, I can't believe you're driving us.

491
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,750
On top of that, you told us 
to sit in the back.

492
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,130
Yeah, Mom. We're so uncomfortable.

493
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,250
No.

494
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,590
I wanted to drive you, my Seo Yeon.

495
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,420
- Jae Hee.
- Yes.

496
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,940
I leave Seo Yeon to your care.

497
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,460
Yes, Mother. Don't you worry.

498
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,780
Mom...

499
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,560
My daughter...

500
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,400
My Seo Yeon, you have 
to be happy, okay?

501
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,160
Yes, Mom.

502
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,410
Mom and Dad, we'll bow.

503
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,760
We'll bow.

504
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,000
Aigoo...

505
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,700
Gosh, you're so pretty, my Chae Woon.

506
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,540
Thank you.

507
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,190
I'm sure your two mothers had
 wonderful things to say.

508
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,440
Let's get along in the future, 
Ms. Chae Woon.

509
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,080
What do you mean, "Ms." Chae Woon?

510
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,090
My daughter-in-law.

511
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,320
Chae Woon.

512
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,430
Thank you in advance, Father and Mother.

513
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,990
If it's uncomfortable living 
with your father-in-law

514
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,410
or if you have any complaints, 
report them to me.

515
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,060
- "Report"?
- Okay?

516
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,970
Okay.

517
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,070
Mom, can I report them to you, too?

518
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,790
I won't accept your complaints.

519
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,870
Why not?

520
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,100
All right.

521
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,720
We should take you to 
your newlywed room.

522
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,660
Whoa!

523
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,980
Gosh, did you do all this by yourself?

524
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,250
Father...

525
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,850
It's so nice, Father.

526
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:34,760
Father, you must've worked 
so hard to prepare this room.

527
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,630
Didn't you hurt your shoulder trying to
 put those balloons up there?

528
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,700
I did hurt it. Look...

529
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,120
Over here?

530
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,540
I'm just kidding.

531
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,970
It's okay.

532
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,360
Aigoo...

533
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,560
My goodness... whoa...

534
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,700
When did you do all this?

535
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,210
Wow...

536
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,180
Don't come out.

537
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,260
Mom, be careful going home.

538
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,440
Goodbye, Mother.

539
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,390
Bye, Jung Min Jae.

540
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,460
Bye.

541
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,420
Bye.

542
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,230
Oh? Geez...

543
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,310
Geez...

544
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,870
Wait.

545
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,620
- What are you doing?
- The recipes I gave you...

546
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,480
Did you do your homework?

547
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,160
No, I didn't.

548
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,700
What in the world?

549
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,060
I told you to practice while
 they were on their honeymoon.

550
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,710
You really didn't do it?

551
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,830
Do you think I have that much time?

552
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,500
Whatever.

553
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,670
I don't care whether you become

554
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,400
a disliked father-in-law or not.

555
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,080
Don't you become a disliked 
mother-in-law, Jung Min Jae.

556
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,330
Don't you worry. I'll work on it.

557
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,940
I'm leaving.

558
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,860
I won't walk you out.

559
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,600
What?

560
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,150
Goodbye.

561
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,220
Bye.

562
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,310
Bye.

563
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,830
It's so weird.

564
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:23,990
I'm so happy that the kids 
are happily married.

565
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:28,240
But why does she look more lonely?

566
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,520
Aigoo...

567
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,100
I should've been good to her.

568
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:48,200
♫  You are just like a giving tree  ♫

Woo Jung Hoo...

Why does he look so lonely
 even though he's smiling?

572
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,300
Gosh, I'm lonely, too.

573
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,670
Life is lonely for everyone.

574
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,240
So lonely...

Moong-i...

592
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,380
Let's sleep five more minutes.
 Five minutes.

593
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,290
Ten minutes.

594
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,020
 Breakfast? 

595
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,260
Oh, no...

596
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,810
Ow, Moong-i...

597
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,220
It hurts.

598
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,860
Let's hurry.

599
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,660
What's this smell?

600
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,070
It smells so savory...

601
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,100
D... Dad...

602
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,390
Father...

603
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,050
Good morning.

604
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,890
Why did you come down so early?

605
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,260
Are you making breakfast?

606
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,710
We were going to do it.

607
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,120
It's our first day. I wanted to prepare it.

608
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,130
It's a welcome breakfast.

609
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,000
Gosh, Father...

610
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,830
But I can't guarantee the taste.

611
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,240
Father...

612
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,910
We'll make breakfast tomorrow. 
I'm sorry.

613
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,950
Dad, I'm so shocked.

614
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,150
Don't be too sorry, Chae Woon.

615
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,280
We live together now.

616
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,660
We should share stuff like this.

617
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,030
I even made our schedule.

618
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,150
Here.

619
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,690
Look at this.

620
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,190
 

621
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,740
When did you come up with this?

622
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,570
Does "babes" here refer to us?

623
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,000
That's right.

624
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,200
My daughter-in-law.

625
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,800
Since you're her husband, 
you're kiddo, too.

626
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,350
Father, you're listed more often.

627
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,720
You're at a disadvantage, Father.

628
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,000
What?

629
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,740
Then I'll switch it next month.

630
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,070
- How about it?
- But still...

631
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,610
Dad, you might get sick doing this.

632
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,590
Hurry up and make money 
so that you can move out.

633
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,610
Before I get sick.

634
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,680
Gosh, we should make money quickly.

635
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,600
Okay, eat. It will get cold.

636
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,610
Okay. Thank you.

637
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,120
Father, it's delicious.

638
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,250
Huh?

639
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,600
Wait.

640
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,270
It's unexpectedly good.

641
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,840
Dad, it's really good.

642
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,460
Gosh, I'm so relieved.

643
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,450
I'm glad I practiced.

644
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,050
You practiced?

645
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,070
Just a little bit.

646
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,390
Because Min Jae was nagging 
me so much about it.

647
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,460
- Eat. Eat a lot.
- Thank you for this food.

648
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,390
All right...

649
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,030
Dad.

650
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:08,990
I'll work on your company project.

651
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,180
Will you?

652
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,370
If I talked to you about it,

653
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,260
I thought you'd say,
 "I don't want any favors from you!"

654
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,400
I reached out to you officially 
through our business division.

655
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,940
Geez, I wouldn't have said that.

656
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,050
Come on, man.

657
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,290
You're pretending not to be like 
that with Chae Woon here.

658
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,390
But...

659
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:33,700
it will be tough to handle two jobs 
with your own office.

660
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,170
Will you be okay?

661
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,160
Well, I'll have to work hard
 to pay off my debt.

662
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,100
I'll work hard, Dad.

663
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,140
Okay. Do a good job.

664
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,130
- Fighting.
- Eat.

665
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,200
Yes.

666
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,710
It's good.

667
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,890
It's good.

668
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,350
I guess I'm talented at cooking.

669
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,460
Yeah, you're good.

670
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:59,510
More than anything, be sure the 
construction is done safely and on time.

671
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,700
Yes, will do.

672
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,800
Oh, Jae Hee, welcome!

673
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,100
Did you have a nice time 
on your honeymoon?

674
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,600
Yes, Director. Thank you in advance.

675
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,140
Of course.

676
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,490
Wow, I look forward to 
your work, Jae Hee.

677
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,620
Welcome, Mr. Woo Jae Hee.

678
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,600
I look forward to working with you.

679
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,190
Thank you in advance.

680
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,370
Yes, Eems hyung.

681
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,210
Everything is ready.

682
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:35,610
Thanks to you, we're doing well today.

683
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,950
 - What's going on?
- I know. 

684
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,140
 What is all this? 

685
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:45,160
Okay. No, no, sit down.

686
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,500
Eat comfortably.

687
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,110
It's my treat. Enjoy.

688
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,650
You are, President?

689
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,720
Yes.

690
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,110
But why would you treat us?

691
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,880
My son got married.

692
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,430
So it's on me.

693
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,050
Enjoy.

694
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,110
It's warm and delicious.

695
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,890
Okay, eat, eat.

696
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:12,450
Gosh, it's spicy. It relieves my stress.

697
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,500
Thank you, President.

698
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,420
Yes, enjoy.

699
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,440
It's melting in my mouth.

700
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,490
Why don't you join us, President?

701
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,270
Should I do that?

702
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,060
Then excuse me.

703
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,770
Go ahead and eat.

704
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,220
- It's good.
- You love your son so much.

705
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,080
You're so awesome, President.

706
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,760
Aigoo, thank you.

707
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,600
Both of them are being
 investigated, right?

708
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,490
I'm not sure about that.

709
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,710
What's going to happen now?

710
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,080
Hello.

711
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,210
Hi, Bit Chae Woon. Did you have
 a lovely honeymoon?

712
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,650
Yes, thanks to you.

713
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:49,710
Thank you.

714
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,470
Bit Chae Woon, you got prettier.

715
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,420
I know.

716
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,220
Come on now.

717
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,360
Thanks for going around the 
branches on your first day back.

718
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,360
No problem.

719
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,550
But you know...

720
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:06,130
I heard that the police investigated 
Director Jang Seo Ah and Chief Hwang Na Ro.

721
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,500
Pardon?

722
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,440
I guess you didn't know, Bit Chae Woon.

723
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,240
They're not at a meeting as we speak.

724
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,150
They're actually at their 
second interrogation.

725
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,920
Yeah, I heard Chairwoman Lee Choon Suk
 is being summoned, too.

726
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,320
I'm sorry, Grandma. It's all my fault.

727
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,080
I'm glad you know it's your fault.

728
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,450
I tried to stop you so badly.

729
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:36,830
Aigoo...

730
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,980
- Gosh. Aigoo.
- Chairwoman.

731
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,960
- Chairwoman.
- Grandma!

732
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,470
Grandma?

733
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:03,060
Seo Ah, how is the Chairwoman?

734
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,790
Go in.

735
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,500
See for yourself.

736
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,770
Thankfully, she's conscious.

737
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,060
She needs to rest for a while.

738
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,000
Lucky you.

739
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,050
Now that Grandma and I are both
 in this current predicament.

740
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:20,760
Must you say it like that in this situation?

741
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,600
- Seo Yeon...
- Mom...

742
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,820
She just fell asleep.

743
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,130
She turned a corner.

744
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:51,140
I feel like I did this to her.

745
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,050
I feel so bad.

746
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,000
Don't think like that.

747
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,280
Thanks to you...

748
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,710
she made the right decision.

749
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,540
Right.

750
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:10,690
But still, she'll be investigated
 without being detained.

751
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,380
What a relief that is.

752
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,980
She said she'll pay enough
 for compensation.

753
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,200
Don't worry too much about
 Jae Hee's company.

754
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,700
Okay.

755
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,390
We're meeting Jae Hee oppa now?

756
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,700
I don't want to.

757
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,830
Seo Ah.

758
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:36,000
We must meet Woo Jae Hee.

759
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,290
We'll meet and apologize to him.

760
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:41,680
We have to check on damages suffered 
by the subcontractors and take care of them.

761
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,700
I don't want to. Why should I?

762
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,570
Do you still have feelings 
for Woo Jae Hee?

763
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,690
If it's not that,

764
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,690
listen to me.

765
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,700
We went in for a police investigation
 along with the Chairwoman.

766
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,470
I heard from my subcontractors.

767
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,130
I wanted to know about 
the subcontractors' damages.

768
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:13,450
I'll visit each one of them to
 apologize and pay for damages.

769
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,400
Why?

770
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,690
You sure change your words fast.

771
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,630
I should move quickly on this.

772
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:27,640
We weren't trying to destroy subcontractors 
who had nothing to do with this.

773
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,490
We'll compensate them plentifully.

774
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:34,200
Fine. Apologizing quickly 
and compensation?

775
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,300
Sounds good. However...

776
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:39,370
your crime doesn't disappear
 just because you do this.

777
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,950
The wounds don't disappear.

778
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:45,700
For them as well as for Chae Woon.

779
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,150
I had no idea...

780
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,910
things would get this bad.

781
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,100
I really hated you, Oppa.

782
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,770
You were so heartless, 
and I hated you for it.

783
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,340
I couldn't see things clearly.

784
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,900
Is that why you asked for help from 
Hwang Na Ro and the Chairwoman?

785
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,340
And you helped Seo Ah 
when you knew about this.

786
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,850
But now you're busy trying
 to clean up the mess.

787
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:17,950
No matter what happens to others, you're 
fine as long as you kiss up to Seo Ah?

788
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:19,440
Woo Jae Hee...

789
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,160
We didn't intercept the contract illegally.

790
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,870
A more solid company had jumped 
in the middle of the deal.

791
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:30,000
Why did you involve Park Pil Hong in this?

792
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,270
Park Pil Hong kept 
pestering the Chairwoman.

793
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:35,970
He was asking her for some work.

794
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,770
That's why she asked him to do that.

795
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,580
You weren't trying to put everything on

796
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,010
Park Pil Hong and put him 
away in prison?

797
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,510
That's not it.

798
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,180
Hey, Hwang Na Ro.

799
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,680
What should I do?

800
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,840
I can't believe anything you say, 
no matter what.

801
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,570
Woo Jae Hee...

802
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,110
Oppa.

803
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,180
Na Ro is genuine.

804
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,570
Believe him.

805
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:08,050
- For my sake.
- So...

806
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:11,680
I'm worried that Hwang Na Ro is 
with you for your sake.

807
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,250
I'll apologize.

808
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:14,830
Oppa...

809
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,980
I'm sorry.

810
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:24,480
But don't think negatively of Na Ro.

811
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,410
I love him.

812
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,030
Looks good.

813
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,980
I'm glad that it ended there for Seo Ah.

814
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,020
Yeah, I'm glad.

815
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,790
But I think she needs to go in 
a few more times for interrogation.

816
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:53,330
There still are lots of things 
to take care of.

817
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,590
I went to see Grandma earlier.

818
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:57,610
She seemed to be having 
a tough time as well.

819
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,290
She needs to be hospitalized
 a little longer.

820
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:01,910
 Mr. Makjang! 

821
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:03,430
What are you doing?

822
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:08,110
 Mom, cheer up. Call me if
 something comes up. 

823
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,060
I have to get back to work.

824
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,080
Okay. Good day.

825
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,000
He must be close to Hae Deun.

826
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,480
 - Come on.
- I'm trying. 

827
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,320
 - Why are you trying to be close to me?
- Joon Ah. 

828
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,230
 - Come on.
- Move. 

829
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,320
Smile bigger.

830
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,070
Change up the pose. Nice.
 

831
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,380
So pretty! So pretty.

832
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,860
They're not in focus here.

833
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,640
- Sorry. Let's take a break.
 - Okay. 

834
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:47,060
Lee Ra Hoon, aren't you
 going to work today?

835
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,020
Huh?

836
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,380
I'm off today.

837
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,070
Then you should've stayed home.
 Why are you here?

838
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,290
Cha Ba Reun, he's so attached to you.

839
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,970
I asked him to wait for me.
 So we could leave together.

840
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:01,090
This is a workplace. You think you're 
waiting for a study session to end?

841
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:03,920
Hey, Ra Hoon, this is bad. 
We have to take them over again.

842
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,790
- This will take a while.
- Really?

843
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:07,040
Yeah.

844
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,070
It's okay.

845
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,820
Hey, Lee Ra Hoon! 
Are you going to leave?

846
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,910
Since you've waited this long, 
why don't you wait a little longer?

847
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,990
I don't know when 
you'll be done, though.

848
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:24,790
That's why I told you 
not to come today.

849
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,180
When did you say not to come?

850
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,110
You said to come if I have time 
and go see a movie afterward.

851
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,670
Hey, that's because you want to
 hang around me all the time lately.

852
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:36,120
Even today, you said you're not 
going to work at the food truck.

853
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,430
I just mentioned that you should come.

854
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:40,070
I had no idea you'd dart over like this.

855
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,310
"Dart over?"

856
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:43,940
You "just mentioned it"?

857
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,330
Whoa, I must be bugging you now.

858
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,570
I guess I'm just a sticky leech to you.

859
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,870
Well? A little bit, I guess.

860
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:52,830
You keep following me around lately.

861
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,860
I think you're obsessed with me.

862
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,330
I have my reasons.

863
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:59,040
It's not like I'll get to see you
 all the time in the future.

864
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,980
What are you talking about?

865
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,520
Nothing.

866
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,720
I'll go ahead, Cha Ba Reun.

867
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,320
Hey, Lee Ra Hoon.

868
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,430
Gosh, what's wrong with him lately?

869
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,720
I knew it when I saw those
 two hang around together.

870
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,910
Isn't it too much, though?

871
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,540
 Who knows... 

872
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:19,930
Hello.

873
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,660
Chae Woon, that branch manager
 is handsome, huh?

874
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,990
I was so surprised today 
when I saw him.

875
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,570
The staff knows that I went in 
for interrogations, huh?

876
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,070
I think so.

877
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:01,430
Seo Ah, I told you it's something 
we have to go through anyway.

878
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:03,980
Don't let them see you shaken.

879
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,630
He used Lee Hae Deun as a model?

880
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:15,990
Look at these people.

881
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,450
Seo Ah.

882
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,050
What the heck?

883
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,820
Ba Reun said she'll see
 Ra Hoon out and come back.

884
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,890
What's taking her so long?

885
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,440
Let them be alone.

886
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,780
So we could have 
a good time by ourselves.

887
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,210
What in the world...

888
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:37,520
Hae Deun.

889
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,340
Do this. Like Jesus.

890
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,790
- Do this.
- Like this?

891
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,710
Hug me for a minute like that.

892
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,190
- My gosh, what?
- Hug me for a minute.

893
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:46,600
- Just a minute.
- What's this?

894
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,980
- Whoa! It's so cute!
- Isn't it cute?

895
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,900
- This is...
- Did you buy this for me?

896
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,220
Isn't it so cute? Adorable, huh?

897
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,050
Gosh, so adorable.

898
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,350
So cute. You look the same.

899
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:03,490
I was walking by and noticed that 
the bunny looked just like you.

900
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:05,430
- That's why I bought it for you.
- What in the world?

901
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,800
- Hug me for a minute.
- What if people see us?

902
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:09,880
Who's going to look? People are...

903
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,400
- Hug me.
- No...

904
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,460
Thirty seconds.

905
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,790
- Thirty seconds.
- No.

906
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,080
Fine. Twenty seconds.

907
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,180
Yay!

908
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,620
- Hug me, hug me.
- Jang Joon Ah.

909
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,670
What?

910
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:25,930
What do you mean?

911
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:28,630
Why do you barge in 
without saying anything?

912
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,120
"You"?

913
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,940
What brings you here, Director?

914
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,630
Jang Joon Ah.

915
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:38,080
Did you submit this as a finished product?

916
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,520
Yes, I submitted it as my final.

917
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,100
The concept and styling are
 totally messed up.

918
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,230
Did you do the styling for this one?

919
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,060
- Yes.
- See?

920
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:51,920
You got a ridiculous product because 
you hired someone without any basics.

921
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,590
I don't think it's that 
ridiculous, though. Right?

922
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:55,950
Director.

923
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:58,540
I worked on it based on
 the design team's feedback.

924
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,560
I don't think it's ridiculous.

925
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,810
And the company asked
 me to come work here.

926
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:05,020
Good, good, good job.

927
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,680
Had I been involved from the beginning,

928
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,760
I would've never selected you, 
Lee Hae Deun.

929
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,680
What do you want me to do about it?
 I'm already here.

930
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,030
Hire a professional model

931
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:16,570
and start over.

932
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:18,150
Hey.

933
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,310
- Hey, hey.
- Jang Seo Ah!

934
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,840
"Jang Seo Ah"?

935
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,120
Aren't you thoughtless here?

936
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,700
Hold yourself back.

937
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:32,700
- What?
- You could dislike it as a director.

938
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,570
But to rip up the work that someone

939
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:37,300
worked so hard on is substandard.

940
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,210
Substandard?

941
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:42,240
It looks like you're in a foul mood 
and are taking it out on us.

942
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,780
But still, this is wrong!

943
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,850
- Hey!
- What?

944
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,420
What are you two doing?

945
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,120
People will come in.

946
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,000
You know that the police interrogated me. 
So you think I'm easy, too?

947
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,410
What are you talking about?

948
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:55,620
- Hey, Seo Ah...
 - How rude are you?

949
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,110
You and Bit Chae Woon are the same!

950
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,800
You just found that out? 
My unni and I could go bonkers.

951
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,910
What?

952
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:05,360
I see. I guess this is how you
 mistreated my sister, too.

953
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,700
It's a miracle that Bit Chae Woon
 still lets you live. She's a saint!

954
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,620
- Hae Deun, please...
- Oppa!

955
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:14,250
Fire her right away!

956
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,270
Fine! Fire me! Go ahead!

957
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:19,380
Geez, what are you two doing?

958
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,850
This is nuts. Seriously.

959
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,960
Geez, this is nuts.

960
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,360
Director.

961
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,620
I'll apologize sincerely. Sorry.

962
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,340
I just have to do it over, right?

963
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:38,050
And you shouldn't tell me to
 fire my employee...

964
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:39,880
Director Lee. Hae Deun...

965
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,630
Gosh, I'm about to go crazy 
because of you, Seo Ah.

966
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:48,340
Hey, what are you doing? 
What's with this?

967
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:53,470
Seo Ah, I realize you're on edge 
after the police interrogation.

968
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:55,880
But this isn't right. 
What the heck is this?

969
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:58,800
Let's calm down. Please?

970
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:09,270
Director Lee, geez...

971
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:15,550
Lee Hae Deun.

972
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:16,910
Lee Hae Deun!

973
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:22,290
Director, did something happen?

974
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:24,960
How could two sisters be so same?

975
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,080
Tell Lee Hae Deun to get out now.

976
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,080
What's going on?

977
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,420
Was there trouble between 
you and Hae Deun?

978
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,960
Hae Deun doesn't insist 
on things without reason.

979
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,410
Are you siding with her
 because she's your sister?

980
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:39,380
This is your workplace.

981
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:45,110
Seo Ah, I know you're having 
a hard time right now.

982
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,760
But you shouldn't take it out 
on people like this.

983
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:50,430
Let go.

984
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,760
Fine.

985
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,230
I could be siding with Hae Deun
 because she's my sister.

986
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:02,220
But if you were in a similar situation,
 I'd side with you.

987
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,050
Because we're sisters.

988
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:06,540
What did Hae Deun do wrong?

989
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,750
Tell me. I'll talk to her. Please?

990
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,110
I heard from the CEO.

991
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:23,060
That you're trying to resolve things.

992
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,380
I think it's very brave and 
you're doing the right thing.

993
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,030
I want to help you if I could, Seo Ah.

994
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,270
Did you have a nice honeymoon?

995
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:12,680
Yes.

996
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,410
Where do you guys live?

997
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:16,000
I'm living with my father.

998
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,340
Aigoo, at the father-in-law's house.

999
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,280
It must be uncomfortable for Seo Yeon.

1000
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,920
I'm sure it's not that uncomfortable.

1001
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,270
She's close to my father.

1002
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:25,780
Really?

1003
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,400
No matter how close they are, 
he's still her in-law.

1004
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,560
Pardon?

1005
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,250
Why did you want to meet me?

1006
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:34,910
What kind of work are you 
doing these days?

1007
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:38,190
I'm not doing anything bad. I cut ties 
with Chairwoman Lee Choon Suk, too.

1008
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:40,770
I'm not saying you might be
 into anything bad.

1009
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:44,120
If you're not doing anything, 
come out and work at my site.

1010
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:47,470
Are you looking after 
your father-in-law?

1011
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:50,790
Because you're Chae Woon's father.

1012
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:52,870
Chae Woon wouldn't like this, but

1013
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:55,150
I want to look after you.

1014
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:57,240
Thank you for saying that, but

1015
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,510
the construction work doesn't suit me.

1016
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:03,030
Then what kind of work 
are you going to do?

1017
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:04,900
- At this rate...
- So...

1018
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,860
I found something that
 totally suits me.

1019
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,420
What is it?

1020
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,960
I'll let you know when 
the deal goes through.

1021
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:18,390
You're not doing something terrible like 
getting paid to do things, are you?

1022
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:19,790
No, no.

1023
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:23,410
Would I do things like that after 
seeing what you went through?

1024
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:25,090
And...

1025
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:28,260
this is small, but it's my wedding gift.

1026
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:33,820
I made it with loving care in every stitch.

1027
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:38,290
I'm giving you a gift that I made myself

1028
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:40,640
- but once I make tons of money...
- No, no.

1029
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,750
This stuffed animal. It's perfect.

1030
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,910
Don't think about getting something 
for us by making lots of money.

1031
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:49,710
Geez, you don't trust me at all.

1032
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:51,240
I'm sad.

1033
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:14,380
Geez, Father. What is he trying to do?

1034
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,660
Moong-i.

1035
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,160
Are you busy, hubby?

1036
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,030
I'm swamped, but

1037
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:30,520
I was thinking about 
my lovely wife Moong-i.

1038
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,720
What's going on?

1039
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,250
Just because. I wanted
 to hear your voice.

1040
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,700
I have to go somewhere today. 
Do you want to go with me later?

1041
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,420
Where?

1042
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,680
Hae Deun. Hae Deun...

1043
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,900
Why are you walking so fast?

1044
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,410
You don't look it, but you're so fast.

1045
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,220
You didn't go out to dinner?

1046
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:56,040
I heard the design team was eating
 together for working late.

1047
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,190
How can I go there 
without you, Hae Deun?

1048
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,190
Wait. Talk to me for a minute.

1049
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:07,730
The police interrogated Director Jang?

1050
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:12,040
Yes. She went in voluntarily 
and was questioned.

1051
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,270
For ruining Jae Hee's contract?

1052
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,910
That's right.

1053
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:19,500
Seo Ah is on edge lately 
because of that.

1054
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,520
You know her temper.

1055
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:26,160
She's trying to keep her temper in 
check but tends to burst on whomever.

1056
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,410
But she still shouldn't
 take it out on me.

1057
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,640
I'm not her emotional trash can.

1058
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,140
I know. I know.

1059
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,910
People with weak mental 
power do that.

1060
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:35,970
They behave contrary to their feelings.

1061
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:39,800
Seo Ah was always so anxious, 
even as a child.

1062
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,600
I feel so sorry for her 
as her older brother.

1063
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:48,130
I regret it a lot, thinking that
 I should've been nicer to her.

1064
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:51,640
That's why I probably sided 
with her earlier.

1065
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,340
You were hurt, huh?

1066
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,450
Yes.

1067
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,300
I'm really sorry, Hae Deun.

1068
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,440
I'm really sorry.

1069
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:05,940
In some ways, I think you're 
really close to me.

1070
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,540
So I guess I did that inadvertently.

1071
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:10,480
I must've thought that you'd 
understand how I feel.

1072
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,650
Can't you understand me 
a little bit? Just a little bit?

1073
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:17,760
I'm having a hard time these days 
because of Seo Ah. I'm so drained.

1074
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,580
So please be just
 a little bit understanding.

1075
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:28,800
Koala! Did you wait long?

1076
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,310
Gosh, why call me Koala?
 I'm your hubby now.

1077
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:34,230
What should I call you?

1078
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,170
How about be traditional 
and call me "honey"?

1079
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,070
Geez, nah. It's weird.

1080
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:40,670
It's weird? How about "honey-buns"?

1081
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,920
Gosh, I get goosebumps.

1082
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:47,230
You're "Koala-honey-buns," so...

1083
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,540
How about "Ko-bong"?

1084
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:49,930
Ko-bong.

1085
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:52,500
Ko-bong? No way. Never mind. 
Just call me Koala.

1086
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,250
Why? It's nice. Ko-bong.

1087
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,800
Ko-bong, Ko-bong, Ko-bong.

1088
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,410
Ko-bong.

1089
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,940
Father looks busy.

1090
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:02,970
It's a busy time.

1091
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:08,120
Wow, Father will be so touched when 
he finds out we came to take him home.

1092
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,700
Let's go and help him.

1093
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,790
No. I think he has about 30 minutes left.

1094
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:14,730
Should we go to Samgwang Villa
 and see Mother?

1095
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,440
Should we?

1096
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,190
I'm so sad and having a hard time.

1097
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:26,150
I wonder if I wasted my life.

1098
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:28,630
I feel like it's all my fault.

1099
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:31,940
Why is that your fault?

1100
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,820
All right. I'll try to be understanding.

1101
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:39,670
You'll try to be understanding?

1102
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:42,600
Are you less angry now?

1103
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,010
Hae Deun, be a little understanding...

1104
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:48,910
I'm sorry. Please forgive me 
this once, Hae Deun.

1105
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:51,690
- Don't do that again.
- I won't do it again. I promise.

1106
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:53,810
I promise. I'll be on your side
 no matter what.

1107
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,320
- Really.
- Really. I'll be on your side.

1108
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,620
Do you forgive me then?

1109
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,390
- I'll see about that.
- Give me a kiss.

1110
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:02,170
Put a stamp on it to seal the deal.

1111
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:05,050
Once. Hurry. Someone will see us.

1112
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,030
What the heck?

1113
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,170
Unni.

1114
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:16,580
Hey.

1115
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,370
Joon... Joon Ah...

1116
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:20,960
You guys...

1117
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:26,000
You must be shocked.

1118
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,780
Hae Deun. Hae Deun, it's okay. 
Come here.

1119
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:30,360
It's okay.

1120
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,850
I mean...

1121
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,200
It's okay.

1122
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:38,170
- Holding hands?
- Oh, hands!

1123
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:40,840
We were just holding our hands.

1124
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:43,220
Were you together? 
Congrats on your wedding.

1125
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,740
Congrats.

1126
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,350
Oh, what?

1127
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:50,320
Run! Run! Run!

1128
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,890
- Run!
- Lee Hae Deun!

1129
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,930
Hey!

1130
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,450
Come here! Jang Joon Ah!

1131
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:57,280
Get them!

1132
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,720
♫   Honey, baby, sweetie, darling, good!  ♫

1133
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:06,760
♫   It's good! It's very, very good   ♫

1134
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:14,540
♫   I totally fell for you   ♫

1135
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:21,030
♫   It's perfect! You're truly perfect   ♫

1136
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:28,620
♫   It's a destiny like a present   ♫

1137
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:34,300
♫   The pretty face with a big big smile   ♫

1138
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,070
 

1139
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:38,580
 Am I not your senior now, Unni? Right? 

1140
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:40,040
 Lee Hae Deun! 

1141
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,590
 Do what? Remarry? 

1142
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:43,900
 That's right. I'll start anew. 

1143
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,770
 You begin your new life, too. 

1144
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,950
 Oh, my gosh! 

1145
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:53,430
 Excuse me. Is there a jokbal 
place around here? 

1146
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:56,070
 - By chance, are you Eun Ji?
- Hwak Se oppa? 

1147
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:57,400
 Hwak Se oppa! 

1148
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,910
 It's my first time holding 
Seo Yeon's hand. 

1149
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:02,270
 Take good care of my Seo Yeon. 

1150
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:05,350
 He must've been in the
 same prison with Park Pil Hong. 

1151
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:06,660
 Mother. 

1152
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,200
 It's not true, is it? 

1153
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,610
 There was some misunderstanding, right? 

1154
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:11,770
 Jae Hee. 

1155
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:14,130
 Why open your store here? 
Samgwang Villa is right there. 

1156
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:15,090
 Jae Hee? 

1157
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:16,630
 What brings you here? 

1158
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:20,190
 Hello. I'm Lee Dong Chool, 
and I opened up this tailor shop today. 

1159
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:21,930
♫   The best!  ♫

1160
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:23,715
♫   Honey, baby, sweetie, darling, good!  ♫
