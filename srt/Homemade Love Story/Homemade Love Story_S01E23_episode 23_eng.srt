1
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,580
 

2
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,700
What are you looking at?

3
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,830
Did you really get your memory back?

4
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,670
What's your name?

5
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,090
Huh?

6
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,780
Huh?

7
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,140
Geez.

8
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,690
How many times are you asking me?

9
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,400
Am I stupid?

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,830
I just can't believe it.

11
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,680
Just tell me one more time. 
Your name is?

12
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,260
Woo Jung Hoo.

13
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,130
Your name is Jung Min Jae.

14
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,760
My son is Woo Jae Hee.

15
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,860
You're back. Your back! You're back!

16
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,600
- Ouch!
- You're back, Honey!

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,900
- Honey, gosh...
- What's wrong with you?

18
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,490
Gosh, Jae Hee.

19
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,590
What did his doctor say?

20
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,220
He says he's fine.

21
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,840
But you never know, so he should stay 
here tonight for them to monitor.

22
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,250
You should have a complete 
examination in the morning.

23
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,880
Okay, he should.

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,510
Honey, you did great.
 I'm so glad you're back.

25
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,730
Dad, did you get your memory back?

26
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,900
Dad, do you remember 
your name? Your name?

27
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,760
Tell me your name.

28
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,520
Gosh, hey.

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,320
I just asked him.

30
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,210
He knows it clearly.

31
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,480
Oh, really?

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,200
Then, what's 32 + 62?

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,560
Geez, look at this guy.

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,190
Hey, is this an IQ test or something?

35
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,210
Just the basics... I guess...

36
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,750
Honey, honey, honey.

37
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,220
Do you remember living 
in Samgwang Villa?

38
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,010
You don't remember?

39
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,940
He doesn't. He doesn't remember.

40
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,300
So, when he gets his old memory back,

41
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,900
I guess he forgets things 
he went through

42
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,490
while he lost his memory?

43
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,980
Well, well, I wouldn't know.

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,950
From a movie I watched
 a long time ago,

45
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,120
I feel like I saw that. Am I wrong?

46
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,040
So, is this the only hospital
 room available?

47
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,140
Did you reserve this room, Honey?

48
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,540
- Why?
- I did.

49
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,160
With my credit card?

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,890
Do you know how expensive
 a private room is?

51
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,980
- He's back! He's back!
- He's back.

52
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,090
He's back!

53
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,760
Aigoo.

54
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,320
- I'm dizzy.
- Lie down.

55
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,970
Do you have to go to the bathroom?

56
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,190
I should go home.

57
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,880
I'm perfectly fine. Why sleep here?

58
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,500
I told you earlier.

59
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,610
You have to have more examinations.
 You have to stay overnight.

60
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,450
They have to monitor you, too.

61
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,070
I'll go home and come back.

62
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,660
You go and pay our bill. We're leaving.

63
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,310
Gosh, the house was 
left empty too long.

64
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,740
It'd feel empty if you go now. 
Just sleep here tonight.

65
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,360
Even if we pay our bill now, they'll 
count tonight as if you slept here.

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,060
Really?

67
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,760
Geez, what a waste.

68
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,440
 Go ahead. 

69
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,530
 Right. 

70
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,120
 That man wasn't Woo Jung Hoo. 

71
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,630
 Yoo Jae Hee! 

72
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,110
 I know I should be extremely 
happy about this, but... 

73
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,140
 I know, but... 

74
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,850
Are you guys going to 
stay here like this?

75
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,720
Honey, you go home, and you, too.

76
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Do you know where I live?

77
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,520
Do you remember living together
 in Samgwang Villa?

78
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,890
Lower the bed.

79
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,050
Do it slowly! I'm dizzy!

80
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,400
It's automatic...

81
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,590
Chae Woon.

82
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,590
What brings you here all of a sudden?

83
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,100
To give this back to you.

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,230
Gosh...

85
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,370
Why did you bring this back?

86
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,730
I gave it to you to keep it.

87
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,720
I had nothing to give you, so...

88
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,850
You treasure this so much.

89
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,630
How can you give this to me?

90
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,450
Is that why you came here?

91
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,560
Yeah.

92
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,920
Are you feeling sick or anything?

93
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,570
How about you?

94
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,750
I'm fine, too.

95
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,060
I'm fine.

96
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,560
Chae Woon.

97
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,930
You...

98
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,780
answered that phone call, right?

99
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,020
Your grandmother.

100
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,080
 I told you it'd be over if 
you take the blame, Soon Jung. 

101
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,700
Yeah.

102
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,060
Whatever she says...

103
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,820
Don't pay attention to her.

104
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,990
I don't care.

105
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,890
But...

106
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,420
I can't let her put everything on you.

107
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,750
Chae Woon.

108
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,280
Don't worry, Mom.

109
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,900
I'm doing fine.

110
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,150
By chance...

111
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,540
did that grandma...

112
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,220
say something else to you?

113
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,250
No.

114
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,650
Don't worry about me.

115
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,030
I'm standing firm.

116
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,610
Are Hae Deun and Ra Hoon home?

117
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,150
- I'll go in and say hi.
- Chae Woon.

118
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,200
Just leave.

119
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,400
It was hard for you to 
move into the CEO's house.

120
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,850
Don't let that effort be wasted

121
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,420
and go. Okay?

122
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,160
Hurry.

123
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,100
Hurry.

124
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,090
Be careful going home.

125
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,120
 Am I the only one in this house? 

126
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,030
 - Hey, why don't you ask Na Ro oppa? 
- Go. Hurry.

127
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,700
 - Come on! 
- Go on.

128
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,600
 - You keep it down.
- Hurry. 

129
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,290
Geez.

130
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,020
Arguing again?

131
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,340
 Gosh, it's the box collection. 

132
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,650
 Right. Where did you put them? 

133
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,470
 Behind the kitchen. 

134
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,440
 - I'll get it.
- Why don't you do it right? 

135
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,130
 Bring out the bottle collection, too. 

136
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,460
 Okay! 

137
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,860
Aigoo, aigoo, look at this.

138
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,160
It's all red here.

139
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,460
 Stay still, Kim Hye Soo. 

140
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,290
Hwak Se, you got lipstick on here.

141
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,440
Really?

142
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,290
- Bit Chae!
- Hey, Chae Woon!

143
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,470
Hey!

144
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,100
- Auntie.
- You...

145
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,030
I thought you went out of town 
on a job. Back already?

146
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,950
Oh, well...

147
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,480
You went there, came back, 
and going back again, right?

148
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,060
Your mom said you'll stay out there 
a long time this time around.

149
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,610
- Yeah, yeah, right.
- Yeah.

150
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,190
Oh, I see. That's why Noonim
 looked so down.

151
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,900
Since Chae Woon left.

152
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,810
- Is Mom not feeling well?
- What? No.

153
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,740
Why would she feel down? No.

154
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,960
Ouch! Why?

155
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,860
Hwak Se.

156
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,770
- Go ahead.
- What?

157
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,290
You go ahead.

158
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,260
I have to go anyway. I have something
 to take care of at the jokbal place.

159
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,250
Chae Woon, stay healthy and be well.

160
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,300
Don't get sick.

161
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,760
You're coming home 
on the weekend, right?

162
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,540
Gosh, come on. Go! Hurry!

163
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,860
All right. I'm going.

164
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,340
Bye, Chae Woon.

165
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,600
Take care, Uncle.

166
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,990
Are you feeling sick?

167
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,040
You know I'm super healthy.

168
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,170
I'm born healthy.

169
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,360
Are you happy to live 
with your real mom?

170
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,420
Do I seem happy?

171
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,910
You look rotten.

172
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,370
Mom seemed to be 
having a tough time.

173
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,260
That's why I left.

174
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,530
I'm glad you did.

175
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,700
I'm glad you did, but...

176
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,540
But your mom told me 
not to ask you

177
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,020
so I couldn't ask you.

178
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,570
There's something else wrong, huh?

179
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,890
That's why you left, right?

180
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,770
Hey, I know you take after me
 for your nasty temper,

181
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,040
but I know you wouldn't run off

182
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,050
just to live a good life 
by yourself. Right?

183
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,070
Auntie.

184
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,760
Do you remember when Mom 
brought me home for the first time?

185
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,230
Do you know who left me with Mom

186
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,130
back then?

187
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,370
Well, I was busy studying then.

188
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,800
I lived away from your mom.

189
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,510
Your mom was working
 in a factory in Seoul.

190
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,540
But she left for another 
province all of a sudden.

191
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,230
She said she got a job at an 
orphanage in another province.

192
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,650
That's probably because
 she had to raise you,

193
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,460
and that's why she moved.

194
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,150
To raise me,

195
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,850
she had to give up everything, huh?

196
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,720
Auntie, take care of Mom for me.

197
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,760
I couldn't compare to you.

198
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,050
Let me give you a hug.

199
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,680
Chae Woon...

200
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,130
Will you call me if 
something bothers you?

201
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,960
Call me, okay?

202
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,420
Hey. You know I'm a good fighter, right?

203
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,610
Of course, I know.

204
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,070
Especially Jung Won unni's daughter, 
Jang Seo Ah or whatever bothers you,

205
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,900
call me right away. Got it?

206
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,430
Okay.

207
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,760
Hey, I heard that James ahjussi

208
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,880
went home earlier today.

209
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,790
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

210
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,770
Min Jae unni, no...

211
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,080
your boyfriend's mom came 
by and took him home.

212
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,280
Then you know...

213
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,410
James ahjussi is Mr. Woo's father?

214
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,340
Yeah.

215
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,690
My Hwak Se told me.

216
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,970
"My" Hwak Se?

217
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,940
Not just Hwak Se?

218
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,510
I just said Hwak Se.

219
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,280
- You just said, "my."
- Nah...

220
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,770
- You just did.
- No, I didn't.

221
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,290
I didn't say that.

222
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,710
I'm sure I heard it.

223
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,180
You didn't hear that. You heard wrong.

224
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,970
Focus on your stuff.

225
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,580
Mom, go home and sleep. I'll stay here.

226
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,340
No, I'll stay here.

227
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,560
I don't know how he'll be 
through the night.

228
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,200
I'm too anxious to go home.

229
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,590
Then lie down on the sofa.

230
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,650
I'm comfortable here.

231
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,130
How is your depression, Mom?

232
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,460
I should've paid more 
attention to you. I'm sorry.

233
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,890
I'm taking medication and
 have therapy sessions.

234
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,620
I'm getting better.

235
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,230
I had no idea the aftermath of 
your divorce would be this bad.

236
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,250
I thought you'd always stay bold.

237
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,610
To end our relationship 
as a married couple

238
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,120
was a huge ordeal.

239
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,110
But still, you're doing well. 
I'm proud of you.

240
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,400
Whoa.

241
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,690
Bit Chae Woon, wow. Answer it.

242
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,340
 Min Jae is suffering from depression? 

243
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,540
 Gosh, I had no idea. 

244
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,040
Moong-i.

245
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,990
Koala.

246
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,000
I just heard.

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,230
I heard your father left Samgwang Villa.

248
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,430
Oh, you heard.

249
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,160
 Are you still at your father's? 

250
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,620
No, well...

251
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,510
At the hospital.

252
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,950
Hospital?

253
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,270
Why?

254
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,720
Well...

255
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,370
An amazing thing happened today.

256
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,320
Dad got his memory back.

257
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,880
That Chae Woon. 
Why did she bring this back?

258
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,980
 Actually, I have a superstition of my own. 

259
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,640
If I wish for something desperately,

260
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,440
I do this.

261
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,400
Blow this away...

262
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,130
and my wish comes true.

263
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,960
- Really?
- Yeah.

264
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,330
When my youngest sister 
Jung Ok got sick with tuberculosis,

265
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,200
and when they didn't pay me 
for my delivery job.

266
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,380
When I blew petals like this,
 everything was taken care of.

267
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,050
Wow!

268
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,720
You know the novel you 
submitted to a competition?

269
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,120
Try blowing this like this

270
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,600
and pray, "Please let me make it."

271
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,410
Then you'll make it.

272
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,560
♫  Your heart that comes through my fingers  ♫

273

284
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,881
How can you do that?

285
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:43,631
I heard you went to see a movie 
with Soon Jung in the town!

286
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:48,511
Well, I got free tickets out of the blue.

287
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:52,551
The manager of the theater gave 
them to me instead of my pay.

288
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:56,291
I like James Dean, too!

289
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,861
I really like him!

290
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:09,611
- Min Jae...
- Gosh, seriously!

291
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:14,171
James Dean.

292
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:19,461
"James" came from James Dean.

293
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:24,951
James Dean was stuck in his head.

294
00:19:24,951 --> 00:19:27,691
Since Soon Jung liked him.

295
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:29,151
♫  My love  ♫

296

Come on, Jung Min Jae...

303
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:58,291
Soon Jung unni says... so...

304
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:02,451
Ms. Lee pleaded with me.

305
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,731
I had no choice but to accept it.

306
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:08,401
Okay?

307
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:10,531
Won't you answer me?

308
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:12,341
- Yes.
- Right.

309
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:17,541
But you know, if you're 
going to live with me,

310
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:20,341
well...

311
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:22,591
you'll have to tighten up.

312
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:24,461
Okay.

313
00:20:24,461 --> 00:20:26,601
I'm...

314
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,571
a very neat person.

315
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:34,131
Yeah. It's almost OCD level.

316
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:37,001
So, as my roommate,

317
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:40,531
you should be very clean.

318
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,171
Well, Aunt...

319
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:46,171
"Aunt?" No, no, no.

320
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:48,941
No "Aunt." Call me "unni."

321
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:51,341
Unni? Unni...

322
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:55,421
Well, Unni...

323
00:20:55,421 --> 00:21:00,521
I noticed that this room was 
messy, to begin with.

324
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:02,821
I see...

325
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,651
Is that right?

326
00:21:04,651 --> 00:21:06,501
As for that,

327
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:09,131
wouldn't it differ depending 
on your perspective?

328
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:11,201
If you think it looks messy here,

329
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:13,721
then you just have to clean up.

330
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:15,031
Right?

331
00:21:15,031 --> 00:21:16,431
Yup.

332
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:18,131
Okay.

333
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:20,831
Cool evening...

334
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:23,181
Gosh, so cold.

335
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,701
Geez, such a crybaby.

336
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:42,611
Why did she cry then?

337
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:48,731
Oh, my God!

338
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:51,781
Oppa!

339
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:54,681
Hey, Seo Ah, how did you 
know to come here?

340
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:57,741
Is Mom here with you? Where is she?

341
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:59,791
- I'm leaving.
- Hey!

342
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,681
Gosh!

343
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:13,081
Whoa...

344
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,181
It's unbelievable.

345
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:19,011
What do you mean, unbelievable?

346
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:20,821
My lovely sister Seo Ah...

347
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:23,001
Drink this and...

348
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:24,681
calm down. Here.

349
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:26,601
How can you laugh now?

350
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:28,661
Well...

351
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:33,251
If you were back from London, 
why didn't you call me?

352
00:22:34,191 --> 00:22:36,551
Aren't you just too much?

353
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:39,891
No, I think you're the one 
who's too much.

354
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,041
It cost 10,000 won for four cans...

355
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,921
so I thought it was now to
 buy them. Yet you spilled it.

356
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:46,551
All right, all right.

357
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:50,231
Okay, I thought if Mom
 finds out I'm here,

358
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:52,651
she'd pester me to come out to work.

359
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:54,751
Mom doesn't know I'm here yet, right?

360
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:57,281
You haven't told her yet, right?

361
00:22:57,281 --> 00:22:58,851
Oppa.

362
00:22:58,851 --> 00:23:02,511
Do you know what's going on at home?

363
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:06,291
I don't know. You haven't told me. 
What's going on?

364
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:09,121
Chae Woon...

365
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:14,091
Where did she go?

366
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:23,671
What?

367
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:26,291
Daebak. For real?

368
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,091
So Mom has...

369
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:29,441
She had another daughter?

370
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,531
And that daughter is 
Woo Jae Hee's girlfriend?

371
00:23:31,531 --> 00:23:32,811
Yeah.

372
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,841
Now you know how much 
I struggled alone.

373
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:38,401
With things going down this way,

374
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:41,841
you don't even call me, 
and I was all alone.

375
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:46,451
Hey, hey, Seo Ah.

376
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:48,491
Aigoo...

377
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:51,191
Aigoo, my baby sister. Don't cry.

378
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:54,501
Hey, but...

379
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:59,001
it's not like you were dating
 Woo Jae Hee, though.

380
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:00,811
- Hey!
- Scared me.

381
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:03,101
Gosh, seriously!

382
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:04,981
You did. You dated him 
no matter what.

383
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:07,111
Why change now?

384
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:16,471
Why did you come this late at night?

385
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:19,311
I know you're happy.

386
00:24:21,731 --> 00:24:23,471
Aren't you cold?

387
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:29,651
When Dad couldn't regain
 consciousness earlier,

388
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:31,831
I thought this all of a sudden.

389
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:38,451
"Oh, I got close to Dad 
after all this time."

390
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:43,781
 A handsome young man shouldn't 
walk around with this. 

391
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:46,141
 Yoo Jae Hee, you're awesome. 

392
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:49,681
 I'll just sleep here with him. 

393
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:52,101
 I think I can sleep well tonight. 

394
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:53,901
 I feel so comfortable for some reason. 

395
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:55,311
 Of course, I'm fine! 

396
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:59,031
 Not because he's my dad... 

397
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,851
 and not because I'm his son. 

398
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:05,111
As my roommate James.

399
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:08,741
I thought I grew close to him.

400
00:25:10,891 --> 00:25:13,221
I think I know how you feel.

401
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:18,681
But don't you think you felt 
that way before?

402
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:21,521
Before your father lost his memory.

403
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:26,171
Back then, you argued with him a lot,

404
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:29,351
fought, and got hurt.

405
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:32,231
But I'm sure you didn't
 feel that way inside.

406
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:35,751
It's because you shut
 the door to your heart.

407
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:37,961
I'm not sure.

408
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:39,521
Do you think so?

409
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:44,991
But if Dad doesn't remember 
his time at Samgwang Villa,

410
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:47,161
I think I'd be very sad.

411
00:25:47,161 --> 00:25:50,621
Because it's where you made 
memories with your dad?

412
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:56,031
Moong, I'm so touched.

413
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:58,281
You came running over right 
after talking on the phone.

414
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:02,181
You sounded like you were struggling.

415
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,521
Oh! My voice.

416
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:07,241
Okay, my voice.

417
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:09,331
You can't use that again.

418
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:10,591
Your voice card.

419
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:12,451
I can't use that again. Okay.

420
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:19,161
It's CEO.

421
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:26,011
Yes.

422
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:28,801
Chae Woon, where are you right now?

423
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:32,261
I'm sorry, I stepped out for a moment...

424
00:26:32,261 --> 00:26:33,661
You didn't tell her?

425
00:26:39,521 --> 00:26:42,141
Something got mixed in her box?

426
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:45,291
She probably wanted to go over
 using that as an excuse.

427
00:26:49,781 --> 00:26:52,261
Mom, I'm home.

428
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:55,431
You're home late. Did you have plans?

429
00:26:55,431 --> 00:26:58,681
I just worked late.

430
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:01,921
Did Bit Chae Woon go somewhere?

431
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:04,221
I guess she went out for a second.

432
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,181
Bit Chae Woon's old clothes?

433
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:15,861
I guess she's here for good.

434
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:19,831
So scuzzy.

435
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:22,891
- I'll go change.
- Seo Ah.

436
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:25,601
Yes?

437
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:32,541
I understand that you're stressed out
 and struggling because of Chae Woon.

438
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:36,811
But it bothers me that you 
talk like that, you know?

439
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:40,491
 Because Bit Chae Woon is 
your real daughter? 

440
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:42,851
 And I'm not even your real daughter... 

441
00:27:42,851 --> 00:27:44,661
 and am being rude to her? 

442
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:49,311
Of course, I know it's not easy for you.

443
00:27:49,311 --> 00:27:51,991
I'm still bewildered myself.

444
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:55,371
But could you consider me 
and try a little bit...

445
00:27:56,561 --> 00:27:59,821
I'm sorry. I was shortsighted.

446
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:03,271
You know I get jealous easily.

447
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:04,791
I'm sorry.

448
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:06,491
I'll try harder.

449
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:10,711
Thanks, Seo Ah.

450
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:13,031
Thank you so much.

451
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:30,261
Whoa, chives. Are you making
 me chives kimchi?

452
00:28:31,301 --> 00:28:33,451
How did you know?

453
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:35,941
I noticed we were running
 low on chive kimchi,

454
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:39,791
I thought, "My mom will be 
making chive kimchi soon."

455
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:41,391
Since I love it.

456
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:42,971
Aigoo.

457
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,501
Gosari!

458
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:47,551
You're going to make me 
yukgaejang. Right?

459
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:50,171
Aigoo, how could it not be?

460
00:28:50,171 --> 00:28:53,651
I was craving yukgaejang this morning...

461
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:55,521
and you're making it right away!

462
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:57,091
- Gosh.
- Hey, come on.

463
00:28:57,091 --> 00:28:59,211
My gosh.

464
00:28:59,211 --> 00:29:01,901
I'll put lots of gosari...

465
00:29:01,901 --> 00:29:03,881
and make boiling hot yukgaejang.

466
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:05,241
- Eat it in the morning.
- Okay.

467
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:07,201
I'll eat two bowls.

468
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:09,221
No, I'll eat three bowls.

469
00:29:09,221 --> 00:29:10,461
Yeah, sure.

470
00:29:10,461 --> 00:29:13,121
Are you craving something else?

471
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:15,701
Well, soojunggwa.

472
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:18,501
You know the kind where 
walnuts are stuck in jujubes,

473
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:20,791
and they're sliced in there.

474
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:23,151
Gosh, in any case...

475
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:25,521
you always ask for food 
that takes lots of work.

476
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:28,631
You trained me that way, Mom.

477
00:29:28,631 --> 00:29:32,251
You always made me food 
that takes time and affection.

478
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:34,631
Oh, yeah. I also want that.

479
00:29:34,631 --> 00:29:37,661
The mulkimchi with carrots
 and cucumbers

480
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:39,911
that are cut in a flower shape.

481
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:13,031
 Mother, I'll sleep over at 
my dad's place tonight. 

482
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:15,841
 I thought you'd be worried. 
So I'm letting you know. 

483
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:22,281
 Thanks, Mr. Woo. 

484
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:25,061
 Is your father doing okay? 

485
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:36,261
 Yes, he's sleeping right now. 

486
00:30:38,191 --> 00:30:42,041
I guess I'll tell her later about 
regaining his memory.

487
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,771
 I'm sorry to text you so late. 

488
00:30:46,771 --> 00:30:48,561
 It's okay. 

489
00:30:48,561 --> 00:30:52,691
 I knew you were busy taking
 care of your father. 

490
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:57,351
 Mother, is Hwang Na Ro home? 

491
00:30:57,351 --> 00:30:58,991
 I'm not sure. 

492
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,571
 It looks like Na Ro is late. 

493
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:03,741
I'm home, Mother.

494
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:05,461
Hi, Na Ro. Give me a minute.

495
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,571
 Na Ro just came home. 

496
00:31:08,571 --> 00:31:10,431
 Goodnight. 

497
00:31:11,881 --> 00:31:13,921
 Yes, Mother. Goodnight. 

498
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:18,271
Na Ra, you're late.

499
00:31:18,271 --> 00:31:20,041
I guess you had a lot of work to do.

500
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,481
Yes, a little bit.

501
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:26,811
Gosh, you look so thin.

502
00:31:26,811 --> 00:31:30,321
You know how you got 
injured last time?

503
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,091
Are you not well because
 of what happened?

504
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,461
No.

505
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,481
Did you eat dinner?

506
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:40,201
I had a simple dinner.

507
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:43,591
Gosh, you can't eat a simple
 dinner. It was a cold day.

508
00:31:43,591 --> 00:31:46,371
- Stay. I'll set the table.
- No...

509
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,111
No, I don't have to eat.

510
00:31:48,111 --> 00:31:50,731
Gosh, sit down already.

511
00:31:50,731 --> 00:31:53,331
It won't even take five minutes
 to set the table. Sit down.

512
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:56,171
Sit down.

513
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:03,641
 Hwang Na Ro, that guy 
has a fraud record. 

514
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:06,661
Hwang Na Ro...

515
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:09,361
He hasn't moved out yet.

516
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:12,441
Is Cunning Penguin going somewhere?

517
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:15,001
Dad.

518
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:18,961
Dad, did you lose your memory again?

519
00:32:21,771 --> 00:32:23,391
Dad...

520
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:26,801
What? What, what?

521
00:32:26,841 --> 00:32:28,501
Just now, Dad...

522
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:31,571
went back to being James...

523
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:33,101
Was he sleep talking?

524
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:35,741
What? Did he lose his memory again?

525
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:37,411
Why?

526
00:32:37,411 --> 00:32:39,481
Aigoo...

527
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:42,311
Gosh...

528
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,341
Go back to sleep, Mom.

529
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:55,141
Aigoo, eat.

530
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:57,951
Yes, thank you.

531
00:33:03,661 --> 00:33:05,231
Aigoo.

532
00:33:05,231 --> 00:33:07,751
Eat slowly.

533
00:33:07,751 --> 00:33:10,951
If you get a stomachache at night,
 medicine won't even work.

534
00:33:10,951 --> 00:33:12,531
Okay.

535
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:17,181
Aigoo.

536
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:19,841
Perhaps because you lived 
overseas for a long time.

537
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:22,861
You're not good with chopsticks.

538
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:24,561
Give them to me.

539
00:33:28,991 --> 00:33:30,781
Scoop some rice.

540
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:36,891
Eat.

541
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:39,051
Thank you.

542
00:33:42,301 --> 00:33:44,901
- It's so delicious.
- Really?

543
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:46,531
Eat a lot.

544
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:51,861
Why are you preparing 
so many green onions?

545
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:54,511
Aigoo, is it spicy for you?

546
00:33:54,511 --> 00:33:55,941
Sorry.

547
00:33:55,941 --> 00:33:58,501
Gosh, let me see.

548
00:33:58,501 --> 00:34:01,961
Chae Woon loves chive kimchi.

549
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,201
Oh, I see.

550
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:09,731
 Ask for forgiveness... 

551
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:12,761
 and leave. 

552
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:17,401
- Here. Eat.
- Okay.

553
00:34:17,401 --> 00:34:20,211
- Eat the stew while it's hot.
- Okay.

554
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,740
 - CEO. 
- Yeah.

555
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,860
- I'm home.
- Come in.

556
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,820
It's okay. Come in.

557
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,580
Have a seat.

558
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,650
I'm sorry about earlier.

559
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,960
Because you disappeared,

560
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,270
I got so nervous.

561
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,730
No, it's my fault.

562
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,050
Here you go again.

563
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,630
You sound so proper.

564
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,440
I'm sorry...

565
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,740
Sorry.

566
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,930
Chae Woon.

567
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,360
I know...

568
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,520
that you didn't come here 
only to live with me.

569
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,640
Soon Jung...

570
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,480
It must be because of your mom.

571
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,420
Kind Soon Jung was...

572
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,460
struggling so much because of you.

573
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,930
At times...

574
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,230
when we didn't know we 
were mom and daughter...

575
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,980
when we met at work only...

576
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,300
I think...

577
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,160
we were closer and got 
along better then.

578
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,630
So I feel a bit uneasy.

579
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,690
So many things have
 happened all this time.

580
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,600
I'm sure it's because we're
 both exhausted. Right?

581
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:27,000
But still, I'd love it if 
you'd try a little harder

582
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,230
to open your heart.

583
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,020
Okay.

584
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,310
"Yes, CEO. I understand." 
Aren't you going to say that?

585
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,680
Yes, CEO. I understand.

586
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,030
Oh, yeah.

587
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,500
I was going to stop by at home 
and come back here straight,

588
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,440
but I heard that Jae Hee's 
father is hospitalized.

589
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,350
 I came home late because
 I stopped by there. 

590
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:57,060
 Jae Hee's father? Why? 

591
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,770
It's not anything serious.

592
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,890
He's just a bit ill.

593
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,650
Really?

594
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,190
It's too late now. I guess 
I'll visit him tomorrow.

595
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,170
I can't believe I had lost my memory.

596
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,560
 Who are you! 

597
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,850
 - Fighting!
- What are you doing? 

598
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,530
 Clang your glasses. 

599
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,040
 Hae Deun. 

600
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,620
 - You're right.
- Hae Deun! 

601
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,670
 I'm offended. Why do you think 
of me looking at this? 

602
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,970
 Didn't you get it? 

603
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,660
 I said let's get divorced. 

604
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,400
 Woo Jung Hoo, a divorce. 

605
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,700
 A divorce! 

606
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,660
 
 I'll get it notorized through a lawyer. 

607
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,160
 And I'll never come back to this house. 

608
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,850
 Stay healthy. 

609
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,860
 

610
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,690
Good morning.

611
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,310
You.

612
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,920
Am I dreaming? Am I?

613
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,580
It's not a dream. Hey!

614
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,180
- What are you doing here?
- It's me. Cha Ba Reun.

615
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,700
Why are you here?

616
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,310
Ms. Lee said I could live here.

617
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,430
- Mom did?
- Yeah.

618
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,410
She felt uneasy about me living 
at my friend's house.

619
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,860
She told me to move back in if 
I haven't found a place yet.

620
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,900
So I moved in yesterday.

621
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,930
Why didn't you tell me?

622
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,700
Surprise!

623
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,380
You're really...

624
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,750
Do you know how worried I was?

625
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,750
I couldn't even reach you.

626
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,460
Lee Ra Hoon, you were 
worried about me?

627
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,990
You missed me, huh?

628
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,130
Of course, I missed...

629
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,270
Well, you know...

630
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,150
I was worried.

631
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,700
Good to see you, Lee Ra Hoon.

632
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,850
I don't have to hide out anymore.

633
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:04,680
I can talk to you openly.

634
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,980
 - What were you thinking?
- I know. 

635
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,620
Hey!

636
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,190
You...

637
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,760
Whoa, you begged for forgiveness, 
and you're back?

638
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,160
Yes, I'm back, Unni.

639
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,520
Whoa, look at her.

640
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,450
Hey, you...

641
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,780
Noona...

642
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,960
Uncle, pull it together.

643
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,840
Don't come! Don't!

644
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,190
Don't come near!

645
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,560
Hello.

646
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,550
Oh? It's Ba Reun.

647
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,030
Aigoo...

648
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,520
Mr. Woo, I mean...

649
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,730
James ahjussi is Mr. Woo's father?

650
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,940
Yeah. Isn't it shocking?

651
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,400
Whoa...

652
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,490
No wonder. I thought they
 got along so well.

653
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:06,090
I feel sad that Ahjussi left so suddenly.

654
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,490
I know.

655
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,170
Gosh, I had no idea he'd
 leave so suddenly.

656
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:15,190
Wow, the table feels so empty 
without Eems hyung.

657
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,270
But still...

658
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:21,080
I'm so glad he got to go home.

659
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,810
In any case, he needs to 
get his memory back soon.

660
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,590
I couldn't even say goodbye.

661
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,340
He'll visit us, right?

662
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,220
Mother.

663
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,810
Did Woo Jae Hee go home
 to sleep last night?

664
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,220
Yeah...

665
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,040
He was worried about his father.

666
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,770
Geez, we had no idea that they had

667
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,590
great chemistry as father and son.

668
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,990
Gosh, it's hot.

669
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,590
Why am I so hot?

670
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,470
Unni.

671
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,230
Did you turn on the heater?

672
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,480
No, I turned it off this morning.

673
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,940
Are you hot?

674
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,850
Ba Reun.

675
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,850
Did you sleep okay?

676
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,730
Were you uncomfortable at all?

677
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,190
Yes. I slept well.

678
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,110
Eat a lot.

679
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,870
Mr. Hwang!

680
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,650
Pil Hong hyungnim.

681
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,960
You got an early start.

682
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,760
You have low blood pressure,

683
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,750
so it's not good for you to 
be active this early.

684
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,940
A**hole, did you say 
you're dating Seo Yeon?

685
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,030
My Seo Yeon, no...

686
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,790
Bit Chae Woon has 
a perfectly good boyfriend.

687
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,880
How dare you lie through your teeth?

688
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,550
You even checked?

689
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,070
You've been busy, Hyungnim.

690
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,330
You must know that your 
daughter Bit Chae Woon

691
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,920
went back to her birth mom.

692
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,850
A**hole, I told you to disappear from 
this neighborhood within 24 hours.

693
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,720
Are 24 hours that long to you?

694
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:16,220
Hyungnim, I won't disappear
 from this neighborhood.

695
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,970
You think I'd interfere with your business?

696
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,700
Gosh, no, no...

697
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,900
I'm not your rival anymore.

698
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,390
I changed my business target.

699
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:31,190
Bit Chae Woon isn't my
 business target anymore.

700
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,550
What?

701
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,260
Then who is it?

702
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,930
Well?

703
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:39,830
Who could it be?

704
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,470
I have to get going.

705
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:50,580
That a**hole...

706
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
Changed his target?

707
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,370
Could it be Jang Seo Ah?

708
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:03,280
Geez, he's got such a wide range.

709
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,770
Ride with us. We live in 
the same house. Why not?

710
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,280
I think I should go to work separately.

711
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,890
Yes, Mom.

712
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:16,280
We decide not to announce that 
Bit Chae Woon is your daughter yet.

713
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,170
I don't think we should create
 a misleading situation.

714
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,060
I'll see you at work.

715
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,260
See you later.

716
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,420
- Be careful.
- Okay.

717
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,400
Let's go to work, Mom.

718
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,940
I have to stop by somewhere.

719
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,590
- You go ahead.
- Where?

720
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,480
The sun feels nice.

721
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,260
Mom must love this.

722
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,210
Saying it's a perfect day 
to air out comforters.

723
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,920
♫  I love you  ♫

724
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,990
♫  I like you  ♫

725
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:16,270
♫  I trust you and only you  ♫

726
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,000
The sun feels so nice.

727
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:25,190
It's Chae Woon's favorite
 type of weather.

728
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:32,940
♫  To me, you're the only shining one  ♫

729
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,000
♫  Always stay this way  ♫

730
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,730
 
 Going to work? 

731
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,400
 Yeah, on my way to work. 

732
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,860
 How is your father? 

733
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,080
 He's being examined. 

734
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,220
 Congrats on going back to work, Moong-i. 

735
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,460
 My Moong-i, you'll be fine. Hooray! 

736
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:57,050
 Yup, I'll do a good job. 

737
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,570
 My Koala, everything will be fine. 

738
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,770
 Your father will be healthy, too. 

739
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,240
 I love you, Koala. 

740
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,940
♫  I can feel it by looking at your eyes  ♫

741
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,210
♫  Our deeper trust  ♫

742
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,770
 As hot as that sunshine... 

743
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,210
♫  We can dream together  ♫

744
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,730
What's with you, Bit Chae Woon?

745
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,660
Gosh, makes me cringe.

746
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,340
♫  I love you, I like you  ♫

747
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,720
♫  I trust you and only you  ♫

748
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,950
"I love you, Koala"?

749
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,210
I think... I think she sent it by mistake.

750
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:40,090
I got you, Moong-i.

751
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,870
 You sent it by mistake, huh? 

752
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:46,430
 Moong-i, hello? 

753
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:49,100
 Whatever! 

754
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,310
She did send it by mistake.

755
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,530
I'm so happy.

756
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,180
♫  I love you  ♫

757
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,760
It's the oldest daughter, huh?

758
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,090
Yes.

759
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,190
Dad, what did you just say?

760
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,310
 Ms. Woo Jung Hoo. 

761
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,140
Let's go to the next testing room.

762
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,660
Okay.

763
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:27,130
Why does James keep popping out 
of Dad since last night?

764
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,660
Is there any app that retrieves your text?

765
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,800
Gosh, this is bad.

766
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,810
 Testing, testing, Moong-i, Moong-i? 

767
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,440
 Reply, Moong-i. 

768
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,050
 It's nice being honest. 

769
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:44,810
 I feel the same way. 

770
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:47,790
 Geez, don't be embarrassed. 
It's between us. 

771
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,740
I shouldn't have said it first.

772
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,360
Gosh, I shouldn't have!

773
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,100
Hwang Na Ro...

774
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:06,530
 Oh, I don't think Hwang Na Ro
 moved out yet. 

775
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:09,480
 Be careful around him if 
you see him at work. 

776
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,360
Good morning, Bit Chae Woon.

777
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,850
Hwang Na Ro, you're still here.

778
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,030
You told me to leave, right?

779
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,800
I'm sure I said I love Samgwang Villa.

780
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,650
Your mom is so good to me, too.

781
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,400
Your mom is doing well.

782
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,050
Don't worry.

783
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,350
Hwang Na Ro.

784
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,800
Let me ask you a favor.

785
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,860
Please don't disappoint the 
Samgwang family.

786
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:59,490
Especially my mom.

787
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:02,480
You get what I mean, right?

788
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:08,810
As for disappointment and 
disillusionment about you...

789
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:11,780
Just let Woo Jae Hee and I 
be the only ones to experience it.

790
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,670
Okay?

791
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,360
I'll try.

792
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:26,600
What?

793
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,420
Bit Chae Woon is back at work?

794
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,960
Yes, Chairwoman.

795
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,000
Bit Chae Woon will rejoin 
our design team starting today.

796
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,400
Please welcome her.

797
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,530
 Welcome back. 

798
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,180
Thank you.

799
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,370
I'm sorry I was gone for a while 
due to my circumstances.

800
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:48,190
We struggled so much 
without you, Bit Chae Woon.

801
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,190
I'm sorry.

802
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:53,500
I'll work harder to make up for it.

803
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,520
Gosh...

804
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,480
Jung Won didn't listen
 to me and did that.

805
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,020
Aigoo...

806
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,430
 

807
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:20,100
Aigoo.

808
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:25,900
Here I am making Woo Jung Hoo's 
bed once again.

809
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,300
What bondage of destiny.

810
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:33,020
But I'm glad his memory is back.

811
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,560
Min Jae.

812
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,690
Jung Won.

813
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,680
Min Jae, what happened?

814
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,600
Where is Jae Hee's father?

815
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,880
He went to get examined.

816
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,820
He's much better now.

817
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,690
Gosh, I'm glad.

818
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,790
You must've been so scared.

819
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,890
How did you find out?

820
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,810
Did Jae Hee tell you?

821
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:00,520
No.

822
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,640
Chae Woon told me.

823
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,830
Bit Chae Woon.

824
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:06,140
Oh, Bit Chae Woon.

825
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,040
Since Bit Chae Woon and
 Jae Hee are dating...

826
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,630
Seo Ah is upset, huh?

827
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,620
Now that Jae Hee has 
a girlfriend, huh?

828
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:19,660
Well, Seo Ah did like Jae Hee a lot.

829
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,850
So what is Jung Hoo's illness?

830
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,610
Gosh.

831
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:28,980
What did you say?

832
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:32,090
He had lost his memory?

833
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,000
How about now?

834
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,690
He's beginning to recover now.

835
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:42,820
So Bit Chae Woon didn't
 tell you about that?

836
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,950
No, she said he's not feeling well.

837
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:51,210
Aigoo. Bit Chae Woon is so thoughtful.

838
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,200
What a relief.

839
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,880
You must've suffered so
 much all this time.

840
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,100
I'm sorry, Min Jae.

841
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,250
I also had some things going on.

842
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,430
I couldn't check up on you.

843
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,140
I'm sorry.

844
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,650
Some things?

845
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,520
What things?

846
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,240
What is it?

847
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,460
Actually...

848
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,480
Bit Chae Woon is...

849
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,810
my birth daughter.

850
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,790
What...

851
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:52,140
What are you saying?

852
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:56,470
Bit Chae Woon is...

853
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:58,600
Seo Yeon.

854
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,650
The baby I lost a long time ago.

855
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,100
Wait a minute. Bit Chae Woon is...

856
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,610
Seo Yeon?

857
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:12,420
You mean Seo Yeon was alive?

858
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,160
Hold on.

859
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,920
How could that happen?

860
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,360
How could...

861
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,320
How could Bit Chae Woon be...

862
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,820
Oh, my.

863
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,650
Jung Won...

864
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,730
Father!

865
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:47,420
- Father!
- Seo Ah.

866
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,670
Seo Ah.

867
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:51,090
Hi, Oppa.

868
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:54,190
Father, I heard you were sick.

869
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,750
You knew?

870
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,700
Yeah, I heard from Bit Chae Woon.

871
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,920
How is Father doing?

872
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,870
He's doing much better.

873
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,860
Dad, what's wrong?

874
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:12,610
 So I guess Seo Ah, Bit Chae Woon, 

875
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:15,700
 and Jae Hee are in a love triangle. 

876
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,810
 No, Jae Hee only loves Bit Chae Woon. 

877
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:23,930
 If so, she's thorny path for their love. 

878
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,930
Father, I'm so glad you're better.

879
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,220
I was so worried.

880
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,130
Father.

881
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:39,290
Seo Ah, thank you for coming.

882
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,270
You remember Seo Ah, right?

883
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:53,470
I thought Bit Chae Woon is
 Soon Jung's daughter.

884
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,390
Jung Won.

885
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:59,740
So as we expected,

886
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:02,610
it was Seo Yeon's dad, 
Park Pil Hong's doing, right?

887
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:06,230
He tried to make a fortune by

888
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:08,820
making it look like a kidnapping

889
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:13,040
and lost Seo Yeon for real, right?

890
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,140
I think so.

891
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,790
At the time,

892
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,600
I found out recently that

893
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,380
he left Seo Yeon with Soon Jung.

894
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,220
While Park Pil Hong...

895
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,840
was bringing back Seo Yeon,

896
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,400
I think he lost her.

897
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,500
But...

898
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,470
something doesn't feel 
right to believe that.

899
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,270
Even if Soon Jung met

900
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:43,690
Seo Yeon in an orphanage later,

901
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:46,070
why didn't she contact you?

902
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:48,790
Even though you were
 in the US already,

903
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:52,790
shouldn't she have found you 
somehow and contact you?

904
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:55,320
That's what I mean. Right?

905
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:00,230
Although she said there 
was a reason, but still...

906
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,880
I think that's weird.

907
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,990
Jung Won, in my opinion...

908
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,180
I think there's something more to this.

909
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,680
Oh, Mr. Woo.

910
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,420
CEO, you're here.

911
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,160
- Hello.
- Hi, Jae Hee.

912
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,860
Do you recognize me?

913
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,720
Of course, I do.

914
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,140
You're Min Jae's childhood friend

915
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:30,390
and LX Fashion CEO Kim Jung Won.

916
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:32,740
Yes, you're right.

917
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,070
- Hello.
- Hi, Seo Ah.

918
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,180
Seo Ah.

919
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,890
I heard from Bit Chae Woon.

920
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:47,020
I was worried, so I came.

921
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,620
I'm glad you did.

922
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:53,600
Thank you for coming over
 in your busy schedule.

923
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,980
Oh, no.

924
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,200
You should get better soon.

925
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,390
Yes. I will.

926
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:05,880
 Something seems different... 

927
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,800
 or not. 

928
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,140
 My gosh. 

929
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,820
Is Bit Chae Woon doing okay with work?

930
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:23,290
Yes, as always. She's working hard.

931
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:28,770
I think...

932
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:33,170
it would be good if you'd fully 
support her, Director.

933
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:37,220
You have to put her on the stage

934
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,110
for you to pull her down?

935
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:41,720
That's right.

936
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:45,050
Bit Chae Woon won't get 
pushed out that easily.

937
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:46,870
Just set the stage for me.

938
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:49,570
I'll take care of the rest.

939
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,000
You're all working hard.

940
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,890
You know there's a VIP styling
 class next week, right?

941
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,860
Yes, we're working on it.

942
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:05,340
Let's have Bit Chae Woon take 
control and prepare it this time.

943
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,340
Director, by herself?

944
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:15,990
Well...

945
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:19,660
I'll prepare it with Dae Won.

946
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,560
Well...

947
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,050
I don't think you will be effective
 if the tasks are divided up.

948
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,480
Considering the showcase last time,

949
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,440
CEO was complimenting 
how good you are

950
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,830
in preparing for events.

951
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:37,850
So take control this time 
and move it right along.

952
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:39,660
All right then.

953
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,550
Good day.

954
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,180
Wait...

955
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:17,000
Kim Dae Won, you must be upset.

956
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,750
You two are both interns,

957
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,220
yet Bit Chae Woon alone gets 
to work on important events.

958
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:24,800
But don't you think it's weird?

959
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,310
Both Director Jang and the CEO...

960
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:32,530
Doesn't it feel like they're
 supporting only Bit Chae Woon?

961
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,370
Don't you? Right?

962
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,760
Right, Chief?

963
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,720
I felt that, too.

964
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,500
Hwang Na Ro.

965
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,790
Didn't you feel that?

966
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,400
I'm not sure.

967
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Bit Chae Woon is exceptionally
 talented anyway.

968
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,670
You were all here.

969
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,730
Everyone, let's get back to work.

970
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,240
Coffee?

971
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:19,450
I'll get it myself.

972
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:22,520
Jung Hoo!

973
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,860
Jung Hoo! Jung Hoo...

974
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,150
Jung Hoo!

975
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:30,720
Do you know how worried I was for you?

976
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,820
I can't believe you were so sick.

977
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,250
You must've struggled so much!

978
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,170
Hey, hey, hey.

979
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:38,780
Don't overreact.

980
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,020
Director Jung, you're still the same.

981
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,930
You're always overreacting.

982
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,700
Why is everyone standing here like this?

983
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:50,170
Mr. Sung, report to me today online

984
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,520
what's been going on at work.

985
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,770
Director Jung, gather an 
executive meeting tomorrow.

986
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:57,240
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, Jung Hoo.

987
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,730
What are you doing? Go.

988
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:04,170
Okay, then...

989
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:06,310
- Get some rest.
- I'll get going.

990
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,930
Aren't you leaving?

991
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,610
Go on and get back to work.

992
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:17,430
Let me check the house. 
You've been away too long.

993
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:19,980
I'll go after making some
 side dishes for you.

994
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,590
What's wrong with both of you?

995
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:24,230
Do I have some terminal 
disease or something?

996
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:27,120
Stop behaving differently. Go on.

997
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,160
I'll leave right after.

998
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:33,150
Woo Jae Hee, don't you 
remember saying

999
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:36,370
let's not say hi even if 
we bump into each other?

1000
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,100
You got your memory back, Dad.

1001
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,380
Leave, Honey.

1002
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,010
I can have side dishes delivered.

1003
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:50,990
For me to become independent,

1004
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,630
you wrote out a manual 
this thick when you left.

1005
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,650
Why are you acting this way now?

1006
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,250
I did.

1007
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:00,830
But you're still not fully well.

1008
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:02,690
I'll stay for a bit.

1009
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,800
My doctor will keep checking on me.

1010
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,160
I've been fine without
 you guys all this time.

1011
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,760
I'll be fine going forward.

1012
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,400
So leave. You make me uncomfortable.

1013
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:18,040
Well, Honey...

1014
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,690
you really don't remember 
anything about living in

1015
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:23,190
Samgwang Villa after your accident?

1016
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,280
Yeah?

1017
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,770
Well...

1018
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:33,180
Sam...

1019
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,800
What?

1020
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,100
My goodness...

1021
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,880
I guess he has no memory 
of Samgwang Villa.

1022
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,000
Yeah, I guess not.

1023
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,130
I'll check real quick before I go.

1024
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,550
Hey, Woo Jae Hee.

1025
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:48,030
Hey! That guy...

1026
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,740
Gosh, if you feel uncomfortable,

1027
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:53,630
I'll leave with Jae Hee after he's done.

1028
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:55,360
But still...

1029
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,500
you should hire a housekeeper.

1030
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,600
I'll take care of it!

1031
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,460
Is your store doing well?

1032
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,900
Did you know I bought a franchise?

1033
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,600
I heard about it on our way home.

1034
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,280
It's just starting, but it's going well.

1035
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,930
Gosh, if I stayed here for a few days...

1036
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,670
Ms. Jung Min Jae.

1037
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:21,010
Aren't we strangers now?

1038
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,280
We are strangers.

1039
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:30,580
Nothing is wrong with
 the security and heater.

1040
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,430
I'll get going, Dad.

1041
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,430
All right.

1042
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:35,880
All right!

1043
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,650
Thanks for everything.

1044
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:43,020
- I'll get going.
- Call me if anything comes up.

1045
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,760
Bye.

1046
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,350
- Okay?
- Call me right away.

1047
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,350
Be sure to eat your meals.

1048
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:02,570
He remembers Samgwang Villa, 
but he's pretending not to.

1049
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:04,300
Sure.

1050
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,510
Rather than Woo Jung Hoo with amnesia,

1051
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,650
picky and mean 
Woo Jung Hoo is much better.

1052
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,710
Let's go, Mom.

1053
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:42,020
Hwak Se, going out now?

1054
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,910
Noonim, I'll sweep.

1055
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:46,440
No, it's okay. I'm almost done.

1056
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,460
How is your throat?

1057
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:53,330
Oh, my throat. You know the bellflower
 tea you gave me last time?

1058
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,200
After drinking that, 
my voice sounds like a bell!

1059
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:58,150
Gosh, I'm glad.

1060
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:00,650
- Have a good day.
- Okay, Noonim. See you.

1061
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:01,990
See you.

1062
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:11,260
 If she finds out I'm dating Aunt, 

1063
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:13,660
 what would she think about that? 

1064
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,600
Why?

1065
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,260
Oh, huh?

1066
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:22,010
Oh, nothing.

1067
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:24,310
- I'll get going now.
- All right.

1068
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,820
Hwak Se, are you okay?

1069
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:31,280
Ow, I think it's dented.

1070
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,620
It's a lie.

1071
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:34,270
My gosh.

1072
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:35,810
Come on.

1073
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:37,400
Noonim, I'm really leaving now.

1074
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,300
Be careful, Hwak Se.

1075
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,530
Aigoo, gosh.

1076
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:01,630
Excuse me.

1077
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,040
Who are you?

1078
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,890
Are you Ms. Lee Soon Jung?

1079
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:10,020
Yes, I am.

1080
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,610
Chairwoman.

1081
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:25,990
Lee Soon Jung.

1082
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:30,340
Madam.

1083
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:58,040
I'm back here.

1084
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:02,720
I'm back...

1085
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:09,970
 Cheers! 

1086
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:12,470
 What are you doing? 

1087
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,430
Geez, this place...

1088
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:47,300
This place is...

1089
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:50,220
too...

1090
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:56,890
lonely...

1091
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:14,390
♫  In the extravagant building forest  ♫

1092
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:17,950
♫  You're walking with confidence, City Boy  ♫

1093
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:22,180
♫  In the suffocating gaze of people  ♫

1094
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:24,170
♫  You're walking with pride, Working Girl  ♫

1095
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:25,860
 

1096
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:28,750
 - An old lady came by this afternoon.
- An old lady? 

1097
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:30,520
 Didn't President Woo retire? 

1098
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,020
 Work is going to be stifling again. 

1099
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:34,280
 Geez, it was nice not 
seeing the cheapskate boss. 

1100
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,380
 If Bit Chae Woon starts to talk, 

1101
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:39,060
 it could hurt our company image greatly. 

1102
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,150
 I'm Lee Ra Hoon's sister, who works here. 

1103
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,690
 Ra Hoon went on a delivery. 

1104
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:43,820
 Noona, you're still here? 

1105
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:46,020
 How could you lie about
 such a huge matter? 

1106
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,220
 Break up with Bit Chae Woon. 

1107
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:50,400
 If you don't break up with 
Bit Chae Woon, she will suffer more. 

1108
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,950
 All right, we'll begin now. 

1109
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:56,720
 The last outfit you prepared 
all disappeared. 

1110
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,350
♫  You are my city girl  ♫
