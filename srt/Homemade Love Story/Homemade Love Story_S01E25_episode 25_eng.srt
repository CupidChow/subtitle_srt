1
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,540
 

2
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,670
Is this true?

3
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,790
Is that why...

4
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,700
 

5
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,410
I was working late...

6
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,140
and ran into the CEO.

7
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,150
I can't believe an article like this posted.

8
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,870
Someone must be playing a joke.

9
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,340
Since it's an anonymous blog.

10
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,480
It just got deleted.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,970
See? It's a joke.

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,260
Did someone take it out on Bit Chae Woon
 for messing up at the event today?

13
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,180
Why are you looking at me?

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,230
I didn't do anything.

15
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,720
I have to organize new items.

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,580
I'll go to storage.

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,880
All right.

18
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,030
 
Yes, Executive Director.

19
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,420
I think someone posted it as a joke.

20
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,700
 

21
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,420
I'm sorry for causing concern.

22
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,750
Please speak with Director Hong
 and tell her to rest easy.

23
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,490
Okay.

24
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,770
Yes, Director Jang.

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,640
It's nothing serious.

26
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,420
We have had stunts like
 this pulled before.

27
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,890
Sister-in-law is doing well, right?

28
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,670
Please tell her I said hi.

29
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,040
Okay.

30
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,130
 

31
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,820
I was leaving, then turned
 around out of shock.

32
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,680
Who posted such an article?

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,000
Isn't it someone who 
knows about our family?

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,300
We deleted the post and 
uploaded an explanation.

35
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,850
It's nothing serious. Don't worry, Mom.

36
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,330
What do you mean it's not serious?

37
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,440
Don't you know a small 
crack brings down a dam?

38
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,210
Gosh. I have a bad feeling about this.

39
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,670
Because of that Seo Yeon or 
Bit Chae Woon or whatever...

40
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,200
I think something huge will 
happen to our family.

41
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,530
CEO! On the internet...

42
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,850
Chairwoman, you're back.

43
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,810
Did you see our blog?

44
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,670
What's going on online?

45
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,490
There were two posts 
about the article

46
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,760
that was posted on the company blog.

47
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,550
- I asked them to delete them.
- What?

48
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,390
Aigoo, gosh.

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,500
What are we going to do? What now?

50
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,120
Ms. Goo!

51
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,100
Yes, CEO.

52
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,420
Find out where the post came from.

53
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,790
We're checking right now.

54
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,790
What does the IT Team say?

55
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,800
They still haven't found the employee
 who posted that blog post?

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,890
No.

57
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,550
It came through an external 
server. They can't find it.

58
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,260
The IP that deleted the post came
 from another location, too.

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,630
Gosh, all right.

60
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,400
You can leave.

61
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,960
Aigoo.

62
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,170
Someone is totally determined.

63
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,760
Someone is totally determined 
to ruin our family.

64
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,760
Yes, uncle.

65
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,260
It's nothing serious.

66
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,600
Of course. It's nonsense.

67
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,280
Director Jang just talked 
to me on the phone.

68
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,160
Director Jang?

69
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,670
Wait.

70
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,000
Your brother-in-law?

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,640
See?

72
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,970
They're coming at you in droves 
as if they were waiting for it.

73
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,490
What do we do now?

74
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,480
Please, Mom!

75
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,910
Why are you irritated with me?

76
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,340
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,920
This isn't going to work.

78
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,250
- Make Bit Chae Woon leave.
- Mom.

79
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,420
Chairwoman, how could she do that?

80
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,310
She's Mom's long lost daughter.

81
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,450
For now, send her far away
 like New York or Paris.

82
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,700
Study abroad or training. 
There are lots of reasons.

83
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,570
Until your position
 in the company is firm,

84
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,690
- tell her to stay out for a few years.
- Mom...

85
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,140
You'd better come to your senses.

86
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,590
Everything you've struggled
 to build all this time.

87
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,560
Do you want to lose it because
 of that Bit Chae Woon?

88
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,290
Why do you keep saying I'll lose it?

89
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,490
Do you think I'll stand back 
while that happens?

90
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,060
Do you know how I've come this far?

91
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,340
That's what I'm saying.

92
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,820
Then...

93
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,310
the CCTV didn't work 
at that time frame?

94
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,670
Yes.

95
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,470
Of all places, just the prep room
 and its surroundings?

96
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,450
It looks that way.

97
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,330
Of course.

98
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,010
No one can find out who
 hid the clothes.

99
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,890
What?

100
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,970
Nothing.

101
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,490
Have a good day. Thank you.

102
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,660
It has to be someone inside.

103
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,370
Hwang Na Ro?

104
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,160
Jang Seo Ah?

105
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,400
 

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,480
 Chae Woon, you had a tough day, huh? 

107
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,100
 I enjoyed the event earlier. 

108
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,160
 I couldn't say bye because I rushed out. 

109
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,810
 My Chae Woon was so cool. 

110
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,790
I know you were worried.

111
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,770
Hi, Mom. Did you get home okay?

112
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,360
Hi. I just got home.

113
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,240
It was a tough day today, huh?

114
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,050
It wasn't that bad.

115
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,170
I made a mistake at the end...

116
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,830
But I got lots of compliments
 for positive responses.

117
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,050
Really?

118
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,130
 Mom, you were worried seeing 
me get nervous earlier, huh? 

119
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,470
That happens a lot when
 you're working at events.

120
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,080
Everyone understood.

121
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,190
I see. I'm glad...

122
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,630
that everyone understood.

123
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,290
Chae Woon.

124
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,380
James...

125
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,940
I mean...

126
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,960
Mr. Woo's father is here.

127
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,790
Oh, really?

128
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,990
 As for my dad getting his memory back, 

129
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,930
 I won't tell Samgwang people for now. 

130
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,170
Tell Jae Hee's father that I said hello.

131
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,440
Chae Woon says hello.

132
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,410
I see.

133
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,150
Chae Woon, you take care, too.

134
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,600
Chae Woon.

135
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,320
Have a good day.

136
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,610
 Okay, Mom. 

137
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,090
Oh, Chae Woon.

138
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,050
Nothing's the matter, for real, right?

139
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,060
Yeah, everything is fine.

140
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,580
 Okay. 

141
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,990
 - I'll hang up. 
- Bye.

142
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,310
Chae Woon went to her
 birth mom's house, right?

143
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,480
I heard Hae Deun and Ra Hoon talk.

144
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,770
You must feel very empty

145
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,650
since Chae Woon went to that house.

146
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,350
No.

147
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,200
It's a good thing.

148
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,530
She went back to her birth mom.

149
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,510
My Chae Woon...

150
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,540
will struggle for now...

151
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,060
but she'll prevail.

152
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,340
Yes, she will.

153
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,340
Chae Woon is bold.

154
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,300
She'll overcome it well.

155
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,870
Ms. Lee.

156
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,820
By chance, is something the matter?

157
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,750
By chance, is someone bothering you?

158
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,410
I was wondering if something
 like that was going on.

159
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,460
Aigoo, aigoo...

160
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,180
Gosh, it's not my place and 
asked you such a thing.

161
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,650
It's okay.

162
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,530
Thank you for your concern.

163
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,270
It may be out of line,

164
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,040
but you tend to take 
everything on alone.

165
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,250
When I think that

166
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,220
you must be struggling 
with something,

167
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,030
but Samgwang Villa family 
or I say something,

168
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,820
you take it all in with a smile.

169
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,020
You continue to endure alone.

170
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:22,500
I was worried that you'd damage
 your health at that rate.

171
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,020
I just...

172
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,360
feel like...

173
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,400
I'm still so dumb...

174
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,930
at this age.

175
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,860
I'm so fearful, too.

176
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,220
Actually...

177
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,620
I should reveal something honestly,

178
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,300
but I can't bring myself to do that.

179
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,100
How come?

180
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,200
Is there a reason 
why you can't reveal it?

181
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,410
Or is someone scaring you
 so you can't reveal?

182
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,960
No.

183
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,380
I'm not...

184
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,680
scared of that at all.

185
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,050
But my daughter...

186
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,990
My Chae Woon...

187
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,100
When I consider how shocked 
and hurt she will be...

188
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,950
So I'll keep my mouth shut

189
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,950
decided to hold it in

190
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,090
all inside.

191
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,840
But that is so tough to do.

192
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:43,080
I feel like I'm committing another
 type of sin by doing so.

193
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,980
My gosh.

194
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,990
Why am I such a stupid person?

195
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,950
No.

196
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,060
It's not like that at all. Never.

197
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,780
Who is stupid in this world?

198
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,250
Just because you're kinder, 
gentler, and more fragile

199
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,690
than others, they think you're foolish.

200
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,420
That's not true.

201
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,360
That's really not true.

202
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,700
Gosh, I can't believe I told you all this.

203
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,300
- Let me get more ginger tea...
- Ms. Lee.

204
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,780
I don't know the details, but...

205
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,790
why don't you have courage?

206
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,050
I don't know what it's about,

207
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,510
but I don't think 
Chae Woon will be hurt

208
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,130
as much as you think.

209
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,200
Chae Woon is just as strong as you.

210
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,470
Just think you're doing it
 for Chae Woon,

211
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,890
and why don't you 
muster up the courage?

212
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,270
Gosh.

213
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,810
Gosh...

214
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,690
I was out of line.

215
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,220
Gosh, I spoke out of my place.

216
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,850
Gosh, I'm sorry.

217
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,210
Mr. Woo...

218
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:19,220
you were always a very warm person.

219
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,130
When I faced difficulties or struggles,

220
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,330
you always comforted me.

221
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,290
I did?

222
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,380
What do you mean...

223
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,310
 Did I do that? 

224
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,390
 You can't come in today? 

225
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,360
We can't help it. Rest up.

226
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,040
What's going on, Eems hyung?

227
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,740
Eems hyung!

228
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,780
- Eems hyung!
- Hwak Se!

229
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,490
Eems hyung!

230
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,890
No wonder.

231
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,050
I felt like coming home.

232
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,700
Eems hyung, do you know 
how much I missed you?

233
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,190
Me, too. Me, too, Hwak Se!

234
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,210
But...

235
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,500
how have you been?

236
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,140
What's the use in
 dressing up like this?

237
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,860
I heard you didn't get 
your memory back.

238
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,620
- Aigoo. What will you do now?
- Hwak Se.

239
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,150
- Is something the matter?
- What?

240
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,580
Oh, the part-timer at work...

241
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,390
He's not feeling well, 
so he can't come in today.

242
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,600
- It's trouble.
- Yeah, that's bad.

243
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,450
It's one of the busiest days.

244
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,570
What?

245
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,850
Yeah, right?

246
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,770
Yeah, right.

247
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,420
Whoa!

248
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,490
Hwak Se!

249
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,850
Hwak Se.

250
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,600
James... I mean, Mr. Woo...

251
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,060
He just stopped by.

252
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,200
- Eems hyung, you said you're fine.
- Yes.

253
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,420
Don't worry.

254
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,230
I finished all my work.

255
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,720
But still.

256
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,400
If your wife and Mr. Woo find out,
 they'd worry.

257
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,500
I'll tell Jae Hee.

258
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,390
- Let's go.
- Aigoo, don't worry, Noonim.

259
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,860
Look how happy Eems hyung is.

260
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,010
I'll take care of Eems hyung.

261
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,320
Okay, Hwak Se. Take care of him.

262
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,530
Okay, don't worry, Noonim.

263
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,050
- Let's go, Eems hyung.
- Let's go.

264
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,560
My goodness.

265
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,300
My phone.

266
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,880
 

267
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,000
Hi, Soon Jung. 
Did you get home okay?

268
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,400
 Yes, did you get home okay? 

269
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,960
Well, I'm here to see Jae Hee.

270
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,750
Jae Hee's dad?

271
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,140
Yes.

272
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,750
So...

273
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,560
he's at the jokbal place 
he used to work at.

274
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,430
I didn't know what I should do.

275
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,910
What kind of mood was he in?

276
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,280
Well, he met Hwak Se

277
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,060
and seemed very happy.

278
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,050
That's good then.

279
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,230
It's fine as long as he's happy.

280
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,040
 That's what his doctor said, too. 

281
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,650
Don't worry.

282
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,920
Okay.

283
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,660
I'll call you again
 if anything happens.

284
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,270
Thank you.

285
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,640
But Soon Jung.

286
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,410
I told you.

287
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,520
Jung Hoo and I got divorced.

288
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,600
 Of course, I'll take care 
of him as a friend. 

289
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,590
But don't think that I'm his wife

290
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,620
and feel burdened.

291
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,680
Just consider me his friend.

292
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,320
Okay.

293
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,130
I understand what you're saying.

294
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,280
But still, since you're his close friend,

295
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,320
I'll discuss it with you
 if this happens again.

296
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,640
Thank you, Soon Jung.

297
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,800
I guess Jung Woo was happy 
while he stayed at Samgwang Villa.

298
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,260
Where is this?

299
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,240
Hwang Na Ro, that jerk. 
He sure plays dirty.

300
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,120
 Hey, man. Is this how you work? 

301
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,130
 Did you already switch 
to Jang Seo Ah? 

302
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,650
Oh-ho? Look at this guy.

303
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,360
Hwang Na Ro, is this 
how you'll interfere?

304
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,590
My Seo Yeon needs to be
 accepted there quickly.

305
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,320
Excuse me.

306
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,250
I'm here to see Mr. Woo Jae Hee.

307
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,250
I'm his mom.

308
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,660
 Jung Min Jae is Mr. Woo's mom? 

309
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,410
By chance, do you know where he is?

310
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,700
Over there? Where?

311
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,630
Ahjussi...

312
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,160
Are you okay?

313
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,370
Wait. Hold on.

314
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,020
My gosh. I'm so sorry.

315
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,600
Who put this here? It's dangerous.

316
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,690
Jae Hee!

317
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,290
Hold on.

318
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
Are you here to see Jae Hee?

319
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,060
Yes.

320
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,390
By chance, are you his older sister?

321
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,910
What?

322
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,980
Hello, I'm Son Jung Hoo, 
Jae Hee's sunbae.

323
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,880
- Son Jung...
- Son Jung Hoo.

324
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,130
Hoo, as in hoo-hoo-hoo.

325
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,750
Jung Hoo.

326
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,360
He's Jung Hoo, too.

327
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,500
- Excuse me?
- Oh, nothing.

328
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,700
- Professor, you're here.
- Hi, Jae Hee.

329
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,770
Did you two meet?

330
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,430
He's my college professor.

331
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,700
He used to be my sunbae
 and became a professor.

332
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,530
Hello, I'm Jae Hee's mom.

333
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,950
You're Jae Hee's mother?

334
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,420
Is that right?

335
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,240
I thought you were his older sister.

336
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,970
Oh, my gosh...

337
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,340
Really?

338
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,330
Mom, you must be so happy.

339
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,780
But Mom, what brings you here?

340
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,920
I came by Jung Won's office

341
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,910
and stopped by since 
you're in the area.

342
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,860
You two talk first.

343
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,780
- I'll wait over there.
- Okay.

344
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,360
Excuse me.

345
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,760
Interior trend seminar?

346
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah.

347
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,910
I'm the chief researcher 
at the company.

348
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,360
I was wondering if you can do a presentation
 for our upcoming interior seminar.

349
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,920
Of course, I will.

350
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,830
I'm still lacking, but I'll do my best.

351
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,220
I knew I could count on you.

352
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,150
Thanks, Jae Hee.

353
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,270
Hey...

354
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,930
is she really your mother?

355
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,030
Well, no. She's actually my older sister.

356
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,590
Nah...

357
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,200
He looks very familiar.

358
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,000
- I wanted to see his face.
 - I'll do my best to prep. 

359
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,610
 Please do. 

360
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,030
 - I'm off.
- All right. 

361
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,940
It's been so long since 
I last saw Min Jae.

362
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,530
Wait.

363
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,450
That family has some money, too.

364
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,990
Wow.

365
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,300
Seo Yeon was sure born into money.

366
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:37,170
So, that professor is your sunbae?

367
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,050
Right. He's my sunbae and a teacher.

368
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,190
He's like a mentor to me.

369
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,960
But how can his name 
be Jung Hoo, too?

370
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,130
He has the same name as your father.

371
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,560
It's not a common name, either.

372
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,100
I know.

373
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,020
But it's so neat.

374
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,070
Professor Son thought 
you were my older sister.

375
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,620
Aigoo, I feel great for some reason.

376
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,160
You just found out?

377
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,050
Even now, people see me
 from the back

378
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,020
and say, "Hey, student!"

379
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,020
Mom, I love everything about you, 
but you always go too far.

380
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,480
Come back, Mom.

381
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,280
I'm coming back.

382
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,600
Hey, hey.

383
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,810
I got a call from Soon Jung.

384
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,730
She says your dad is at Samgwang Villa.

385
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,390
Why? Did he lose his memory again?

386
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,880
No, it's not that.

387
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,180
Hello.

388
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,570
 

389
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,240
What?

390
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,060
Jung Hoo, where did you go?

391
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,550
I got so scared because you 
disappeared all of a sudden.

392
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,140
Why get scared?

393
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,630
I gave my instructions to 
Mr. Seo on tasks.

394
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,260
Where are you right now?

395
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,600
Here?

396
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,490
With a vendor.

397
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,840
What?

398
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,130
Why didn't you take Mr. Seo 
with you to meet a vendor?

399
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,210
I'm busy. Hang up.

400
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,890
Hwak Se!

401
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,100
Hwak Se!

402
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,700
Aigoo, Eems hyung, come on.

403
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,870
- Here.
- Aigoo, good job.

404
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,890
Here is the next delivery.

405
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,640
- Two this time?
- Yes.

406
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,570
Since you're back at our store,

407
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,680
you brought high sales with you.

408
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,900
Right? It makes me so happy, too.

409
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,540
I'll be back.

410
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,220
Wait, no, no.

411
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,400
Okay.

412
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,250
Aigoo, don't be too jumpy. 
Walk slowly.

413
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,460
Here comes Bit Chae Woon.

414
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,680
Bit Chae Woon, did you fall?

415
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,530
I was looking for some 
stuff in the storage.

416
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,860
Look for what? I thought you 
were organizing new items.

417
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,730
The outfits I had prepared
 for the styling class.

418
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,280
I looked to see where 
they were hidden.

419
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,490
Bit Chae Woon, do you
 think you were framed?

420
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,130
Unbelievable.

421
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,400
Who would hide that in there?

422
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,460
It's not like a psycho did it.

423
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,210
I know.

424
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,150
It wasn't there as expected.

425
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,360
Interestingly, the CCTV wasn't 
working only in that area.

426
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,770
CCTV... really?

427
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,890
Okay, I came to explain the post

428
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,090
that posted a little bit ago.

429
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,490
I'm sure you read the announcement.

430
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,130
I want to say that the rumor that
 the CEO and Bit Chae Woon

431
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,380
are somehow related is not true

432
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,330
at all once again.

433
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,820
The reason Bit Chae Woon 
was in charge of the event

434
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,430
was because she performed 
very highly thus far.

435
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,450
Of course,

436
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,520
I will ask her to be accountable

437
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,130
for the mistake she made
 at the event.

438
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,530
All right, everyone, thank you for 
your hard work at the event.

439
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,120
Director.

440
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,830
I'd like to meet with you.

441
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,700
Come to my office.

442
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,250
What is it about?

443
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,790
Is it about the post on the blog?

444
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:47,020
I think you gave them
 the reason for it.

445
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,700
If you had led the styling 
class perfectly,

446
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,410
I don't think a post framing you like
 that wouldn't have come up.

447
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,370
Do you think so?

448
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,220
I thought it wasn't framing
 because of my mistake

449
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,890
but a trap trying to get me.

450
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,610
 The disappearance of 
the outfits I prepared  

451
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,280
 - for the styling class... 
- Wait.

452
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,080
 I thought it was in line with 
the post that was on the blog. 

453
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,690
 So what you're saying is that... 

454
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,430
someone planned it purposely?

455
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,540
And you came to see me

456
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,910
to ask, "Isn't this your doing, 
Jang Seo Ah?"

457
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,000
The photo on the blog

458
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,620
was possible because 
it was an insider.

459
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,350
And the reason CCTV didn't work

460
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,920
means someone who can control

461
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,100
all the system in the 
company was helping.

462
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,780
Bit Chae Woon.

463
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,020
Were you investigating
 that all this time?

464
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,920
That's why you look
 like a dirty mouse?

465
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,370
How could you think that?

466
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:06,930
I'm a director of this company.

467
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,180
I worry about the company 
more than anyone else.

468
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,340
How dare you say such a thing?

469
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,020
So?

470
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,800
What do you really want to say?

471
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,720
I wanted to let you know that

472
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,320
I'm fully aware of such intentions.

473
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,920
What intention?

474
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,040
Your intention to get rid of me.

475
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,400
- Hey!
- Director Jang!

476
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,970
Bit Chae Woon.

477
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,050
What I heard was over the top.

478
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,860
About what had happened today,

479
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,320
you're not remorseful at all?

480
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,720
You put Director Jang and me 
in confusion all-day,

481
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,150
and you try to blame Director Jang?

482
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,560
Wait.

483
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,920
What's with your clothes?

484
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,850
To find the proof that I framed her,

485
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,760
it looks like she searched 
all over the building today.

486
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,250
What?

487
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,750
It's my fault that I showed 
my flaws at the event.

488
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,990
But there were definitely
 unsettling aspects to it.

489
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,400
So?

490
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,900
Are you saying I did that?

491
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,220
You're really...

492
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,910
Did you see that, Mom?

493
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,750
That's how she is.

494
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,630
She acts calm and quiet,

495
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:44,960
- yet she throws you under the bus!
- Director Jang, we're at work.

496
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,730
Call me, "CEO."

497
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,110
Okay.

498
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,760
Let's say Director Jang did that.

499
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,670
If we supposed that,

500
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,120
what will you do, Bit Chae Woon?

501
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,800
Hm?

502
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,170
There's nothing I can do.

503
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,460
I'll just take the punches

504
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,690
and fall into the trap she dug.

505
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,400
However, I'm falling into her trap,
 knowing she set it.

506
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,570
If I keep falling, I can build a tolerance.

507
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,480
That I won't fall over just 
because she tramples on me.

508
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,500
I came here to say this.

509
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,500
Hey.

510
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,570
You get out.

511
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,600
Get out!

512
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,060
- Get out!
- Calm down, Director Jang!

513
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,670
You can leave, Bit Chae Woon.

514
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,820
Leave now.

515
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,600
Calm down.

516
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,930
 You clearly understand
 it's your fault, right? 

517
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,550
 You can leave, Bit Chae Woon. 

518
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,190
 Leave now. 

519
00:33:49,932 --> 00:33:52,152
 I still... 

520
00:33:53,202 --> 00:33:55,972
 can't protect you. 

521
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:01,852
 I'm sorry, Chae Woon. 

522
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:08,262
So I wanted to discuss it 
with you again.

523
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:12,082
I'm so happy about going
 to France as a trainee.

524
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:15,032
I wanted to know if 
I really have potential.

525
00:34:15,032 --> 00:34:16,732
I've been thinking a lot.

526
00:34:18,202 --> 00:34:19,792
Actually...

527
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:23,962
I put you as a candidate 
since you pleaded.

528
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,982
But when you get there,

529
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:29,072
you'll have to help out 
with other tasks.

530
00:34:31,432 --> 00:34:33,822
Just like what I've been doing here,

531
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:37,512
getting the costumes, cleaning,

532
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:40,412
chores like that?

533
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:47,672
 When you work hard like that, 

534
00:34:47,672 --> 00:34:49,842
 you can get another chance. 

535
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:51,972
When I work hard?

536
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:55,752
Didn't I work hard here?

537
00:34:55,752 --> 00:35:00,312
Gosh, so I was an odd one out again?

538
00:35:00,312 --> 00:35:02,322
No...

539
00:35:02,322 --> 00:35:04,032
This is still a good chance.

540
00:35:04,032 --> 00:35:05,132
Yes.

541
00:35:05,132 --> 00:35:06,832
Wait, wait a minute.

542
00:35:06,832 --> 00:35:08,302
Wait a minute. I'm on my way.

543
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:10,422
I'll do it if I can't find a model.

544
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:12,482
I'm a man.

545
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:14,252
Mr. Makjang.

546
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,742
I told you we're meant to be.

547
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:18,802
Wait. I'll call you back.

548
00:35:18,802 --> 00:35:20,802
Hae Deun, come with me. 
I'm glad I ran into you.

549
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:22,022
Where?

550
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:23,242
A part-time job.

551
00:35:23,242 --> 00:35:24,552
English class again?

552
00:35:24,552 --> 00:35:26,032
No, not an English class. 
Something else.

553
00:35:26,032 --> 00:35:28,442
I'll pay you 70,000 won per hour.

554
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:32,102
- 10,000 won?
 - Did I push too high? 

555
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:33,672
10,000 won, okay. Let's go.

556
00:35:33,672 --> 00:35:34,972
Wait!

557
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:40,812
- A shopping mall?
- Yes.

558
00:35:40,812 --> 00:35:43,662
It's a small business I'm running.

559
00:35:43,662 --> 00:35:45,682
Mr. Makjang, weren't you 
an English teacher?

560
00:35:45,682 --> 00:35:47,302
That's a side job.

561
00:35:47,302 --> 00:35:48,432
This is my dream job.

562
00:35:48,432 --> 00:35:50,392
Don't you know full well 
since you have your dream?

563
00:35:50,392 --> 00:35:52,792
I think you can understand 
me very well.

564
00:35:53,972 --> 00:35:55,452
What a line, huh?

565
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:57,662
Anyway, my part-time model ran away.

566
00:35:57,682 --> 00:36:00,482
Please work with me just 
for the day, Hae Deun.

567
00:36:00,512 --> 00:36:01,632
Gosh.

568
00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:04,612
But I don't want to model. I didn't 
put that much makeup on today.

569
00:36:04,612 --> 00:36:07,672
Why? You look great. 
You look so natural.

570
00:36:07,672 --> 00:36:09,992
Anyway, the natural look is 
our store concept.

571
00:36:09,992 --> 00:36:11,312
It's okay. You look great right now.

572
00:36:11,312 --> 00:36:13,352
No, I don't want to do it.

573
00:36:14,332 --> 00:36:15,692
Wait.

574
00:36:15,692 --> 00:36:18,892
The photographer is
 waiting right now.

575
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:20,292
You can't say that...

576
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:23,262
I paid him a lot to hire him.

577
00:36:23,262 --> 00:36:25,832
I rented this cafe for a limited time.

578
00:36:25,832 --> 00:36:27,902
Hae Deun, please let me
 ask you a favor this once.

579
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:29,462
Just this once. Really.

580
00:36:31,192 --> 00:36:33,102
Oh, this...

581
00:36:33,102 --> 00:36:34,762
This... what?

582
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:37,682
 It worked. I loosened it.  

583
00:36:37,682 --> 00:36:39,182
 Did you see that? This... 

584
00:36:39,252 --> 00:36:41,082
You remember, right?

585
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:42,952
I said we're meant to be.

586
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:44,672
Please rescue me just this once.

587
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,672
This checker pattern
 looks great on you.

588
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:48,572
Try it on. Looks great.

589
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:50,532
Let's go. Let's go. It's okay.

590
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:52,692
Hello, I'm sorry we're late.

591
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:55,062
- Why do you make me wait?
- I'm sorry. Let's get going.

592
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:58,222
Sit here. You look pretty. 
You look like an idol. Great, great.

593
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:07,322
Great. That's right.

594
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:09,032
You look great.

595
00:37:09,032 --> 00:37:10,502
Right.

596
00:37:10,502 --> 00:37:11,992
Great.

597
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,392
Your expression.

598
00:37:16,392 --> 00:37:19,232
You can wear this next.

599
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:29,692
No.

600
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:36,172
Okay. One more time. One, two.

601
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:37,922
Gosh, great.

602
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,472
Looks good.

603
00:37:39,472 --> 00:37:41,042
Are you a model?

604
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:42,632
No, it's my first time.

605
00:37:42,632 --> 00:37:44,322
You have talent, Hae Deun.

606
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:46,982
- You look good now. Let's go again.
- Okay.

607
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:48,742
One, two.

608
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,072
Look to the side and smile.

609
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,022
Again.

610
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,492
Hello, dry cleaning owner.

611
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:05,572
Mr. James.

612
00:38:05,572 --> 00:38:09,722
Whoa, Dad is totally James.

613
00:38:10,862 --> 00:38:14,932
Of course, James is James.

614
00:38:14,932 --> 00:38:17,522
Auntie, you're home early.

615
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:21,862
I heard James came by.

616
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:23,162
I wanted to see him.

617
00:38:23,162 --> 00:38:25,572
I even canceled my dinner plans.

618
00:38:25,572 --> 00:38:26,782
You're home early, Mr. Woo.

619
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:28,692
I have to go out again.

620
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:30,462
I heard my dad came here, 
and I was worried.

621
00:38:30,462 --> 00:38:32,732
Wow, Mr. Woo...

622
00:38:32,732 --> 00:38:35,082
You're such a scary person.

623
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:37,582
When he's your father,

624
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:41,012
how can you deceive us 
as if he's a stranger?

625
00:38:41,012 --> 00:38:44,442
There's a family story behind it.

626
00:38:44,442 --> 00:38:46,562
I'm so sorry, Auntie.

627
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:48,542
It's okay.

628
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:51,952
What family doesn't have a story?

629
00:38:51,952 --> 00:38:53,102
I understand.

630
00:38:53,102 --> 00:38:57,072
So are you going out on 
a date with Bit Chae?

631
00:38:57,072 --> 00:38:58,832
Yes.

632
00:39:00,402 --> 00:39:02,132
Is Bit Chae doing well?

633
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,372
Yes, she's doing very well.

634
00:39:04,372 --> 00:39:06,212
Be good to Bit Chae.

635
00:39:06,212 --> 00:39:08,192
I have never seen her

636
00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:13,172
relying on anyone before.

637
00:39:13,172 --> 00:39:16,392
But she does rely on you a bit, right?

638
00:39:16,392 --> 00:39:17,682
Gosh, of course.

639
00:39:17,682 --> 00:39:21,172
I'm a very broad-minded Koala...

640
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:23,022
Oh, you're Koala?

641
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:26,472
You two call each other that?

642
00:39:26,472 --> 00:39:28,252
Gosh, that's how you two are.

643
00:39:32,492 --> 00:39:36,232
Why did Jae Hee come 
home so early?

644
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:38,742
What's wrong with him?

645
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:40,222
I know.

646
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:42,522
Auntie, I'll get going.

647
00:39:42,522 --> 00:39:43,742
All right.

648
00:39:43,742 --> 00:39:45,262
Bye, Koala.

649
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:50,032
Yes.

650
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,042
Yes, Moong-i.

651
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:55,582
Dinner? Sounds good.

652
00:39:55,582 --> 00:39:57,662
Yes. Right now?

653
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,272
Phew.

654
00:40:03,272 --> 00:40:04,802
Gosh.

655
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:08,862
He must be on his way 
to see Chae Woon.

656
00:40:10,602 --> 00:40:11,972
Aigoo.

657
00:40:11,972 --> 00:40:13,812
Here you go. Enjoy.

658
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:15,872
Thank you.

659
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:20,062
♫  I love you  ♫

660
00:40:20,062 --> 00:40:22,072
♫  I like you  ♫

661
00:40:22,072 --> 00:40:25,742
♫  I only trust you  ♫

662
00:40:25,782 --> 00:40:29,062
Jung, you're home early.

663
00:40:29,062 --> 00:40:31,332
Well, you know.

664
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:34,122
You said Jame was here,

665
00:40:34,122 --> 00:40:36,992
so I came home to say hi.

666
00:40:36,992 --> 00:40:38,982
What the heck?

667
00:40:38,982 --> 00:40:42,342
You didn't come home early
 to see me quickly?

668
00:40:42,342 --> 00:40:43,912
Well...

669
00:40:43,912 --> 00:40:48,282
that is a part of a reason
 a little bit, too.

670
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:50,702
"A part of a reason a little bit"?

671
00:40:50,702 --> 00:40:52,832
That's the only reason. 
Isn't that right?

672
00:40:52,832 --> 00:40:54,602
- Isn't that right?
- No, no, no.

673
00:40:54,602 --> 00:40:55,792
No, no...

674
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:57,622
Scared me.

675
00:41:00,162 --> 00:41:02,602
Why are you standing so close?

676
00:41:02,602 --> 00:41:04,742
You're ridiculous.

677
00:41:04,742 --> 00:41:05,782
I had to tell him something.

678
00:41:05,782 --> 00:41:07,572
James, you're here.

679
00:41:07,572 --> 00:41:08,792
How have you been?

680
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:10,762
I heard you came, 
so I wanted to say hi.

681
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:13,062
I came home even canceling
 my dinner plans.

682
00:41:13,062 --> 00:41:14,912
Nah.

683
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:16,412
What?

684
00:41:17,582 --> 00:41:21,842
Ba Reun, I'm saying this just in 
case there's a misunderstanding.

685
00:41:21,842 --> 00:41:23,342
My Jung...

686
00:41:25,502 --> 00:41:28,132
Aunt Man Jung and I usually...

687
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:30,032
tend to push each other...

688
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:33,272
and we throw punches, left, right, 
hook, straight, to the side.

689
00:41:33,272 --> 00:41:34,982
Nah...

690
00:41:34,982 --> 00:41:37,832
Student, you're a young student.

691
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:39,912
How can you be so rude 
when an elder is speaking?

692
00:41:39,982 --> 00:41:43,582
James, come in later.

693
00:41:43,612 --> 00:41:45,802
- Okay?
- Yes, Auntie.

694
00:41:45,802 --> 00:41:47,042
Take care.

695
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:49,372
- See you later.
- Bye.

696
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:52,952
Eems hyung.

697
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:54,772
You can go home now.

698
00:41:54,772 --> 00:41:56,642
The night part-timer is here.

699
00:41:58,522 --> 00:42:01,542
Hwak Se, congrats.

700
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:04,472
Eems hyung, congrats on what?

701
00:42:05,612 --> 00:42:08,002
I'll keep it a secret.

702
00:42:08,002 --> 00:42:09,802
Me, too.

703
00:42:09,802 --> 00:42:11,802
Gosh. Nah...

704
00:42:11,802 --> 00:42:13,102
No...

705
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,102
Please have dinner with us.

706
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,842
No, I'll eat at home.

707
00:42:20,842 --> 00:42:23,782
All you did was work all day.

708
00:42:23,782 --> 00:42:26,672
No, I had so much fun.

709
00:42:28,742 --> 00:42:30,602
Ms. Lee.

710
00:42:30,602 --> 00:42:35,222
What I had mentioned earlier.

711
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:37,712
Please consider it.

712
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:44,202
I hope you'll muster up the courage.

713
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:47,302
Okay.

714
00:42:47,302 --> 00:42:49,572
Thank you.

715
00:42:50,712 --> 00:42:52,712
 James ahjussi! 

716
00:42:52,712 --> 00:42:55,572
Hae Deun. Ra Hoon.

717
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:58,242
I was sad thinking that I'd miss you.

718
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,412
It's good to see you.

719
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:01,732
You left without saying bye. I'm sad.

720
00:43:01,732 --> 00:43:03,132
I'm sorry, Hae Deun.

721
00:43:03,132 --> 00:43:05,532
James ahjussi, I missed you so much.

722
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:06,972
Me, too, Ra Hoon.

723
00:43:06,972 --> 00:43:08,772
Ra Hoon.

724
00:43:08,772 --> 00:43:11,762
You can't call him "James" anymore.

725
00:43:11,762 --> 00:43:13,122
No.

726
00:43:13,122 --> 00:43:16,652
Just call me James, at least here.

727
00:43:16,652 --> 00:43:19,202
- All right then.
- Good-bye.

728
00:43:19,202 --> 00:43:20,932
Do you know your way home?

729
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,802
Don't worry. I know my way home.

730
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:25,262
Bye.

731
00:43:25,262 --> 00:43:27,062
- Bye.
 - Be careful going home. 

732
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,552
Yes, yes.

733
00:43:31,572 --> 00:43:34,852
Mom, I guess he hasn't 
gotten his memory back yet.

734
00:43:34,852 --> 00:43:37,672
I guess not.

735
00:43:37,672 --> 00:43:41,642
It's so nice to see him.
 It's been a while.

736
00:43:41,642 --> 00:43:44,232
James ahjussi looks healthier, too.

737
00:43:44,232 --> 00:43:46,062
Right?

738
00:43:46,062 --> 00:43:48,682
Doesn't he look like 
a different person in a suit?

739
00:43:52,582 --> 00:43:55,482
♫  My love  ♫

740
00:43:57,572 --> 00:44:00,212
♫  My love  ♫

741
00:44:02,612 --> 00:44:04,532
 I'll carry this. 

742
00:44:04,532 --> 00:44:09,142
♫  You're my only one  ♫

743
00:44:11,132 --> 00:44:13,452
 How is your depression, Mom? 

744
00:44:13,452 --> 00:44:16,452
 I'm taking medication and
 have therapy sessions. 

745
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:18,582
 I'm getting better. 

746
00:44:21,452 --> 00:44:23,272
I thought...

747
00:44:23,272 --> 00:44:27,032
Min Jae would live happily 
ever after the divorce.

748
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:29,152
She has depression?

749
00:44:29,152 --> 00:44:33,142
♫  You shine down on 
me with comfort  ♫

750
00:44:33,142 --> 00:44:36,172
♫  You're like sunshine to me  ♫

751
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:37,612
I wonder...

752
00:44:38,522 --> 00:44:41,082
how she's doing today.

753
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:45,572
 

754
00:44:45,572 --> 00:44:47,952
 You've improved a lot, Jung Min Jae. 

755
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:51,572
 At this rate, you'll 
overcome depression. 

756
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,122
♫  My love  ♫

757
00:44:56,122 --> 00:44:58,822
I wonder how Woo Jung Hoo is doing.

758
00:44:58,882 --> 00:45:01,162
♫  Only you can give me perfect love  ♫

759
00:45:01,162 --> 00:45:08,382
♫  You're my only one  ♫

760
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:12,122
Moong-i.

761
00:45:16,252 --> 00:45:18,272
Moong-i.

762
00:45:18,272 --> 00:45:20,032
Why did you...

763
00:45:20,032 --> 00:45:22,822
come suddenly while I was yawning?

764
00:45:22,822 --> 00:45:24,552
I know.

765
00:45:24,552 --> 00:45:28,002
Why do you yawn all the time?

766
00:45:28,002 --> 00:45:29,492
Let me see you.

767
00:45:29,492 --> 00:45:32,042
Did your mouth rip?

768
00:45:35,462 --> 00:45:37,182
Stand up.

769
00:45:43,412 --> 00:45:45,142
Where are we going?

770
00:45:59,372 --> 00:46:01,372
Unbelievable.

771
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:04,372
Was it Cunning Penguin?

772
00:46:04,372 --> 00:46:06,052
Hwang Na Ro?

773
00:46:06,862 --> 00:46:10,042
It's the day I went to your 
office basement parking lot.

774
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:11,302
Yeah.

775
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:13,492
Then was it Seo Ah, by chance?

776
00:46:13,492 --> 00:46:15,272
Or two them together?

777
00:46:18,382 --> 00:46:21,582
There's no proof. 
I can't jump to conclusions.

778
00:46:22,932 --> 00:46:25,202
Anyway, it has to be someone

779
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:27,402
who wants to drive you out, 
causing the problem with this.

780
00:46:27,402 --> 00:46:30,142
Also, the outfits disappearing 
from the styling class.

781
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:34,862
If it's Hwang Na Ro's doing, 
I won't stand back.

782
00:46:39,732 --> 00:46:42,132
You must be so upset, Moong-i.

783
00:46:43,182 --> 00:46:44,982
Yeah, a little bit.

784
00:46:46,322 --> 00:46:47,732
Then...

785
00:46:47,732 --> 00:46:51,572
you got dirty from looking
 through the storage?

786
00:46:52,552 --> 00:46:56,102
Gosh, they wouldn't hide it
 inside the building.

787
00:46:56,102 --> 00:46:57,722
Right?

788
00:46:57,722 --> 00:47:01,252
I thought that, too, but just in case.

789
00:47:02,512 --> 00:47:04,532
I had to do something.

790
00:47:04,532 --> 00:47:06,802
I was too angry to sit back.

791
00:47:07,882 --> 00:47:09,112
You did well.

792
00:47:09,112 --> 00:47:11,632
I even confronted Seo Ah.

793
00:47:11,632 --> 00:47:13,402
I'm glad you did.

794
00:47:15,972 --> 00:47:17,922
Am I very dirty?

795
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:19,982
Yes, very.

796
00:47:22,522 --> 00:47:24,102
It's okay.

797
00:47:24,102 --> 00:47:26,042
You're cuter when you're dirty like that.

798
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:29,012
You really look like a puppy. A pup.

799
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:33,582
Finally, you smile.

800
00:47:33,582 --> 00:47:35,842
I have to be by your side, Moong-i.

801
00:47:35,842 --> 00:47:36,992
What if you didn't see me tonight?

802
00:47:36,992 --> 00:47:39,412
You'd be sitting there 
on the street and crying.

803
00:47:39,412 --> 00:47:41,702
I don't cry on the street.

804
00:47:41,702 --> 00:47:45,722
Earlier, it was just that 
I was thinking of seeing you...

805
00:47:45,722 --> 00:47:47,602
So you were thinking of meeting me...

806
00:47:47,602 --> 00:47:49,872
When I thought of seeing you...

807
00:47:49,872 --> 00:47:51,962
You let your guard down.

808
00:47:51,962 --> 00:47:53,402
Right?

809
00:47:58,992 --> 00:48:03,752
I think the CEO is in 
a bind because of me.

810
00:48:03,752 --> 00:48:06,002
My heart is heavy.

811
00:48:08,262 --> 00:48:10,232
You must be.

812
00:48:10,232 --> 00:48:14,272
About this mishap, and I'm sure 
Seo Ah will keep doing that.

813
00:48:17,412 --> 00:48:18,922
Why?

814
00:48:18,922 --> 00:48:22,442
This thought just occurred to me.

815
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:25,832
It's a calm and peaceful lake.

816
00:48:25,832 --> 00:48:28,172
And I flow in

817
00:48:29,262 --> 00:48:31,922
and create all kinds of ripple,

818
00:48:31,922 --> 00:48:34,452
making everyone suffer.

819
00:48:35,592 --> 00:48:38,972
CEO, Koala,

820
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:41,322
and including Seo Ah.

821
00:48:41,322 --> 00:48:44,332
What kind of nonsense is that?

822
00:48:44,332 --> 00:48:47,672
Who's suffering now?
 You're having the hardest time.

823
00:48:50,202 --> 00:48:52,192
You were childlike,

824
00:48:52,192 --> 00:48:55,472
bright, and cute.

825
00:48:55,472 --> 00:48:59,682
One day, you got swept 
by a strange tornado.

826
00:48:59,682 --> 00:49:03,292
But it will pass soon.

827
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:05,672
The tornado won't last forever.

828
00:49:05,672 --> 00:49:08,232
The tornado will tire out.

829
00:49:08,232 --> 00:49:11,422
Right? The tornado will tire out, right?

830
00:49:15,392 --> 00:49:17,002
Moong-i.

831
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,512
My life is...

832
00:49:20,512 --> 00:49:23,942
divided into before and after I met you.

833
00:49:23,942 --> 00:49:26,712
Isn't that too grandioso?

834
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:29,572
Listen.

835
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:34,512
I was very grim as a child.

836
00:49:34,512 --> 00:49:37,302
I fought with Dad all the time.

837
00:49:38,382 --> 00:49:41,392
After I left home,

838
00:49:41,392 --> 00:49:44,842
I failed two businesses.

839
00:49:44,842 --> 00:49:47,412
I lost a studio that I used to live in.

840
00:49:47,412 --> 00:49:49,862
It was really tough.

841
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:53,082
I'd laugh on the outside,

842
00:49:54,082 --> 00:49:56,282
but thought, "What's going on?

843
00:49:56,282 --> 00:49:59,972
Why am I struggling so much?"

844
00:49:59,972 --> 00:50:02,712
It was a bit tough.

845
00:50:02,712 --> 00:50:04,642
One day...

846
00:50:04,642 --> 00:50:08,762
as I buttheaded a super strong woman,

847
00:50:08,762 --> 00:50:10,462
I came to my senses.

848
00:50:14,002 --> 00:50:17,222
That's how I got to know you

849
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:21,972
and living is so fun to me ever since.

850
00:50:23,462 --> 00:50:27,602
When I open my eyes in 
the morning, I think of you first.

851
00:50:27,602 --> 00:50:31,372
And you're looking down 
on me from the ceiling.

852
00:50:31,372 --> 00:50:33,442
Smiling like this.

853
00:50:33,442 --> 00:50:36,952
And I'd look up like this

854
00:50:36,952 --> 00:50:41,192
and laugh, "Ha, ha."

855
00:50:41,192 --> 00:50:43,462
"Ha, ha, ha."

856
00:50:43,462 --> 00:50:44,792
Yeah.

857
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,732
"Ha, ha, ha."

858
00:50:46,732 --> 00:50:50,162
I laugh because I'm happy
 and because it's so neat.

859
00:50:51,772 --> 00:50:53,182
So...

860
00:50:53,182 --> 00:50:56,342
don't say weird stuff like 
you're bothering everyone.

861
00:50:56,342 --> 00:50:57,722
Okay?

862
00:50:59,592 --> 00:51:01,782
You're not answering me.

863
00:51:01,782 --> 00:51:03,982
You got that, Moong-i?

864
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:08,212
Don't laugh so sadly like that.

865
00:51:08,212 --> 00:51:09,702
I can't sleep tonight then.

866
00:51:09,702 --> 00:51:12,432
Laugh big like this.

867
00:51:16,552 --> 00:51:18,692
You have such a cute smile.

868
00:51:19,882 --> 00:51:23,922
♫  Life is so hard  ♫

869
00:51:25,422 --> 00:51:28,962
It's so neat that someone's smile can

870
00:51:28,962 --> 00:51:30,712
make me so happy.

871
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:38,972
♫  Well, just living with
 that in my heart  ♫

872
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:56,812
Maybe I should've given in 
and eaten there.

873
00:52:08,152 --> 00:52:10,322
 You did refuse, 

874
00:52:10,322 --> 00:52:13,972
 but I sent a few side dishes I made. 

875
00:52:19,012 --> 00:52:21,932
 

876
00:52:23,472 --> 00:52:24,982
Geez.

877
00:52:33,072 --> 00:52:34,302
 

878
00:52:43,672 --> 00:52:45,482
What's going on?

879
00:52:46,862 --> 00:52:48,382
"What's going on?"

880
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,632
I was wondering if you ate dinner.

881
00:52:51,632 --> 00:52:54,882
I ate a long time ago. 
Look at the time.

882
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,892
I think you're eating now.

883
00:53:03,922 --> 00:53:05,492
What do you mean?

884
00:53:05,492 --> 00:53:06,872
Don't assume.

885
00:53:08,182 --> 00:53:12,382
Did you go home right after work?

886
00:53:13,312 --> 00:53:15,412
Of course, I did.

887
00:53:17,262 --> 00:53:20,732
But Jung Min Jae.

888
00:53:20,732 --> 00:53:23,692
Why are you checking up
 on my personal life?

889
00:53:23,692 --> 00:53:26,252
Aren't we strangers?

890
00:53:26,252 --> 00:53:28,372
We are strangers.

891
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,312
But you just got your memory back,

892
00:53:30,312 --> 00:53:31,542
and you live alone.

893
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,782
I'm calling just to check.

894
00:53:33,782 --> 00:53:36,292
Don't think of me as your ex-wife.

895
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:39,792
Just think of me as your old friend.

896
00:53:39,792 --> 00:53:41,612
What friend?

897
00:53:41,612 --> 00:53:44,452
- Between a man and a woman.
- A man and woman?

898
00:53:44,452 --> 00:53:46,572
Do I even look like a woman to you?

899
00:53:46,572 --> 00:53:48,012
And you're a man?

900
00:53:48,012 --> 00:53:49,402
Oh, my gosh!

901
00:53:49,402 --> 00:53:50,872
 - Aigoo. 
- Why are you laughing?

902
00:53:50,872 --> 00:53:52,942
Then are you a man?

903
00:53:52,942 --> 00:53:54,442
Am I a woman?

904
00:53:54,442 --> 00:53:57,342
Do you like the side 
dishes I sent you?

905
00:53:58,222 --> 00:54:00,352
Don't know. I haven't eaten them yet.

906
00:54:01,382 --> 00:54:06,422
 Be sure to turn on the heater 
in your room before you go to bed. 

907
00:54:06,422 --> 00:54:08,632
There's a draft in the room. 
It gets cold early in the morning.

908
00:54:08,632 --> 00:54:11,752
I'll take care of it, Jung Min Jae.

909
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:13,762
You do that, Woo Jung Hoo.

910
00:54:13,762 --> 00:54:15,302
I'm hanging up.

911
00:54:17,482 --> 00:54:20,952
Gosh, what terrible manner.

912
00:54:20,952 --> 00:54:24,142
I feel sorry for him, so I try to be nice.

913
00:54:24,142 --> 00:54:26,712
But after talking to him for 
a minute, I lose my temper.

914
00:54:26,712 --> 00:54:28,782
Gosh, gosh.

915
00:54:28,782 --> 00:54:31,912
Jung Min Jae, why did you call him? 
He's living a good life.

916
00:54:48,822 --> 00:54:51,292
Oh, my. What's wrong with me?

917
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:52,492
Oh, my.

918
00:54:52,492 --> 00:54:54,302
Gosh, what do I do?

919
00:54:56,572 --> 00:54:59,252
What is it that you're
 dragging this out?

920
00:55:01,182 --> 00:55:02,842
Lee Hae Deun!

921
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:06,002
- You're breaking all the dishes, right?
 - No, I'm not. 

922
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,492
 I didn't break any. 

923
00:55:11,452 --> 00:55:13,402
Ra Hoon.

924
00:55:13,402 --> 00:55:14,942
What's wrong?

925
00:55:14,942 --> 00:55:16,982
Is something wrong?

926
00:55:16,982 --> 00:55:18,722
Mom.

927
00:55:20,412 --> 00:55:23,972
Mom, actually...

928
00:55:26,512 --> 00:55:28,612
Mom, I...

929
00:55:28,612 --> 00:55:32,072
Mom, I'm actually...

930
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:42,832
You don't have to say it.

931
00:55:42,832 --> 00:55:44,682
Mom.

932
00:55:46,052 --> 00:55:48,132
Did you know?

933
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:51,832
That I don't attend Seohan University?

934
00:55:57,552 --> 00:56:00,172
What? What's this?

935
00:56:00,172 --> 00:56:02,342
 

936
00:56:02,342 --> 00:56:04,952
My gosh. What is all this?

937
00:56:04,952 --> 00:56:09,282
 Mom, I'm sorry for lying about 
being a Seohan University student. 

938
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:15,642
Mom. Mom, I'm really sorry.

939
00:56:15,642 --> 00:56:17,572
I'm really sorry.

940
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:30,482
You must've felt so uneasy
 every single day.

941
00:56:32,632 --> 00:56:34,082
Mom...

942
00:56:36,482 --> 00:56:39,172
I wanted to study really hard...

943
00:56:40,302 --> 00:56:42,512
and make you happy...

944
00:56:42,512 --> 00:56:45,162
by going to a good university.

945
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:48,982
I'm sorry. I'm a fool.

946
00:56:50,322 --> 00:56:51,742
Gosh.

947
00:56:52,682 --> 00:56:54,382
Ra Hoon.

948
00:56:55,552 --> 00:56:58,642
Why are you a fool?

949
00:56:58,642 --> 00:57:01,442
Because you didn't get
 into a good college?

950
00:57:01,442 --> 00:57:06,072
That's just a good college, 
according to other people.

951
00:57:06,072 --> 00:57:08,102
I just...

952
00:57:09,062 --> 00:57:14,912
cheered you on since you had a goal.

953
00:57:14,912 --> 00:57:18,362
I never thought that you have to

954
00:57:18,362 --> 00:57:21,702
attend a good university.

955
00:57:21,702 --> 00:57:23,992
My Ra Hoon...

956
00:57:23,992 --> 00:57:29,852
had a dream and living diligently.

957
00:57:29,852 --> 00:57:33,012
It was so wonderful for me to see.

958
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:39,982
 All right. 

959
00:57:39,982 --> 00:57:42,842
 Let me hug you, Ra Hoon. 

960
00:57:45,282 --> 00:57:47,652
 Don't cry. 

961
00:57:50,352 --> 00:57:52,312
My gosh.

962
00:57:52,312 --> 00:57:54,022
Ra Hoon.

963
00:57:54,842 --> 00:57:58,152
If something comes up again, 
don't hide from me.

964
00:57:58,152 --> 00:58:00,022
- Okay?
- Yes.

965
00:58:00,022 --> 00:58:02,442
It's tough on you.

966
00:58:02,442 --> 00:58:05,112
- Okay?
- Yes, I will.

967
00:58:05,112 --> 00:58:06,792
Okay.

968
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:10,802
Just tell me. You can just talk to me.

969
00:58:10,802 --> 00:58:12,702
Gosh, don't cry.

970
00:58:12,702 --> 00:58:16,022
It's okay. It's okay.

971
00:58:16,022 --> 00:58:17,802
Gosh, you're a baby.

972
00:58:17,802 --> 00:58:20,692
You're a baby crying like this.
 Don't cry.

973
00:58:25,682 --> 00:58:27,432
We can talk at home.

974
00:58:27,432 --> 00:58:29,992
Why did you ask me to come out?

975
00:58:30,862 --> 00:58:32,342
It was you, right?

976
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,742
What?

977
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,802
Wasn't this your piece of work?

978
00:58:37,802 --> 00:58:40,632
You also hid the clothes
 for her styling class.

979
00:58:40,632 --> 00:58:42,062
What the hell?

980
00:58:42,062 --> 00:58:45,272
- Did you open up a PI agency?
- Hwang Na Ro.

981
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:48,302
I told you to stay put if
 you're not going to leave.

982
00:58:48,302 --> 00:58:50,112
I did stay put.

983
00:58:50,112 --> 00:58:53,072
Why would I do such a thing?
 It's a hassle.

984
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,732
Because you and 
Bit Chae Woon are dating?

985
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:56,432
Out of jealousy? Hey.

986
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:57,942
Don't be delusional.

987
00:58:57,942 --> 00:59:00,272
I wasn't into Bit Chae Woon that much.

988
00:59:00,272 --> 00:59:02,132
Didn't you find another target?

989
00:59:02,132 --> 00:59:03,592
Jang Seo Ah.

990
00:59:04,722 --> 00:59:06,392
Did Seo Ah tell you to do this?

991
00:59:06,392 --> 00:59:09,932
Or you did this to 
capture Seo Ah's heart.

992
00:59:09,932 --> 00:59:11,262
Isn't that right?

993
00:59:14,242 --> 00:59:15,922
Hey, you laugh?

994
00:59:15,922 --> 00:59:17,582
Why?

995
00:59:17,582 --> 00:59:19,952
I can't find another target?

996
00:59:19,952 --> 00:59:22,872
It's none of your business what I do.

997
00:59:22,872 --> 00:59:24,752
Nothing is going on with 
you and Jang Seo Ah.

998
00:59:24,752 --> 00:59:26,872
- You a**...
- Hey, a**hole.

999
00:59:26,872 --> 00:59:29,082
Look out for your good.

1000
00:59:29,082 --> 00:59:31,152
Don't meddle in my business.

1001
00:59:31,152 --> 00:59:32,932
This jerk!

1002
00:59:38,522 --> 00:59:40,412
Dang it.

1003
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:44,392
This jerk...

1004
00:59:48,842 --> 00:59:50,652
Hey, Hwang Na Ro.

1005
00:59:50,652 --> 00:59:52,472
I'm warning you.

1006
00:59:52,472 --> 00:59:55,302
If you do anything suspicious, 
I won't let it go.

1007
00:59:55,302 --> 00:59:57,262
If you don't let it go, then what?

1008
00:59:57,262 --> 00:59:59,832
Will you put me away in jail?

1009
01:00:01,292 --> 01:00:04,842
You don't have any proof.

1010
01:00:16,872 --> 01:00:19,992
How could such an evil bastard...

1011
01:00:22,732 --> 01:00:24,602
It hurts.

1012
01:00:40,442 --> 01:00:43,732
I still don't want to move 
out of here, though.

1013
01:01:05,572 --> 01:01:08,362
 What I heard was over the top. 

1014
01:01:08,362 --> 01:01:11,172
 And you try to blame Director Jang? 

1015
01:01:29,222 --> 01:01:33,412
 Why don't you muster up the courage? 

1016
01:01:33,412 --> 01:01:36,252
 I don't think Chae Woon will be hurt 

1017
01:01:36,252 --> 01:01:40,172
 as much as you think. 

1018
01:01:40,172 --> 01:01:42,132
Courage.

1019
01:01:44,432 --> 01:01:47,592
Should I muster up the courage
 and tell her everything?

1020
01:01:48,512 --> 01:01:52,432
That everything happened 
because of the Chairwoman.

1021
01:01:59,942 --> 01:02:04,422
But my Chae Woon will get hurt again.

1022
01:02:24,592 --> 01:02:28,442
 Did you have someone post this? 

1023
01:02:28,442 --> 01:02:32,002
 Anyway, we're all about to go down
 because of you, Soon Jung. 

1024
01:02:32,002 --> 01:02:34,902
 Even with this, you insist 
you won't leave? 

1025
01:02:34,902 --> 01:02:37,472
 If you'll stand your ground foolishly, 

1026
01:02:37,472 --> 01:02:40,022
 take Bit Chae Woon back. 

1027
01:02:57,332 --> 01:02:59,632
 You can leave, Bit Chae Woon. 

1028
01:03:01,842 --> 01:03:03,782
 Leave now. 

1029
01:03:15,302 --> 01:03:17,502
I hurt Chae Woon again...

1030
01:03:32,272 --> 01:03:33,672
My gosh.

1031
01:03:33,672 --> 01:03:36,562
Seo Yeon is crying her heart out,
 and you're her mom.

1032
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,632
Aigoo, aigoo, Seo Yeon...

1033
01:03:38,632 --> 01:03:41,042
Aigoo, Seo Yeon.

1034
01:03:41,042 --> 01:03:42,712
Aigoo...

1035
01:03:42,712 --> 01:03:44,772
Gosh. Don't cry. Don't cry.

1036
01:03:44,772 --> 01:03:46,192
Aigoo, Seo Yeon.

1037
01:03:46,192 --> 01:03:48,632
Soon Jung, come in.

1038
01:03:54,352 --> 01:03:56,302
Young Lady Jung Won.

1039
01:03:56,302 --> 01:03:58,382
Long time no see.

1040
01:04:01,702 --> 01:04:03,352
Hey, Soon Jung.

1041
01:04:03,352 --> 01:04:06,982
Calm her down somehow.

1042
01:04:06,982 --> 01:04:09,672
Aigoo. Here.

1043
01:04:09,672 --> 01:04:13,812
Gosh, all the helpers quit.

1044
01:04:13,812 --> 01:04:17,472
We have no one to take care of the baby.

1045
01:04:17,472 --> 01:04:21,732
And Jung Won is in that state 
with depression or something.

1046
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:25,292
And who knows what kind 
of trouble Pil Hong is up to.

1047
01:04:25,292 --> 01:04:26,742
I can't even reach him.

1048
01:04:26,742 --> 01:04:28,332
Oh, my.

1049
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:30,022
Look at her.

1050
01:04:30,022 --> 01:04:33,072
She's smiling since you're holding her.

1051
01:04:33,072 --> 01:04:34,552
My gosh.

1052
01:04:35,602 --> 01:04:37,372
Hey, Soon Jung.

1053
01:04:37,372 --> 01:04:41,692
You said you're not working at 
the factory since it's Sunday, right?

1054
01:04:41,692 --> 01:04:43,342
Yes, ma'am.

1055
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:47,002
Then please take care of the baby today.

1056
01:04:47,002 --> 01:04:49,402
As you can see, the mom is in that state.

1057
01:04:49,402 --> 01:04:52,242
I'm so nervous.

1058
01:04:53,502 --> 01:04:56,402
- Okay, I'll do that.
- All right.

1059
01:04:57,682 --> 01:04:59,202
Gosh.

1060
01:04:59,202 --> 01:05:03,332
Aigoo, my Seo Yeon is smiling.

1061
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:04,942
Aigoo.

1062
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:07,252
Aigoo, so pretty.

1063
01:05:12,832 --> 01:05:14,842
Young Lady.

1064
01:05:14,842 --> 01:05:19,232
Please get stronger for
 Seo Yeon's sake.

1065
01:05:21,902 --> 01:05:24,972
I'm exhausted.

1066
01:05:24,972 --> 01:05:27,402
My Seo Yeon...

1067
01:05:28,722 --> 01:05:31,472
I don't even know how
 I'm going to raise her.

1068
01:05:32,982 --> 01:05:35,752
I'm too exhausted.

1069
01:05:52,142 --> 01:05:54,012
CEO.

1070
01:06:03,642 --> 01:06:05,542
Seo Yeon.

1071
01:06:06,992 --> 01:06:09,192
You asked me why...

1072
01:06:09,192 --> 01:06:14,072
I had lost you back then, right?

1073
01:06:18,382 --> 01:06:23,112
You asked me what I was 
doing when I lost you.

1074
01:06:24,032 --> 01:06:25,632
CEO.

1075
01:06:33,732 --> 01:06:35,752
Actually...

1076
01:06:38,272 --> 01:06:40,222
it was my fault.

1077
01:06:43,662 --> 01:06:45,712
I should have...

1078
01:06:48,632 --> 01:06:52,572
protected you no matter what.

1079
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:57,742
It's all my fault.

1080
01:06:59,272 --> 01:07:02,052
I'm sorry, Seo Yeon.

1081
01:07:09,732 --> 01:07:11,692
I'm sorry.

1082
01:07:29,282 --> 01:07:31,362
 

1083
01:07:49,262 --> 01:07:52,492
Seo Yeon is so pretty.

1084
01:07:52,492 --> 01:07:54,342
Aigoo.

1085
01:07:54,342 --> 01:07:56,592
Aigoo, so pretty.

1086
01:08:15,602 --> 01:08:20,002
♫  I'm in love, I'm in love  ♫

1087
01:08:20,002 --> 01:08:23,852
♫  I'm in love with you  ♫

1088
01:08:23,852 --> 01:08:31,062
♫  Stay with me forever  ♫

1089
01:08:31,062 --> 01:08:43,672
♫  It makes me fill up my whole day 
with the thoughts of you  ♫

1090
01:08:43,672 --> 01:08:46,432
♫  Just like that...  ♫

1091
01:08:46,432 --> 01:08:48,052
 

1092
01:08:48,052 --> 01:08:49,842
 I won't tell Chae Woon. 

1093
01:08:49,842 --> 01:08:52,412
 
 Did Seo Ah send out the post? 

1094
01:08:52,412 --> 01:08:56,142
 It was you who posted an article
 saying I'm CEO's daughter. 

1095
01:08:56,142 --> 01:08:57,992
 Jung, shall we go on a date today? 

1096
01:08:57,992 --> 01:09:00,602
 I said I'd treat you to everything
 including a movie. 

1097
01:09:01,632 --> 01:09:02,812
 Ra Hoon. 

1098
01:09:03,742 --> 01:09:05,812
 I'm sorry. 

1099
01:09:05,812 --> 01:09:08,002
 Jung Won is looking for me? 

1100
01:09:08,002 --> 01:09:09,842
 Ms. Goo, give me a cup of coffee. 

1101
01:09:09,842 --> 01:09:12,472
 - Jung Won, long time no see.
- How did you get in here? 

1102
01:09:12,472 --> 01:09:14,162
 - Ms. Lee.
- Mr. Woo. 

1103
01:09:14,162 --> 01:09:18,472
 Long time no see. I'm Jung Won's 
friend Min Jae's husband. 

1104
01:09:18,472 --> 01:09:21,532
 Mr. Woo, you remember?
