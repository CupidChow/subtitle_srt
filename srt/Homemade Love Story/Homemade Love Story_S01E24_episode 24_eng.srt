1
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,320
     

2
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,500
You look great.

3
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:09,000
I guess you're happy since you sent your daughter to a wealthy family.

4
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,670
Have you been spying on Chae Woon and me?

5
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,460
You guys are the ones who might do something at any time.

6
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,490
What kind of plots did you guys talk about while meeting in the middle of the night?

7
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:46,630
Do this and that to get this old grandma down. Did you coach something like this to her?

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,700
Think as you want to.

9
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,690
Soon Jung.

10
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,960
You should leave.

11
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,110
Forget about renting business and everything, and just leave far away.

12
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,770
To the place where nobody can find you.

13
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,680
- Why do I have to leave? 
 - Because you are a sinner.

14
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,270
I had to hide about raising Chae Woon to young lady Jung Won.

15
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,380
And I couldn't tell Chae Woon about her real mother.

16
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,780
Yes, I had been living feeling like a sinner. But!

17
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,640
That's all because of you.

18
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,170
You begged me before, and now you're calling me a sinner?

19
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,190
It's a sin that you were the mother of Bit Chae Woon.

20
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,130
Your sin is that you brought a precious child and made her suffer.

21
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:53,600
That you are some kind of a mother and make Bit Chae Woon run to you, that is your sin. Did you understand me?

22
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:06,020
You said you want me to recognize Bit Chae Woon as my granddaughter, right?

23
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,380
If you really want that to happen, you have to disappear.

24
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,680
If you are here like a ticking timebomb, I can't live because you're getting on my nerves.

25
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,020
About what happened between you and me, I didn't tell anyone.

26
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,100
- You don't have to worry about it. 
   - No.  

27
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,200
I think Bit Chae Woon figured something out about it.

28
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,060
Soon Jung. Leave far away.

29
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,880
If you leave far away, Seo Yeon, no I meant,

30
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,500
Bit Chae Woon, I'll recognize her as my granddaughter.

31
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,800
If you don't leave,

32
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:55,950
Bit Chae Woon, she's going to suffer and be thrown out of my family.

33
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,780
I'm not going anywhere.

34
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:17,100
I'm going to watch that my Chae Woon is getting happy and getting recognized as your granddaughter.

35
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,900
We'll see.

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,500
I wonder if you can say that after seeing Bit Chae Woon suffering and drying out like a branch in the winter.

37
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,600
With this, go far away and get a place.

38
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,270
It would be enough.

39
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,800
Take this with you!

40
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,210
Get out of my way!

41
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,400
Take this with you.

42
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,410
Chairwoman Lee Choon Seok! Stop insulting me!

43
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,500
You will be leaving.

44
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,800
I left my phone at home! I'm such an idiot!

45
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,970
Who is that?

46
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,020
Noonim! Who was that elderly person?

47
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,400
Noonim! Why are you so pale?

48
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,900
Oh! Noonim!

49
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,700
It's nothing. I'm fine, Hwak Se.

50
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,900
     

51
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,960
Why are you calling me again!

52
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,440
I'm just wondering if you're okay, father.

53
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,600
It wasn't that long time ago you left the house.

54
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,170
  I'm not a child!  

55
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,450
If you have any problem, just call Jae Hee or me right away!

56
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,110
There would be no problems, and I'm going to do everything by myself.

57
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,070
I was reviewing the backlogged work, so I'm hanging up!

58
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,500
He definitely recovered his memory. Well, it's better in a way.

59
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,500
- Mom. 
 - Yes?

60
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,580
I was thinking about this while we were coming here.

61
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,780
I think we shouldn't tell about him recovering his memory to the people in Samgwang villa for a while.

62
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,120
Why?

63
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,930
Your father recovering his memory is a good thing!

64
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,920
I think we should talk about this to Soon Jung and the people in Samgwang villa, and express our gratitude, too.

65
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,600
I talked with the doctor.

66
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,830
He did recover his memory, but it'll be confusing for a while.

67
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,580
He might be a little bit depressed as an aftereffect as well.

68
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,930
And the psychological test result shows that

69
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,180
he feels most stable when he thinks about the time in Samgwang villa.

70
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:58,630
So you are saying we should give him a psychological refuge for a while?

71
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,600
Right.

72
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,010
Let's leave it until he talks about it himself to the people in Samgwang villa.

73
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,140
That makes sense after hearing from you.

74
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,830
Do you think he's acting like he doesn't remember anything about Samgwang villa to us

75
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,080
because he feels embarrassed?

76
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,820
I think so.

77
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:25,150
Because the father will also be aware that he was a completely different person from the original him when he was James.

78
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,840
He was a completely different person!

79
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,090
Did a strong wind

80
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,220
blow into my heart?

81
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,440
  Hae Deun! The schedule for the domestic training camp changed to a closer date!  

82
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,920
  It starts next week, and you can move into the place from tomorrow.  

83
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:16,150
Unni is not home, and if I go into the training camp...

84
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,320
I should talk about this to Ra Hoon first.

85
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,600
It's exam period, so he must be at school now.

86
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,460
  Here's your drink!  

87
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,510
  Thank you! Please come again!  

88
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,400
What? Is it Ra Hoon?

89
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,500
Is he doing a part-time job?

90
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,700
- He wouldn't have enough time to study... 
 - I'll be back from delivery!

91
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,000
Cha Ba Reun?

92
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,690
  Thank you. Enjoy!  

93
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,700
Noona.

94
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,380
Hey, are you doing a part-time job here?

95
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,820
What?

96
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,580
- Yes... 
 - I thought you didn't have enough time just to study, how can you afford to do a part-time job?

97
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,040
Noona, I'm busy right now.

98
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,150
- Let's talk later at home! 
 - I'm here to talk about something with you.

99
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,670
- No, no, let's talk later. I'm sorry! 
 - Wait, wait!

100
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,710
- I'm sorry. 
 - I said I have something to talk about with you!

101
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,500
- What's wrong? 
 - Let's talk later. I'm really busy right now!

102
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Here you go. Thank you!

103
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,850
It's strange.

104
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,180
Cha Ba Reun is taking a semester off, so she can work.

105
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,710
But did Ra Hoon's semester is already over?

106
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,370
We'll be back!

107
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,270
Welcome! What can I get for you?

108
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,500
Hello! I'm the older sister of Ra Hoon, who works here.

109
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,920
Ah, is that so!

110
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,390
- Ra Hoon went out for delivery right now. 
 - Ah, okay.

111
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,420
- Is he doing well? 
 - Of course!

112
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,180
Ra Hoon is working very hard.

113
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:13,830
He gave up the college that everybody goes to and start working at an early age,

114
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,900
so I'm always impressed by him. Don't you think so, too?

115
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,130
- I'm sorry? 
 - Ah, and I heard that he also wants to open a food truck like this!

116
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:26,150
A young fellow works multiple part-time jobs and saving money. That's not an easy thing to do!

117
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,000
You have an amazing brother!

118
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,700
  Do you want a cup of coffee?  

119
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,000
Noona! Were you still here?

120
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,480
Lee Ra Hoon.

121
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,830
Noona.

122
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,260
Noona... Noona...

123
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,270
Hey!

124
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,350
How can you tell such a huge lie?

125
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,280
How can you say you were a college student when you didn't even go to a college?

126
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,150
Noona, I'm really sorry.

127
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,970
I didn't mean to lie...

128
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,690
I tried three times, but I failed again.

129
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,520
So I couldn't tell that to you guys and mom.

130
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,670
At first, Hwak Se kept asking me which college I got into,

131
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,930
so I said I got into Seohan university on a whim, but that spread quickly.

132
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,850
Even auntie came up to Seoul because she heard about it.

133
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,960
Most of all, mom was...

134
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,810
mom was really happy about it.

135
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,410
She was crying because of happiness. And you guys were excited about it, too, so I couldn't tell you the truth!

136
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,300
I'm sorry, Noona. I'm really sorry...

137
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,580
No, it's not a thing for you to be sorry.

138
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,480
But you should've told us.

139
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,880
You guys were all looking at me and expecting me to do well!

140
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,650
And mom was--

141
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,920
mom was working multiple housekeeper jobs to support me to study for the college exam again.

142
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,070
And because of that, she got water on her knees and suffered!

143
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,150
Also, when big sister gets her paycheck, she always gave me pocket money first.

144
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,590
And on Sundays, when she's exhausted coming back from the construction sites,

145
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,410
she thought of me first and taught math to me.

146
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,370
And you.

147
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,830
When we were young, you always said 'Ra Hoon is very smart,' 'Ra Hoon is different from me,' to the other people.

148
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,310
'My brother... my brother will be a big person.'

149
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,120
I know that you always said it like that proudly to your friends.

150
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:58,100
I wanted to tell you when I make a lot of money and open my own food truck.

151
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,630
Even though I wasn't good at studying,

152
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,960
I wanted to show that I did my best.

153
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,650
I wanted to say it like that to you guys and mom.

154
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,620
Noona, I'm really sorry...

155
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,010
Hey, don't cry.

156
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,380
- Good job, guys! 
 - Hello!

157
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,300
  - Hello, Mr. Woo!   
 - Hello!

158
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
  Mr. Woo!  

159
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,310
How is your father?

160
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,510
He's a lot better now. Thank you for covering for me yesterday and today.

161
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,880
It's nothing. I'm glad to hear your father is better.

162
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,580
I did this on the second floor--

163
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:04,070
I should get close to him first and get close to Seo Yeon through him.

164
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,440
Mr. Woo!

165
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,360
  Mr. Woo!  

166
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,140
Are you okay?

167
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,640
Are you okay, Mr. Lee?

168
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,840
- I'm fine. Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

169
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,360
Thank you, you saved me.

170
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,140
- Thank you so much! What should I do for you? 
 - I'm really fine.

171
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,320
I'm fine.

172
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,970
Mr. Lee, you are very quick!

173
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:42,750
I was once famous as the Jiri Mountain tiger. Flash in the east, flash in the west!

174
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,740
- You were the Jiri Mountain tiger? 
 - Yes. And my head is very strong as well!

175
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,870
- I know a person who has a strong forehead as well. 
 - Is that so?

176
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,110
- Thank you so much. 
 - Thank goodness that nothing happened.

177
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,460
  Where did Gomgomi go?  

178
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,670
  I definitely left it over here.  

179
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,520
  Chae Woon, what are you looking for?  

180
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
  Chae Woon.  

181
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,050
  - Were you looking for this? 
 - Gomgomi!  

182
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,600
  - Gomgoma! 
 - It got so dirty, so I washed it for you.  

183
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,500
  Thank you, mom.  

184
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,200
  - Do you like Gomgomi that much? 
 - Yes!  

185
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,000
  I think I just got attached because I had this since I was a baby.  

186
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,900
  It's because you said this was from my dad when he was leaving me at the orphanage.  

187
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,570
  But if my mom knows about the reason, then she must be sad.  

188
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,340
  So it's my secret.  

189
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:23,030
  Even in the future, if my dad sees this, then he'll recognize me!  

190
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,260
  What are you going to do by sending Seo Yeon to our place after all those years!  

191
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,090
  The child of the filthy person, Park Pil Hong!  

192
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,650
Park Pil Hong...

193
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,160
My father...

194
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,850
Is he really a bad person?

195
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,570
  Knock, knock. Excuse me.  

196
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,850
  Knock, knock. I'm busy.   

197
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:18,730
  Even though you're busy, you have to see me now. I'm at the parking lot of your office.  

198
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,310
Here.

199
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,680
I thought you might be hungry.

200
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,440
When you're hungry, you get very angry.

201
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,700
How did you know about that? Thank you for the food.

202
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,440
One second.

203
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,130
- I don't need this. 
 - You should wear it.

204
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,790
It got really cold out there.

205
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,850
Ah, how is your father?

206
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,560
He's at home now. The test results were fine, too.

207
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,710
It's good to hear that.

208
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,520
But he must be lonely by himself after living with lots of people in Samgwang villa.

209
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,390
So my mom kept insisting on staying with him for a while,

210
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,920
but father was saying we should all leave.

211
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,610
My father's personality is like that originally.

212
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:31,710
I can't imagine that! If I think about him, I can only picture kind James.

213
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:38,720
That's why I'm confused, too.  And for now, I'm not going to tell Samgwang villa people about my father recovered his memory.

214
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:43,260
Because he might feel awkward if he visits Samgwang villa?

215
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,670
- Right. 
 - Okay.

216
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,890
I think that'll be better for now.

217
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,200
  I know you refused it, but I made some food and sending it to you.  

218
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,550
  If you need help, then don't hesitate and call me!  

219
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,570
Jung Min Jae! You dumped and left me!

220
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,000
It's so strange.

221
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:22,060
Why am I getting angry after recovering my memory?

222
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,690
Why do I feel sad, angry, and unfair to everyone?

223
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,600
And lonely as well.

224
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,400
  This is really good! It's very delicious!  

225
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,960
  - The soup has a deep flavor and delicious. 
 - Right?  

226
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,920
Ah, I'm hungry...

227
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,900
This is good..!

228
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,320
  Do you remember the time when you lived in the Samgwang villa?  

229
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,530
  Let me carry that for you.  

230
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,700
How could he be like such a different person?

231
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,500
I'm worried if he's doing okay.

232
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,800
  Ms. Jung Min Jae! Aren't we strangers now?  

233
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:55,880
Woo Jung Hoo! Why do you make me worry about you! Why!

234
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,440
I'm full now. But I got sleepy from the food.

235
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,910
Are you sleepy? Then you can sleep on my shoulder in my car.

236
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,890
No, I have to go. I have lots of things to do!

237
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,500
About Hwang Na Ro, is there any suspicious behavior from him? Maybe he puts you in trouble?

238
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,220
Nothing happened yet.

239
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,370
If he does something to me, I wouldn't just stand that.

240
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:29,200
Ah, is he not doing any unexpected things at home? I'm worried.

241
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,840
He's still very polite to your mother at home.

242
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,080
If he does something, I won't stand that!

243
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,800
- I won't stand that! 
 - You're so cute!

244
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,450
How is the styling class project going?

245
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,660
I'm working hard on it, but I don't know.

246
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,300
It feels like I'm on the test.

247
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,470
I'm going to hit a home-run.

248
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:01,300
Yes! I firmly believe that you'll hit a home-run!

249
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,700
Since you believe me firmly, it gives me energy!

250
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,600
By the way, I don't know why I get more affectionate to you whenever I see you more!

251
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,300
- What's the reason? 
 - Stop it! Don't do that!

252
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,900
  - Why? 
 - Stop it!  

253
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,900
  Jae Hee oppa.  

254
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,620
  He looks happy.  

255
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,520
  Why can't it be me? Why?  

256
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,440
Oppa!

257
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,290
- Seo Ah! 
 - Why did you have to come all the way here?

258
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,640
Why did you have to come to my office!

259
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,980
Ah, Koala said he's going to the construction site after this.

260
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,390
It's going to be cold outside.

261
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,860
  It's the second basement floor.  

262
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,710
Ah, I'm sorry, I came to your office.

263
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,090
- But Chae Woon is working late, so I thought she must be hungry. 
 - That's what I'm talking about.

264
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,420
Why does it have to be Bit Chae Woon?

265
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,460
- What? 
 - Why can't I be with you, but Bit Chae Woon can?

266
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,500
Why does it have to be Bit Chae Woon? Why?

267
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,580
Why does it have to be her who came to take everything from me!

268
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,790
Seo Ah, calm down. She doesn't have any intention to take anything from you.

269
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,100
If you keep being like this, then I feel bad for you.

270
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:32,550
You were a cute kid! You're my best friend's younger sister, so I adored you since you were a baby!

271
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,000
  Then, please don't make me sick, oppa.  

272
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,190
Please don't make me go crazier than this.

273
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,950
Can't you just date somebody else?

274
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,860
Please date any other woman but Bit Chae Woon!

275
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,740
  Please date someone else!  

276
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,990
Seo Ah.

277
00:24:55,010 --> 00:25:00,330
What should I do? What can I do to help you?

278
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,350
Then, break up with Bit Chae Woon.

279
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,060
That's the way to help me.

280
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,350
Seo Ah.

281
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,480
If you don't break up with her, she's going to suffer more and more.

282
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,970
And I'm going to break down more!

283
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,450
Hey.

284
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,450
Do your job well.

285
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,780
  Jung Won, I feel like  

286
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,550
  there's something more to this case.   

287
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,470
  It's okay to judge in any way  

288
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,240
  about what I can't tell you anymore.  

289
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,900
Is Soon Jung hiding something from me?

290
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,850
  If you leave far away, Seo Yeon, no I meant,  

291
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,310
  Bit Chae Woon, I'll recognize her as my granddaughter.  

292
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,780
Yes, young lady Jung Won.

293
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,020
Did I bother you when you were having some rest?

294
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,350
No, you didn't.

295
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,180
I was working.

296
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,280
Chae Woon is doing well.

297
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,040
She's working late tonight, so she hasn't come home yet.

298
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,630
Is that so.

299
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:08,010
  How can I ask what she is hiding from me?  

300
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,400
By the way, why did you call me?

301
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Oh, yes...There's an event about styling class in our company, and I want to invite you.

302
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,720
Oh...

303
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,790
I can't go there.

304
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,740
I think I shouldn't go.

305
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,680
Right. I understand how you feel.

306
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,000
After sending Chae Woon to me and coming to the event,

307
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,930
I thought it might be uncomfortable for you, but...

308
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:04,200
It's like a dream that my Seo Yeon came back to me,

309
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,480
  and after thinking about it over and over again,  

310
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,890
I feel so grateful for you, Soon Jung.

311
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,810
Until now,

312
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,800
  you raised Seo Yeon so well. I'm thankful for that, too.  

313
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,720
I am Seo Yeon's mom,

314
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,190
but you are also Chae Woon's mom.

315
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:50,300
So if you come to the event, I think Chae Woon can do a better job.

316
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,890
What do you think, Soon Jung?

317
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,100
It's so cold...

318
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,220
- Guess who? 
 - Oh!

319
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,700
Judging from this beautiful scent,

320
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,480
are you my pretty Jjung-a?

321
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,030
Who the heck is Jjung-a?

322
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,050
Because your name is Man Jung,

323
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:38,180
so you're my pretty Jjung-a.

324
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,570
What is that?

325
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,920
So I'm not being called an aunt anymore, and I'm Jjung-a?

326
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,170
Of course!

327
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,660
You're my precious Jjung-a.

328
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,950
What is that! But why are you standing here when your work is done?

329
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,110
I was waiting for you. My pretty Jjung-a!

330
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,850
Were you waiting for me?

331
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,230
It's very cold right now!

332
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,520
What are you talking about it! It's hot!

333
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,800
I'm wearing a coat of love right now.

334
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,100
I'm not cold, Jjung-a. I'm hot!

335
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,400
- I don't want to go home! 
 - I don't want to go either, Jjung-a!

336
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,040
We got to Samgwang villa so soon.

337
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,270
Shall we go inside?

338
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,730
Let's just go around the block one more time.

339
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,490
We just walked around the neighborhood 25 times.

340
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:45,070
Let's go inside now.  Jjung-a's feet are getting frozen!

341
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,150
Are your feet getting cold? That can't happen.

342
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,000
You bad winter cold! I'm going to smack you! I'm not cold at all. I'm hot.

343
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,110
Don't take it off! You might catch a cold.

344
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,370
- Let's go inside! 
 - Yes!

345
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,560
Oh, that's right!

346
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:07,300
Earlier today, this old lady came to our villa.

347
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:13,680
She was very luxurious but looks scary and have a strong aura.

348
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:19,640
I don't know what she talked about with our Noonim, but Noonim was standing in the yard with a pale face.

349
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,930
- An old lady? 
 - Yes.

350
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,210
  I'm going out for a work-out.  

351
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:45,540
  - Oh, come on! 
 - No, it's real! I work-out at night.  

352
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,020
  - Good night. 
 - Come on!  

353
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,410
  It's real...  

354
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,030
It makes me reminisce.

355
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,920
Mr. Yoo Jae Hee.

356
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,600
Not that brat Jae Hee.

357
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,160
Mr. Yoo Jae Hee.

358
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,870
  I'm sorry that I made you uncomfortable.  

359
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,870
It makes me reminisce about James.

360
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,640
Not my father.

361
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,460
Mr. Yoo Jae Hee.

362
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,800
    
    

363
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,300
     

364
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,200
One hundred and Seventy-nine thousand won...

365
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,820
Wow.

366
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,140
My father didn't change at all.

367
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,160
  Thank you so much!  

368
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,519
You thought I would've forgotten about it.

369
00:34:21,549 --> 00:34:24,499
I'm very precise with money stuff.

370
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:35,609
  Also, I didn't tell Samgwang villa people about you recover your memory.  

371
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:37,299
  I thought you should know about that.  

372
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:42,639
What do I need to know about it!

373
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:56,019
Samgwang villa people, they have nothing to do with me anymore!

374
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,849
I don't care!

375
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:04,789
When you feel complicated inside of your head, cleaning is the best!

376
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,669
What?

377
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:13,479
  When you feel anxious, cleaning is the best!  

378
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,719
What am I doing right now?

379
00:35:39,419 --> 00:35:41,019
This brat!

380
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,919
Chae Woon!

381
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:56,559
CEO!

382
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:58,819
I'm here to pick you up.

383
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:01,799
- Did you come here just for me? 
 - Yes!

384
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:03,979
How is your work going?

385
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:08,819
I'm working on it, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

386
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:13,929
What are you talking about it? You're doing great!

387
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:22,219
I don't have any other cup, so it's my mug.

388
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:26,249
This is your mug.

389
00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:29,679
It's so pretty!

390
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:40,729
I was always coming here as the LX CEO,

391
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:45,859
but it felt different to come here as your mom.

392
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:48,419
How does it feel?

393
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:53,179
It feels really great!

394
00:36:57,339 --> 00:37:04,309
I want to say "please take care of my daughter," to the CEO or the director.

395
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:07,189
Really?

396
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,959
What's going on?

397
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:17,459
Do you want to say something?

398
00:37:22,689 --> 00:37:24,699
What is it?

399
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:34,899
I have been just wondering about it a little bit.

400
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:41,349
How did you lose me?

401
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:46,149
I thought about it,

402
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:54,849
but I don't think you're a person who might just lose me.

403
00:37:58,049 --> 00:37:59,689
Well...

404
00:38:01,419 --> 00:38:04,319
I told you about this before as well,

405
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:08,339
but at that time I was very sick.

406
00:38:08,629 --> 00:38:13,589
It was hard to survive every day.

407
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:20,699
So at the moment when I couldn't give attention,

408
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:23,889
I lost you.

409
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:34,419
But that can't be an excuse.

410
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:40,629
I had to protect my daughter no matter what.

411
00:38:43,339 --> 00:38:45,689
I'm sorry, Seo Yeon.

412
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:48,749
I'm really sorry for you.

413
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,789
No, don't be sorry.

414
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:56,589
I'm sorry. I should've not asked you about this.

415
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:00,789
No, it's okay!

416
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:05,759
Shall we go home now?

417
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:07,259
Yes.

418
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:15,029
- Ah, I can do it! 
 - No, it's okay! Let me do it for you.

419
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:18,289
I always wanted to do something like this.

420
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:24,549
Picking up my daughter, who's working late. I feel like now I'm a real mother.

421
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:34,239
- Please give that to me. It's heavy. 
 - It's not heavy at all!

422
00:39:34,269 --> 00:39:35,869
Here!

423
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:05,519
- Good night! 
 - Good night!

424
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:19,819
Weren't you asleep, Seo Ah?

425
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:21,819
I guess you went out to pick up Bit Chae Woon?

426
00:40:22,749 --> 00:40:26,069
Yes, it got really late because she had to work overtime.

427
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:28,579
Then, why are you coming in so secretively?

428
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:31,169
You didn't do anything wrong.

429
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:36,719
Seo Ah! How is your condition? Seo Ah!

430
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:10,319
Mom...

431
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:21,009
Mom is standing outside again.

432
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:26,429
I guess she's doing that because it makes her feel like unni might come back.

433
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:32,319
Ra Hoon!

434
00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:35,749
Mom.

435
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:37,439
Yes, Ra Hoon?

436
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:40,019
Why are you standing out here?

437
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:45,419
- I just felt stuffy. 
 - It's cold outside.

438
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:48,669
Your hands are all frozen.

439
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:51,549
I'm fine.

440
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:54,199
Let's go inside! It's getting cold.

441
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:56,919
- Mom! 
 - Yes?

442
00:41:57,869 --> 00:41:59,759
I...

443
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,739
I mean, I...

444
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:12,039
Mom, I'm actually...

445
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:17,589
Mom! Why are you out here when it's cold? You might catch a cold. Let's go inside.

446
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:21,269
Yes! It's cold out. Ra Hoon, let's go inside.

447
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:24,859
Sure.

448
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:29,119
- Mom! 
 - Yes?

449
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:33,659
Are you hungry? Should I make something for you?

450
00:42:35,129 --> 00:42:36,559
No.

451
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:39,539
I'm really sleepy!

452
00:42:39,549 --> 00:42:44,269
If you're not hungry, then why don't we talk about it later? You guys should go upstairs and go to bed.

453
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:48,389
- Go to bed, guys! 
 - Okay. Good night, mom!

454
00:42:50,169 --> 00:42:54,829
Noona, what should I do? I really can't say it.

455
00:42:55,319 --> 00:43:00,119
Tell her next time. Today is not the only day. Let's go upstairs.

456
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:21,719
I can't pretend that I know about it first.

457
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:28,839
Our sweet Ra Hoon. He must be undergoing more inside!

458
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:37,079
The president is here!

459
00:43:41,029 --> 00:43:47,079
I was out of the office for a while because of my health issue,

460
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:51,849
but I had been getting reports about the work progress.

461
00:43:51,919 --> 00:43:57,349
Even though I was not around, I want to express my sincere gratitude to all of you

462
00:43:57,349 --> 00:44:01,419
who worked hard and maintained our company.

463
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:08,019
Let's give a round of applause to our president Woo Jung Hoo who came back to the office!

464
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:12,499
President Woo Jung Hoo, stay healthy! Hooray to the president!

465
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:16,319
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

466
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:20,079
Hooray! President! I hope you live long and healthy!

467
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:26,359
He's buttering me up too much! It's embarrassing.

468
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:45,889
  I thought president Woo Jung Hoo was retired!  

469
00:44:45,899 --> 00:44:48,219
  I know, I thought so, too.  

470
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,499
  Ah! The company life is going to be suffocating again.  

471
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:55,619
  - I was happy not to see the stingy president. 
 - I know!  

472
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:09,049
  Ah! The company life is going to be suffocating again.  

473
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:11,949
  I was happy not to see the stingy president.  

474
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:36,689
- Please, give that to me. 
 - No, I got this!

475
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:39,119
Just give it to me.

476
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,469
Thank you, Mr. Lee!

477
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:44,889
Hey, Woo Jae Hee!

478
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:50,609
J-Jang Joon Ah!

479
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:52,989
Hey! When did you come back?

480
00:45:53,029 --> 00:45:56,309
- How have you been! 
 - I don't care how you have been.

481
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:00,419
Do they say hello like this in London these days?

482
00:46:00,419 --> 00:46:03,139
This bastard, you really...

483
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:06,759
How can you make my one and only baby sister cry that much?

484
00:46:06,789 --> 00:46:10,739
You're such a bad guy. I think I have to show my killer move again.

485
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:14,209
Hey, what is that over there? This bastard!

486
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:19,139
Did you do it wrong or not?

487
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:22,779
Wait, what is it? Who is this person? Is he a policeman?

488
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:28,449
- Who the hell is this person? 
 - Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee!

489
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:31,079
- It's not like that. 
   - Who is it?  

490
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:35,819
My goodness. Joon Ah, are you okay?

491
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,439
It's the other arm.

492
00:46:38,449 --> 00:46:43,869
What's wrong with you, mister? We were just playing as friends.

493
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:47,289
I'm sorry. I thought a bad person was bothering Mr. Woo.

494
00:46:47,299 --> 00:46:50,009
A bad person? I'm the bad one, not him?

495
00:46:50,029 --> 00:46:53,479
Why do I look like a bad person? If anybody, he looks like a bad one.

496
00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:57,219
- Don't I look like a super kind person? 
 - He's my friend!

497
00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:00,389
- Thank you so much, Mr. Lee! You can go back to work. 
 - Alright.

498
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:10,479
See? I live like this. My relationships are so tight with trust,

499
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:16,059
- so everyone tries to save me when I'm in trouble. 
 - Why are you keep massaging this arm!

500
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:20,929
Stop kidding with me. What are you going to do with Seo Ah!

501
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:24,239
Is the hurting arm is the other side..?

502
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:30,319
I'm worried about Seo Ah, too. She seems to be more obsessed with me these days.

503
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:37,269
This is all because... what was that girl's name? The daughter of my mom.

504
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:40,099
- Bit Chae Woon? 
 - Yes, Bit Chae Woon. It's all because of her.

505
00:47:40,109 --> 00:47:44,629
- I don't think it's all because of her. 
 - You are taking her side!

506
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:49,359
  Why is he not leaving?  

507
00:47:49,509 --> 00:47:51,859
Anyway, you should do it well!

508
00:47:51,879 --> 00:47:54,269
I can't see my baby sister suffer like that.

509
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:58,349
If it's keep being like this, I don't care if you're my friend or not.

510
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:02,139
Why are you saying that when we haven't seen each other for a long time!

511
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,739
Why do you look like Koala so much? You weren't like that when you were young.

512
00:49:17,139 --> 00:49:19,979
Chairwoman, I didn't know that you were coming today.

513
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,569
Then, should I go back home, CEO?

514
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:42,429
We gave the point with turtleneck pull-over details,

515
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:46,009
and we used the windproof lining to increase the warmth.

516
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:47,819
- With gloves and-- 
 - Bit Chae Woon!

517
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:54,019
Hello! You came to our event! Thank you.

518
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:58,109
Of course, I should come, since you gave me the invitation.

519
00:49:58,219 --> 00:50:02,119
- I heard you're hosting the event today. 
 - Yes.

520
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,119
- Are you nervous? 
 - Yes.

521
00:50:04,509 --> 00:50:09,009
Why are you nervous! You're a brave woman! You'll do great.

522
00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:13,109
- Mother! 
 - Oh, Seo Ah! How are you?

523
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:19,739
- I'll walk you to your seat. 
 - Okay!

524
00:50:19,749 --> 00:50:22,759
- Good luck, Bit Chae Woon! 
 - Thank you.

525
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:26,939
- Oh, Soon Jung! 
 - Mom!

526
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:32,819
It's good to see you here, Soon Jung.

527
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:34,639
Me, too.

528
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:39,269
- Mom, thank you for coming! 
 - Yes.

529
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:43,219
- We'll head first, Soon Jung. 
 - Okay.

530
00:50:47,019 --> 00:50:50,019
Mom, you look so beautiful today!

531
00:50:50,609 --> 00:50:53,499
- Am I? 
 - Yes!

532
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,639
Maybe because you worked hard preparing this,

533
00:50:58,649 --> 00:51:01,139
you look skinny right now.

534
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:03,589
That's not true! I'm fine.

535
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,599
This new product complements the existing product, and at the same time,

536
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:15,219
it will improve the current effectiveness through technology development.

537
00:51:20,169 --> 00:51:22,919
It's time for food supplies to come in for the Jokbal place.

538
00:51:23,129 --> 00:51:24,499
I'm sorry?

539
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:26,709
What?

540
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:32,499
You just said something, president. Do you want to eat Jokbal?

541
00:51:33,779 --> 00:51:35,259
Yes, yes...

542
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:40,219
  So this new product will be more ergonomic  

543
00:51:40,219 --> 00:51:45,819
  and can appeal to consumers' emotions more...  

544
00:51:55,319 --> 00:52:00,119
Why don't you guys go first? I'll be back from the restroom.

545
00:52:00,279 --> 00:52:03,089
Yes, president.

546
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:27,099
Did the president's memory come back yet?

547
00:52:27,609 --> 00:52:30,189
Oh, about that...

548
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:36,219
  I think we shouldn't tell about the father recovering his memory to the people in Samgwang villa for a while.  

549
00:52:37,189 --> 00:52:39,429
It hasn't come back yet.

550
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:44,079
I guess you must be worried about him a lot.

551
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:50,119
The more I think about it, the more I'm thankful to you for taking care of Jae Hee's father that well.

552
00:52:50,189 --> 00:52:52,549
I didn't do anything.

553
00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:57,299
Everybody in our villa liked him a lot.

554
00:52:57,309 --> 00:53:01,579
He's a very kind and warm person.

555
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,039
Is that so?

556
00:53:05,029 --> 00:53:08,749
  I guess he really lived like a totally different person.  

557
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:22,539
  Wow...  

558
00:53:23,609 --> 00:53:28,339
How can Jung Won's mother be the same as she was in the old days?

559
00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:33,199
She was famous back in the days as being an extreme person.

560
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:36,329
When Jung Won said she's dating Pil Hong,

561
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:40,819
her mother was making a scene and said she would hire a hitman and get rid of him.

562
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:43,599
She's scary.

563
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,549
I guess it's starting now!

564
00:53:56,379 --> 00:53:57,669
  Hello.  

565
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:02,369
I'm Lee Bit Chae Woon, and I'll be hosting the LX fashion styling class.

566
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:15,889
Now, let's start the styling class of the day.

567
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:21,609
  The first concept is the lifestyle.  

568
00:54:22,209 --> 00:54:27,899
  The styling you're going to see is a lifestyle-down look that you can wear in everyday life.  

569
00:54:28,709 --> 00:54:33,699
The long jumper matched with the belt to emphasize the waist,

570
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:37,279
  which enables a more stylish look.  

571
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:44,699
It's a very warm and active item.

572
00:54:44,909 --> 00:54:50,839
  With this down look, I hope you'll be able to enjoy a lifestyle look that is not overwhelming in your daily life.  

573
00:54:51,609 --> 00:54:54,899
The next concept is a golfing look.

574
00:54:55,469 --> 00:54:59,689
This season's golfing apparel color is Black and White.

575
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:19,939
  Bit Chae Woon! The clothes that you prepared for the last round of the show are all gone. What should we do now?  

576
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:33,309
I'm sorry. There was a mistake. Then shall we start the actual styling?

577
00:55:33,769 --> 00:55:39,149
  Director Jang Seo Ah! Can you come up to the stage?  

578
00:55:57,239 --> 00:55:59,599
Thank you, director.

579
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:07,619
I'm going to style one of the down-jumpers from this season to the director.

580
00:56:17,209 --> 00:56:22,109
  Director is even stylish with just a down-jumper!  

581
00:56:22,139 --> 00:56:28,669
  She looks beautiful already, but if you prefer to have a unique style that looks different from the others,  

582
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:34,719
I'll recommend this cute fur bag to style with it.

583
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:39,139
The style stands out even more!

584
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:46,109
If you use these items, you can make your styling stand out and give an extra warm feeling.

585
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:49,709
Wow, our director is very beautiful, right?

586
00:57:05,399 --> 00:57:07,999
What kind of humiliation is this!

587
00:57:08,029 --> 00:57:11,509
In front of our best VIP customers!

588
00:57:11,539 --> 00:57:17,509
CEO Kim! How can you let a petty intern do such an important event like this?

589
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:19,419
I'm sorry, chairwoman.

590
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:24,029
Chairwoman! But she finished it well.

591
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:25,949
I think the event went well.

592
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:29,829
Director Jang, are you trying to cover your subordinate?

593
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:37,019
CEO Kim. If you look at one thing, you can know the rest. You shouldn't let this mistake slide.

594
00:57:37,029 --> 00:57:40,919
  Take stern disciplinary action and reflect this in her personnel review.  

595
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:43,809
  Director Jang, you should take responsibility, too.  

596
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,319
  Let's just go, Soon Jung.  

597
00:57:46,819 --> 00:57:51,019
This can happen when you work at a company. Don't take it to your heart.

598
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:52,929
Let's go.

599
00:57:55,959 --> 00:58:01,089
I can't believe Bit Chae Woon. If she got that great opportunity, shouldn't she have to do it perfectly?

600
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:05,879
  I suggested multiple times to collaborate with Kim Dae Won, but the executives didn't listen.  

601
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:11,419
  I said this before! I think there's something with Bit Chae Woon.  

602
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:16,029
Right. It's suspicious that she joined our company as an intern in the first place.

603
00:58:16,069 --> 00:58:19,579
  She didn't major in this field, and she didn't even graduate from college!  

604
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:34,739
I'm sorry that I made a mistake in today's event.

605
00:58:35,469 --> 00:58:40,469
I did check multiple times, but I don't know why that happened.

606
00:58:41,609 --> 00:58:43,579
Everything is my fault.

607
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:50,569
I'll take any responsibility.

608
00:58:55,019 --> 00:58:56,949
But

609
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,799
I got this job not because I have a connection with this company.

610
00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:08,449
Dae Won, when we were joining the company,

611
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:14,119
you remember my prize got canceled because I got involved in a plagiarism dispute, right?

612
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:18,629
If I really had a connection in this company, that would've not happened.

613
00:59:21,189 --> 00:59:26,929
I didn't graduate college, and I didn't major in the related field.

614
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:33,789
But I dreamed about becoming a designer for a long time and worked hard to achieve it.

615
00:59:35,109 --> 00:59:43,169
These days, graduating from college is not necessary to do good work, isn't' it?

616
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:48,759
Well, that's true.

617
00:59:51,349 --> 00:59:54,039
Our event has good reviews!

618
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:07,299
  The host of the styling class had an outstanding sense.  

619
01:00:07,779 --> 01:00:12,499
  It was a fashion event that tried a new way of styling.  

620
01:00:14,829 --> 01:00:18,309
  The host had a good sense of handling a crisis.  

621
01:00:18,419 --> 01:00:22,419
Isn't this enough to consider today's event was a success? Don't you think so, supervisor?

622
01:00:22,479 --> 01:00:26,569
I think so. I guess the executives wouldn't ask for any further responsibility.

623
01:00:27,179 --> 01:00:31,899
  - Thank goodness. 
 - I was worried about this.  

624
01:00:44,259 --> 01:00:47,619
The reviews for the styling class is pretty good.

625
01:00:47,629 --> 01:00:51,169
  I think this can be considered a successful event. Don't you agree, chairwoman?  

626
01:00:52,269 --> 01:00:57,099
Didn't you hire people to write these reviews?

627
01:00:58,499 --> 01:01:01,479
- Chairwoman. 
 - Anyway,

628
01:01:01,489 --> 01:01:04,919
I'm going to watch Bit Chae Woon from now on.

629
01:01:04,959 --> 01:01:08,699
Also, the fact that she is your biological daughter,

630
01:01:08,709 --> 01:01:11,119
that can't be spread outside at all.

631
01:01:11,769 --> 01:01:14,689
How can the dead daughter be alive the whole time?

632
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:19,699
- CEO Kim Jung Won had a relationship with a weird guy-- 
 - Chairwoman!

633
01:01:22,269 --> 01:01:26,559
Anyway, if people start talking about you and Bit Chae Woon,

634
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:29,989
it would affect our company's image.

635
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:34,979
- Director Jang, you should be careful about this as well. 
 - Yes, chairwoman.

636
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:46,649
Bit Chae Woon.

637
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:51,839
What happened today was a total fault of yours. You know that, right?

638
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:53,899
Yes, CEO.

639
01:01:54,209 --> 01:01:55,469
I'm sorry.

640
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:59,989
It was an inevitable situation. This kind of excuse is unacceptable.

641
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:06,019
If Director Jang Seo Ah trusted your skill and let you do the job, then you should've done your best!

642
01:02:07,219 --> 01:02:08,379
I'm sorry.

643
01:02:08,379 --> 01:02:14,659
You handled the crisis wisely, but I don't think today's issue is something that can be overlooked.

644
01:02:15,019 --> 01:02:18,539
  Your mistake today will be reflected in the intern evaluation,  

645
01:02:18,579 --> 01:02:21,609
  and I want all of you to work harder, so something like this wouldn't happen again.  

646
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:23,319
Yes, CEO.

647
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:26,659
  Everybody! All of you worked hard today.  

648
01:02:26,669 --> 01:02:30,199
Let's work harder!

649
01:03:03,499 --> 01:03:07,679
  If you look at one thing, you can know the rest. You shouldn't let this mistake slide.  

650
01:03:07,699 --> 01:03:12,009
  Take stern disciplinary action and reflect this in her personnel review.  

651
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,329
  If you don't leave,  

652
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:24,219
  Bit Chae Woon, she's going to suffer and be thrown out of my family.  

653
01:04:06,669 --> 01:04:09,109
  What are you doing in there by yourself!  

654
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:11,889
  Open the door! Open the door now!  

655
01:04:37,629 --> 01:04:39,429
James!

656
01:04:41,619 --> 01:04:44,419
James... I mean, president.

657
01:04:44,509 --> 01:04:45,839
What brought you here?

658
01:04:45,919 --> 01:04:51,919
I was just... passing here and came by for a second.

659
01:04:52,009 --> 01:04:54,169
Why don't you come in for a second?

660
01:04:54,179 --> 01:04:56,129
No, it's okay!

661
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:59,629
I was just passing by. I should go now.

662
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:06,539
If it's okay with you, why don't you come inside and have a ginger tea?

663
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:12,369
- Ginger tea? 
 - Yes.

664
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:23,259
  Soon Jung. Maybe she's still not at ease.  

665
01:05:38,049 --> 01:05:39,729
  Soon Jung.  

666
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:45,249
  Are you having a hard time?  

667
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:49,719
  No, I'm fine.  

668
01:05:53,909 --> 01:05:56,349
Ms. Lee.

669
01:05:58,739 --> 01:06:01,869
Are you having a hard time?

670
01:06:05,789 --> 01:06:07,859
No.

671
01:06:09,419 --> 01:06:11,019
I'm fine.

672
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:13,189
Is that so.

673
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:30,419
     

674
01:06:32,449 --> 01:06:35,979
Chae Woon is not a person who'll make that kind of mistake.

675
01:06:39,639 --> 01:06:42,769
Did Seo Ah plan this?

676
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:46,069
No, it can't be.

677
01:06:49,409 --> 01:06:51,019
CEO!

678
01:06:53,939 --> 01:06:58,139
- Ms. Goo, what's wrong? 
 - There's something on our company's anonymous board.

679
01:07:26,279 --> 01:07:27,949
What?

680
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,989
Mom!

681
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:37,699
What is this?

682
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:41,419
     

683
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:48,699
My goodness, what is this?

684
01:07:48,739 --> 01:07:50,989
Take this down, now.

685
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:53,329
Take this down, now!

686
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:06,519
Bit Chae Woon, are you a daughter of the CEO?

687
01:08:07,529 --> 01:08:11,739
Bit Chae Woon, is this real?

688
01:08:31,519 --> 01:08:33,219
     

689
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:47,689
♫   I'm in love, I'm in love   ♫

690
01:08:47,699 --> 01:08:51,749
♫   I'm in love with you   ♫

691
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:57,699
♫   Stay with me forever   ♫

692
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:04,769
♫   It makes me fill up my whole day   ♫

693
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:09,679
♫   with the thoughts of you   ♫

694
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:11,619
     

695
01:09:11,849 --> 01:09:14,369
  Chae Woon, you worked hard today.  

696
01:09:14,389 --> 01:09:17,359
  You were really amazing.  

697
01:09:17,379 --> 01:09:21,369
  It wasn't hard. I got so many compliments because of the good reviews!  

698
01:09:21,389 --> 01:09:23,419
  Is there something going on?  

699
01:09:23,519 --> 01:09:26,219
  Is someone bothers you?  

700
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:29,309
  In fact, there's something that I have to tell everybody...  

701
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:34,119
  - I'll keep that in secret. 
 - Me, too.  

702
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:38,539
  Don't think of me as your ex-wife, and just think of me like an old friend.  

703
01:09:38,569 --> 01:09:43,659
  - How can a man and a woman be a friend? 
 - Do you consider me as a woman?  

704
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,939
  Hello, I'm Son Jung Hoo. I graduated from the same college as Jae Hee but years before him.  

705
01:09:45,959 --> 01:09:47,609
  How can his name be Jung Hoo as well?  

706
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:49,389
  I'm sorry.
