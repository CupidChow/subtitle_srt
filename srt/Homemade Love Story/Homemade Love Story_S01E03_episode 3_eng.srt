1
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,500
Miss!

2
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,000
Look.

3
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,460
Miss.

4
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,650
Mom...

5
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,530
Look, miss!

6
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,770
Get an ambulance!

7
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,100
CEO, if the rumor spreads...

8
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,850
 

9
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,700
- Please call Dr. Lee.
- Yes, CEO.

10
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,470
Yes, this is Manager Jo.

11
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,100
My goodness...

12
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,430
  The customer is not 
answering the phone. 

13
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,480
My gosh.

14
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,660
Chae Woon, she's not 
answering her phone.

15
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,020
Gosh and the rain is 
really coming down.

16
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,150
Good evening.

17
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,000
CEO.

18
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,170
I think we should 
contact her family.

19
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,300
You're right.

20
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,300
 

21
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,780
 

22
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,160
 What's going on, Unni? 

23
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,190
I called you so many times.

24
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,990
Where are you? 
Are you celebrating?

25
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,020
At a BBQ restaurant? A buffet? 
Where? In Gangnam?

26
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,230
 Excuse me... 

27
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,940
Who is this?

28
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,870
 

29
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,720
Geez, Jang Soo Ah 
will be nagging me.

30
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,550
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

31
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,450
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

32
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,230
You laughed.

33
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,920
Success!

34
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,880
There was so much traffic...

35
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,220
Gosh.

36
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,620
I brought back gifts

37
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,740
for Mother and Father 
on my business trip.

38
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,280
I wanted to give it to him.

39
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,550
I thought we could 
have dinner together...

40
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,460
Seo Ah.

41
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,350
Why did you do this?

42
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,300
- Oppa...
- See you next time.

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,570
Woo Jae Hee!

44
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,200
Stop right there! Stop!

45
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,250
Seo Ah.

46
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,160
Give us a minute.

47
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,120
Yes, Father.

48
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,750
Seo Ah.

49
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,680
Go as far as you can.

50
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,180
Okay.

51
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,020
How can you embarrass
 me like that?

52
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,050
How can you turn around

53
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,660
as soon as you see
 your own father?

54
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,010
I'm humiliated in
 front of Seo Ah.

55
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,520
Seo Ah knows, too.

56
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,830
That our relationship is over.

57
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,730
Over?

58
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,740
Did you and I ever date 
or something? Over?

59
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,120
Well, as far as I know, it is.

60
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,230
If you don't recall, 
should I send you

61
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,520
- the recording from that time?
- You...

62
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,520
It took a lot for me to come out 
due to Seo Ah's pleading.

63
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,170
Why did you decide to do 
that all of a sudden?

64
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,380
Didn't you kick me out saying, 
"You're not my son"?

65
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,850
You screamed at 
the top of your lungs

66
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,620
saying not to take anything
 you bought for me.

67
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,560
So, in that freezing winter
 night, you clearly saw

68
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,940
a 19-year-old grownup
 leaving the house

69
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,450
only wearing striped underwear.

70
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,960
It wasn't the stripes.

71
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,880
It was olive green.

72
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,350
I did see that.

73
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,440
But did you buy those 
underwear with your money?

74
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,950
Leaving the house was
 nonsense from the get-go.

75
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,010
I got those underwear...

76
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,150
from a friend as a birthday
 gift in high school.

77
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,830
You know my
 friend, right? Beom Jin.

78
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,140
And I'm sure Seo Ah 
invited Mother, too.

79
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,500
Why did you come out alone?

80
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,470
You were always this way.

81
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,750
You always left Mom at home, 
and you went out alone.

82
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,520
You ordered Mom around
 like a housekeeper,

83
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,730
yet you ate all the good food 
and went to nice places.

84
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,640
You haven't changed.

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,430
Your habit of raising 
your hand first.

86
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,080
Thanks to you, Father, 
I've become...

87
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,360
very quick.

88
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,700
Especially with unexpected
 punches like this...

89
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,900
Quick?

90
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,450
Quick, my foot.

91
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,400
What a weakling.

92
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,310
I'll leave now.

93
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,400
Woo Jae Hee. Hey!

94
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,000
You despicable punk!

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,650
I noticed on my way in that

96
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,000
Lay Furniture president and
 his family were over there.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,070
I think they'd get a kick
 out of seeing this.

98
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,220
Geez!

99
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,110
Oppa!

100
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,390
Oppa!

101
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,600
Oppa, sorry.

102
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,770
I spoke to Father
 on the phone earlier,

103
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,450
and I asked him cautiously 
if I should invite you, too.

104
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,330
He said, "Sure, if you want to."

105
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,570
I thought it might be...

106
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,060
a sign of reconciliation.

107
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,340
Seo Ah.

108
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,460
This is my family matter.

109
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,170
Thank you for thinking of me,

110
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,270
but I wish you wouldn't 
get involved in this.

111
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,550
Why?

112
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,700
I'll become part of 
your family soon.

113
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,830
Why?

114
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,500
I told you.

115
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,460
For you, I just feel...

116
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,080
Let's not talk about this.

117
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,880
Will you eat with my father?

118
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,580
Since you called for this.
 I'll go now.

119
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,040
Oppa.

120
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,810
Are you awake?

121
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
 Excuse me! This... 

122
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,220
I'm sorry. I've stepped out of line.

123
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,050
The doctor said you'll be fine.

124
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,780
I'm glad.

125
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,250
But you said you were
 falsely accused?

126
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,660
What did you mean by that?

127
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,620
Where is my bag...

128
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,250
They're sketches I've had 
 since middle school.

129
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,250
The piece that won 
the competition

130
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,330
was developed out
 of this motif.

131
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,130
But my prize was revoked, 
saying that I had plagiarized.

132
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,330
I came here because
 I felt it's so unfair.

133
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,980
If that's the case,

134
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,050
you should've submitted this 
with the department in charge.

135
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,420
You shouldn't have come over
 like this, don't you think?

136
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,460
Yes, I did go to the company, but...

137
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,830
they said the entire department 
went to a workshop.

138
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,120
Having a workshop on the day 
of the award ceremony...

139
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,970
I didn't think it seemed right.

140
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,160
That's why I became 
more suspicious...

141
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,840
If so...

142
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,360
are you saying my employees are

143
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,440
ostracizing you in
 this competition?

144
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,900
Do you think you're that amazing?

145
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,850
This doesn't prove anything.

146
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,030
You're the only one
 who thinks so.

147
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,930
If that's the case,

148
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,210
I'd like to know 
the legitimate reason

149
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,560
for plagiarism by your company.

150
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,280
I believe just notifying 
me of the result

151
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,370
without presenting me with

152
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,680
convincing evidence is wrong.

153
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,340
Daebak...

154
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,050
It was thoughtless of me to
 come to your house, CEO.

155
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,250
But I was so desperate...

156
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,000
that I couldn't see straight
 in my rushed state.

157
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,030
Sorry.

158
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,110
I thought your
 expression was funny.

159
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,280
That you couldn't see straight.

160
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,900
Okay...

161
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,620
CEO.

162
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,200
Lee Hae Deun.

163
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,750
Hi, Unni, what's going on?

164
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,770
I heard you fainted. 
Are you okay?

165
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,190
She happened to call you.

166
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,520
I thought you'd need your family's 
help. So I told her to come.

167
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,230
Hello. I'm her younger 
sister, Lee Hae Deun.

168
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,020
I'll ask them to submit 
the proof of plagiarism.

169
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,310
- Be careful going home.
- I'd like to...

170
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,750
pay you for medical care.

171
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,300
Ms. Jo, give her the 
doctor's contact info.

172
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,910
Yes, ma'am.

173
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,220
Thank you, CEO.

174
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,310
Your younger sister?

175
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,300
Yes, I'm Lee Hae Deun. 
Many thanks in advance.

176
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,850
You don't look like each other.

177
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,810
Thank you! Good night.

178
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,030
Hey.

179
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,330
Wow!

180
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,970
This is daebak. Is this for real?

181
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,080
I can't believe I'm in 
a house like this.

182
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,380
Isn't that right, Unni?

183
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,210
Unni, are you all right?

184
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,730
Why did you come here anyway?

185
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,380
She said something 
about plagiarism.

186
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,930
Something went wrong, huh?

187
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,730
You're finally curious?

188
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,360
No...

189
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,770
I'm in shock. I've never 
been to a house like this...

190
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,070
Unni...

191
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,580
There's even a pond. I wonder
 if there are any fish.

192
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,020
I'll call a taxi.

193
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,470
Just walk.

194
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,600
That'd look pathetic.

195
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,100
I'm sure these people are
 looking at us through the CCTV.

196
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,040
What if we just walk away 
in your poor condition?

197
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,160
We'd look too pathetic.

198
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,060
Who cares?

199
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,420
Gosh.

200
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,280
Unni!

201
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,780
Wow, you couldn't live 
around here without a car.

202
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,460
The subway station was far, too.

203
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,420
Does the generational law
 apply to these houses?

204
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,580
Oh, yeah, Unni.

205
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,170
Did you see the slippers
 the CEO lady was wearing?

206
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,180
She was wearing 
Garavni slippers at home.

207
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,600
They must be real, right?

208
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,910
Lee Hae Deun.

209
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,580
What, Unni? Are you feeling ill?

210
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,810
Don't tell the family 
what happened today.

211
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,030
I'll tell them depending 
on how things go.

212
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,600
All right.

213
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,770
But how about you? 
You're so disappointed, huh?

214
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,130
Totally disappointed, huh?

215
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,470
Unni.

216
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What's with that?

217
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,800
Did he see me?

218
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,070
Gosh, my beauty that shines even
 in the darkness. What to do...

219
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,120
Not today!

220
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,500
That was Bit Chae Won.

221
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,760
Why is she...

222
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,800
Mom.

223
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,750
- By chance...
- Why didn't you report to me

224
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,590
about revoking the grand prize?

225
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,830
Mom...

226
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,930
Let's talk.

227
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,700
She came to my house?

228
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,040
Gosh, that girl is ridiculous.

229
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,580
"That girl?"

230
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,810
Do you know Lee Bit Chae Woon?

231
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,420
How?

232
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,140
Mom.

233
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,670
I'll take care of this.

234
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,430
Seo Ah.

235
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,640
There's something here, huh?

236
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,890
The prize wasn't revoked
 because of plagiarism, huh?

237
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,490
No.

238
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,560
Whose work did she plagiarize?

239
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,160
Who is she?

240
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,090
Who is Lee Bit Chae Woon?

241
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,540
- Who is it?
- It's her.

242
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,880
Lee Bit Chae Woon...

243
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,460
It's her, Mom.

244
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,500
The girl who bullied me in middle
 school and quit school.

245
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,960
It's her.

246
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,050
What?

247
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,300
Seo Ah!

248
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,900
What happened?

249
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,820
Who did this?

250
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,200
Even so...

251
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,110
Revoking the grand prize...

252
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,050
was too rash. It wasn't fair.

253
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,320
You should've discussed 
it with me first.

254
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,960
Why did you do 
such a foolish thing?

255
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,290
I don't know!

256
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,600
When I realized it
 was Bit Chae Woon,

257
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,770
I couldn't think straight.

258
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,030
I kept thinking of what happened.
 I just wanted to avoid her.

259
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,800
I wanted to avoid 
her at all costs.

260
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,100
Seo Ah!

261
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,570
Ms. Jo!

262
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,810
Seo Ah...

263
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,640
What's wrong with you?

264
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,500
Seo Ah...

265
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,000
Seo Ah...

266
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,880
You got it, right?

267
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,350
Shut your mouth.

268
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,650
I got it. I don't want to 
get beat up to death.

269
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,610
Why would you die?

270
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,190
Why would you beat up 
adorable Hae Deun?

271
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,700
- Uncle! 
- Hae Deun!

272
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,210
Oh, our New Yorker.

273
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,990
- Going to work?
- Yeah.

274
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,340
- Good evening.
- Did you party?

275
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,760
Did you eat out to celebrate?

276
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,560
What did you eat?

277
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,820
Sashimi? Charcoal BBQ? 
A buffet?

278
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,800
How come you ask 
the same questions I did?

279
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,550
I'm so curious.

280
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,340
What's up?

281
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,220
New Yorker.

282
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,150
 

283
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,510
 

284
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,630
Oh, my.

285
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,210
My head...

286
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,940
Oh, my.

287
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,470
What happened to her?

288
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,300
Gosh...

289
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,440
Aigoo.

290
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
My goodness...

291
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,230
Why did she get rained on?

292
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
- Is Chae Woon home?
- Unni!

293
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,270
What?

294
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,730
Unni, talk to me.

295
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,600
- Later.
- This is important.

296
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,020
- Very important.
- I'm home.

297
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,500
Hey, I'm glad you're here.
 Come here.

298
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,970
- You, too. Come, come.
- Why?

299
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,980
- Everyone, come, come.
- What's going on?

300
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,940
Then Noona's win...

301
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,000
Her win got revoked?

302
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,280
Whoa.

303
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,540
She came home in the afternoon 
looking for something. It was crazy.

304
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,640
I felt really strange about it.

305
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,610
So I found out through my hoobae.

306
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,160
Noona must be so stunned.

307
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,790
Why aren't you shocked?

308
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,600
Huh?

309
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,080
Well...

310
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,200
Noona, did you know by chance?

311
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,170
Well, no. Well, earlier...

312
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,300
You couldn't have known.

313
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,500
If you did, you would've 
jabbered already.

314
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,030
- Hey, I could...
- Hey, be quiet.

315
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,830
Be quiet.

316
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,400
Anyway, for now...

317
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,510
everyone, shut your mouth.

318
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,980
Especially you, Hae Deun.

319
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,540
Why do you pick on me?

320
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,760
You don't need to do that.

321
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,250
I was wondering when
 I should tell you.

322
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,210
I guess everyone found out.

323
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,030
Chae Woon.

324
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,830
Are you feeling ill?

325
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,580
Earlier, Unni had...

326
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,970
No, I was just stressed out.

327
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,860
Geez, these people. How could 
they tease you like that?

328
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,510
How dare they make 
such a mistake?

329
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,520
I'll tell all about it on 
a post. They're dead.

330
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,190
Hey, Ra Hoon, don't.

331
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,690
It's not final yet.

332
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,260
- What?
- Really?

333
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,080
Aigoo, of course.

334
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,030
That's right. I'm sure 
there was a mistake.

335
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,210
Chae Woon has fantastic talent.

336
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,680
I'm sure they made a mistake.

337
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,000
Right?

338
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,660
- Right, Hae Deun?
- Yeah.

339
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,100
- I'm going to bed.
- Hey...

340
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,810
If it's not final,

341
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,590
are you talking to 
them right now?

342
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,170
I'm going to bed.

343
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,560
Hey!

344
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,280
Answer me! Bit Chae Woon!

345
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,910
Hey, Man Jung. Stop it.

346
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,570
Let Chae Woon get some rest.

347
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,320
 You were always this way. 

348
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,360
 You always left Mom at home, 
and you went out alone. 

349
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,380
 You ordered Mom around
 like a housekeeper, 

350
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,130
 yet you ate all the good food 
and went to nice places. 

351
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,580
Despicable punk.

352
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,200
Sir, I'll...

353
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,820
Go home.

354
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,140
We've been checking
 in front of the house.

355
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,070
Ahjumma said she'd wipe up, but...

356
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,820
I told her to do it tomorrow.

357
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,900
I'll quit. Goodbye.

358
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,590
Not you, ahjumma.

359
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,540
Did you think I didn't know?

360
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,630
Never mind ahjumma. You quit.

361
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,590
 

362
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,200
Instead of communicating with
 Jae Hee behind my back,

363
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,400
why don't you check out 
where and how he's living?

364
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,760
What is this?

365
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,940
Eat it if you're hungry.

366
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,900
I couldn't eat it because of 
Jae Hee, so I brought it home.

367
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,980
Again?

368
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,710
How embarrassing 
in front of Seo Ah.

369
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,100
I paid for the expensive food and
 brought home the leftover.

370
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,060
What's so embarrassing 
about that?

371
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,320
If that's embarrassing, Seo Ah 
doesn't qualify to join our family.

372
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,410
I guess Seo Ah bought me a gift.

373
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,890
Leave it as is.

374
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,770
Isn't this a gift from Seo Ah for me?

375
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,170
Semyeong Construction's Ms. Noh's 
birthday is next month.

376
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,680
Send her that as a gift.

377
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,260
Don't waste extra money.

378
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,300
Only when it's worn by someone 
suitable, it shows off its value.

379
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,000
How about yours?

380
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,150
It's a belt for me.

381
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,750
I'll give it to Jung Soon's second son
 to congratulate his college entrance.

382
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,550
Your sister's second is 
only in 10th grade.

383
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,450
He has a long way to go until 
his college entrance exam.

384
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,210
He'll take it at some point.

385
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,720
I'm tired. Turn off the light.

386
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,000
 Of course. 

387
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,800
 You'll put away even 
a half of a bean 

388
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,110
  to give it to your side 
of the family, huh? 

389
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,960
Turn off the light!

390
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,530
Yes.

391
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,760
 

392
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,510
The winners' announcement 
page is gone.

393
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,410
It's not like they announced
 taking her prize back.

394
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,100
What happened?

395
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,590
Noona must be so upset.

396
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,470
My stomach...

397
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,180
I don't want to poop at night.

398
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,090
Look at Lee Hae Deun, 
sleeping with the light on.

399
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,270
You don't care if Chae Woon noona
 is suffering or not, right?

400
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,650
Geez, rotten stench.

401
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,570
Geez.

402
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,480
 

403
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,000
She called Chae Woon noona a traitor.

404
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,240
Chae Woon, it's Seo Ah's mother.

405
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,800
Apologize.

406
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,990
Chae Woon.

407
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,860
It's okay, Teacher.

408
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,020
Please punish her 
according to school policy.

409
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,730
Let's go, Seo Ah.

410
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,890
I didn't do anything wrong.

411
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,950
 It was her. 

412
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,200
 How should I take care 
of the plagiarism issue? 

413
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,700
 Shouldn't I have revoked her win? 

414
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,900
Seo Ah.

415
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,210
Are you okay?

416
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,500
Mom, I'm okay.

417
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,600
You haven't had an 
episode in a while.

418
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,240
How can you be so fragile? 
Your work is tough as is.

419
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,090
I'm sorry.

420
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,790
What should I do now, Mom?

421
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,940
Seo Ah.

422
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,850
You...

423
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,980
just stay put.

424
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'll take care of it.

425
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,840
How?

426
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,010
I'll have to think about it.

427
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,580
Mom.

428
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,340
I'm sorry.

429
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,320
I'm so sorry.

430
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:25,440
You must've been so 
scared, my daughter...

431
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,490
to have done such a thing.

432
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,370
 

433
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,500
Bean sprouts soup.

434
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,690
Don't be like this.

435
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,500
I'm so touched.

436
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,990
I'm really fine.

437
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,550
Don't walk on eggshells, everyone. 
I'll get a stomachache.

438
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,560
We might get sick 
because of you, too.

439
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,380
Be quiet and eat.

440
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,270
We're not walking on 
eggshells, Chae Woon.

441
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,580
Right, Hwak Se?

442
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,420
Yes, I'm not being cautious.

443
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,750
I was giving her some 
meat. That's all.

444
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,430
Uncle, give it to me.

445
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:16,170
Aigoo, that's right. I forgot
 about you, Hae Deun.

446
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,400
Here, Hae Deun. Psyche!

447
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,910
Uncle!

448
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,690
I'll get going first. 
I have to go to the site.

449
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,720
Why? You should eat 
more, Chae Woon.

450
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,210
Should I fix you something else?

451
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,720
I'm okay.

452
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,890
Geez, seriously.

453
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,890
How can you leave 
me out and eat?

454
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,120
You should've woken me up.

455
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,190
Leave you out, Auntie?

456
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,080
Auntie, do you know how hard 
I tried to wake you up?

457
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,100
- You wouldn't budge at all.
- I know.

458
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,580
Hey.

459
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,590
I couldn't fall asleep 
until early this morning.

460
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,780
Some ahjussi...

461
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,170
was snoring all through the night.

462
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,570
Should we put a soundproof wall?

463
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,980
Uncle, do you snore?

464
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,700
I don't snore.

465
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,880
Hey.

466
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,850
This is so unfair.

467
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,600
Auntie.

468
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,000
Why?

469
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,300
You're paying rent for using
 the upstairs room, right?

470
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,810
Hey, I'm using an 
empty room temporarily.

471
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,970
Why should I pay rent?

472
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,160
Mom.

473
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,440
We have to save every penny if 
we are to move out next spring.

474
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,020
We can't afford a free room.

475
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,310
Right. No free room. 
You should pay.

476
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,440
You guys.

477
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,340
Be proactive about
 looking for renters.

478
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,880
Yes, Chae Woon noona.

479
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,650
Gosh.

480
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,890
That Lee Bit Chae Woon. 
She doesn't pity me.

481
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,250
Right?

482
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,250
Auntie, eat plenty.

483
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,200
Hae Deun, you're the best.

484
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,880
Mom, what are you doing?

485
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,060
I'm making something
 for Chae Woon.

486
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,520
Bye.

487
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,470
Chae Woon.

488
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,110
Gosh, aigoo, Chae Woon. 
Chae Woon.

489
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,720
Take this and eat 
while you work.

490
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,060
You barely ate breakfast.

491
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,960
You have a tough job. Eat well.

492
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,530
- I'm all right.
- Geez.

493
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,000
Come here.

494
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,900
Thanks, Mom.

495
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,700
You're the best, Mom.

496
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,120
Right?

497
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,050
If you're grateful, smile. 
Like me, smile.

498
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,400
So pretty.

499
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,280
- I'm off.
- Okay.

500
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,940
Watch out for the cars. 
Always be careful.

501
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,800
Everything will be fine. 
Fighting, my daughter!

502
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,160
Fighting!

503
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,610
Geez, this is 
Hae Deun's workplace.

504
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,920
What should I do?

505
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,890
 

506
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,100
What the heck?

507
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,540
Geez...

508
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,010
What?

509
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,420
Why is Hae Deun going up there?

510
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,800
Your wardrobe is here.

511
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,600
Lee Hae Deun, are you a slug?

512
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,010
We can't practice because of you.

513
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,460
Oh, sorry.

514
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,020
What's this? It's wrong.

515
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,460
What? You brought 
the wrong costume.

516
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,650
- The manager said to take these...
- Bring new ones.

517
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,300
This one.

518
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,030
Hurry!

519
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,050
I got it.

520
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,120
Ahjussi!

521
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,000
Thank you!

522
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,770
Oh, no, Hae Deun.

523
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,000
Can you bring me the ones 
you brought up earlier?

524
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,280
I confused our schedule.

525
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,100
- Really?
- Yeah.

526
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,260
It's called "Trot Girls."

527
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,530
We're producing a new girl group.

528
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,310
You're one of the candidates.

529
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,720
Even though it may 
be tough, endure.

530
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,950
Thank you, Manager!

531
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,480
Thank you!

532
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,330
I'll be right back.

533
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,770
Geez, Wang Sammie.

534
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,060
You're bothering Hae Deun again?

535
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:47,370
 Sammie noona, this is Ra Hoon. 

536
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,790
 I don't know if this is still your 
number. It's an old one. 

537
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,490
 How are you doing? 

538
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:54,090
 I enjoy watching Emerald on TV. 

539
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,960
 Noona, you got prettier. 

540
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,960
Right.

541
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,110
There's no way she's still 
using this number.

542
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,570
 
  Ra Hoon, long time no see. 

543
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,020
Hi, Seo Ah.

544
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,400
I felt bad after leaving you
 last night like that.

545
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,000
What's with you, Oppa?

546
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,690
You feel bad?

547
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,660
Come on. I'll buy you 
something good.

548
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,300
What? Tonight?

549
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,990
Not tonight. I'll check 
my schedule.

550
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,830
 What? You always do this. 

551
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,980
If you feel bad, shouldn't you
 take up on it right away?

552
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,660
I'm sorry.

553
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,860
You know I'm always working.

554
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,010
No, it's not.

555
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,150
- I said I'll keep my promise.
- Ms. Lee.

556
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,920
Are you finished upstairs?

557
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,060
Yes. I finished everything.

558
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,950
Thank you.

559
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,540
No.

560
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,190
- Come on.
- Geez...

561
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,010
Mr. Woo is so thrilled.

562
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,670
His girlfriend.

563
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,740
Girlfriend?

564
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,280
I said no.

565
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,960
I'll keep my promise.

566
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,040
I said no.

567
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,980
Aigoo, Koala...

568
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,300
- Smiling ear to ear.
- I know.

569
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,200
Yeah.

570
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah.

571
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,320
Plagiarism?

572
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,240
What do you mean plagiarize?

573
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,530
Why would Chae Woon do that?

574
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,410
Chae Woon stayed 
up many nights

575
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,400
working on that piece
 for the competition.

576
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,260
Anyway, it's still off the record.

577
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,580
- You get it?
- What?

578
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,790
You don't know? 
You can't say anything.

579
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,830
Okay?

580
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,610
Anyway, my hoobae's sister

581
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,200
works at the design 
department there.

582
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,460
I'm late. I'm leaving.

583
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,700
Unni.

584
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,130
Unni!

585
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,220
You can't take any action trying to
 help out Chae Woon, okay?

586
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,620
Got it?

587
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,890
Okay.

588
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,030
Go, go.

589
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,580
My gosh.

590
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,430
Okay.

591
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,800
Yes, ma'am.

592
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,540
This is Lee Soon Jung.

593
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,610
I'll be running a little late today.

594
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,980
I'm very sorry.

595
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,040
Yes.

596
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,450
♫  One shot at life  ♫

597
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:02,480
♫  At one shot, just one shot  ♫

598
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,500
♫  One shot at life  ♫

599
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,390
♫  At one shot, just one shot  ♫

600
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,720
My goodness, what should I do?

601
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

602
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,860
- You worked hard.
- Thank you.

603
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,030
- Bye. 
- Bye.

604
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,110
- How about take down this side?
- Bye.

605
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,400
Thank you.

606
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,030
Goodbye.

607
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,300
Ms. Lee.

608
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,330
I finished everything upstairs.

609
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,230
Mr. Yu confirmed.

610
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,610
I see. Got it.

611
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,760
Why did you call me?

612
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,050
Well...

613
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,190
thank you for your work.

614
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,700
Thank you.

615
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,160
Thank you.

616
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,520
Yes, Mr. Bong.

617
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,860
What about the tiles?

618
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,010
We put in the Scandinavian
 tiles as you ordered.

619
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,760
What complain?

620
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,800
Pardon?

621
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,250
Take out all the tiles?

622
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,950
- Add on?
- Yes.

623
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,120
Leave the floor as is...

624
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,680
and add the new tiles on top.

625
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,200
What do you think?

626
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,850
I can see why he's complaining.

627
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,080
I thought he ordered
 the Scandinavian style.

628
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,910
What's with this 
Renaissance style?

629
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,550
That's not something 
we should decide hastily.

630
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,680
Maybe we should 
just start from scratch...

631
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,610
You shouldn't decide hastily.

632
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:44,370
But inside my head,

633
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,820
there is a way

634
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:50,000
to revive this failed design the quickest 
and the most cost-effective way.

635
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,520
For instance...

636
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,180
like this. Here.

637
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,940
Like this.

638
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,650
All right. Like this.

639
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,450
And your negotiation terms are?

640
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,370
I'll do a fantastic job of 
selecting and placing the tiles.

641
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,200
Instead, the Gongdeukdong officetel

642
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,640
and the beauty salon 
remodeling in Bundang.

643
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,940
- Hire me for those projects.
- What?

644
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,670
That's impressive. You figured 
out our construction schedule.

645
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,610
That's basic for freelancers.

646
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:23,330
So, you want to earn as much as 
you can before you leave the country?

647
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,130
My goodness.

648
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,440
She has a great attitude.

649
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,140
Of course, I should.
 It's a tough world out there.

650
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,460
That's right. But I don't want to.

651
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,240
Why would we trust you, 
and have you join us?

652
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,910
What, that? For taking 
care of that incident?

653
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:42,200
I could've done that
 myself if I had to.

654
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,210
Considering our friendship,

655
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,850
I can work with you on the tiles...

656
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,960
Okay. That would be it.

657
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,470
Do your thing then.

658
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,110
Wait, Ms. Lee...

659
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,730
Goodbye.

660
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,070
Aigoo.

661
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,460
Mr. Woo.

662
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,400
Let's have her join us.

663
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,160
It's hard to find a contractor who
 has design sensibilities.

664
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,730
I'll look further.

665
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,350
I found out that Headbutt's
 rate is pretty high.

666
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,860
Geez, we can negotiate.

667
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,320
Negotiate? Yeah, right.

668
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,480
How dare she try to make a deal?

669
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,600
What's with you, Bit Chae Woon?

670
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,250
No matter how desperate you are.

671
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,190
Geez, so embarrassing.

672
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,690
Whatever. Things will work out.

673
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,780
Geez, I should look.

674
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,350
Aigoo.

675
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,270
 

676
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,280
Let's see...

677
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,240
 

678
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,790
 

679
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,530
 This girl bullied Seo Ah? 

680
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,790
How do you feel?

681
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,880
I'm fine.

682
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,600
And I apologize for intruding
 on you yesterday.

683
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,410
It's the CEO's past work collection.

684
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,710
One of the judges

685
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,230
was familiar with CEO's style.

686
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,600
That's why he determined that 
you plagiarized CEO's work.

687
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,960
It does have...

688
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,520
similar feel to my work.

689
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:49,920
But I had no idea you 
had such works in place.

690
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,680
I hope you're telling us the truth.

691
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,740
However, judging should be fair.

692
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,150
Please understand.

693
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,180
We'll not make the 
plagiarism charge official.

694
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,970
You can also reenter our 
competition in the future.

695
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,700
No, thank you.

696
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:12,650
I will not enter the
 competition again.

697
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:17,090
Even if it takes time, 
I'd like to prove that

698
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,340
I'm innocent.

699
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,520
I acknowledge your talent, 
Bit Chae Woon.

700
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,660
So I'd like to make you an offer.

701
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,040
I'll offer you an intern position.

702
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,790
It's not our company.

703
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,750
It's at a subsidiary company 
design department.

704
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:52,520
It's J-Boutique. I'm sure
 you know of the brand.

705
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,260
After six months of internship, 
depending on your performance,

706
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,060
you may be able to
 get hired full time.

707
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,710
How about it?

708
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,770
 Bit Chae Woon, what's with you? 

709
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,540
 Are you conflicted? 

710
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,950
 Are you wavering? 

711
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,320
I'm sorry. It's out of the blue.

712
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,900
Could I please meet her?

713
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,780
I'm sorry. That's not possible.

714
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,160
But still.

715
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,720
Please let me meet the 
competition coordinator.

716
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,700
I must show her something.

717
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,870
I'm sorry.

718
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,710
Please make an appointment with
 the coordinator and come back.

719
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,230
I'm here because I don't know 
who the coordinator is.

720
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:49,430
Then, could you call up
 the design department?

721
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,910
I'll wait here...

722
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,660
- Mom.
- Hey, Chae Woon!

723
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,900
What are you doing here?

724
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,580
Wait.

725
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,000
- Wait.
- Let's go.

726
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,890
Hey, hey, Chae Woon, wait.

727
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:04,510
Chae Woon, I brought
 your sketches.

728
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:07,150
About plagiarizing... no...

729
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:09,880
I wanted to prove to them 
that you didn't do that.

730
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,010
You worked so hard 
preparing while losing sleep.

731
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,410
You should've talked
 to me about it first.

732
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:16,950
- Let's go, Mom.
- But still!

733
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,010
Let's go! I already spoke to them.

734
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,710
You did?

735
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,920
Did they say yes?

736
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,290
Are you the winner?

737
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,290
- Aigoo, that's great then!
- No, let's go. Go.

738
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,600
Let's go. Please.

739
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,340
Let's go.

740
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:42,090
I couldn't help it.

741
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,200
Mom...

742
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,450
CEO.

743
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,830
- How did you...
- Let's talk later.

744
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,490
Hey, Chae Woon...

745
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,040
There was a mistake
 in the judging.

746
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,340
Why?

747
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,800
You made it to the
 finals twice already.

748
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,230
You're more than talented
 to win the competition.

749
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:24,250
There must've been people who 
were more talented than me.

750
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,120
This is strange.

751
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,900
There's something there.

752
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,020
You stay put. I'll go 
back and look into this.

753
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,410
What will you do there, Mom?

754
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,840
I noticed that you couldn't 
even convince the front desk staff.

755
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,250
What will you do? 
They'll treat you like a fool!

756
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,390
Aigoo.

757
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,200
You're right.

758
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,810
Aigoo, I was just thinking of you...

759
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,190
Right?

760
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,420
I'm not even a good talker.

761
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:58,050
I'd just be embarrassing you.

762
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,260
No...

763
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,700
That's not it, Mom.

764
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,300
I misspoke.

765
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,100
I'm extremely on edge right now.

766
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,900
Chae Woon.

767
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,790
I'm fine.

768
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,130
Don't worry. Okay?

769
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:17,930
Gosh.

770
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:20,340
Aigoo, seriously.

771
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:24,110
Aigoo, my daughter
 must be so upset.

772
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:25,980
It's okay. It's okay.

773
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,670
Geez.

774
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,640
It's okay. All right?

775
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,500
 This. 

776
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,230
 - This.
- Oh, my! 

777
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,760
 No, thank you. 

778
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:01,780
 I will not enter the 
competition again. 

779
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:30,830
 Instead of communicating with 
Jae Hee behind my back, 

780
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:34,820
 why don't you check out 
where and how he's living? 

781
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,910
 

782
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,570
- Hi, Min Suk.
- Hi, Noona. What's up?

783
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:49,160
Oh...

784
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,700
- Look.
- Yes?

785
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,590
Is that visible enough?

786
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:55,390
 Hello, Min Suk. 

787
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,110
 Min Suk. 

788
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:01,040
 Where did he go? Min Suk. 

789
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,900
 Why? Is something wrong? 

790
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,500
Jung Hoo just passed by. 
Nothing is wrong.

791
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,260
Geez, I automatically hide 
whenever I see him.

792
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,650
 It's so weird. 

793
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:13,320
I do that, too.

794
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,260
 But why, Noona? 

795
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:19,450
Well, I wanted to 
ask you something.

796
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,920
 I'll do an amazing job of 
selecting and placing the tiles. 

797
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,550
 Instead, the Gongdeukdong officetel 

798
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,970
 and the beauty salon 
remodeling in Bundang. 

799
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,420
 Hire me for those projects. 

800
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,080
Headbutt.

801
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,880
She's got spunk.

802
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,680
And that's pretty cute.

803
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,860
Geez, cute? Bull...

804
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,700
Should I hire her?

805
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:15,120
Woo Jae Hee.

806
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:18,560
I got enough on my plate.

807
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,000
I'm here.

808
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,860
Huh? Mom?

809
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:31,250
You jerk! You punk!

810
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,710
Jerk!

811
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,930
- Mom, how did you come here?
- How else?

812
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,000
I found out through your uncle.

813
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,440
Your father knows everything.

814
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,110
What are you going to do? 
You jerk.

815
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,780
Let go! Punk...

816
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:54,390
Mom, let's talk outside.

817
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,400
He's my son.

818
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,200
Where is it?

819
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,880
Gosh.

820
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,090
How could this be...

821
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,320
Gosh...

822
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,520
- My gosh!
- No...

823
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,000
How could you...

824
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:26,260
Geez, Jae Hee!

825
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,200
- Yikes.
- Some coffee?

826
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,000
Leave it, Mom. I'll do it.

827
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,660
Aigoo!

828
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,990
Stop grinding it.

829
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:02,110
Would you want to drink 
coffee in this setting?

830
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:07,710
Geez!

831
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,970
Lift your feet.

832
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:15,020
Leave it alone. I'll do it. 
I already did that.

833
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,700
Geez...

834
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,990
Mom, it's okay. You don't
 have to clean there.

835
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,450
I had no idea you were 
struggling so much.

836
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:32,460
Geez, Ms. Jung Min Jae.

837
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,230
I'm not struggling that much.

838
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:35,670
I'm investing in my future.

839
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:38,280
Why invest by selling your house?

840
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,540
Jae Hee, just come home.

841
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,620
Why are you living like
 this in a motel?

842
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,410
There is no way.

843
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,680
Even if I'm left with
 only my underwear,

844
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,310
who said I should stand 
ground to the end?

845
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:52,150
I said that only because
 I was so upset then.

846
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:57,600
Mom, you know it well since you have
 a husband who is a businessman.

847
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,550
Business is actually...

848
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:01,730
all about going through difficulties

849
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:05,330
this way and that way
 in order to grow.

850
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:07,960
Your son, Woo Jae Hee? 
He's perfectly fine. No problem.

851
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,300
Believe in me.

852
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,460
You're loud, just like your father.

853
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,010
Geez, stop crying.

854
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,330
Stop.

855
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,600
Anyway, Father is great 
at getting information.

856
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,160
He knew all about my situation,
 yet he pretended not to know.

857
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,110
That's impressive.

858
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,560
By chance...

859
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,820
could he be following 
us as we speak?

860
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:40,620
By now...

861
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,910
I'm sure they're looking around

862
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:44,950
wondering if I have them followed.

863
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,460
It costs money to
 put a tail on them.

864
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,210
Just because it's not his money, 
he spends it like water.

865
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:54,200
I can see right through it.

866
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
They must be so scared.

867
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,750
Geez.

868
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,700
All right.

869
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,010
Aigoo...

870
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,400
Geez, that scared me.

871
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,700
Geez.

872
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,080
 Sammie noona, I'm glad you're
 happy to hear from me. 

873
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,940
 I knew you hadn't
 forgotten about me. 

874
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,680
 I felt the same way. 

875
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,970
It's not like I hadn't 
forgotten about her.

876
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:42,540
 Well, Sammie noona. 

877
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,130
 Be nice to my Hae Deun noona. 

878
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:47,450
 My sister looks like she's 
having a hard time lately. 

879
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,230
Geez, is it too soon 
to get to the point?

880
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,800
 Do you have a girlfriend? 

881
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:58,730
Not yet.

882
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:01,270
 Really? 

883
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,200
What's this?

884
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,770
What's the meaning 
behind this smile?

885
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:08,590
Lee Ra Hoon, could you 
step on my calves?

886
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,950
They're so swollen. 
My pretty legs...

887
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,360
What? What were you doing?

888
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,410
What else? I was trying 
to go to sleep.

889
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,440
Were you looking at something? 
What were you looking at?

890
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,430
Geez, I wasn't looking at anything.

891
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:21,700
What? You were texting, right?

892
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,040
Do you have a girlfriend? 
Come on.

893
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,280
- Geez, no! Get away from me!
- Come on!

894
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,780
Come on...

895
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,410
 
 The DNA test results for 

896
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,650
 Choi Young Sook and 
Lee Bit Chae Woon is out. 

897
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:46,650
 Unfortunately, you're not related. 

898
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,030
Yes, this is Ms. Lee.

899
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,700
 I'm Hyo Jung's mom. 

900
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,590
They contacted you, right?

901
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,600
Yes.

902
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:13,110
 I just wanted to say bye. 

903
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,350
 I was glad to have met you. 

904
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:16,950
Yes, me, too.

905
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,640
You'll meet your 
daughter for sure.

906
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,360
Stay healthy.

907
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,050
 Thank you. 

908
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:28,340
 Oh, please say hello
 to your mom. 

909
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,580
 She was so nice to me last time. 

910
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,940
Did you meet...

911
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,270
my mom?

912
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:43,470
 Your mother... 

913
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:47,200
 treated me with such warmth. 

914
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,600
 That's not it, Mom. 

915
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,900
 I misspoke. 

916
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,880
 I'm extremely on edge right now. 

917
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,460
Gosh...

918
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,060
Chae Woon.

919
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,490
 Your mother... 

920
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:43,240
 treated me with such warmth. 

921
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:46,370
 Wait. Hey. 

922
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:47,740
 Let's go. 

923
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,680
 You should've talked to
 me about it first. 

924
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,110
 What will you do? 
They'll treat you like a fool! 

925
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:54,840
 Chae Woon. 

926
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,680
 I'm fine. 

927
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,840
 Don't worry. Okay? 

928
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,200
Excuse me, can I sit here?

929
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,770
There are no open seats.

930
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:14,770
Thank you.

931
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,700
I'll get it.

932
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,040
Thank you.

933
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:28,680
Sir, give me a fishcake soup 
and a bottle of soju, please.

934
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,620
You must be upset 
about something.

935
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,930
You shouldn't drink 
so much like that alone.

936
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:50,360
Geez...

937
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:54,140
Why don't you get lost?

938
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:56,840
Excuse me?

939
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:03,230
Aren't you trying to pick me up?

940
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:05,520
Just because a woman
 is drinking alone?

941
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,240
Picking you up?

942
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,400
Geez, I wasn't doing that.

943
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:13,650
I'm sorry.

944
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,720
I was upset about 
something today.

945
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,870
I guess I just wanted to talk.

946
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:19,620
I won't talk to you anymore.

947
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,420
Relax and drink.

948
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:27,340
Look.

949
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,350
Just because you're upset,

950
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:33,180
you shouldn't speak
 to a stranger.

951
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,730
You go alone...

952
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:38,200
in life anyway.

953
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,870
Shut your mouth and go alone.

954
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,720
Go at it alone even
 if you're scared.

955
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,500
Go at it alone for real.

956
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,100
Got that?

957
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,400
He's got a long way to go.

958
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,860
My gosh.

959
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,640
Here.

960
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,510
Thank you.

961
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:26,180
You should be careful.

962
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,780
So that you won't fall.

963
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,740
Okay.

964
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,700
Mom, you like them, right?

965
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:00,800
Choose.

966
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,300
No, they're too expensive.

967
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,440
Geez, I can afford this much.

968
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,100
Choose.

969
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,750
Then, just two.

970
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,260
Geez, no. Six.

971
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,780
Then, four.

972
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:37,700
♫  I guess I'm still young  ♫

973
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,150
♫  I must be  ♫

974
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,820
♫  Oh, my gosh!  ♫
 Oh, my God!

975
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,660
You saw, right?

976
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:50,750
You saw how he's living, right?

977
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,320
What do you mean you didn't?

978
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,230
I'm sure the mother and son 
cried their eyes out

979
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:59,830
badmouthing me until 
your tongues were dry.

980
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:02,300
What are you eating right now?

981
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,000
Jae Hee bought it for you, huh?

982
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,470
What a good life you're living.

983
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:16,780
Did you really want to 
empty your son's pocket

984
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:19,000
when he's living in 
a motel long-term?

985
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,450
How old do you think you are?

986
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:24,620
As the wife of a corporate
 head who has the

987
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:27,020
nation's economy 
on his shoulders.

988
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:29,290
And as the mother 
of an idiotic son

989
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,890
who is running 
a faltering business

990
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:33,220
facing a dire financial crisis.

991
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:36,050
In the middle of the night,

992
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:38,310
in pitch-black darkness,

993
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:39,860
behind your husband's back,

994
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:43,420
did you have to eat 
these cookies in secret?

995
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,200
Wait.

996
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,710
Hey.

997
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,290
Min Jae!

998
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,110
Hey!

999
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:57,580
Honey!

1000
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,820
Honey!

1001
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,700
Excuse me.

1002
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,430
Jung Min Jae. A woman. 
Where is she?

1003
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:04,850
Over there, further in.

1004
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,200
Mom.

1005
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,510
Wait.

1006
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:13,950
Mom!

1007
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:18,290
What... what happened?

1008
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,520
She was eating a cookie 
and swallowed wrong.

1009
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,230
I gave her urgent care. 
She'll be fine.

1010
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,370
I'm not a tiger, you know.

1011
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:34,170
She got so startled.

1012
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:41,110
Step outside for a moment.

1013
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:43,390
I don't want to. It's cold.

1014
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,440
Where is Mr. Lee?

1015
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,180
I asked him to get my jacket.

1016
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,090
Look at this guy.

1017
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:52,130
Hey!

1018
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,860
Hey! Hey, you!

1019
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:58,960
Aigoo.

1020
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,500
Let go of my hand!

1021
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,940
You know, this happened
 many times.

1022
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,320
Mother got startled and
 fainted because of you.

1023
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,200
Well...

1024
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:15,100
anyway, she sure has
 the frailest nerves.

1025
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:18,020
Leave.

1026
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:20,350
What?

1027
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:22,280
Go back home.

1028
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,720
How dare you...

1029
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,240
Why should I leave?

1030
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,980
When Mom wakes up,

1031
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,940
I think it'd be good if 
she doesn't see you.

1032
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,590
At least for tonight.

1033
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:32,610
What?

1034
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:34,750
If you're truly sorry,

1035
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,750
please just for the night...

1036
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,240
go home.

1037
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:42,030
I don't want to, man.

1038
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,330
Please go.

1039
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:45,960
I don't want to.

1040
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,330
- Go.
- I said no!

1041
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,690
Go!

1042
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:51,410
I don't want to!

1043
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:05,760
♫  In the midst of tall 
forest of buildings  ♫

1044
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,650
♫  A city girl is walking confidently  ♫

1045
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:12,330
♫  The star of the city  ♫

1046
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:14,430
 

1047
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,170
 Ahjumma quit. 

1048
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:17,890
 Can you do it alone? 

1049
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:19,800
 Do you think you can
 go at it alone? 

1050
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,510
 Why are you in bed so early? 

1051
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:23,210
 Min Jae! Min Jae! 

1052
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:25,410
 You're hurt and upset
 because of me. 

1053
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:27,270
 Why do you always... 

1054
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:28,380
 Gosh. Hey! 

1055
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,050
 - Man Jung, why are you doing this?
 - Why else?

1056
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:32,100
 - Why else?
- Man Jung! 

1057
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,780
 Let's start dating again. 

1058
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,430
 Wang Sammie, that vixen. 

1059
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,130
 Who is she flirting with? 

1060
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,290
 Let's correct this wrong. 

1061
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:40,510
 Let's fix the mistake we
 made in the judging. 

1062
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:41,660
 Let's give her the grand prize. 

1063
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,300
 Seo Ah, long time no see. 

1064
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:46,200
 Thank you in advance, 
Director Jang Seo Ah.
