1
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,130
 

2
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,060
I don't really wear rings.

3
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,540
You don't like rings?

4
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,960
No, I love them.

5
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,270
But it gets in the way when 
I'm working on construction sites.

6
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,410
I lost a few of them, too.

7
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,070
You can't lose this one. That'd be bad.

8
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,070
I'll never lose this one.

9
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,960
I'll never take this off, no matter what.

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,710
Sounds great.

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,840
Boy, I feel great.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,160
But we should wear rings together.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,420
I'll buy one for you, Koala.

14
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,780
I knew this, so I prepared one.

15
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,480
Ta-da.

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,550
It's the same one as yours.

17
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,640
Seriously.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,190
Put it on me.

19
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,070
There.

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,460
Wait.

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,230
Not like that. You have to say it.

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,340
Like earlier.

23
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,290
- Koala.
- Yes.

24
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,330
Do you love me?

25
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,160
Yes, I love you.

26
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,760
Very much. As big as the universe.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,150
I love you more than the universe.

28
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,120
Chae Woon said that?

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,100
That's what Chae Woon said to you?

30
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,300
I know that...

31
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,580
Seo Yeon moved in here 
because of you and me.

32
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,260
Thanks to Seo Yeon, 
our misunderstanding was cleared.

33
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,230
I'm so glad that happened.

34
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,130
But other situations are

35
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,840
cornering Seo Yeon, giving her a hard time.

36
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,460
Coming to that conclusion...

37
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,940
must be better for you.

38
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,470
Your position in the company...

39
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,140
It could become unstable 
because of Chae Woon.

40
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,590
Yeah.

41
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,250
You're right.

42
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,610
That's the fact.

43
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,670
So I don't want Seo Yeon to 
see me this way anymore.

44
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,070
The way I'm wavering due to
 various situations at work.

45
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,630
Seeing me deny my 
own daughter like last time.

46
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,230
I don't want to show that 
side of me to Seo Yeon.

47
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,190
Not until everything works itself out.

48
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,680
Yes, I understand.

49
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,420
Then I'll take Chae Woon with me today.

50
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,530
Okay.

51
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,170
Do that.

52
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,070
Young Lady Chae Woon is home.

53
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,670
I'm home.

54
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,490
Hi, Chae Woon.

55
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,420
Mom!

56
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,900
Chae Woon.

57
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,640
What were you two talking about now?

58
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,290
About you...

59
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,050
moving back to Samgwang Villa.

60
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,390
We were discussing that.

61
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,700
Since I said that...

62
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,640
I'll move back to Samgwang Villa,

63
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,800
you must be upset, huh?

64
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,370
No. It's not like that.

65
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,260
I've been thinking a lot about you 
moving back to Samgwang Villa.

66
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,980
I think it'd be better if you moved back there.

67
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,270
Yes, Chae Woon.

68
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,880
I discussed it with the CEO.

69
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,700
I think...

70
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,840
it'd be best if you do that.

71
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,230
Thank you...

72
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,860
for respecting...

73
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,440
my thoughts.

74
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,030
Go and...

75
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,620
pack your things.

76
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,200
It'd be better for me to 
move back home, right, Mom?

77
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,040
You do whatever you want.

78
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,090
Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

79
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,420
But...

80
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,070
I think this is a right 
decision for the CEO, too.

81
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,560
I'll go now.

82
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,180
Did you pack everything 
and not forget anything?

83
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,090
Yes.

84
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,270
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,880
What are you sorry about?

86
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,910
It feels like you're going far away.

87
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,730
We'll see each other at work every day.

88
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,240
And if we miss each other,

89
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,370
we'll visit back and forth.

90
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,440
You'll come over often, right?

91
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,570
Yes.

92
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,510
Soon Jung, the car is 
ready for you outside.

93
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,360
Yes.

94
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,050
Thank you.

95
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,870
Be careful going home.

96
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,660
I won't walk you out.

97
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,300
Yes, good night.

98
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,370
Let's go, Chae Woon.

99
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,280
Gosh, it's okay. Don't cry.

100
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,630
 What? Grandpa? 

101
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,860
 - What makes me look like a grandpa? 
- You got scared.

102
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,250
Don't cry.

103
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,460
Father...

104
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,550
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,830
My son was so impolite.

106
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,250
Wait, Professor.

107
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,300
- He's not my...
- I am your father.

108
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,700
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm...

109
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,010
your grandson 
Jae Hee's school sunbae.

110
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,800
My grandson?

111
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,730
- Yes, I moved to the front unit.
- Well...

112
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,940
Well, it's not like that.

113
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,450
Min Jae.

114
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,970
I enjoyed the side dish 
you prepared for me.

115
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,370
Kiddo.

116
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,490
Sorry I scared you.

117
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,410
It's okay.

118
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,250
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,540
You're polite.

120
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,320
Have a nice time.

121
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,390
- Wait...
- Is your father leaving? Not coming in?

122
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,850
Good night, sir.

123
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,370
Oh, my.

124
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,920
The containers I packed for him...

125
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,870
What in the world?

126
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,480
He even did the dishes?

127
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,570
Oh, my goodness.

128
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,510
Geez.

129
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,070
What's the point of 
buying me this now?

130
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,790
It's all over.

131
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,810
 You and ahjumma look just like each other. 

132
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,300
 How am I a grandpa? 

133
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,310
Ba Wi sure seems so smart, but...

134
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,300
he's not tactful.

135
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,230
How does Woo Jung Hoo
 look like a grandpa?

136
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,170
I wonder if Woo Jung Hoo 
is very upset.

137
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
 Good night, sir. 

138
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,210
People would say 
they look like a family.

139
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,600
Geez!

140
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,580
They looked good together.

141
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,970
But he's still someone
 else's kid's father.

142
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,020
But...

143
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,070
where is the mom?

144
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,250
Why are they over at Min Jae's place?

145
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,770
Wait...

146
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,790
Is it a two-income household?

147
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,020
Geez, she's so scary.

148
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,550
Let's go.

149
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,650
Let's go. I should go.

150
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,330
You're home, my lady.

151
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,460
Yes.

152
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,030
Is Mom home?

153
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,200
Yes.

154
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,210
Did something happen?

155
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,810
Young Lady Chae Woon left.

156
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,590
You're home.

157
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,070
I'm home, Mom.

158
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,820
Did Bit Chae Woon go to her house?

159
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,610
"Her house"?

160
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,120
Ah...

161
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,180
I told her to live there for now.

162
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,790
Things are too hectic right now.

163
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,100
You must feel bad, Mom.

164
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,300
It's not like she left for good.

165
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,990
I'll lie down for a minute, Seo Ah.

166
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,320
Okay. Get some rest.

167
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,620
Oh, my gosh!

168
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,520
Bit Chae Woon is gone!

169
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,170
She's finally gone!

170
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,680
 

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,810
 The customer can't 
answer the call right now. 

172
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,960
What's with Hwang Na Ro?

173
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,270
He hasn't answered my calls.

174
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,170
Good job, guys.

175
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,270
Go now.

176
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,970
Geez...

177
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,570
You're moving up.

178
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,820
Working close with 
Chairwoman Lee Choon Suk.

179
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,390
Pretty cool.

180
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,010
Aren't you cold?

181
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,670
I told you not to cross the line.

182
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,520
Why do you make my guys
 give you massages?

183
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,670
You sent the email to the 
board of directors at work.

184
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,860
You called Executive Director Jang.

185
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,360
And you framed me for all that?

186
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,830
Punk...

187
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,340
It's because I know that 
it won't hurt you.

188
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,800
You're already tainted.

189
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,090
What?

190
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,060
If you keep doing this, I'll tell 
Chairwoman Lee Choon Suk.

191
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,760
What kind of guy you are.

192
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,600
Hey, that's cowardly.

193
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,590
I still didn't spill our relationship.

194
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,600
So what if you haven't spilled it?

195
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,170
You told Seo Yeon that I was

196
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,770
meeting Jung Won. 
You think I didn't know?

197
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,230
Didn't you do that to scare me?

198
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,090
I knew you ran off just fine.

199
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,730
Hyungnim, you're the tiger
 from Jiri Mountain.

200
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,700
So you still acknowledge me, huh?

201
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,990
Hey, it does make me 
feel good, though.

202
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,720
Hello, Bit Chae Woon.

203
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,100
The laughter?

204
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,080
I'm with your father, Bit Chae Woon.

205
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,570
What? Hey! Hang up.

206
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,870
I'll put him on the phone.

207
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,150
Geez!

208
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,550
 Your horoscope for the day is that... 

209
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,110
 your fate hangs by a thread. 

210
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,260
 You'll encounter a frustrating situation. 

211
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,340
Hey!

212
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,320
Geez, that's an expensive phone!

213
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,370
You a**hole! How dare you tease me!

214
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,120
You sure are afraid of your daughter.

215
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,380
She's your weakness.

216
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,990
Hyungnim.

217
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,750
Why do you think I let you 
beat me up without a fight?

218
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,500
What do you mean you let me?

219
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,270
You're no match for me to begin with.

220
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,890
You really think so?

221
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,310
That's not it.

222
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,790
Because you're 
Bit Chae Woon's birth father,

223
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,670
I'm treating you with respect.

224
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,980
I'm letting you beat me to be polite.

225
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,340
What?

226
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,330
By chance, did you
 really like my Seo Yeon?

227
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:29,170
Then a long time ago, did you 
really like CEO Kim Jung Won?

228
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,360
You a**hole! How dare 
you like my Seo Yeon?

229
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,210
Wow.

230
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,980
You really did love CEO Kim Jung Won.

231
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,050
Park Pil Hong romance...

232
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,570
Whoa.

233
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,690
It really doesn't suit you.

234
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,230
You stop paying attention 
to my Seo Yeon, a**hole.

235
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,910
You're no comparison to Woo Jae Hee.

236
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,650
Geez, you even love that Woo Jae Hee?

237
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,430
That makes me feel so sad.

238
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,230
We're in the same field, you know!

239
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,610
Anyway, you're no good. Trash like you

240
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,530
can't even look at my Seo Yeon.

241
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,730
- Got that?
- How about you, Hyungnim?

242
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,300
Aren't you just the same trashy dad?

243
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,240
You and I are both like cancer

244
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,460
to Bit Chae Woon.

245
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,880
We're the same.

246
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,250
You a**hole!

247
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,230
Hyungnim.

248
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,110
This is the last day I'll get hit like this.

249
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,680
Next time, I won't let you
 get away with it.

250
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,130
You a**hole...

251
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,280
Watch your back in 
dark alleys, Hyungnim.

252
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,570
It's an expensive phone...

253
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,050
Hey!

254
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,140
- What are you doing?
- Me? Working.

255
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,550
Is it fun?

256
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,680
Yeah.

257
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,380
Styling is so fun.

258
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,100
Time flies when I'm doing this.

259
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,500
Wow, you finally found your path.

260
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,010
I don't know yet.

261
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,690
I might give up suddenly. 
I'm like that, you know.

262
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,890
No, no, no.

263
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,590
Your gaze is different than before.

264
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,910
- Really?
- Yeah.

265
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,400
How do I look?

266
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,650
Am I wrong?

267
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,900
Huh?

268
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,690
Noona, by chance...

269
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,620
do you like someone?

270
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,810
- What?
- Your eyes totally say melo.

271
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,620
Gosh. Why did I think of 
Mr. Makjang out of the blue?

272
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,920
Geez. What melo?

273
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,940
You take care of your own melo.

274
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,070
What? What do you
 mean by "my melo"?

275
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,210
Cha Ba Reun is looking
 for another place.

276
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,150
She was asking me which
 place is better earlier.

277
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,110
Really?

278
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,540
Geez.

279
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,110
The real skill in melo is timing.

280
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,080
Don't regret it after 
you miss the boat, my child.

281
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,430
Oh-ho.

282
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:16,790
Why is Cha Ba Reun cleaning 
so diligently all of a sudden?

283
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,820
Because I won't be
 around for too long.

284
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,710
Why?

285
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,070
Hey. Are you going somewhere?

286
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,480
Huh? Are you?

287
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,760
Wait.

288
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,740
Hey.

289
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,260
- What?
- Auntie.

290
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,100
What?

291
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,070
Huh?

292
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,670
I see. You two have to talk?

293
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,970
Huh?

294
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,700
Do you need to talk?

295
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,070
Well. Aunt...

296
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,520
I was going to say 
something to you, Auntie.

297
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,100
Go ahead. Say what? Say it.

298
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,570
You have something to
 tell me? What? What?

299
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,730
- What is it?
- Huh?

300
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,270
Geez, seriously.

301
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,170
Geez, come on.

302
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,170
My gosh, seriously.

303
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,260
I get so frustrated 
when I see you two.

304
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,410
Geez.

305
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,150
- Why...
- Don't stop me.

306
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,850
Don't stop me and...

307
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,210
Hey.

308
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,850
I'll... listen up.

309
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,790
I'll be out of here for 
exactly 30 minutes. Okay?

310
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,770
You two finish what you have 
to say during that time.

311
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:30,730
Just stand 50 cm apart and 
talk morally and ethically.

312
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,840
Hey, Cha Ba Reun.

313
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,690
"All of a sudden."

314
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,470
Got it? Nothing more is needed 
for young people. Just hug suddenly.

315
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,860
"All of a sudden."

316
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,620
Talk now. I'll be back.

317
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,970
Gosh, where should I go?

318
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,600
"All of a sudden"?

319
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,830
What is she talking about?

320
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,540
Hurry up and say what you have to say.

321
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,030
I have tons to do.

322
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,850
Are you...

323
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,100
really moving out?

324
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,250
Yeah.

325
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,020
I found a place close to school.

326
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,680
It's a share house where my friend lives.

327
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,200
I'll try sleeping there tomorrow.

328
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,000
Thanks for everything, Lee Ra Hoon.

329
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,470
For letting me live with 
such good people.

330
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,410
That's...

331
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,470
I have more things now.

332
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,090
I'll take some little at a time 
whenever I go over there.

333
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,980
If you're done talking, will you leave?

334
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,810
I want to clean up 
thoroughly before I leave.

335
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,270
Gosh, I have to wash this.

336
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,760
Cha Ba Reun.

337
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,270
What?

338
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,380
Dummy.

339
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,870
Don't go.

340
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,810
What?

341
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,110
What did you say?

342
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,580
So...

343
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,070
I'm saying, don't go.

344
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,000
I have to go.

345
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,340
I have to wash this and sterilize it.

346
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,280
Dummy, don't go.

347
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,450
Don't leave this place.

348
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,630
Don't go.

349
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,640
You're uncomfortable around me.

350
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,400
No.

351
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,710
I think I'll be more
 uncomfortable without you.

352
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,610
I don't think I'll be well.

353
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,970
I don't think I can eat nor work well.

354
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,960
I can't even breathe.

355
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,880
Don't go, Cha Ba Reun.

356
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,290
I won't be foolish anymore. Never.

357
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,230
I'll be your boyfriend now. For real.

358
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,210
I'll be your dependable boyfriend.

359
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,570
Hey.

360
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,180
Lee Ra Hoon, seriously.

361
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:40,070
♫  Youth these days are 
having a hard time  ♫

362
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:48,970
♫  Well, just living with 
that in my heart  ♫

363
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,280
♫  It's good  ♫

364
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,110
♫  Very very good  ♫

365
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,260
♫  To a man's heart  ♫

366
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,750
You're good.

367
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,590
I think this song is good.

368
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,490
It's perfect with your sound.

369
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,270
Gosh. It's great!

370
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,690
Let's see.

371
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,120
Good, good, good. How about this one?

372
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,930
If you keep staring, 
my face will wear out.

373
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,860
I can't help it even if it does.

374
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,320
My gosh. When will we 
choose a song at this rate?

375
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,920
Let me be.

376
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,010
We can choose one tomorrow.

377
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,730
Really?

378
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,670
What are you trying to do now?

379
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,750
Oh, my.

380
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,330
Na Ro.

381
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,680
Na Ro is home?

382
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,440
Hi, Na Ro.

383
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,680
I'm home.

384
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,980
What happened to your face?

385
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,160
I fell.

386
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,490
- Again?
- Yes.

387
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,930
I don't think you fell.

388
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,090
- Someone beat you up.
- Oh, no.

389
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,770
Wait, Na Ro.

390
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,280
Why do you keep falling?

391
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,440
You fell last time and time before that.

392
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,300
- I'll go in.
- Wait a minute.

393
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,300
I'll clean up the wound
 for you. I'm a doctor.

394
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,510
I have medicine. 
I'll do it. Good night.

395
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,640
Wait, Na Ro. Na...

396
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,690
He got beat up pretty bad.

397
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,860
I know.

398
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,070
By chance...

399
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,730
do you think...

400
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,160
he's hanging around 
people he met in prison?

401
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,040
He's getting beat up by the bad 
people he used to hang with?

402
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,850
- Aigoo...
- What do we do?

403
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,690
Moong-i, Mother.

404
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,360
Mr. Woo, did you wait for us?

405
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,300
I texted him on our way.

406
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,150
I see. It's cold, though.

407
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,980
It's okay.

408
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,440
Chae Woon!

409
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,240
Chae Woon.

410
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,490
What... what's going on with you?

411
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,960
Auntie.

412
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,730
Oh, yeah.

413
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,310
Yeah...

414
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,020
What's that?

415
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,670
What's that? Did you get kicked out?

416
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,390
No.

417
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,820
What do you mean, no?

418
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,780
Unni, she got kicked out, huh?

419
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,770
Did you fight at Jung Won unni's?

420
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,460
It's not like that. Let's talk inside.

421
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,720
- Mr. Woo, let's go in.
- Okay.

422
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,040
Let's go in.

423
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,940
What's going on, Unni?

424
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,340
Chae Woon.

425
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,150
Let's go in, Uncle.

426
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,400
Okay.

427
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,830
Let's go in.

428
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,750
What's up at this late hour?

429
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,200
It's not that late.

430
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,760
But still.

431
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,430
We're now strangers. Is it okay for 
you to come over like this?

432
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,370
Gosh.

433
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,290
Didn't you just come over 
to my place earlier?

434
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,850
I went there to return
 your containers.

435
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,580
And I got insulted out of the blue.

436
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,370
Grandpa?

437
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,970
Tell that kid to get some eyeglasses.

438
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,750
Yes, I will.

439
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,200
But that tall guy living
 across from you.

440
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,270
Does he come and go to
 other people's house like that?

441
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,900
The kid's mom is okay with that?

442
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,630
The kid doesn't have a mom.

443
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,470
I think he's a widower.

444
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,270
Wh... what?

445
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,040
No wonder he calls you,
 "Noonim, noonim..."

446
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,930
Oh, my. Oh, my gosh.

447
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,110
What are you imagining?

448
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,060
He's Jae Hee's school sunbae.

449
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,590
I heard that.

450
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,740
You did. And what?

451
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,470
If he's your son's sunbae, is there 
a rule he can't be with you?

452
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,480
Tons of older woman and
 younger man couples exist.

453
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,560
Oh, my, my, my, my...

454
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,000
Are you jealous right now?

455
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,960
Jealous?

456
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,890
If you thought you had no chance
 with that good-looking, tall guy,

457
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,790
you'd say, "He's not my father.

458
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,580
He's my husband." You should've 
explained right there.

459
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:56,550
You're not my husband right now.

460
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,670
Wh... what?

461
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,670
You always emphasize that
 we're strangers now.

462
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,610
I guess you still want to
 act like my husband.

463
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,270
He lives across from me now.

464
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,820
He'll obviously know that I live alone.

465
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,510
To someone I don't know well,

466
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,050
should I say that I'm divorced?
 Standing there?

467
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,700
Why can't you?

468
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,830
Why didn't you say that then?

469
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,860
You're the one who said, 
"Min Jae, your dad's leaving."

470
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,500
I came here wondering if you got hurt.

471
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,960
Did I go there empty-handed?

472
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,810
I took my chances and

473
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,600
even bought you those 
expensive cookies that you like.

474
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,810
Geez! Those "expensive" cookies!

475
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,840
Who cares if you buy me those now?

476
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,910
So what if you buy me 
a 100 or a 1,000 of them?

477
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,750
We're over.

478
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,130
Fine. We're done.

479
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,960
Isn't that good?

480
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,220
Good thing that good-looking, 
tall guy moved across from you.

481
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,460
Good luck to you, Jung Min Jae.

482
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,020
My gosh.

483
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,600
We just can't communicate.

484
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,010
It's my fault for coming over here.

485
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,980
I'll leave.

486
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,480
Wait.

487
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,190
Woo Jung Hoo, you're a no.

488
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,720
Even after thousands of years, 
we'll be the same.

489
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,660
Why did you make him 
side dishes again?

490
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,910
Aigoo. Aigoo, you stupid idiot!

491
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,060
Aigoo!

492
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,570
It must be cold outside.

493
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,100
Yes.

494
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,320
Now what?

495
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,970
Are you shocked?

496
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:11,980
I went home after saying goodbye,

497
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,330
and I texted you saying
 I'm coming back.

498
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,270
Moong-i, you were taken aback, huh?

499
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:23,880
But I think it's better to do it 
once I've made up my mind.

500
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,940
Were you sad as you 
left the CEO's home?

501
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,270
A little bit.

502
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,740
But I didn't leave with bad feelings.

503
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,900
But my birth father...

504
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,120
I heard he came to the
 company and met the CEO.

505
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,870
What if he goes to her 
house and stuff later?

506
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,900
I know.

507
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,310
Your cop friend, Min Chul.

508
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,440
How is it going with finding 
Park Pil Hong?

509
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,530
Well... not yet.

510
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:07,130
I think I should find him first 
and meet him somehow.

511
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,420
Why don't you answer?
 It's Mr. Lee.

512
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,370
Okay...

513
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,980
Just a moment.

514
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,380
Hi, Mr. Lee.

515
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,770
You called me several times.

516
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:31,830
I couldn't reach you 
after you left early today.

517
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,040
He left early?

518
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,100
Are you with Seo Yeon?

519
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,470
Yes. So I can't really...

520
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,650
Mr. Woo, don't worry.

521
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,420
I won't run away.

522
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,440
Of course you shouldn't.

523
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
You're coming in tomorrow, right?

524
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,780
 Yes. 

525
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,120
See you tomorrow.

526
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,820
 Why did he leave early? 

527
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,550
 Was he sick? 

528
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,040
 Well... 

529
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,300
 No, I think he had 
a matter to attend to. 

530
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,370
Seo Yeon is worried about me.

531
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,540
Seo Yeon...

532
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:23,960
Oh, yeah. About what 
we talked about earlier...

533
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,720
About getting married.

534
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,770
I think we should tell our parents.

535
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,770
Why? It's not time yet?

536
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,700
A little later.

537
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,500
Okay.

538
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,360
Unni.

539
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,270
Oh, my...

540
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,950
Don't be startled.

541
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:55,020
Hwak Se ahjussi bought some
 delicious food. Come down.

542
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,780
Okay.

543
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,090
Well...

544
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,820
But how did you know
 I was in here?

545
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,980
Does everyone know?

546
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,260
No.

547
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,970
So how did you know, Ba Reun?

548
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,030
I guessed.

549
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,940
Come down.

550
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:20,970
Gosh, so many people are
 watching us here.

551
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,310
- Whoa.
- Looks good!

552
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,570
I didn't know about this.

553
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,930
- Uncle, thanks.
- Sure.

554
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,120
Eat a lot.

555
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,630
Chae Woon is back now and

556
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:34,030
our Samgwang Villa 
people have gathered.

557
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,810
I feel so good.

558
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,380
You're right, Hwak Se.

559
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,900
This is a total party.

560
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,780
Well, not totally.

561
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,570
We're missing Na Ro oppa 
and James ahjussi.

562
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,940
Yeah, right.

563
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,070
Oh, yeah. Chae Woon.

564
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,860
I heard Na Ro got promoted.

565
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,510
Yeah. It hasn't been 
announced, though.

566
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,760
Really?

567
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,550
Then I'm the first one he told.

568
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,640
Did Hwang Na Ro tell you that 
he got a full-time position?

569
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,240
Yeah. He said he's full-time now.

570
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,070
He said when he heard,

571
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,500
he thought of me first.

572
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,490
Really?

573
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,650
Then we should congratulate him.

574
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,790
Is Na Ro ahjussi not home yet?

575
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,950
- I'll go see.
- Hey, he's not here yet.

576
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,060
- He's not.
- He's probably not here.

577
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,800
He's not here. No, he came.

578
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,460
Oh, he sent me a text earlier 
saying that he'll be late.

579
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,260
Yeah, right.

580
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,490
Really?

581
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,560
He must be busy.

582
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,220
Let me call him.

583
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,340
Why call him?

584
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,790
Yes, Mother.

585
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,570
Hi, Na Ro. Are you at work?

586
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,620
Yes, I'm still...

587
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,780
 Really? 

588
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,960
 It'd be nice if you were with us. 

589
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,310
It looks like Chae Woon 
will stay here with us.

590
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,630
So everyone got together.

591
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,700
Oh, I see.

592
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,910
 Hyung, congrats on 
your full-time job! 

593
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,530
 Na Ro oppa, congrats! 
It's your treat next time! 

594
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,710
 Congratulations, Na Ro ahjussi! 

595
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,260
Thank you.

596
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,470
Okay.

597
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,690
Be careful coming home later.

598
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,010
Aigoo, that's too bad.

599
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,820
He always misses out.

600
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,980
Mom, if you're that disappointed,

601
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,590
should we all get together and
 eat out tomorrow night?

602
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:35,150
Hey, why are we having 
a feast so often?

603
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,900
That's a good idea.

604
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,410
We can invite Eems hyung, too.

605
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,530
Right, Jae Hee?

606
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,170
Yes, Hyungnim.

607
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,860
Good, good. Right, Unni?

608
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,030
Yeah. Sounds good.

609
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,480
Unni, are you wearing a ring?

610
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,960
You don't usually wear a ring.

611
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,220
I just decided to wear one.

612
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,900
I see.

613
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,650
 I should eat, too. 

614
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,490
 I'm a total dumpling mania. 

615
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,840
 Me, too. 

616
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,970
 I don't like you anymore... 

617
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,880
 I hate you. 

618
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,870
 But that's why I feel sorry for you. 

619
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,870
 You don't have a right to live here. 

620
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,460
 Leave. 

621
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,720
Yes, Director.

622
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,590
Why didn't you answer the phone?

623
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,020
I called you so many times.

624
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,290
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

625
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,680
Bit Chae Woon is here.

626
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,980
Yeah.

627
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,600
I was so happy about that. 
That's why I called you.

628
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,330
What's Bit Chae Woon doing?

629
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,590
She's eating with her family.

630
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,590
 You know, I'm so happy. 

631
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,290
 I just have to rip her away
 from Jae Hee oppa. 

632
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,570
Woo Jae Hee...

633
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,970
 Hello? 

634
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,420
Hello? Hwang Na Ro.

635
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,770
 You're not in a good mood. 
Did something happen? 

636
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,560
I'm jealous.

637
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,090
All you care about is 
Woo Jae Hee, too.

638
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,830
It's disappointing.

639
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,670
Young Lady.

640
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,370
Oppa!

641
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,310
Oppa!

642
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,190
Hey, hey, hey.

643
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,560
All right, all right.

644
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,960
- Joon Ah, you're here!
- Mom.

645
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,770
- I'm glad you came.
- Yeah.

646
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,450
Mom, I'm sorry.

647
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,160
I couldn't tell you.

648
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,820
Mom knows.

649
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,930
- Really?
- Yeah.

650
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,320
Mom, well...

651
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,150
It's late, but congratulations 
on finding your daughter.

652
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,350
Thanks.

653
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,030
She's not home yet?

654
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,330
I wanted to say hi.

655
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,480
She left earlier. To her house.

656
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,810
Her house? Isn't this her house?

657
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,750
She decided to live in
 her old house for now.

658
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,070
I see.

659
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,420
We had some problems all this time.

660
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,840
Problems? There were problems?
 What problems?

661
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,330
You're the biggest problem here.

662
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,940
I was...

663
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,350
so stunned when
 I saw you in the lobby.

664
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,360
I couldn't tell you properly.

665
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,630
I really went to see you
 to turn myself in.

666
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,110
I went there several times, but...

667
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,470
we kept missing each other.

668
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,800
But if you wanted to, I'm sure 
you would've come to me.

669
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,310
I'm sorry, Mom.

670
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,600
It's...

671
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:51,860
too much pressure for me
 to work at the company.

672
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,540
So I went to London as if
 I was running away.

673
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,170
But when I got there,

674
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,200
studying really didn't suit me.

675
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,660
So I came back.

676
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,930
I know I should've told 
you that I came back.

677
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:07,650
But I couldn't' bring myself to talk 
to you because I felt so bad.

678
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,790
I know, Joon Ah.

679
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:14,610
The disappointment you have
 in your heart toward me.

680
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,080
Until that is resolved,

681
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,840
it will be hard for us to get close.

682
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,490
What would I be disappointed 
about with you?

683
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:32,330
When your father got sick,

684
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,360
I couldn't stay by
 your dad's side that much.

685
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,360
I had to focus on work.

686
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,400
You're like this because you're so 
disappointed in me about that time.

687
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:46,770
Of course, Seo Ah was too little.

688
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,640
She might now know well.

689
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,170
No...

690
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,490
I think I was too young then...

691
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,420
I understand everything now, Mom.

692
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,450
The company was
 struggling back then.

693
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,080
Of course, Mom...

694
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,180
Dad is sick, so...

695
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,700
of course, you should've 
focused on work.

696
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,190
I understand. Really.

697
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,930
That's how you built 
a strong company now.

698
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,640
Thanks for your understanding.

699
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,850
Even so...

700
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:24,370
sad feelings don't go 
away easily, huh?

701
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,150
I'm really trying hard, Mom. But...

702
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,230
it's a bit tough...

703
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,790
Here. Let's drink.

704
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,660
Mom, you must be 
so worried about Seo Ah.

705
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,460
I know about Seo Ah's issues.

706
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,960
Yeah.

707
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,910
Pay attention to Seo Ah.

708
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,550
Talk to her a lot, too.

709
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,380
Yes, Mom. I'll do that.

710
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:01,070
Oh, yeah, Mom. In the lobby earlier...

711
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,110
the man who was talking to you.

712
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,760
 What's this about? 

713
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,520
 I'm here for business. 

714
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,280
- Why?
- Huh?

715
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,650
How do you know him?

716
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,400
Well, just...

717
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,080
over business...

718
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,810
I see. It's about work.

719
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,210
Why? Do you know him?

720
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,370
What?

721
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,970
Yes.

722
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,530
How do you know him?

723
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:35,160
I stopped by Jae Hee's 
construction site before.

724
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,730
He was working there.

725
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,410
What did you say?

726
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:42,020
Right. I heard his daughter 
also works at your company.

727
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,580
That man...

728
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,850
Does he still work at 
Jae Hee's construction site?

729
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,760
Well? I'm not sure about that.

730
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:57,070
I kind of think I saw him in front
 of your company building before.

731
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,790
When I asked him in the
 lobby earlier, he said no.

732
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,630
But you know I have good eyes.

733
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,090
I think it was him.

734
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,520
He must be the person.

735
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,330
Mom?

736
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,630
What's wrong?

737
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,780
Oh...

738
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,070
Gosh. Park Pil Hong.

739
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,830
He approached Jae Hee now?

740
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,420
Gosh. That moron...

741
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,220
 Hwang Na Ro, I'm coming in. 

742
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,580
I didn't say you can.

743
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,540
Do you want this room for yourself?

744
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:50,260
What's with your face now?

745
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:52,960
Mind your own business.

746
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,340
This is why you didn't join 
us in the living room.

747
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,910
You pretended to be at work.

748
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,700
Who beat you up?

749
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,260
I don't know who, but

750
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,080
it makes me feel so good.

751
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,670
Did you come to pick a fight?

752
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,090
Why did you pretend not to know?

753
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:12,320
You knew Park Pil Hong 
worked at my site. Why?

754
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,080
To screw you over.

755
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,830
Oh, great.

756
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,560
You should've kept screwing me over. 
Why did you drop hints?

757
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,980
I didn't drop hints.

758
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,010
I didn't know you'd figure that out.

759
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,400
You know, huh?

760
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,310
Why Park Pil Hong is
 circling Chae Woon.

761
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:37,710
He's trying to use Chae Woon
 to rip off big time.

762
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,040
How would I know that?

763
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,080
 Tell me if you know. 

764
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,440
We can't leave him out.

765
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,900
- Let's share.
- We don't have to.

766
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,800
 What do you want me to tell you? 

767
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,760
 Woo Jae Hee. 

768
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,870
 Don't worry about Bit Chae Woon. 
Worry about yourself. 

769
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,730
 He's her father after all. 

770
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:57,210
Do you think Park Pil Hong will do 
something terrible to his daughter?

771
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:03,120
Did you make a deal 
with Park Pil Hong?

772
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,740
Park Pil Hong will pull something 
big using Chae Woon,

773
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,200
and you'll succeed by 
sticking behind Seo Ah.

774
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,590
And what?

775
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,830
Did you agree with Park Pil Hong 
and decide to hide each other?

776
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,020
- Are you even human, punk?
- Get out.

777
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,410
I said, get lost!

778
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,440
Park Pil Hong...

779
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,120
I'm keeping him in check.

780
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,620
I'll be watching you, too.

781
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,000
You sound so confident.

782
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,050
Okay. Work hard.

783
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,270
What's with that ring?

784
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,370
Is it a wedding ring?

785
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,470
This?

786
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,490
Is it?

787
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:56,800
Put some medicine.

788
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:14,830
Gosh, you startled me. Auntie.

789
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,350
We heard everything.

790
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,440
We didn't hear all the details.

791
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,730
We figured out what's going on.

792
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,780
I was right.

793
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,190
Aunt went to medical volunteer
 at the prison last year.

794
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,750
She met Na Ro there.

795
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,620
After she remembered, 
we've been watching him.

796
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,040
Oh, I see.

797
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,990
You found Chae Woon's birth dad?

798
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:44,360
That man, Park Pil Hong or 
whatever. What's he up to?

799
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:48,170
Well, he's working
 at the construction site.

800
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,090
I haven't seen anything 
of concern yet.

801
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,540
Mr. Woo, once you found out 
what Hwang Na Ro is like,

802
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,270
you must've told him
 to move out, huh?

803
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,640
Yes.

804
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,330
Chae Woon found out that Hwang Na Ro
 approached her intentionally.

805
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:04,760
She even told him to move out.

806
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,380
Chae Woon knows that, too?

807
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,760
My gosh.

808
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,590
And Chae Woon kept her 
mouth shut with her family.

809
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,510
She must be so...

810
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:17,160
Geez.

811
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,090
Then...

812
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:22,750
it means Na Ro won't listen to you two 
after saying what you said.

813
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,090
- Yes.
- I got it.

814
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:29,480
I'll talk to him with Hwak Se
 sometime tomorrow.

815
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,500
You might get angry 
while talking to him.

816
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,210
Forget it. I don't care about that.

817
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:36,480
Right. My Jjung-a is so strong.

818
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,980
Aigoo...

819
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:45,220
I know everything.

820
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,460
Let's go inside.

821
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,760
Go ahead.

822
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,760
Congrats, Hyungnim.

823
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,970
Aigoo, well.

824
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:05,640
She says I'm all right.

825
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,870
Bit Chae Woon.

826
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:18,750
Do you like Woo Jae Hee that much?

827
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,880
Then are we going to
 get ready for our wedding?

828
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,650
Wedding...

829
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,560
Yeah.

830
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,420
I said earlier, "Let's get married."

831
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,230
With a gaze that said, 
"Yes, let's do that."

832
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,720
You looked at me like this.

833
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,760
When did I do that?

834
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,160
Geez, you can't change your mind
 after wearing the ring.

835
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:04,170
Let's get married.

836
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:05,870
Let's not complicate things.

837
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,200
Let's prepare quickly 
and live together soon.

838
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,500
Gosh, here we go again.

839
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,040
Oldest daughter instinct.

840
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,640
I want to live with you, too, Koala.

841
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,950
Then that's it. We'll do it.

842
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:21,640
But...

843
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:27,670
my situation is a bit complex right now.

844
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,760
And if I rush into getting married,

845
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,270
I feel like I'm getting
 married to run away.

846
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:40,150
What do you mean by 
getting married to run away?

847
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,080
It's never.

848
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,170
We're so much in love. 
It's the best decision.

849
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,500
As for complex situations...

850
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,650
it will always be.

851
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:55,230
Let's pull our strengths together

852
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:59,070
and work things out.
 Wouldn't that be better?

853
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,610
Mom.

854
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,220
Did you sleep well?

855
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,560
You should sleep more. 
Why did you wake up already?

856
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,290
My eyes just opened up.

857
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:35,270
Let's do it together.

858
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:36,760
Okay.

859
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,900
Chae Woon.

860
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,230
Do you have something 
to say to me?

861
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,530
Huh?

862
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:50,350
You look like you've been thinking 
all night, wanting to say something to me.

863
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,380
What is it? Tell me. Hurry.

864
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,910
Well...

865
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,880
Mom.

866
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,450
Jae Hee and I were...

867
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:08,810
talking about how it 
would be if we got married.

868
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,590
What?

869
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:12,450
Really?

870
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:16,280
You couldn't sleep all night because 
you were thinking about that?

871
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:18,270
A little bit.

872
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,550
Chae Woon, by chance, is this...

873
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:25,080
Did he propose?

874
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,100
My gosh.

875
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:33,120
Congrats, my daughter.

876
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,870
Why are you telling me 
such good news now?

877
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:40,640
You should've told us when
 everyone was together last night.

878
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,140
I wanted to calmly...

879
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,400
discuss this with you first.

880
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,490
- Mom.
- Yeah?

881
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:54,670
Am I rushing into marriage?

882
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,670
Do you love Mr. Woo?

883
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:07,740
When you're together, you're happy

884
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,250
and when you're apart, you miss him?

885
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,700
Yeah.

886
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,020
You always think of him

887
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,910
and he's comforting 
when you struggle?

888
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:20,330
You want to be with him
 for a long time?

889
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,570
Yeah.

890
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,240
Then you should marry him.

891
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:33,270
Chae Woon.

892
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,630
In life...

893
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,910
except for parent and
 child relationship,

894
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:42,300
a relationship with 
precious feelings like that

895
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,890
don't come easily.

896
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:48,270
And on top of that,

897
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,680
if it's a man like Mr. Woo,

898
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,640
it's the best.

899
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,370
But I haven't quite settled
 into my job yet.

900
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:04,240
And various complex situations in
 my life haven't been resolved.

901
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,790
Gosh, you can resolve that in time.

902
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,110
When someone you like 
so much appears,

903
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:12,990
you must hold onto him tightly.

904
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:16,870
My gosh. Gosh, my daughter.

905
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:19,480
Gosh, I'm so happy. Congratulations.

906
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,810
Chae Woon.

907
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:29,160
I feel so weird right here.

908
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,360
I feel so weird.

909
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,700
Why am I so excited?

910
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,350
My gosh.

911
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:38,590
Anyway, how do I treat Mr. Woo now?
 I have to be cautious.

912
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,170
Why?

913
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,790
You should be more relaxed now.

914
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:44,280
- Right?
- Yeah.

915
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:49,510
You have to tell the CEO, too.

916
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:51,360
Yeah, I will.

917
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,160
Okay, hurry up and tell her.

918
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,310
And tell Mr. Woo's parents, too.

919
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,690
Okay.

920
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,870
My daughter. I can't believe you're 
getting married already.

921
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,250
It's so neat to me.

922
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,670
Gosh, seriously.

923
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:11,210
Good morning.

924
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,110
Mr. Woo, did you sleep well?

925
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:14,580
Yes. How can I help?

926
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,690
Aigoo, no.

927
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:18,440
Congratulations, Mr. Woo.

928
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,120
What?

929
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:25,670
Chae Woon just told me.

930
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,010
Your good news.

931
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,490
Gosh.

932
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:32,040
I was going to tell you properly.

933
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,280
Mother.

934
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,500
I'll love her until the day I die.

935
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,830
Please approve, Mother.

936
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,250
Let me bow.

937
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:43,130
Why are you bowing all of a sudden?

938
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,570
Mr. Woo.

939
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:50,700
Thank you so much for
 loving my Chae Woon.

940
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,300
I thank you.

941
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,930
For raising Chae Woon to be so great.

942
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,680
Please love Chae Woon
 a lot in the future.

943
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,520
Yes. I'll love her very much,

944
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,710
and I'll protect you, too, Mother.

945
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:08,490
Thank you.

946
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:14,480
Gosh. I'm so grateful.

947
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,850
- Hello!
- Hello!

948
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,400
- Hello.
- Hi.

949
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,730
He's not here yet?

950
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,860
Good morning, Mr. Woo.

951
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,380
Mr. Lee.

952
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,500
Did you worry that
 I might've run away?

953
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,660
Yes.

954
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,360
You finally discovered my charm.

955
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:40,970
Good morning.

956
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:43,170
Hello.

957
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,050
Good morning, Bit Chae Woon.

958
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:53,120
You look good.

959
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,830
People should sleep
 in their own house.

960
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:58,660
Right.

961
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,130
You look good, too, Director.

962
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,050
Yeah. I'm really good.

963
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:07,170
There was someone I hated at home.

964
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,990
She left yesterday.

965
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,230
I'm happy that you're happy, Director.

966
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:22,070
Geez.

967
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,610
I have to kick her out 
of the company, too.

968
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,130
 You should tell the CEO, too. 

969
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:51,250
 The man who was talking
 to you earlier in the lobby. 

970
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,850
 I stopped by Jae Hee's 
construction site before. 

971
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:56,460
 He was working there. 

972
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,900
 Mom, I have something to tell you. 

973
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,270
 I'd like to see you 
outside of the building. 

974
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,190
 Really? 

975
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:19,490
 I have to go out. 

976
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,220
 Let's talk later. 

977
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,780
 Okay. I'll see you later. 

978
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:37,030
Congratulations on your promotion.

979
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,530
Thanks.

980
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:53,640
I held back because I didn't 
want to ask you at home.

981
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:57,190
Why did you let me know that

982
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:59,390
the CEO was meeting Park Pil Hong?

983
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,880
My innocent feelings for you?

984
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,530
I thought you'd want to 
meet your birth dad.

985
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,820
You know about Park Pil Hong, right?

986
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,780
How do you know him?

987
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:16,690
How did you know him?

988
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,880
Well?

989
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,760
No comment.

990
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:45,630
 Well? 

991
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:47,970
 No comment. 

992
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:03,760
He's so good at sewing. Look.

993
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,990
Whoa, he's really good.

994
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,100
The next structure over...

995
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,580
Open this side.

996
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,430
- Here, too?
- Yeah, there, too.

997
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,600
How about we open this side?

998
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:28,800
- Do that.
- Okay.

999
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:34,040
CEO.

1000
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:57,170
Mr. Lee! I'm here for your coffee.

1001
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:01,580
Oh, CEO...

1002
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,380
Chae Woon.

1003
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:16,970
Mother.

1004
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:19,670
Are you here to see Jae Hee?

1005
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:22,400
Yes. I was at the storefront in the area.

1006
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,560
Are you here to meet Jae Hee?

1007
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,970
Yeah.

1008
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,820
He works with Jae Hee.

1009
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,910
He makes great coffee,

1010
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:37,050
and he sewed this for me, too.

1011
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,060
Hello.

1012
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,400
Your superior at work?

1013
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,120
It's my mom.

1014
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,880
Really?

1015
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,680
No wonder. I thought 
you two looked alike.

1016
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:56,720
Wow, you're both so beautiful.

1017
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:01,130
Mother. Come this way, please.

1018
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:03,140
Wait.

1019
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,220
Mr. Lee, were you sick?

1020
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:10,730
I heard Jae Hee talking to you.

1021
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:12,450
I heard you left work early.

1022
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:15,100
Well, I had some personal 
matter to tend to.

1023
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,740
What a relief.

1024
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,680
My gosh.

1025
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,600
- Were you busy?
- How could that man be here?

1026
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,070
Mother.

1027
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:27,120
I know everything.

1028
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:31,780
That he's Park Pil Hong.

1029
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,860
What?

1030
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:40,720
I'm so embarrassed to face you.

1031
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,080
No, Mother.

1032
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,910
I know.

1033
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:48,330
- Well...
- As for Chae Woon...

1034
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,540
She has no idea.

1035
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,170
Mom, I'm sorry.

1036
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:55,830
I was so happy to see Mr. Lee.

1037
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:57,430
Mr. Lee?

1038
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:00,540
Mr. Lee Dong Chool. Him.

1039
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:05,260
It's cold here.

1040
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:06,690
I'll take you somewhere warm.

1041
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:09,420
No, Jae Hee. I should get back.

1042
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:10,720
After a meeting,

1043
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,380
I was passing by. 
I stopped by to see you.

1044
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,750
I have something to tell you, too.

1045
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:18,890
I'd like to tell you since you're here.

1046
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:23,640
Chae Woon said she wanted 
to talk to me earlier, too.

1047
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,180
Is it the same topic?

1048
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,880
Yes.

1049
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,040
Get married?

1050
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,190
Yes.

1051
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:39,410
We wanted to discuss with
 you about us getting married.

1052
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:41,690
Get married...

1053
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,430
Did you tell Soon Jung, too?

1054
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:47,410
Yes, this morning.

1055
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,820
I had to think it through, 
so I couldn't tell her right away.

1056
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:01,230
It's unexpected.

1057
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:02,680
I was planning to...

1058
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:06,970
send you to study overseas at the end 
of this year or next year.

1059
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:11,550
I haven't done much for 
you as your mom.

1060
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:17,070
But is there a need to
 rush into marriage?

1061
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:20,700
Jae Hee, sorry.

1062
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,940
I like you, Jae Hee.

1063
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:27,250
But I need to consider 
Chae Woon's future.

1064
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:30,070
Yes, I understand, Mother.

1065
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:35,570
I didn't know you had
 such a plan for me, Mom.

1066
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:37,300
Thank you.

1067
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:41,290
Of course, I want to study overseas.

1068
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:44,330
That's been my dream 
since my childhood.

1069
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:49,580
But I think I can study even 
after getting married.

1070
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:54,360
I was going to continue studying 
while working anyway.

1071
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,910
Women all think that.

1072
01:03:57,910 --> 01:04:00,570
And it seems like you can do that, too.

1073
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,250
I was like that, too.

1074
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:06,350
But the reality isn't that easy.

1075
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:08,010
You know that, right?

1076
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,690
Yes.

1077
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:16,510
You two could be taken aback since
 I'm bringing this up so suddenly.

1078
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:20,060
I have no intention of 
opposing you two dating and

1079
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:22,860
getting married at all.

1080
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,650
It's just that...

1081
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,960
rather than rushing into marriage,

1082
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:31,510
I want you to pursue your dream
 in a bigger world.

1083
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,620
And...

1084
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:40,220
 You must be worried
 about Seo Ah, too. 

1085
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:42,210
Sorry...

1086
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:45,790
that I can't take this simply 
and be happy for you.

1087
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:49,270
Let's think about this a little more.

1088
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,240
Yes, Mother.

1089
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,140
I'll get going first.

1090
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:01,900
You two, talk more.

1091
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:10,770
I'll get going, too. I have to
 go to other storefronts.

1092
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,270
I have to go to my vendor.

1093
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:17,790
Mother, I'll get going first.

1094
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:19,450
Okay, Jae Hee.

1095
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:21,060
Bye.

1096
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:33,000
You couldn't sleep well
 last night, huh?

1097
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,090
A little bit.

1098
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,840
Seo Yeon.

1099
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:43,070
Yes.

1100
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,950
No. I'll go ahead.

1101
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:51,590
Okay.

1102
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:19,970
 Did you come looking for Mr. Lee? 

1103
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:24,010
 You keep staring at 
Mr. Lee from earlier. 

1104
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:26,930
 Why don't you spread your
 imagination about that man? 

1105
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:34,930
 Na Ro, you know about 
Park Pil Hong, huh? 

1106
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:36,380
 Well? 

1107
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:39,100
 No comment. 

1108
01:06:57,410 --> 01:07:00,800
Bit Chae Woon should be
 slowly catching on by now.

1109
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:03,670
Who Park Pil Hong is.

1110
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:12,730
I guess you plan on being
 happy with Woo Jae Hee.

1111
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:15,510
Feel some pain before then.

1112
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,400
Ms. Lee.

1113
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,680
Hi, Mr. Yoo.

1114
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,480
Mr. Woo just left.

1115
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,390
He had to meet with a vendor.

1116
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:35,860
Yes.

1117
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,720
I came to see Mr. Lee.

1118
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,180
Oh, I see.

1119
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:15,870
Ms. Lee, you're back.

1120
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:18,200
Mr. Woo just left.

1121
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,570
I heard.

1122
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:24,860
Would you like some coffee?

1123
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,150
Why...

1124
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:34,170
It's you, right?

1125
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:36,580
What?

1126
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:42,570
Park Pil Hong.

1127
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:46,120
What...

1128
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,730
What are you talking about?

1129
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:52,080
It's you, right?

1130
01:08:54,450 --> 01:09:00,140
♫  Did you forget? 
Did you forget about me?  ♫

1131
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:05,770
♫  Did you forget all those memories  ♫

1132
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:11,380
♫  My heart is opening arms to you  ♫

1133
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:16,720
♫  I'm barely going through today  ♫

1134
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:22,670
♫  When the memories are fading  ♫

1135
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:29,070
♫  I stand on the street where
 we walked together  ♫

1136
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,690
 

1137
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:32,970
 Why are you dealing 
with Park Pil Hong? 

1138
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:34,550
 Does he have something
 over your head? 

1139
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:36,800
 Seo Yeon, I'll be successful 

1140
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,480
 and appear before you. 

1141
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,990
 Isn't it daebak? 

1142
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:42,870
 They called because 
they liked my styling. 

1143
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:44,090
 To you? 

1144
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:45,840
 They're trying to scout you. 

1145
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,030
 To be honest, you're not selling much. 

1146
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:49,840
 I heard you're marrying Jae Hee oppa. 

1147
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,420
 Your obsession for Jae Hee oppa. 
That's not love. 

1148
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,390
 How dare you lecture me? 

1149
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:57,440
 How far is true with you? 

1150
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,790
 That I like Samgwang Villa. 

1151
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:00,330
 For someone trashy like me, 

1152
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:04,560
 for the first and the last time, 
it felt like home. 

1153
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,200
♫  I'm trying to erase it 
again and again  ♫
