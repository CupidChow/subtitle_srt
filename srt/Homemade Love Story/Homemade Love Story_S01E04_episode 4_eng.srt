1
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,290
 
Who do you think you are 
telling me to go home?

2
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,160
Mom almost died because of you.

3
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,560
Crazy. Why is that my fault?

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,200
She was trying to sneak food

5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,710
and she got caught and fainted. 
How is that my fault?

6
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,710
This isn't the first time.

7
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,990
From what I remember, 
it's the fifth...

8
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,500
It's the seventh time.

9
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,830
"Don't eat expensive food, 
be frugal with good food."

10
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,440
You always hound her
 with your nagging.

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,790
She'd go into a shock,

12
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,340
get chocked, and end up in the ER.

13
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,850
This is the seventh time!

14
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,620
What? Seventh time?

15
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,620
Choking on dried persimmon 
at your aunt's

16
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,740
wasn't my fault. 
It was their dog Happy.

17
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,470
Was it Mary?

18
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,920
Anyway, because that 
tiny dog kept yapping.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,270
You still do remember, I guess.

20
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,910
I'm smarter than you, man.

21
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,170
If you're smart,

22
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,120
why do you act as
 if you have amnesia

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,310
whenever I bring up 
my friend Beom Jin?

24
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,090
I begged you.

25
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,800
I pleaded with you, asking you to 
help my friend Beom Jin's family.

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,940
You ignored me.

27
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,350
And then Beom Jin's
 father passed away.

28
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,240
If someone heard you,
 they'd think I killed that man.

29
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,880
Just because he lost his business,

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,060
how can a head of a household

31
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,780
behave so cowardly like that?

32
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,560
This is why I hate you, Father.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,240
You have no idea 
how to be regretful.

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,670
You don't know how to apologize.

35
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,400
You only care about 
your own ambition.

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,330
You never take a look around you.

37
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,640
You're the only one who is right, 
and everyone else is wrong.

38
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,550
That's right. That's who I am.

39
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,550
What will you do about it? What?

40
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,030
Why is that so bad?

41
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,550
I raised you with all 
my care for 20 years,

42
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,900
yet you say you want
 to severe our ties

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,540
and left home in the middle of 
the night in your underwear.

44
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,730
How dare you ramble 
on like this now?

45
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,910
Shut up!

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,100
Shut up?

47
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,560
Mom, are you okay?

48
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,730
Woo Jae Hee.

49
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,880
What are you doing 
here right now?

50
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,490
You're the one who 
abandoned me

51
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,420
and left home for
 your own survival.

52
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,090
Why are you rambling
 on so much?

53
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,470
Am I a kid?

54
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,610
Am I a kid...

55
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,310
whom you have to protect 
screaming at him like that?

56
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,510
I'm just upset you fainted.

57
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,250
I get startled easily.

58
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,130
I got startled easily,
 even as a child.

59
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,080
My nickname was Jumpy.

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,020
Why are you throwing
 a fuss over this?

61
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,780
This is embarrassing.

62
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,050
Mom.

63
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,560
I said forget it, but you kept insisting
 on buying me those macarons.

64
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,160
Let's go in, Honey. It's cold out.

65
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,330
Aigoo.

66
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,440
She's alive.

67
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,430
She's so strong.

68
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,210
Wait, wait, wait.

69
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,210
Careful.

70
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,180
Go, punk.

71
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,290
 

72
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,100
 

73
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,740
 

74
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,650
  The customer is not answering the 
phone. You'll be connected... 

75
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,300
Mom, come on.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,500
Mom.

77
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,800
Chae Woon.

78
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,220
You're home.

79
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,990
Gosh.

80
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,680
Why are you outside? It's late.

81
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,020
Aigoo, I was worried about you.

82
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,990
What?

83
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,300
Did you drink?

84
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,620
A little bit.

85
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,650
Gosh, we should drink together.

86
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,070
What are these guys up to?

87
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,550
When you're standing 
here in the cold...

88
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,620
Aigoo, come on.

89
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,670
Chae Woon.

90
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,650
I'm really sorry about earlier.

91
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,340
No, Mom.

92
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,920
I'm the one sorry...

93
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,250
Gosh...

94
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,700
Aigoo, what an idiot.

95
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,670
I was just trying to help 
you out somehow...

96
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,660
 Your mother treated me 
with such warmth. 

97
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,450
I put you on the spot, huh?

98
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,320
You were embarrassed, huh?

99
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,270
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,500
Mom, why are you...

101
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,900
always so sorry?

102
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,740
It was my fault.

103
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,250
I was the one who 
was rude to you.

104
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,250
Why would you be sorry? Why?

105
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,350
No, why would you, Chae Woon?

106
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,220
I didn't think through...

107
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,150
I heard you met that ahjumma.

108
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,030
That ahjumma...

109
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,330
saying it was my mom 
who came to our house.

110
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,790
Huh?

111
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,860
Gosh, that ahjumma...

112
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,960
She promised me
 not to tell you that.

113
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,070
Gosh.

114
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,090
Serving her tea and fruit...

115
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,980
I heard you treated her 
with utmost care.

116
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,020
Hey, no. Not even.

117
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,130
It was just a cold day,

118
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,520
- so I made some citron tea...
- Mom, why...

119
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,220
Do you even have any feelings?

120
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,590
I betrayed you...

121
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,770
and searched for my birth parents. 
Aren't you even disappointed?

122
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,400
Don't you hate me for that?

123
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,700
No. Chae Woon, why would I be
 disappointed about that?

124
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,950
That could happen.

125
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,410
And I totally understand
 how you feel.

126
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,620
Come on!

127
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,850
Why are you always
 so understanding?

128
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,860
Why are you always so sorry, and

129
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,670
why do you feel sorry for everyone,

130
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,930
and how is everything your fault?

131
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,170
You're so upset because of me.

132
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,090
You're so hurt, but why 
do you always...

133
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,790
Hey!

134
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,900
- Man Jung!
- Why else?

135
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,520
Why else?

136
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,270
- Auntie!
- Why else? She's an idiot!

137
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,500
Your mom is an idiot 
and a pushover!

138
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,180
Your mom is an idiot 
and a pushover!

139
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,890
That's why she took in 
a rude girl like you! Got that?

140
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,350
- Got that?
- Man Jung!

141
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,510
Don't do this!

142
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,360
Mom, you hit her on the nose.

143
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,300
Why... why are you doing
 this to my daughter?

144
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,800
Who the heck are you?

145
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,700
Who the heck are you to
 hit my daughter? Why?

146
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,920
Mom, Mom.

147
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,160
Let's go inside. People are looking.

148
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,320
It's tough to find tenants as is.

149
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,400
They'll think we fight all the time.

150
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,610
Let's go in.

151
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,040
Gosh. Chae Woon.

152
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,330
Auntie, are you okay?

153
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,060
I'm fine.

154
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,750
I'm a doctor.

155
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,000
Huh?

156
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,490
Hey, Bit Chae Woon. 
You're just going in?

157
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,030
You can care less
 after throwing a bomb?

158
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,130
Hae Deun.

159
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,470
Chae Woon, go in.

160
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,640
You should apologize to Mom.

161
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,870
Why are you so pissed off anyway?

162
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,580
Because your win was revoked?

163
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,000
Because you can't go to the US?

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,260
Or because you couldn't 
find your birth parents?

165
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,770
Hae Deun, gosh...

166
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,390
I see. Because you can't 
escape this house?

167
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,760
Hey, why are you
 starting another fight?

168
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,490
Did you think we didn't know?

169
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,050
You put up a note saying, 
"Escape" in front of your desk,

170
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,310
and you've been counting 
down the days.

171
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,770
Do you hate this family that much?

172
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,280
Do you hate us that much?

173
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,680
We're not zombies, you know.

174
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,470
This isn't Shawshank. Why put 
up a note saying "Escape"?

175
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,750
- So ridiculous!
- Hae Deun, come on.

176
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,310
You're in trouble. Come here.

177
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,730
Yeah!

178
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,140
This is my Shawshank.

179
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,660
This is Alcatraz, an inferno.

180
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,760
You guys are the zombies.

181
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,450
You're the load on my back. 
Bringing me down!

182
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,880
- Gosh...
- Mom.

183
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,150
Hey!

184
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,300
You sure picked a day to fight.

185
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,010
Ever since my childhood 
up until now,

186
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,430
do you know how sick
 and tired I was?

187
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,100
Mom is always so 
kind and sweet that

188
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,630
she always got fooled and
 taken advantage of.

189
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,950
To pay off all that debt,

190
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,100
while Mom worked
 as a live-in maid,

191
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,590
I had to take care of you two

192
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,090
ever since I was eight.

193
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,100
Do you know how hard, frustrated,

194
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,140
scared, and annoyed I was?

195
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,410
So, was that it, Unni?

196
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,800
You never said anything
 like that. Why now?

197
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,350
Who would I tell?

198
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,840
Who would I say these things to?

199
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,120
Should I have said this to Mom, 
who says "Sorry" all the time?

200
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,110
Or to you two who 
are so immature?

201
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,120
Until Ra Hoon became
 a sixth-grader,

202
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,700
he was always sick

203
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,250
as if he'd die the next day, 
taking a bunch of medicine.

204
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,490
I had to carry him on my back and 
run to the hospital all the time.

205
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,010
Every morning, 
my heart would drop

206
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,640
feeling for his breath with 
my finger under his nose.

207
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,690
Do you know how scary it was?

208
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,080
- Noona. 
- I got it, Bit Chae Woon.

209
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,680
I got it. So, stop.

210
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,860
Must you see your mom faint?

211
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,240
Auntie, stay out of it.

212
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,440
You know you're the one who took
 advantage of Mom the most, right?

213
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,840
Mom worked so hard 
to make you a doctor

214
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,160
and gave you money to 
open a clinic. But so what?

215
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,020
You always lose everything,

216
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,620
and you keep coming back here.

217
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,120
- Hey, you!
- Please...

218
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,760
Lee Hae Deun.

219
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,820
Since middle school, you were flippant 
about becoming an idol trainee.

220
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,200
You were full of hot air,

221
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,300
going around all over the place.

222
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,530
The ahjussis who came to
 get their money from Mom

223
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,120
said they'd take my pretty 
little sister and sell you off.

224
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,210
Do you know how scared I was?

225
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,600
I was so afraid that they'd barge in

226
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,880
in the middle of the night
 and steal you away.

227
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Do you know how scared I was?

228
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,700
Why are you telling me that now?

229
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,130
You always tell me,

230
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,430
"Girl, get lost!"

231
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,730
That's what you always say.

232
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,290
And just because they sell me off,

233
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,480
do you think I'd let that happen?

234
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,350
Do you think I'd just take that?

235
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,340
Gosh, you're always so rude to me.

236
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,000
But you sure were writing 
a fantasy drama in your head!

237
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,250
Okay, stop.

238
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,520
Stop! Stop now!

239
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,740
Why are you doing this?

240
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,950
Why are you guys doing this?

241
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,170
Why are you guys fighting and crying?

242
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,500
I told you I hate this the most.

243
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,840
Let go.

244
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,800
Okay.

245
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,410
Everyone, shut your mouth.

246
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,080
Disperse!

247
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,610
Mom.

248
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,880
Mom, are you all right?

249
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,290
I'm going to sleep.

250
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,920
I'm tired.

251
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,230
Should I sing you a lullaby?

252
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,000
You didn't wash your feet, huh?

253
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,390
I washed earlier.

254
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,360
Wash them again. They smell.

255
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,420
Okay.

256
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,040
Goodnight.

257
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,280
Unni.

258
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,680
Mom said to shut our mouths.

259
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,800
Noona, do my feet still stink?

260
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,610
I can't breathe. Go.

261
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,860
Gosh. I can't have swollen eyes.

262
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,120
I can't get rid of the stench
 from running deliveries.

263
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,350
 Every morning, my heart would drop 

264
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,520
 feeling for his breath with
 my finger under his nose. 

265
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,250
 Do you know how scary it was? 

266
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,100
Chae Woon noona...

267
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:28,400
♫  I remember that trail  ♫

268
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:38,700
♫  Wearing the flower ring 
you made for me  ♫

269
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,040
♫  Lovingly hand in hand  ♫

270
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,370
♫  Strolling down the trail  ♫

271
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:59,300
♫  Now it's all in the past  ♫

272
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:07,800
♫  It's a beautiful memory  ♫

273
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:26,100
♫  I remember that beach  ♫

274
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:36,600
♫  The sand castle I built with you  ♫

275
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:48,400
♫  Even that beach where the
 waves used to crash in  ♫

276
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:56,780
♫  Now it's all in the past  ♫

277
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:05,900
♫  It's a beautiful memory  ♫

278
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,010
Are you okay?

279
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,390
You should be.

280
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,680
They gave you good medicine. 
You should be fine.

281
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,980
I'll buy you ten macarons tomorrow.

282
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,570
I saw earlier in the kitchen that

283
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,140
Jae Hee didn't buy them 
from an expensive place.

284
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,270
I know where they sell 
expensive macarons.

285
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,940
I'll get them for you from there.

286
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,820
Aigoo, it's so sweet that
 it makes you squint.

287
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,490
Why were you hiding 
while eating that?

288
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,270
Did you think I'd take 
that from you?

289
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,960
As you know, I don't like sweets.

290
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,570
Do you know how bad
 sweets are for you?

291
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,470
Especially eating sweets
 before bed...

292
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,330
That's like poison.

293
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,880
You can get cavities,

294
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,500
raises your sugar level. 
That's not all.

295
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,250
You get fat. Then, you 
get a potbelly...

296
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,660
Geez...

297
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,230
Seriously.

298
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,900
Come on.

299
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,590
What?

300
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,100
Come on.

301
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,190
Come on, what?

302
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,600
Are you sick?

303
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,070
Are you hurting again?

304
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,660
How are you hurting? You took 
an expensive medicine.

305
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,780
Come on.

306
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,100
Come on, shut up.

307
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,100
Wh... what?

308
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,940
Gosh, so noisy.

309
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,770
Hey.

310
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,110
Hey.

311
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,680
What?

312
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,500
 

313
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,500
 Auntie, stay out of it. 

314
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,410
 You know you're the one who took
 advantage of Mom the most, right? 

315
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,480
 Mom worked so hard to
 make you a doctor 

316
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,690
 and gave you money to 
open a clinic. But so what? 

317
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,550
 You always lose everything, 

318
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,760
 and you keep coming back here. 

319
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,650
That terrible wench.

320
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,310
She poured salt on my wound.

321
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,100
Let's go home...

322
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,290
Aunt.

323
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,420
Your nose.

324
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,490
Did you get into a fight?

325
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,510
Did that person die?

326
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,240
Go.

327
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,330
Uncle.

328
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,800
Kim Hwak Se.

329
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,560
Hey!

330
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,010
I finished them all.

331
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,520
Uncle...

332
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,400
I beg you.

333
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,940
Two more beers, please.

334
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,650
You know I can't speak English.

335
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,580
Gosh, I'm done.

336
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,320
I'm sorry.

337
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,290
I need two more bottles of beer.

338
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,220
Uncle, please buy me some.

339
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,800
I'll be sure to pay you 
back tomorrow.

340
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,600
I can keep my promise, Uncle.

341
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,910
I really don't have any money.

342
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,830
I have to go now.

343
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,300
Uncle! Then...

344
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,160
I'd like to ask you for one
 more bottle of beer.

345
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,370
If you have no money, 
leave your ID.

346
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,230
Geez...

347
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,600
I just feel sorry for 
Soon Jung noonim.

348
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,900
Hey.

349
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,740
Are you on the same team
 with Bit Chae Woon?

350
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,050
Huh?

351
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,030
Do you also think...

352
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,850
I'm taking advantage 
of Soon Jung unni?

353
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,980
Right?

354
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,140
Is that true or not? Answer me.

355
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,970
- Is it or not?
- It's true.

356
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,550
Hey!

357
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,600
Hey, I ought to!

358
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,920
Hwak Se, move out.

359
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,570
You should move out. Move out.

360
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,340
You. This won't do.

361
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,480
Move out!

362
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,060
I can't sleep because of you.

363
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,230
Move out!

364
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,100
What gives you the right?

365
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,960
You're the one who
 should move out!

366
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,840
Geez, I told you!

367
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,300
I told you not to call me "Aunt."

368
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,630
How many times did I tell you that?

369
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,980
I asked you not to 
call me "Aunt."

370
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,950
You call my sister "Unni," but

371
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,390
why do you call me "Aunt"?

372
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,940
- Don't call me that!
- Is this the police station?

373
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,690
Is that a police station? 
Good evening.

374
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,800
We're in front of 
a jokbal restaurant.

375
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,320
There's some drunkard...

376
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,470
A drunk...

377
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,200
There's a drunk lady here.

378
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,630
Please take her away quickly.

379
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,680
Yes. Very, very far away.

380
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,530
You'd better hang up that phone.

381
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,480
I'm going to go home right now.

382
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,040
I'm fine.

383
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,750
I'm going home.

384
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,120
I'm fine.

385
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, my.

386
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,910
Hey, what are you doing here?

387
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,510
I was worried about 
Chae Woon noona.

388
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,810
You, too?

389
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,530
No. Why would I?

390
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,310
I was going to the bathroom.

391
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,590
I know you're worried about her.

392
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,830
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

393
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,290
What are you doing? It's noisy.

394
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,820
Chae Woon noona.

395
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,090
I wanted to talk to you.

396
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,930
You, too?

397
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,450
No. Not me.

398
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,580
Noona.

399
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,380
We didn't know...

400
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,990
that you were struggling so much.

401
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,570
I didn't know you struggled so
 much because I was sick.

402
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,820
Of course, you didn't know.

403
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,610
If you guys were keen,

404
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,370
you would've made something 
out of your life already.

405
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,920
Even though I didn't 
accomplish much,

406
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,950
Ra Hoon is a Seohan 
University student.

407
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,100
- Hey, is that important?
- Yup.

408
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Well, I'm proud of you for that.

409
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,420
Go to sleep.

410
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,470
- Stop bothering me.
- Goodnight.

411
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,260
Geez, Bit Chae Woon.

412
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,190
I just can't be nice to
 her even if I tried.

413
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,190
- Geez!
- Stop it.

414
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,730
Why?

415
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,710
Did Auntie Man Jung
 come home?

416
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,220
That's right.

417
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,360
She ran off with her 
nosebleed earlier.

418
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,410
Could she be collapsed
 somewhere on the street?

419
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,300
I'll... I'll go and check.

420
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,610
- Hey, Bit Chae Woon! 
- Auntie!

421
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,460
- Let's go. 
- We're here.

422
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,000
- Auntie!
- She's so heavy.

423
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,930
- Thank you, sir. I'll get down.
- Be careful.

424
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,320
I'll get down.

425
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,370
Auntie!

426
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,050
I'm sorry.

427
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,970
- Hey, my legs are asleep!
- Auntie!

428
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,320
- Wait, wait.
- Come to your senses!

429
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,090
The other foot. Over here. Here.

430
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,000
- Did you black out?
- No, I didn't.

431
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,260
Press down.

432
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,000
- Wake up, Auntie.
- Uncle, you should've called me.

433
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,480
 

434
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,380
 

435
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,290
 I'll offer you an intern position.
 

436
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,360
Bit Chae Woon.

437
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,410
Let's not grovel.

438
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,510
Don't be like that.

439
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,960
Do you like it?

440
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,090
Huh?

441
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,240
You always said we 
eat too extravagantly.

442
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,740
I prepared the way you like.

443
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,100
Yes, yes. It's nice.

444
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,530
Right. We should've 
done this sooner.

445
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,700
Ahjumma, water, please.

446
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Ahjumma quit.

447
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,810
She couldn't handle 
you much longer.

448
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,240
What?

449
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,560
Geez, I was so good to her.

450
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,470
Really?

451
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,760
What?

452
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,170
You really think...

453
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,860
you were good to ahjumma?

454
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
What's wrong with you 
early in the morning?

455
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,810
Why are you so snappy?

456
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,400
Maybe it's the expensive
 medicine at the ER last night.

457
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,590
It worked out.

458
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,900
You didn't want to waste any 
money on the housekeeper.

459
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,300
Let's not hire anyone 
while we're at it.

460
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,430
So...

461
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,450
you think you can do that?

462
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,890
Can you do it alone?

463
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,300
All those ancestral
 ceremonies and

464
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,370
family events that 
occur every month.

465
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,920
How about you?

466
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,240
Do you think you can
 go at it alone?

467
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Well, as for me,

468
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,960
the muscles in my body
 are made for labor.

469
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,360
I have no problem doing
 simple house chores.

470
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,350
That's good.

471
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,470
Where did I put it?

472
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,460
Unni, give me some eye cream.

473
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,580
Hey, have you seen my phone?

474
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,700
No.

475
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,800
Did I leave it in the living room?

476
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,270
- Noona, good morning.
- Hey.

477
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,970
You just realized that
 you lost your phone?

478
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,890
That's something.

479
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,140
Her cellphone?

480
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,180
 

481
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,760
 

482
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,550
Hae Deun.

483
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,180
It's ringing.

484
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,690
But no one is answering.

485
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,780
  The customer is not 
answering the phone.  

486
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,570
Gwacheon?

487
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,980
- Whoa.
- Gwa...

488
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,180
Why is your phone over there?

489
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,880
Oh, my. Hey, what's this?

490
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,310
There's...

491
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,540
stuff like this? So neat.

492
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,900
You're a freelancer. 
Your phone is your lifeline.

493
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,410
Noona, you never know.

494
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,260
Back up anything 
important and wipe it clean.

495
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,310
Yeah, I'm doing it.

496
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,940
Geez, this is crazy.

497
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,480
I still have so much to
 pay off on that phone.

498
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,430
Gosh, how can you do that now?

499
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,920
You lost it last night.

500
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,140
Shut up, Hae Deun.

501
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,550
Aigoo, hey, hey.

502
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,420
I'm sure someone kind will 
find it and return it to you.

503
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,200
Gosh, my mom and her optimism.

504
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,110
Hey, hurry up and come.

505
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,180
Let's eat breakfast. Hurry.

506
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,310
Come. Let's eat breakfast.

507
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,120
Gwacheon?

508
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,420
My stomach...

509
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,800
Good morning.

510
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,620
Are you okay?

511
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,030
You drank so much last night.

512
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,330
Don't be too embarrassed.

513
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,460
I see people like you...

514
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,030
every night.

515
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,750
Is there a problem?

516
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,340
I can have a few drinks alone 
if I'm stressed out.

517
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,420
You're stodgier than you look.

518
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,660
A few?

519
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,350
A few?

520
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,700
Don't you remember last night?

521
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,340
- Last night at jokbal place...
- Wait a minute.

522
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,100
I guess you want to
 continue this conversation,

523
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,820
but I haven't washed up nor brushed 
my teeth yet, as you can see.

524
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,520
Let's talk later.

525
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,100
You don't remember?

526
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,900
Are you nuts?

527
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,800
Geez, my money.

528
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,200
Score! I saved my money.

529
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:16,120
Auntie, is your stomach
 feeling better?

530
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,430
Why? I'm feeling fine, to begin with.

531
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,490
Gosh, I shouldn't eat so much
 salt early in the morning.

532
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,890
How is your nose?

533
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,650
I'm fine.

534
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,220
I'm sorry.

535
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,440
I didn't mean to hit you.

536
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,190
So then...

537
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,980
did you hit her?

538
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,970
Whoa, you hit her real good.

539
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,230
The upstairs room and the basement
 haven't rented out yet?

540
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,720
Yeah, a few people 
came by to look,

541
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,310
but they're not calling back.

542
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,460
I posted online, too.

543
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,850
Hey, did you ask around 
at your school?

544
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,820
Huh?

545
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,780
You didn't, huh? 
I said to ask around.

546
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,410
I did ask.

547
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,450
I asked around, but

548
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,400
their lease hasn't expired yet.

549
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,910
I also asked all the 
stores I work at,

550
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,670
but there's no one these days.

551
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,240
Gosh, everyone...

552
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,910
is dying to kick me out.

553
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,670
You're quick.

554
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,250
What do you mean kick you out?

555
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,920
Aren't you going back 
to Jeju Island soon?

556
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,300
I should go. I will.

557
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,500
Gosh, I'm sure we'll 
get more tenants.

558
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,800
For the basement room,

559
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,180
I hung a pair of scissors
 by the door.

560
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,720
For a new tenant to move in soon.

561
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,420
Noonim.

562
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,930
I put coins in the shoe rack.

563
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,790
- That's great, Hwak Se.
- What in the world?

564
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,040
Aigoo, that's right.

565
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,540
Let's all relax.

566
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,010
There are ups and downs.

567
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,160
Yes, yes.

568
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,210
When things are down, 
it's bound to go up.

569
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,030
There are ups and downs.

570
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,720
Oh, yeah!

571
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,570
 Woo-hoo! 

572
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,300
Aigoo, gosh.

573
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,600
Here, eat.

574
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,250
Chae Woon.

575
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,950
You're without your cellphone.

576
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,760
Take mine with you.

577
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,210
No. I'll wait a little longer.

578
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,530
I'll buy a used phone.

579
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,900
Aigoo.

580
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,970
Nothing's working out.

581
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:48,110
What do you mean?

582
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,000
Everything will work out.

583
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,400
Wait.

584
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,700
 Mom has a few... 

585
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,700
 - superstitions she came up with. 
- Blow.

586
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,700
 This is one of them. 

587
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,610
Blow it.

588
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,010
This is from when
 I was the happiest...

589
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,750
They're petals you dried 
when you were happiest.

590
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,580
If you blow this and it goes far, 
good luck will come your way.

591
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,330
That's right.

592
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,770
Here. Blow.

593
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,230
 If you blow the petals she dried 

594
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,910
 between her book pages when
 she was at her happiest, 

595
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,980
 good luck will come to you again. 

596
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,750
 My mom's cute superstition. 

597
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,690
 As for it's effectiveness... 

598
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,120
 I'm not sure. 

599
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,380
  - The customer is not answering... 
- That's weird.

600
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,490
If she suggested we work together,

601
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,620
shouldn't she wait by her phone?

602
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,430
Ms. Lee still isn't 
answering her phone?

603
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,490
No.

604
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,110
Geez, I was going to be 
a bearer of good news.

605
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,160
This Headbutt doesn't 
have the right attitude.

606
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,030
Let's just call Mr. Huh from
 Bulgwangdong. I'll call him.

607
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,260
Hey, she answered.

608
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,630
Hello?

609
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,870
- Headbutt.
- Hey, Mr. Woo!

610
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,980
Don't call her "Headbutt."

611
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,500
Ms. Lee?

612
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,000
Why aren't you 
answering your phone?

613
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,580
Hello.

614
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,080
 Hello? 

615
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,730
Who are you?

616
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,580
Yes.

617
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,680
If I don't want to grovel,

618
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,780
I should work on Koala.

619
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,140
Okay.

620
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,559
My goodness.

621
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,509
Headbutt is hopeless.

622
00:34:48,509 --> 00:34:50,359
You found this at a bar, right?

623
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:51,859
No, on the street.

624
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,199
On the street? Geez.

625
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,039
The owner didn't even
 call the phone, right?

626
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,549
She probably doesn't 
even know she lost it.

627
00:34:57,549 --> 00:34:59,559
- I'll get going.
- Wait.

628
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:01,779
Have a cup of tea. 
You went out of your way.

629
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:03,229
Yes, please. Have a seat.

630
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:04,829
No, thank you.

631
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:07,389
Aigoo, you've come all this way.

632
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:08,519
Have some tea.

633
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:11,919
It makes me happy 
that there is still

634
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:14,189
a model citizen.

635
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,979
I'm busy.

636
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:18,489
Good day.

637
00:35:20,029 --> 00:35:21,439
Wait...

638
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:24,959
Why is he running off like that?

639
00:35:52,009 --> 00:35:53,009
Geez.

640
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:54,809
Who brought this to you?

641
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:57,539
He left just now. 
Didn't you see him?

642
00:35:57,539 --> 00:35:58,919
Just now?

643
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:30,129
Did you meet him?

644
00:36:30,129 --> 00:36:31,629
No.

645
00:36:31,629 --> 00:36:34,399
Geez, I couldn't even thank him.

646
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:36,889
But that guy is weird.

647
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:38,449
Who's got the time

648
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:40,499
to come all the way 
here with a phone?

649
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:43,959
Hey, hey. He said 
he was passing by.

650
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:46,729
So, what brings you 
here, Ms. Lee?

651
00:36:46,729 --> 00:36:49,229
How did you know that
 we were looking for you?

652
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:50,269
Right?

653
00:36:50,269 --> 00:36:52,079
You were waiting for me, right?

654
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,839
Hey, what do you mean 
we were looking for her?

655
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,779
How close is Mr. Huh?

656
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:58,989
The tile master from
 Bulgwangdong? That Mr. Huh?

657
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:00,359
Do you know him?

658
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:03,439
He's taking some time off 
due to a back injury.

659
00:37:04,149 --> 00:37:05,429
That's what I heard.

660
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:09,509
Aigoo, he's not the only 
Mr. Huh in Korea.

661
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:12,209
Why isn't Mr. Huh here yet?

662
00:37:12,209 --> 00:37:15,359
We don't have time. 
Stop playing hard to get.

663
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,139
You'll let me join, right?

664
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:20,589
Well...

665
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:24,349
Gosh, we'd be so grateful
 if you'd work with us.

666
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,709
But how did you know to come here
 when we couldn't reach you?

667
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:30,339
It's not like you came 
looking for your phone.

668
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:32,759
I have that much intuition.

669
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:34,859
Then, let's go to the site.

670
00:37:34,909 --> 00:37:37,139
Let's not waste any time. 
Where is your equipment?

671
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:38,789
Equipment? Over there.

672
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:39,919
Okay.

673
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:55,999
 I just came over to feel it out. 

674
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:58,589
 But work was waiting for me. 

675
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:01,479
 Did Mom's superstition work? 

676
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:18,729
♫  You keep squeezing and 
letting go of my heart  ♫

677
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:24,189
♫  You keep squeezing and
 letting go of my heart  ♫

678
00:38:24,189 --> 00:38:29,559
♫  You keep squeezing and
 letting go of my heart  ♫

679
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:35,259
♫  You keep squeezing and 
letting go of my heart  ♫

680
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:41,209
♫  The moment I saw you again  ♫

681
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:42,779
 Lee Ra Hoon. 

682
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,849
 You're still so cool. 

683
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:50,669
♫  At your glance  ♫

684
00:38:50,669 --> 00:38:52,009
Sammie noona?

685
00:38:54,649 --> 00:38:56,159
Long time no see.

686
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,939
Hae Deun boasts a lot about you.

687
00:38:59,939 --> 00:39:01,429
There's no way.

688
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:06,209
 What's with her look? 

689
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:09,769
 I feel the pressure. 

690
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:11,259
Ra Hoon.

691
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:14,309
Should we start dating again?

692
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,529
Excuse me?

693
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:20,559
 Emerald has a photo shoot today. 

694
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,379
 But they forgot their props. 

695
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:24,399
 Can you drop them off? 

696
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:27,279
Geez, they're having me
 run errands now.

697
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,209
Does Wang Sammie 
have a boyfriend?

698
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:42,539
Daebak.

699
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:52,079
Let's start dating again.

700
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:55,239
Noona.

701
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:59,809
It's not like we dated before...

702
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:01,089
What?

703
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:05,709
Noona.

704
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:08,109
I'll be honest with you.

705
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:10,739
Actually...

706
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:15,889
I think Hae Deun noona is 
struggling at work these days.

707
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,269
When you asked me out last time,

708
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:23,299
I dumped you, no...

709
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:25,129
I rejected you...

710
00:40:25,129 --> 00:40:28,349
You must be bothering her 
because you're mad about that.

711
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:31,319
But just take it out on me 
and leave Lee Hae Deun...

712
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:32,929
no, could you...

713
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:35,399
leave my noona alone?

714
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:38,059
Ever since she quit 
being a trainee,

715
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:40,309
she worked all kinds 
of part-time jobs.

716
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:41,769
And when the agency
 called her back,

717
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:45,449
- she was so happy, but...
- Hey, Lee Ra Hoon!

718
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:47,429
Are you crazy?

719
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:50,009
Hey, Lee Hae Deun.

720
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:51,159
What about Wang Sammie?

721
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:53,919
Do you think she's taking it out 
on me because you dumped her?

722
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:56,589
It's me. She's doing it to me.

723
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:59,309
You know that I was much 
better than her as a trainee.

724
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:01,969
That inferior complex 
traumatized her

725
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:03,709
and when I appeared again,

726
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:05,079
she's taking it out on me now.

727
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,659
- It's not you...
- That's not true.

728
00:41:06,659 --> 00:41:08,699
It's because I hurt her in the past.

729
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,679
Because I wouldn't accept 
her feelings.

730
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:11,669
Give me a break. That's not it.

731
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,099
Don't be ridiculous.

732
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,229
How could you be 
delusional together as a set?

733
00:41:16,229 --> 00:41:20,149
Lee Ra Hoon, do you think 
I really want to date you again?

734
00:41:20,209 --> 00:41:22,809
What, Lee Hae Deun? 
Traumatized?

735
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:25,439
How dare you compare
 yourself to me?

736
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:27,399
Did you ask them to
 send me here?

737
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:28,389
Yeah.

738
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:29,979
I called you siblings 
who are full of it

739
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:32,119
to teach you a lesson.

740
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,529
Lee Ra Hoon.

741
00:41:33,529 --> 00:41:36,579
You don't interest me 
at all anymore.

742
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:38,259
Lee Hae Deun.

743
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:41,879
Drink this and come
 to your senses.

744
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:45,889
You're a loser doing odd jobs after
 dropping out as a trainee.

745
00:41:47,499 --> 00:41:49,739
I'm leaving. Get the car ready.

746
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:53,559
Ridiculous.

747
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:01,309
- Lee Ra Hoon.
- Lee Hae Deun.

748
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:04,879
Why did you humiliate me?

749
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:08,739
It's already a hard pill to swallow,

750
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:11,199
yet I'm enduring one 
day at a time.

751
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,749
Why did you humiliate me?

752
00:42:13,749 --> 00:42:16,469
I didn't do that on purpose...

753
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:18,709
I just thought you were...

754
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:22,849
Noona.

755
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:24,979
Noona, I'm sorry.

756
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:27,799
I just wanted to help you out.

757
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:30,149
Noona, I'm really sorry.

758
00:42:30,149 --> 00:42:32,199
Beat me up. I'm really fine.

759
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:34,159
Just beat me up.

760
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:36,389
Who the heck are you?

761
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:38,559
Why, why, why?

762
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:40,519
Ma'am, you can't do this here.

763
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:42,099
Ma'am.

764
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:04,379
Hey, get in.

765
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:06,059
I'm okay.

766
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:07,479
Get in.

767
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:08,699
Okay.

768
00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:12,639
Sir, please go to Seohan University.

769
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:13,869
No.

770
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:17,799
Go to your workplace.

771
00:43:17,799 --> 00:43:19,289
Please go.

772
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:23,079
 

773
00:43:24,899 --> 00:43:27,519
The smell of an elite university.

774
00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:29,609
Hey.

775
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:32,239
There aren't any pretty girls here.

776
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:34,229
I'm the prettiest, huh?

777
00:43:34,229 --> 00:43:35,429
Go.

778
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:37,459
- I'll go in.
- Okay, go.

779
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:47,719
 Lee Hae Deun, why don't you leave? 

780
00:43:48,399 --> 00:43:49,739
 

781
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:13,379
Excuse me.

782
00:44:13,379 --> 00:44:14,899
Excuse me. I'll sit down.

783
00:44:18,009 --> 00:44:19,899
Okay, let's begin our class.

784
00:44:19,899 --> 00:44:21,159
This is what we'll cover today.

785
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,509
We'll discuss this.

786
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:31,159
Let's share.

787
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:33,609
I'm...

788
00:45:06,209 --> 00:45:08,109
This must be the space.

789
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:12,999
Well, this is how he did the tiles.

790
00:45:12,999 --> 00:45:15,219
- I'll take a look at the tiles.
- Okay.

791
00:45:16,729 --> 00:45:17,889
Yup.

792
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:21,389
The tile thickness isn't that thin.

793
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:24,169
It's easier to add on if they're thin.

794
00:45:24,169 --> 00:45:26,789
But still, I'll pick out thinnest tiles

795
00:45:26,789 --> 00:45:28,369
as much as possible for the add-on,

796
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:29,789
so they don't stick out too far.

797
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:31,339
I've worked with this
 much thickness a lot.

798
00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:33,059
I'll save the floor.

799
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:36,539
If I put them in 
a herringbone pattern,

800
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:39,729
I think the sizes will work out 
with the ones that are there.

801
00:45:39,729 --> 00:45:41,579
I think they'll go on all right.

802
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:43,029
Okay.

803
00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:44,589
What do you think?

804
00:45:45,689 --> 00:45:48,569
Well, I'm not entirely sold,

805
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:51,269
but why don't we move forward
 with your plan, Ms. Lee?

806
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:54,119
I knew you'd say that.

807
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,529
So, when are you leaving?

808
00:45:56,529 --> 00:45:59,179
Aren't you leaving to study
 for winning the competition?

809
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:04,149
When are you leaving?

810
00:46:04,149 --> 00:46:07,279
I have to know, so that I can 
adjust my work schedule.

811
00:46:07,279 --> 00:46:09,859
I'm not leaving.

812
00:46:09,859 --> 00:46:11,619
Why not?

813
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:14,839
They revoked my prize.

814
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,519
They say there was a 
mistake in the judging.

815
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:19,299
Is that possible?

816
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:20,779
Are you sure it's not a mistake?

817
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:24,009
If you won the grand prize, 
that doesn't seem right.

818
00:46:24,009 --> 00:46:26,089
I know.

819
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:31,289
Aigoo, don't accept it 
so easily like that.

820
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,369
Dig into it.

821
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:34,179
Who knows if there's 
some corruption?

822
00:46:34,179 --> 00:46:36,659
I didn't accept it easily.

823
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:39,649
I threw a huge fit.

824
00:46:39,649 --> 00:46:42,469
So, a compromise.

825
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:44,829
That company offered you 
a compromise, right?

826
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:47,649
For example, an intern 
position or something.

827
00:46:48,859 --> 00:46:52,859
 I'll offer you an intern position.
 

828
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:56,629
I think that company sounds shady.

829
00:46:56,629 --> 00:46:57,499
What's the name of that company?

830
00:46:57,499 --> 00:46:59,559
Should I look into it
 through my network?

831
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:00,979
Tell me. What company is it?

832
00:47:00,979 --> 00:47:02,879
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

833
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:05,359
By chance, you didn't 
accept their offer, right?

834
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,939
You can't do that. 
You should fight to the end.

835
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:10,839
Hold this.

836
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:13,089
A compromise means...

837
00:47:13,089 --> 00:47:15,149
you're running away. No.

838
00:47:15,149 --> 00:47:17,739
It's more cowardly 
than running away.

839
00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:19,959
Come on, hold this.

840
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:21,069
Okay.

841
00:47:22,449 --> 00:47:24,629
How about you, Mr. Woo?

842
00:47:24,629 --> 00:47:26,809
I guess you never run away?

843
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:28,489
Of course not.

844
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:31,049
I, Woo Jae Hee, don't know
 the "R" in "Run away."

845
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:33,139
I'm a real man!

846
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:41,529
Hey, Mr. Woo...

847
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:44,069
How did you pay for
 this material?

848
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,929
Did you spend your rent again?

849
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,319
What else can I do?

850
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:49,239
I can see everyone is struggling.

851
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:51,809
I mean, without a place to live,

852
00:47:51,809 --> 00:47:53,879
you're living in a motel long-term.

853
00:47:53,879 --> 00:47:56,639
Are you saying you'll 
keep living like that?

854
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:59,819
My friend, I was thinking...

855
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:01,719
Should I just move 
into your house?

856
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:03,369
It's over, man.

857
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:04,459
You said you're not moving in,

858
00:48:04,459 --> 00:48:07,449
so my sister moved in yesterday.

859
00:48:07,449 --> 00:48:08,929
Geez.

860
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:10,439
My head...

861
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:14,949
 Zzajangmyeon is here. 

862
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:16,309
Yes, sir.

863
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:18,389
- Thank you!
 -Thank you! 

864
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:20,189
The sweet and sour 
pork is good.

865
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:24,239
That looks good.

866
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:26,679
- I'm off to Yeonhuidong.
- Good luck.

867
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:28,639
- Enjoy.
 - See you! 

868
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,589
- You should eat.
- Fighting, Mr. Woo!

869
00:48:30,589 --> 00:48:31,999
See you!

870
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,569
Where is he going now?

871
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:36,609
We got a recall from
 a previous client.

872
00:48:37,729 --> 00:48:39,199
Let's eat.

873
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,729
He ordered an extra-large.

874
00:48:43,009 --> 00:48:44,909
He said he was starving.

875
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,479
Geez, I'm starving.

876
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:02,489
Geez.

877
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:04,499
Geez, I'm hungry.

878
00:49:04,499 --> 00:49:08,479
Headbutt must be eating 
my extra-large zzajangmyeon.

879
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:12,599
Geez, I'm hungry.

880
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:17,059
Hello, I'm from W.

881
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:18,519
Hello.

882
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:20,639
Long time no see, Mr. Woo.

883
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,349
Hello, ahjumma.

884
00:49:22,349 --> 00:49:23,579
Yes.

885
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:30,969
Mr. Woo.

886
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:33,229
Drink this.

887
00:49:33,229 --> 00:49:35,469
Aigoo, your special juice.

888
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:37,019
Thank you.

889
00:49:39,439 --> 00:49:42,469
The last time I drank this, 
I couldn't sleep.

890
00:49:42,469 --> 00:49:43,769
I kept thinking about it.

891
00:49:43,769 --> 00:49:45,029
Really?

892
00:49:45,029 --> 00:49:46,489
You should've called me.

893
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:48,209
I would've brought you some.

894
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:49,529
I'm really going to call next time.

895
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:50,979
Yeah, do that.

896
00:49:50,979 --> 00:49:52,569
You can do that.

897
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:54,729
I'll leave it here.

898
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:57,149
- Take your time and drink it.
- Okay.

899
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:10,049
Is there a leak somewhere?

900
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:13,889
Aigoo.

901
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:15,919
Are you hungry?

902
00:50:15,919 --> 00:50:17,879
You didn't have lunch?

903
00:50:17,879 --> 00:50:19,139
No...

904
00:50:19,209 --> 00:50:22,109
No, I just have indigestion...

905
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:25,229
Aigoo.

906
00:50:25,229 --> 00:50:28,439
You are hungry.

907
00:50:30,009 --> 00:50:31,909
Well...

908
00:50:31,919 --> 00:50:34,099
- Give me a moment.
 - Yes.

909
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:35,939
Okay.

910
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:40,349
- Gosh.
- All right.

911
00:50:40,349 --> 00:50:42,089
Have some.

912
00:50:42,089 --> 00:50:44,509
- Thank you.
- Sure.

913
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:46,149
Whoa...

914
00:50:49,209 --> 00:50:51,209
Why? Why?

915
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:52,729
Did you chew on a rock?

916
00:50:52,729 --> 00:50:54,119
It's delicious.

917
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:56,739
My goodness.

918
00:50:56,739 --> 00:50:59,119
Thank you.

919
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,409
When you're starving

920
00:51:01,409 --> 00:51:04,309
and start eating suddenly, 
you can get sick.

921
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:07,489
Eat slowly and chew thoroughly.

922
00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:09,219
- Here.
- Okay.

923
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:10,899
Thank you.

924
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:13,889
Aigoo, Mr. Woo.

925
00:51:13,889 --> 00:51:16,209
- Grab my phone.
- Okay.

926
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,279
 

927
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:22,319
- Put on speaker.
- Okay.

928
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,789
Yes, sir.

929
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:27,529
Hello.

930
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,309
I'll be right out. Standby.

931
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:55,519
Yes, sir.

932
00:51:56,539 --> 00:51:58,029
Turn off the car.

933
00:51:58,029 --> 00:51:59,289
Okay, sir.

934
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:03,479
You're home.

935
00:52:04,949 --> 00:52:06,939
Mr. Lee called you, right?

936
00:52:06,939 --> 00:52:07,949
My suit for the funeral.

937
00:52:07,949 --> 00:52:09,809
It's in our room.

938
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:21,289
I'll eat dinner at home.

939
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:23,069
See you later.

940
00:52:23,999 --> 00:52:25,989
 So stiff. 

941
00:52:35,769 --> 00:52:37,239
- Good evening.
- Bye.

942
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:38,659
- See you.
- Bye.

943
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:40,079
See you tomorrow.

944
00:52:44,219 --> 00:52:46,389
 

945
00:52:52,509 --> 00:52:55,359
CEO, why now?

946
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,829
I've given it a lot of thought.

947
00:52:57,829 --> 00:52:59,749
But...

948
00:52:59,749 --> 00:53:02,129
accusing her of 
plagiarism this way

949
00:53:02,129 --> 00:53:04,459
is wrong, no matter how 
much I think about it.

950
00:53:04,459 --> 00:53:06,869
It weighs too heavily 
on my conscience.

951
00:53:08,209 --> 00:53:09,959
Director Jang.

952
00:53:09,959 --> 00:53:11,859
Let's correct this.

953
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:14,649
Let's announce that there was 
a mistake in the judging

954
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,529
and give the

955
00:53:16,529 --> 00:53:18,339
grand prize to Bit Chae Woon.

956
00:53:18,339 --> 00:53:19,879
Mom!

957
00:53:19,879 --> 00:53:21,689
You said you understand me.

958
00:53:21,689 --> 00:53:23,489
I do understand you,

959
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:26,099
but how long will you
 run away like this?

960
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:27,709
How much longer

961
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:30,909
will you torture yourself with
 the pain she caused you?

962
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,699
Seo Ah.

963
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:39,169
Let's just face this.

964
00:53:39,169 --> 00:53:41,209
I don't want to!

965
00:53:41,209 --> 00:53:44,179
I don't want to face her.

966
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,339
How do I deal with her again...

967
00:53:46,339 --> 00:53:48,459
Why are you so afraid?

968
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:50,819
You're the victim.

969
00:53:50,819 --> 00:53:54,049
She can't bother you any longer.

970
00:53:54,049 --> 00:53:56,529
You didn't do anything wrong.

971
00:53:56,529 --> 00:53:59,759
Why are you trying to avoid her?

972
00:53:59,759 --> 00:54:02,969
I'm not trying to avoid her.

973
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:05,289
Mom!

974
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:07,009
Seo Ah.

975
00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:09,929
I wish...

976
00:54:09,929 --> 00:54:13,029
you wouldn't disappoint
 me any longer.

977
00:54:30,009 --> 00:54:34,209
 

978
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:40,319
 A compromise means... 

979
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,469
 you're running away. 

980
00:54:41,469 --> 00:54:44,549
 No, it's more cowardly 
than running away. 

981
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,549
Koala was trying to lecture me.

982
00:54:47,549 --> 00:54:48,829
Okay.

983
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:50,119
No compromise.

984
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:54,959
I'm here to see the CEO.

985
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,229
Did you make an appointment?

986
00:54:56,229 --> 00:54:57,709
Yes. I'm Lee Bit Chae Woon.

987
00:54:58,769 --> 00:55:00,409
Please fill this out.

988
00:55:00,409 --> 00:55:02,219
Just a moment, please.

989
00:55:03,709 --> 00:55:05,739
I'm here to see 
Director Jang Seo Ah.

990
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:06,909
From Joon Fashion.

991
00:55:06,909 --> 00:55:08,919
Please fill this out.

992
00:55:08,919 --> 00:55:10,649
Please wait just a moment.

993
00:55:10,649 --> 00:55:12,339
 Jang Seo Ah? 

994
00:55:16,509 --> 00:55:17,609
This way, please.

995
00:55:36,109 --> 00:55:37,409
Hello, Director Jang.

996
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:39,949
Hello, Team Leader.

997
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:41,159
How have you been?

998
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:42,519
Fine, thank you.

999
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:44,839
We'll start the meeting
 in ten minutes.

1000
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:03,619
Jang Seo Ah.

1001
00:56:22,699 --> 00:56:23,939
 

1002
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:26,759
 

1003
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:28,809
 

1004
00:56:33,699 --> 00:56:35,119
 

1005
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,299
 

1006
00:56:41,909 --> 00:56:44,049
How did I not know this?

1007
00:57:13,909 --> 00:57:15,839
 Jang Seo Ah, it was you. 

1008
00:57:17,249 --> 00:57:18,909
 You found out I won grand prize. 

1009
00:57:18,909 --> 00:57:21,199
 You revoked my prize. 

1010
00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:24,829
 Because you don't want to face me. 

1011
00:57:26,749 --> 00:57:29,169
 Because of your wrongdoing.  

1012
00:57:31,539 --> 00:57:32,809
 

1013
00:57:32,809 --> 00:57:33,929
 

1014
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:38,059
Did you...

1015
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:39,969
think about my offer?

1016
00:57:40,949 --> 00:57:41,929
Yes.

1017
00:57:42,979 --> 00:57:45,609
Thank you for 
your consideration,

1018
00:57:46,539 --> 00:57:48,099
but I'll turn it down.

1019
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:51,429
Why?

1020
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:56,579
Because I don't want to grovel.

1021
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:04,499
The unfair plagiarism dispute
 hasn't been cleared,

1022
00:58:04,499 --> 00:58:07,049
but I can't accept an offer

1023
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:08,689
to appease me.

1024
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:12,489
All right.

1025
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,149
A person shouldn't grovel.

1026
00:58:17,909 --> 00:58:21,809
I discussed this with the judges.

1027
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:24,589
We decided to...

1028
00:58:25,989 --> 00:58:28,199
give you the grand prize.

1029
00:58:29,469 --> 00:58:32,339
Changing the winners twice

1030
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:35,729
is a disgrace from 
the company's stance.

1031
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:38,689
But if we made a mistake, 
we should acknowledge it.

1032
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,929
There was a mistake in judging.

1033
00:58:41,929 --> 00:58:43,909
As the company representative,

1034
00:58:43,909 --> 00:58:45,729
I will...

1035
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:47,769
apologize to you.

1036
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:50,219
 It's because of Seo Ah. 

1037
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:52,199
 Because you'd be in a bind. 

1038
00:58:52,959 --> 00:58:54,449
Do you have any objections?

1039
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,219
I don't...

1040
00:58:59,949 --> 00:59:02,009
quite understand.

1041
00:59:02,009 --> 00:59:03,319
Last time,

1042
00:59:03,319 --> 00:59:06,559
you said your work was
 the proof for plagiarism.

1043
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,189
But now you say
 it was your mistake.

1044
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:13,339
 She's not easy. 

1045
00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:15,609
We reviewed various aspects.

1046
00:59:15,609 --> 00:59:18,469
When I examined the release 
of my work timeline,

1047
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:20,569
I realized it was later than

1048
00:59:20,569 --> 00:59:22,359
the time of your sketches.

1049
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:23,319
Of course,

1050
00:59:23,319 --> 00:59:26,149
based on the fact that 
you were not lying to us.

1051
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:28,159
I didn't lie to you.

1052
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:30,529
Then I think we 
have our answers.

1053
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:33,479
We already notified the winners.

1054
00:59:33,479 --> 00:59:34,769
But the New York
 program has been

1055
00:59:34,769 --> 00:59:37,199
postponed to next year due 
to changes at the school.

1056
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:38,769
For now, we decided to

1057
00:59:38,769 --> 00:59:41,089
hire you as our 
design team intern.

1058
00:59:41,089 --> 00:59:44,299
Of course, as long as 
that's what you want.

1059
00:59:44,299 --> 00:59:47,549
The US study abroad program
 will take place next year.

1060
00:59:49,759 --> 00:59:51,789
I have something to tell you.

1061
00:59:53,779 --> 00:59:55,159
Ms. Goo.

1062
01:00:02,179 --> 01:00:04,509
The ads we produced in 2015

1063
01:00:04,509 --> 01:00:06,569
were focused on TV and radio.

1064
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,629
But in 2018, we focused
 on portal sites.

1065
01:00:08,629 --> 01:00:11,139
And in 2019,

1066
01:00:11,139 --> 01:00:13,339
we focused on the SNS...

1067
01:00:13,339 --> 01:00:14,979
Rather than what took 
place in the past...

1068
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:17,989
Speak.

1069
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,499
I saw Seo Ah on my way in.

1070
01:00:28,029 --> 01:00:30,109
I just realized...

1071
01:00:30,109 --> 01:00:32,949
that Seo Ah is your daughter.

1072
01:00:34,509 --> 01:00:35,589
I'm...

1073
01:00:35,589 --> 01:00:39,199
Seo Ah's middle school classmate.

1074
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:41,289
Because of that campus
 violence incident,

1075
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:42,789
I had to drop out.

1076
01:00:48,409 --> 01:00:49,939
Is that right?

1077
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:52,449
You didn't know?

1078
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,649
 If you were to 
acknowledge this, too... 

1079
01:00:55,649 --> 01:00:58,279
 I guess you'd be... 

1080
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,489
 acknowledging that
 Seo Ah is in this. 

1081
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:03,149
And?

1082
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:07,159
I want to...

1083
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:10,309
ask you if you'll still hire me.

1084
01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:18,069
What does that have
 to do with this?

1085
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:19,839
Of course, that incident...

1086
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,749
was a bad memory to
 both Seo Ah and me.

1087
01:01:23,269 --> 01:01:26,309
But I don't think we need 
to link it to our work.

1088
01:01:28,359 --> 01:01:29,919
I have a meeting.

1089
01:01:30,889 --> 01:01:33,799
Discuss the rest with Ms. Goo.

1090
01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:41,319
See Seo Ah on your way out.

1091
01:01:41,319 --> 01:01:43,559
Now that you know
 you were classmates.

1092
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:45,229
All right then.

1093
01:02:01,769 --> 01:02:03,449
I thought she was coming.

1094
01:02:09,889 --> 01:02:11,119
 Hello. 

1095
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:37,889
Seo Ah.

1096
01:02:41,789 --> 01:02:43,219
Bit Chae Woon.

1097
01:02:43,219 --> 01:02:44,589
Long time no see.

1098
01:02:46,469 --> 01:02:47,719
I guess.

1099
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:50,239
Have you been well?

1100
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:51,279
Yeah.

1101
01:02:53,129 --> 01:02:54,349
And you?

1102
01:02:57,409 --> 01:02:59,809
Well, as you can see.

1103
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:05,089
Director?

1104
01:03:06,009 --> 01:03:07,809
You're so cool.

1105
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:11,679
Come in.

1106
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:12,969
Next time.

1107
01:03:12,969 --> 01:03:14,669
I have to go.

1108
01:03:14,669 --> 01:03:17,069
We'll be seeing each other often.

1109
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,959
I heard about the competition.

1110
01:03:20,959 --> 01:03:22,859
I was on a business trip 
to Milano then.

1111
01:03:22,909 --> 01:03:25,309
You pulled some strings to clear up
 the plagiarism dispute, right?

1112
01:03:26,479 --> 01:03:27,579
Thanks.

1113
01:03:27,579 --> 01:03:29,719
Thank you in advance...

1114
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:31,579
Director Jang Seo Ah.

1115
01:03:48,839 --> 01:03:50,509
 I'll jump into it. 

1116
01:03:50,509 --> 01:03:52,319
 I'll go for it. 

1117
01:04:00,409 --> 01:04:02,409
Why is it so dark?

1118
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:06,139
Why are all the lights off when the 
man of the house is home?

1119
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:09,319
Does she think I'll 
compliment her for this?

1120
01:04:09,319 --> 01:04:11,419
Just acting as if she's being frugal.

1121
01:04:11,419 --> 01:04:14,119
Why are you sleeping so early?

1122
01:04:25,669 --> 01:04:26,879
Hey, look.

1123
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:28,329
Where are you?

1124
01:04:37,179 --> 01:04:38,659
Min Jae!

1125
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:41,609
What are you eating in secret?

1126
01:04:45,109 --> 01:04:47,409
Where did she go after 
setting the table like this?

1127
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,029
 Goodbye, Woo Jung Hoo. 

1128
01:04:58,029 --> 01:04:59,509
 I'm out of here. 

1129
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,199
What in the world...

1130
01:05:05,709 --> 01:05:06,409
Honey.

1131
01:05:07,109 --> 01:05:08,109
Min Jae!

1132
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:10,509
Are you kidding me?

1133
01:05:11,509 --> 01:05:12,609
Hey, look.

1134
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:14,029
Hey!

1135
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:21,309
 

1136
01:05:22,009 --> 01:05:24,709
 The number you dialed
 does not exist. 

1137
01:05:24,769 --> 01:05:27,459
 Please check and dial again. 

1138
01:05:28,809 --> 01:05:30,109
What?

1139
01:05:33,419 --> 01:05:34,669
Hey!

1140
01:05:36,009 --> 01:05:37,119
Hey!

1141
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:40,039
Hey!

1142
01:05:41,709 --> 01:05:43,609
 Hey! 

1143
01:05:45,209 --> 01:05:46,209
Really?

1144
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:47,909
Where?

1145
01:05:47,949 --> 01:05:48,979
That three-story house?

1146
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:50,839
No, the house behind us.

1147
01:05:50,839 --> 01:05:53,789
That ahjumma was about to take 
off her clothes to take a shower,

1148
01:05:53,789 --> 01:05:57,679
and that pervert was
 looking at her like this!

1149
01:05:57,679 --> 01:05:59,919
I'm home.

1150
01:06:01,969 --> 01:06:02,969
Where is Mom?

1151
01:06:03,729 --> 01:06:05,039
She's working late.

1152
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,569
At the Yeonhuidong house,

1153
01:06:06,569 --> 01:06:08,819
there's a party tomorrow. 
She has lots of work to do.

1154
01:06:08,819 --> 01:06:11,599
Hey, how come there are 
so many parties there?

1155
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:12,999
Does she pay her overtime?

1156
01:06:12,999 --> 01:06:15,089
- I wouldn't know.
- I have good news.

1157
01:06:15,089 --> 01:06:16,119
What?

1158
01:06:16,829 --> 01:06:17,899
The plagiarism issue?

1159
01:06:18,699 --> 01:06:19,949
Wait. Let me wash up.

1160
01:06:19,949 --> 01:06:20,909
Hey!

1161
01:06:20,909 --> 01:06:21,889
Stop!

1162
01:06:21,889 --> 01:06:23,069
Let me use the bathroom.

1163
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:26,169
What? You were
 relaxing all this time.

1164
01:06:26,169 --> 01:06:28,459
I know. I was relaxing
 all this time,

1165
01:06:28,459 --> 01:06:30,059
but makes me want to go
 now that you're home.

1166
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:31,169
Let go.

1167
01:06:31,169 --> 01:06:33,439
- Seriously.
- Unni.

1168
01:06:33,439 --> 01:06:35,189
Inside our neighbor's bathroom,

1169
01:06:35,189 --> 01:06:36,629
a pervert snuck in.

1170
01:06:36,629 --> 01:06:38,139
He took his shirt off and

1171
01:06:38,139 --> 01:06:40,019
was sneaking a peek like this.

1172
01:06:40,019 --> 01:06:41,539
But he ran away.

1173
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,819
Gosh, I feel so icky.

1174
01:06:43,819 --> 01:06:45,889
Hey, Uncle isn't home yet, right?

1175
01:06:45,889 --> 01:06:47,559
Yeah, you want to 
use the men's room?

1176
01:06:47,559 --> 01:06:49,739
Bring some toilet paper 
when you come down.

1177
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:50,749
Okay?

1178
01:06:50,749 --> 01:06:51,819
 Nope! 

1179
01:07:04,629 --> 01:07:07,079
 Unni, inside our 
neighbor's bathroom, 

1180
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:08,939
 a pervert snuck in. 

1181
01:07:09,999 --> 01:07:11,449
 That pervert? 

1182
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:35,179
Hey!

1183
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:45,709
Headbutt.

1184
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:47,909
Koala.

1185
01:07:48,509 --> 01:07:51,009
Headbutt...

1186
01:07:51,089 --> 01:07:52,809
Why, why...

1187
01:07:52,809 --> 01:07:55,619
Why? What's wrong?

1188
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:57,219
Wake up! Hey!

1189
01:07:57,219 --> 01:07:58,499
You're too heavy.

1190
01:07:58,499 --> 01:08:00,599
Wait. Mr. Woo!

1191
01:08:03,309 --> 01:08:04,709
My gosh.

1192
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:07,309
What's that?

1193
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:09,449
What, what?

1194
01:08:09,449 --> 01:08:11,819
Why? Why? What's going on?

1195
01:08:11,819 --> 01:08:13,449
Hurry up!

1196
01:08:13,449 --> 01:08:14,669
Hey, Hae Deun!

1197
01:08:26,999 --> 01:08:31,179
♫  In the midst of tall 
forest of buildings  ♫

1198
01:08:31,179 --> 01:08:35,119
♫  A city girl is walking confidently  ♫

1199
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:39,159
♫  As people stare 
at her breathlessly  ♫

1200
01:08:39,159 --> 01:08:41,349
♫  The cool girl is walking arrogantly  ♫

1201
01:08:41,349 --> 01:08:43,049
 

1202
01:08:43,049 --> 01:08:45,109
 I'll start working at LX Fashion. 

1203
01:08:45,109 --> 01:08:48,039
 Whoa, you're 
a professional woman. 

1204
01:08:48,039 --> 01:08:50,759
 She starts tomorrow. If you want 
to get passed her for good, 

1205
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:51,759
 this is the best way. 

1206
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:55,219
 Please let Chae Woon 
meet a nice man at work. 

1207
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:56,559
 
 Jung Hoo oppa. 

1208
01:08:56,559 --> 01:08:58,179
 You're doing well, right? 

1209
01:08:58,179 --> 01:08:59,589
 Get out! Get out right now! 

1210
01:08:59,589 --> 01:09:00,519
 I'm sorry. 

1211
01:09:00,519 --> 01:09:01,959
 I don't need you. Get out! 

1212
01:09:01,959 --> 01:09:03,969
 Jae Hee, Min Suk, I'm doing well. 

1213
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:05,669
 Don't be fussy and just wait. 

1214
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:06,889
 I'll be back. 

1215
01:09:06,889 --> 01:09:07,999
 A new tenant? 

1216
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:10,809
 Let's score big time 
and ditch this dump. 

1217
01:09:10,839 --> 01:09:12,349
 - The basement tenant?
- Yes. 

1218
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:13,309
 Give them to me. I'll clean up. 

1219
01:09:13,309 --> 01:09:14,739
 No, it's okay. 

1220
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,859
 Hey, jerk! 

1221
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:20,319
 What are you doing?
