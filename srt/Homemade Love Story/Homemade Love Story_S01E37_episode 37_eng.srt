1
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,850
 

2
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,150
Thanks.

3
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,640
The contract...

4
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,660
didn't go through.

5
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,160
When my subcontractors heard the news,

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,140
they all came barging in.

7
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,010
But they're not...

8
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,730
the kind of people who'd do this.

9
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,720
By chance, did you borrow money
 from the loan sharks?

10
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,990
I guess Chief Yoo...

11
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,640
did because he was so desperate.

12
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,150
Geez, he didn't even discuss it with me.

13
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,090
I guess he tried to take care of it himself.

14
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,290
Jae Hee...

15
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,430
Don't... don't worry.

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,430
 How can I tell him that 
Park Pil Hong did this? 

17
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,790
 Some guy named Park Pil Hong 
jumped in the middle of it. 

18
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,840
 The people in the field didn't 
know much about him, either. 

19
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,636
 How can I tell her that
 Park Pil Hong is involved in this? 

20
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,320
Moong-i.

21
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,810
You're in shock, huh?

22
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,990
I'm...

23
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,750
really okay. Really.

24
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,660
Don't pretend to be okay, Jae Hee.

25
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,870
You don't have to pretend with me.

26
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,990
You were always by my side 
when I was struggling.

27
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,780
Why do you try to hide your struggles?

28
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,180
No...

29
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,480
I'm really okay.

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm okay...

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,940
Jae Hee...

32
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,760
Jae Hee, are you not well?

33
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,910
Chairwoman, why did you deceive me?

34
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,490
Why didn't you tell me that Woo Jae Hee 
was going for that contract?

35
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,280
Well, that's none of your business.

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,510
Don't you do anything for money?

37
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,960
Woo Jae Hee is someone 
my Seo Yeon is in love with.

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,390
He's her fiancé.

39
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,030
How could you do this as a human being?

40
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,860
To your granddaughter!

41
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,120
Before she's my granddaughter, 
she's your daughter.

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,810
She inherited trashy blood from you,

43
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,420
someone who ruined my daughter's life.

44
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,570
Bit Chae Woon tore up 
my granddaughter Seo Ah's heart!

45
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,150
So Seo Yeon isn't your granddaughter, but

46
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,410
Jang Seo Ah is the only 
granddaughter to you?

47
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,260
Because Jang Seo Ah is the financial 
ticket to protect your position?

48
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,540
Are you clueless?

49
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,250
My Jung Won, whose life was on 
the edge of a cliff because of you.

50
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,270
She revived when she met Seo Ah's dad.

51
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,010
I'm so glad that I was able to 
keep her away from you back then!

52
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,440
Didn't I tell you last time?

53
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,050
That I have a voice recording 
of our conversation.

54
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,400
Would you be okay if
 I expose it to the world?

55
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,040
Would you be okay if everyone finds out

56
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,970
what horrific deed you committed?

57
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,110
What?

58
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,570
You bastard!

59
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,750
If you're afraid, put everything
 back in its place.

60
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,010
Take care of things so that Woo Jae Hee 
could sign the contract with that firm.

61
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,520
I'll give you until tomorrow.

62
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,290
Uncle, you didn't go to work?

63
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,420
- Yeah, well...
- Why not?

64
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,000
Well...

65
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,560
It's been a while...

66
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,760
since we started dating.

67
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,400
I wanted to tell you, but I copped out.

68
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,690
Unni, you're in shock, huh?

69
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,980
Yeah.

70
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,810
I'm in shock.

71
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,140
Are you disappointed that I'm not 
dating someone better than him?

72
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,190
Man Jung.

73
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,340
Yeah?

74
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,530
Hwak Se...

75
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,160
Don't you consider him wonderful?

76
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,750
No matter what others say,

77
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,700
you date someone as long as you
 think he's a great catch.

78
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,900
Yeah... you're right.

79
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,680
Well, that is true, but...

80
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,330
based on what other people think...

81
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,220
You're like a mother to me, Unni.

82
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,760
I guess you could be 
disappointed. I understand.

83
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,750
Hwak Se is such a good person.

84
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,340
Where would you find 
a kindhearted soul like him?

85
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,710
There aren't any. I know that.

86
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,520
Yeah.

87
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,730
What worries me is that...

88
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,050
You and Hwak Se are both...

89
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,940
so precious to me.

90
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,680
After dating him for a while,

91
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,690
what if things don't work out?

92
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,470
If things don't work out,

93
00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:01,000
it would be hard for all of us to 
have the same kind of relationship.

94
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,100
Gosh, Unni...

95
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,940
Why do you think we won't 
work out first and foremost?

96
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,360
Do you love Hwak Se?

97
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,700
Yeah.

98
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,510
I love him. I like him a lot.

99
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,890
Are you going to marry him?

100
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,990
Yeah.

101
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,560
We probably should.

102
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,730
My gosh.

103
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,140
Man Jung...

104
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,630
do you know that you always start 
a relationship this way?

105
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,960
What?

106
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,610
Whenever you start dating,
 you're always so passionate.

107
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,090
You can't see straight.

108
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,670
As if you'll give it all and 
marry the guy tomorrow.

109
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,900
Yeah, I did. That's just my style.

110
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,540
When I fall for someone, 
I can't see straight

111
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,250
and jump into it without thinking.

112
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,960
That's how I lost all my money, too.

113
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,350
That's how I am.

114
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,720
But Unni, Hwak Se is different 
from other guys I dated.

115
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,360
Don't you know that better than anyone?

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,770
You know how kind he is.

117
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,020
You know that he's not the type to 
betray me or stab me in the back.

118
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,760
You always told me...

119
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,230
that all those other guys
 are like that, too.

120
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,810
So what is it you want to say, Unni?

121
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,180
Are you trying to say that 
Hwak Se will also betray me?

122
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,680
No, that's not it.

123
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,770
I think you could hurt Hwak Se, too.

124
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,980
Oh, I see. Wait a minute.

125
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,980
So Unni, this is how you're saying
 you oppose our relationship.

126
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,190
Right?

127
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,610
Unni, just be honest with me.

128
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,600
"I paid for your medical school 
working as a housekeeper.

129
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,330
You kept getting dumped
 by guys you meet.

130
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,170
Now you're dating a third-class singer?

131
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,230
Did I suffer through and support 
your education for this?"

132
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,330
Unni, just be straight with me.

133
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,400
Why do you beat around the bush?

134
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,210
Gosh, Man Jung!

135
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,120
- Gosh.
- Man Jung...

136
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,150
- Auntie.
- Why are you doing this?

137
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,400
- Man Jung, don't do this.
- Leave me alone.

138
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,620
Unni, just be blunt...

139
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,240
and say you're against our relationship.

140
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,490
Say, "Why don't you bring 
home a doctor like you?"

141
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,920
Unni, can't you be honest 
and say that?

142
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,390
Unni, why do you have to say 
that I'll betray him or hurt him?

143
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,610
It offends me more that 
you'd say it like that.

144
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,860
Hey, Man Jung, how can you say that?

145
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,830
I'm like a mom to you.

146
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,290
Can't I  say that as your older sister?

147
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,070
Fine. I'm fine with you two dating.

148
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,740
But I'm just saying be cautious.

149
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,820
What's so bad about that?

150
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,500
So why are you getting 
all worked up over it?

151
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,420
I'm so disappointed by you, Unni!

152
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,870
Unni, I really feel like we're 
meant to be together.

153
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,470
It was hard for me to
 come to this conclusion.

154
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,550
That's why it was so hard 
for me to tell you just now.

155
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,340
But did you congratulate me?

156
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,820
Never mind being happy for me.

157
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,190
How can you stare at me, 
looking so puzzled?

158
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,770
- Am I that pathetic to you?
- Let's go.

159
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,370
Why are you sighing?

160
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,220
- What did I do so wrong?
- What's wrong with you?

161
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,560
Unni, why do you look 
at me with such pity?

162
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,090
Let go of me!

163
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,010
Do I seem that pathetic to you?

164
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,780
- Gosh...
- Mom.

165
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,160
Uncle Hwak Se and Auntie 
are really dating?

166
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,750
Gosh, what's gotten into her?

167
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,050
- Gosh...
 - Let go! 

168
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,400
Why do you treat me like a child?

169
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,850
Why are you doing this?

170
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,380
Don't do this.

171
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,650
You're acting like this 
because you feel bad for her.

172
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,710
You're getting angry at 
others for your mistake.

173
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,350
You feel bad, so you keep...

174
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,710
What do you mean by that?

175
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,680
Wait...

176
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,670
Aigoo...

177
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,450
Noonim, I'm really sorry.

178
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,470
Go and comfort Man Jung.

179
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,750
Well...

180
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,990
- Noonim.
- We'll...

181
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,220
talk later, Hwak Se. Okay?

182
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,470
Okay.

183
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,750
All right then.

184
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,170
What's going on here?

185
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,460
- Auntie!
- Hae Deun...

186
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,900
Gosh. Later.

187
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,580
Gosh...

188
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,210
 Jjung-a, I'm coming in. 

189
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,360
Wait...

190
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,420
Why are you doing this? 
Where are you going?

191
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,090
I'll just sleep at the hospital. 
I can't stay here.

192
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,700
Jjung-a, what about me 
if you leave like this?

193
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,060
Did you hear everything
 I said to my sister?

194
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,220
Geez...

195
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,960
I'm sorry.

196
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,000
Jjung-a, if you leave like this, 
how would Noonim feel?

197
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,190
Why are you doing this to your sister?

198
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,500
She didn't say much.

199
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,870
I wish she had said something instead.

200
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,950
Just hit me and say how crazy I am.

201
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,550
What the heck? She embarrasses
 me even more.

202
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,380
 That's right. 

203
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,590
 It's crazy that Man Jung... 

204
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,680
 is dating me. 

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,200
I mean...

206
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,620
Why do I keep speaking nonsense today?

207
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,370
Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

208
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:23,110
I didn't mean that it's crazy for
 me to date you, Hwak Se.

209
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,510
That's not what I meant. I just...

210
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,040
You know this, too.

211
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,870
I always worried my sister because
 I'd get carried away with guys I date.

212
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,730
That's what I meant. 
That I look pathetic to her.

213
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,900
Man Jung...

214
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,790
Don't say anything. I...

215
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,930
I understand it all.

216
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,390
I understand how you feel...

217
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,560
and I know how Soon Jung noonim feels.

218
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,190
I understand everything, but...

219
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,980
what hurts me the most is that...

220
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,900
you're so upset about it.

221
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,730
That's what hurts me. I don't care...

222
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,270
I really don't care about everything else.

223
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,130
Geez...

224
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,000
And what I said about 
you making a mistake...

225
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,960
I misspoke.

226
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,680
You were right, though.

227
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,200
- What are you doing?
- I'll just go and sleep elsewhere.

228
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,400
Come on. Don't go.

229
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,040
I can't stay home.

230
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,500
I'll go. I'm sorry.

231
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,000
Gosh.

232
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,220
Auntie, where do you 
think you're going?

233
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,150
- Don't go.
- Come on.

234
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,830
- Mom! Auntie is leaving!
- Man Jung...

235
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,790
Hey, where do you think you're going?

236
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,800
I'll sleep in the hospital night duty room.

237
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,090
My gosh.

238
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,650
Man Jung, why are you doing this?

239
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:59,800
If you leave like this, how would I feel?

240
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,820
Sorry, Unni.

241
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
I can't sleep here tonight.

242
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,400
Aigoo...

243
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,600
It must be so nice to be you.

244
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,850
You have a place to go 
whenever you don't get your way.

245
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,120
Aigoo, seriously.

246
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,600
Is the night duty room warm?

247
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,710
It's boiling hot.

248
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,830
That's good.

249
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,250
Come home tomorrow night, though.

250
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,660
I won't come home tomorrow.

251
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,200
- Seriously.
- Auntie!

252
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,540
- Man Jung, why are you doing this?
- Auntie!

253
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,350
Auntie, how would Mom
 feel if you leave like this?

254
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,470
Hey.

255
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,360
Your mom is already upset
 because of me...

256
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,460
She's already in turmoil.

257
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,600
And you, Hae Deun, 
you caught on, right?

258
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,520
I'm dating Hwak Se.

259
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,510
Any complaints?

260
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,630
No, I have no complaints, but...

261
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,990
just date. Why are you acting
 like this? It's a good thing.

262
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,690
We just feel bad for 
your mom. That's why.

263
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,560
I'm leaving.

264
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,020
- Don't do this...
- Auntie!

265
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,580
Hey, go inside.

266
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,530
Geez, Lee Ra Hoon.

267
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,080
You're feeling down, huh?

268
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,520
No.

269
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,050
You don't feel good 
about it, either, huh?

270
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,440
Yeah.

271
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,910
I do feel bad, but...

272
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,460
we'll have another opportunity.

273
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,600
I'm relieved that we didn't get scammed.

274
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,450
We were short on funds anyhow.

275
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,300
Let's save up more and
 launch a stable franchise.

276
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,270
Okay. Thanks.

277
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,530
Well, I feel bad about 
the food truck, but...

278
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,210
I'm concerned about 
Chae Woon noona.

279
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,580
She seemed very upset 
about it earlier.

280
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:59,530
So, is he Chae Woon unni's birth father?

281
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,210
Her birth father?

282
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,630
Let's not tell our family 
about this at home.

283
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,850
I think my mom will be 
shocked if she finds out.

284
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,460
Yeah, we shouldn't.

285
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,560
Cheer up, Lee Ra Hoon.

286
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,820
All right. You cheer up, too.

287
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,920
Okay.

288
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,270
Auntie.

289
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,110
- Where are you going?
- Hi, you're home.

290
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,080
- Ra Hoon, wait.
- Uncle...

291
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,430
Auntie!

292
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,410
What's going on?

293
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,990
It looks like something happened.

294
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,470
Did they argue again?

295
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,970
It seems more serious than that.

296
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,780
 Woo Jae Hee didn't get his contract 

297
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,520
 because of your father Park Pil Hong. 

298
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,490
 Why would he do that? 

299
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,950
 Guys, sorry. 

300
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,540
 - Noona.
- Hello... 

301
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,530
I'm sorry, Jae Hee.

302
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,510
You wouldn't be going through
 this if you hadn't met me.

303
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,050
  The phone is turned off. 
After the beep... 

304
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,590
Hwang Na Ro, what's with you?

305
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,640
Ms. Lee!

306
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,110
Chief Yoo.

307
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,100
He's suffering from 
stress and exhaustion.

308
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,550
I see.

309
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,410
I wonder if he's experiencing
 panic attacks again.

310
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,540
Panic attacks?

311
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,380
Didn't you know?

312
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,420
He started having panic attacks 
when his best friend from high school

313
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,670
went through a hard time.

314
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,510
Being on bad terms with 
his father was also a cause.

315
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,490
I see.

316
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,910
But he's been doing well 
ever since he met you.

317
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,990
Chief Yoo, could you stay
 here for a while?

318
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,720
I have to go somewhere.

319
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,420
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

320
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,800
Bit Chae Woon.

321
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,490
Are you sure Park Pil Hong
 was involved?

322
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,600
Are you sure Park Pil Hong 
ruined Jae Hee's contract?

323
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,900
That's what I heard.

324
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,720
Why did you tell me about it then?

325
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,400
You wanted to tell me that my 
birth father was blinded by money

326
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,010
that he even ruined the 
man his daughter loves?

327
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,130
I wanted to help if I could.

328
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,440
Okay.

329
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,040
Help me then.

330
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,300
Convince Seo Ah and 
put things the way they were.

331
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,000
I never said Seo Ah did that.

332
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,150
If not Seo Ah, who'd do
 such a crazy thing?

333
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,020
She's taking it out on us after finding
 out that we're getting married.

334
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,700
And Park Pil Hong would be perfect
 to use since he'd do anything for money.

335
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,990
Bit Chae Woon.

336
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,610
What are you doing here?

337
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,380
Seo Ah, you did this, right?

338
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,360
- You did it, huh?
- Bit Chae Woon.

339
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,060
Seo Ah, let's go.

340
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,670
Jae Hee is in the ER right now!

341
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,300
His office is a mess, Seo Ah.

342
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,820
Bit Chae Woon.

343
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,350
What did I do for you to say this to me?

344
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,700
Because of your crazy joke, 
not only Jae Hee, but

345
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,680
numerous people are about to suffer.

346
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,620
Seo Ah, why are you doing this?

347
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,230
Why must you do this to this extent?

348
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,200
So...

349
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,160
are you suffering?

350
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,940
Are you in pain?

351
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,820
After you took everything from me,

352
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,940
did you think you'd be happy?

353
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,990
Jang Seo Ah.

354
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,670
You'd better be ready, Bit Chae Woon.

355
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,970
This is only the beginning.

356
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,600
Jang Seo Ah.

357
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,590
Jang Seo Ah!

358
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,990
Here's your jokbal.

359
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,400
Enjoy!

360
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,390
Table three...

361
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:44,480
Jae Hee said he was 
signing the contract today.

362
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,070
 

363
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,290
Yes.

364
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,490
Chae Woon?

365
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,100
Yes, Father.

366
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,500
You must be with Jae Hee.

367
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,930
Yes.

368
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,050
Gosh, sorry to interrupt.

369
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,420
No, it's okay.

370
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,670
Jae Hee said he was 
signing his contract today.

371
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,620
 I was wondering how it went. 

372
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,270
Well...

373
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,080
As for that...

374
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,640
Moong-i.

375
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,260
Father, I'll let you speak to Jae Hee.

376
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,690
 No, no. 

377
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,520
I just called. I'm busy right now.

378
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,600
My dad?

379
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,150
Yeah.

380
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,720
Jae Hee, are you okay?

381
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,800
Can you breathe okay?

382
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,840
You're not dizzy or anything?

383
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,930
I'll get the doctor.

384
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,200
Wait.

385
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,800
What?

386
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,600
I scared you, huh?

387
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,360
Are you really okay?

388
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,660
I'm okay.

389
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,690
That's good.

390
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,240
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

391
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,220
Letting you see me so weak.

392
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,160
Why are you saying that? Don't say that.

393
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,320
You really did get scared.

394
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,360
Why get scared? You're a brave person.

395
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,530
I'm really fine.

396
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,600
Oh, my. Jae Hee.

397
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,230
When did you get here?

398
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,800
Do you still build stuff like this?

399
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,100
You used to love to play with
 this when you were little.

400
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,620
That's why you became an architect, my son.

401
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,100
Jae Hee, what should 
I make for you? Galbijim?

402
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,520
Jae Hee.

403
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,840
What's wrong? Is something the matter?

404
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,240
What's wrong?

405
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,190
What's going on?

406
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,720
Huh?

407
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,210
Jae Hee...

408
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,350
Jae Hee... Jae Hee!

409
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,350
Jae Hee! Jae Hee...

410
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,310
When did I fall asleep?

411
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,150
Is something the matter with Jae Hee?

412
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:23,720
Something was off 
about Chae Woon's voice.

413
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,560
 

414
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,300
Yes, Jung Min Jae.

415
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,270
Are you at the jokbal place right now?

416
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,980
Yes, and?

417
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,140
 Oh, that's good. 

418
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,370
Will you check on Jae Hee 
and see if he's okay?

419
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,900
I just called him, but he won't answer.

420
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,850
I think he's on a date with 
Bit Chae Woon right now.

421
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,010
Is that why he didn't answer?

422
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,980
But he'd usually answer, though.

423
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:04,550
Since you're there, just stop by.

424
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,540
I just...

425
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,010
had a dream about Jae Hee.
 I feel uneasy.

426
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,950
Just now?

427
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,190
Then you had turned in for the night?

428
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,030
I get sleepy in the early 
evenings these days.

429
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,280
If you sleep early, 
you can't fall asleep later.

430
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,600
Yes, yes. I got it.

431
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,370
Hurry up and stop by, okay?

432
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,450
All right.

433
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,830
I'll stop by after my shift.

434
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,190
Stop by and call me back.

435
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,620
Tell me if he's okay or if he's not okay.

436
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,120
Yes, I'll do that.

437
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,650
I'm hanging up.

438
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,900
She's got quite an accurate hunch...

439
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,670
What...

440
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,040
I'm hungry.

441
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,620
I'm hungry.

442
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,600
What? It's porridge.

443
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,410
I'm hungry.

444
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,040
Hungry...

445
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,950
Geez...

446
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,600
Why is the porridge so yucky?

447
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,690
What the heck?

448
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,420
 Mr. Makjang. 

449
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,420
 I made this porridge with all my care. 

450
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,960
 My auntie says you'll 
get better if you eat well. 

451
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,570
 Be sure to eat all the 
porridge I made for you. 

452
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,180
 If you don't eat it, I'll get mad at you. 

453
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,890
Director Lee made this?

454
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,830
Geez, how could porridge
 taste this bad?

455
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,610
It's so yucky...

456
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,830
 Mr. Makjang! Are you up? 
Can I come in? 

457
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,330
No, no, no. Wait, Hae Deun. 
Give me a minute!

458
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,030
Wait a minute! I'm up but wait.

459
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,030
What do I do? What now?

460
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,880
Do I have to...

461
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,210
Wait a minute! Wait!

462
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,350
Give me a minute. I'm up.

463
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,230
Wait...

464
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,400
Mr. Makjang, are you still in pain?

465
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,830
- What in the world...
- I'm okay.

466
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,260
You ate all the porridge I made!

467
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,920
Wasn't it good?

468
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,100
It was really good...

469
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,980
You made more porridge?

470
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,480
Yeah, I made more.

471
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,720
My auntie says it's good
 to eat small portions often.

472
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,820
Here, eat it.

473
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,900
Gosh, it looks really good.

474
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,750
But Director Lee...

475
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,330
I just ate the porridge.

476
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,930
I'm really okay now.

477
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,160
I'm fine. I feel like 
my stomach will explode.

478
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,190
Gosh, nobody's stomach explodes 
from eating porridge.

479
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,360
Hurry up and eat it.

480
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,940
You got some color back in your face.

481
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,260
My porridge must've been
 effective. Hurry up and eat.

482
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,810
Here, eat more.

483
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,400
- The color is back on my face?
- Yeah.

484
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,930
Oh, yeah...

485
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,330
I have to say hello to your mother.

486
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,870
- No, no, sit down.
- No, I should say hi.

487
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,080
Sit down!

488
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,130
- I'm just...
- What in the world...

489
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,400
I was going to tell my mom, but...

490
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,640
there's a war going on upstairs.

491
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,930
So I'll tell my mom after 
things calm down.

492
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:26,080
- Hurry up and eat this.
- I should say hi, though...

493
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,020
Don't worry. Eat more.

494
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,440
I'll really eat this. I will, but...

495
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,890
go outside for a minute, Director Lee.

496
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:35,680
Then I'll take my time eating
 this and be right out.

497
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,050
Gosh, it's lonely eating alone.

498
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,930
I'll be here with you.

499
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,440
Aren't you grateful?

500
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,060
I'm grateful.

501
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,010
I'm so grateful and...

502
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,230
This looks good.

503
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,600
Isn't it good?

504
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,960
Gosh, I must be a cooking genius!

505
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,190
- Isn't it good? Huh?
- It's good.

506
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,270
Director Lee...

507
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,200
I have a request for you.

508
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,880
Why don't you take a bite?

509
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,640
Geez, I had a big dinner 
already. Don't worry.

510
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,210
No, you should try this porridge.

511
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,430
No, I'm letting the sick 
person eat it. Eat it.

512
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,290
No...

513
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,420
If I ring the bell,

514
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,440
Soon Jung will worry, 
wondering what's up.

515
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,590
 

516
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,170
Mr. Woo.

517
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,620
Did you just finish your shift?

518
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,910
Yes.

519
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,610
Are you going somewhere?

520
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:59,440
No, I just wanted to 
get some fresh air.

521
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,020
I see.

522
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,750
Is something upsetting you?

523
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,800
Come in. It's cold.

524
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,780
Is Jae Hee home?

525
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,460
Mr. Woo isn't home yet.

526
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,810
He must be busy today because 
of his construction contract.

527
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,900
- Come in, Mr. Woo.
- Ah, okay.

528
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,810
Geez...

529
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,150
 

530
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,880
 Hyungnim, Bit Chae Woon found out... 

531
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,320
 that you intercepted
 Woo Jae Hee's contract. 

532
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,520
 What are you going to do now? 

533
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,970
This a**hole...

534
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,560
Seo Yeon must be so upset
 because of me.

535
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,390
Darn it...

536
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,880
Geez...

537
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,480
I'm done with the IV. Let's go home.

538
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,910
No, let's stay a little longer.

539
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,590
No. I want to go home.

540
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,180
Then stay here. I'll tell them.

541
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,080
I have to get your medicine, too.

542
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,920
I'll get it.

543
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,950
Stay. I'll be right back.

544
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,150
 

545
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,980
Park Pil Hong, where are you right now?

546
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,400
Meet me.

547
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,130
You heard, right?

548
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,370
I'm sorry.

549
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,360
But I...

550
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,300
had no idea that contract was yours.

551
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,930
Why would you get involved in that?

552
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,070
I'm with Chae Woon right now. 
I can't talk long.

553
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,220
Where are you?
 Where should I meet you?

554
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,440
Let's meet later.

555
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,530
I'll be sure to put everything 
back the way it was.

556
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,950
I'll make sure you're not in a bind.

557
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,740
I'll pay back all the money you lost.

558
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,350
Just wait a little bit.

559
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,660
What are you going to do now?

560
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,290
This isn't that simple.

561
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,100
His IV is finished.

562
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,910
Could he go home now?

563
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,470
 Shouldn't he stay longer? 

564
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,870
Is he at the hospital?

565
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,920
Geez...

566
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,080
I'm glad that no one is
 in the living room.

567
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,200
 Is that you, Chae Woon? 

568
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,660
Yeah, Mom.

569
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,450
Oh, hi.

570
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,200
- Aigoo, you're late.
- Yeah.

571
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,920
Where is Mr. Woo?

572
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,420
He just went upstairs. 
He hurried to the bathroom.

573
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,090
Oh, I see.

574
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,710
His father is in his room.

575
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,380
Oh, really?

576
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:19,080
I think he's curious about 
Mr. Woo's contract.

577
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,080
How did the contract issue go?
 Did he get it?

578
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,020
Well, I'll tell you about it later.

579
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,890
Dad.

580
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:37,180
What happened to your face?

581
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,640
What happened? What's going on?

582
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,150
Be quiet...

583
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,660
Why are you here?
 Why didn't you go home?

584
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,040
Geez, you didn't answer your phone.

585
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,800
Your friend Chief Yoo didn't
 answer his phone, either.

586
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,500
I came because I got worried.

587
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,320
You didn't get the contract?

588
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,750
Aigoo.

589
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,930
You jumped the gun buying 
the materials in advance.

590
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,690
Did something go wrong?

591
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:05,760
I told you that you should
 always look before you leap.

592
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,350
Did I want this to happen?

593
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:14,270
Must you give me a hard time, too?

594
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,970
Today, I...

595
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,440
- Today...
- Jae Hee...

596
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,210
Jae Hee, sit down. Sit down.

597
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,620
Oh, no...

598
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,570
Are you okay? Are you okay?

599
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,580
My goodness...

600
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,680
Are you having panic attacks again?

601
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,610
Gosh...

602
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,230
Gosh, my son...

603
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,560
Gosh. Yes.

604
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,350
- Father.
- Hi, Chae Woon.

605
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,070
Jae Hee.

606
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,010
Is it happening again?

607
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,300
I'm okay.

608
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,980
Oh, hi.

609
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,290
Mr. Woo.

610
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:14,200
What happened to your face? 
Did you get hurt?

611
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,830
Hi, Mother.

612
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,800
Geez...

613
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,320
Chae Woon.

614
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,190
So Mr. Woo didn't get his contract?

615
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,920
Yeah.

616
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,540
A big firm intercepted
 the contract at the end.

617
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,350
Gosh, what do we do now?

618
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:45,340
But what happened to his face?

619
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,010
I guess they had a scuffle due to 
some issues with subcontractors.

620
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,960
Aigoo.

621
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,730
Gosh, this is so upsetting.

622
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,290
Mr. Woo must've been in such a shock.

623
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:06,140
Is there anything else going on?

624
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,360
Yeah.

625
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,220
I'm not sure about that.

626
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,140
But things like this do happen. 
I'm sure Jae Hee will take care of it.

627
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,130
Is that why...

628
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,630
you didn't want to rush into marriage?

629
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,020
Yeah.

630
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,030
Aigoo...

631
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,080
What?

632
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,150
You'll sleep over tonight?

633
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,520
That's right.

634
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,810
How can I leave when 
you just came back from ER?

635
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,130
I'm really fine. Go home, Dad.

636
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,610
I'm more uncomfortable with you here.

637
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,440
What do you mean uncomfortable?

638
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,120
You're Yoo Jae Hee. I'm James.

639
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,660
We got along as roommates
 just fine then.

640
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,530
I'm repaying my debt for that time.

641
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,100
Aigoo, here she goes again.

642
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,240
Is it Mom?

643
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,380
I forgot to call Mom today.

644
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,870
I'll answer it.

645
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,570
Will you be okay?

646
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,500
Of course. I'll get it.

647
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,300
Hi, Mom.

648
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,900
Why are you answering 
your father's phone?

649
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,950
He's in my room right now.

650
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,670
I see. Are you okay?

651
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,870
I dozed off in the early evening, and

652
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,610
I had a strange dream.

653
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,380
Geez...

654
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,280
Look at you, Mom...

655
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,140
What could go wrong?

656
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,820
I had a stomach ache 
from lunch earlier.

657
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,090
- Is your dream about that?
- No.

658
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,480
You know I have a great hunch.

659
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,730
Are you sure everything is fine?

660
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,550
Yeah, I know.

661
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,990
You have a magical hunch, Mom.

662
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:00,460
Is that why you dispatched Dad here?

663
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,940
I'm okay. Nothing's going on, Mom.

664
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,750
Jung Min Jae, do you feel better now?

665
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,450
Yeah, Jae Hee does seem okay.

666
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:18,180
I can't believe you sent me over
 here, so I can't go home.

667
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,210
Yes, good job. I'll go over next time.

668
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,300
It's okay.

669
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,940
It's better for me to come here 
since I work around here.

670
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,320
I'm hanging up. I have to go home now.

671
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,650
All right.

672
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,240
Thanks for...

673
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,420
Gosh, would it be so wrong to 
hear me out before hanging up?

674
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,670
I'm glad that Jae Hee is okay.

675
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,400
Let's go to sleep.

676
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,530
What's with this...

677
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:55,440
cold chill I'm feeling?

678
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,610
Hey, move aside.

679
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,260
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

680
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,350
Move. You can't even breathe well.

681
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,940
Geez...

682
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,130
Yes.

683
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,570
Aigoo.

684
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,570
I think the floor will get cold.

685
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,600
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

686
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,000
I'm okay, Mother. Don't worry.

687
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,770
All right.

688
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,330
Geez.

689
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,750
Hwak Se.

690
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,090
Oh, Noonim.

691
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:52,880
Are you done with your shift 
at the jokbal place?

692
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,460
Yes.

693
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,310
Man Jung got to the hospital okay.

694
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:03,900
Thanks for looking out 
for her this late at night.

695
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,980
You must be tired.
 Go up and get some rest.

696
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,870
Okay, Noonim.

697
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,680
Noonim...

698
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,640
I'm really sorry.

699
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,330
Gosh, don't say that.

700
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:35,200
Why are you sorry about 
dating Man Jung?

701
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:41,510
But I feel so shameless to
 face you, Noonim.

702
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,000
Seriously.

703
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,870
Hwak Se.

704
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,400
You're like my brother.

705
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,690
- Okay?
- Yes, Noonim.

706
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:04,970
I've always thought of you 
as my real brother.

707
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,280
Yes.

708
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,340
I just don't want our precious relationship

709
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,710
to be ruined.

710
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:20,160
I was just saying we should be cautious.

711
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,580
Yes.

712
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,260
Yes, Noonim.

713
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,160
Okay, Hwak Se.

714
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,360
Don't cry.

715
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,230
I'm sorry.

716
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,480
No, don't say that.

717
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,730
Gosh, don't be like that.

718
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,610
Aren't you uncomfortable on the floor?

719
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,550
I told you to sleep on the bed.

720
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,400
I'm fine.

721
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,940
It's warm with the electric blanket.

722
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:59,730
How much is your loss?

723
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:03,510
You must have a loan to
 pay off right away.

724
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:11,450
I think I can help you out.

725
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,590
I'll take care of it.

726
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,220
Hey, you.

727
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,220
You're about to go down.

728
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,460
Why try to save face now?

729
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,310
Is it that important to look good 
in front of your dad?

730
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:28,670
Dad, did you forget our promise?

731
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:32,900
I said I'll never take 
a penny from you, Dad.

732
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,380
Then you must still think that I'm...

733
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,550
Goodnight.

734
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,720
♫  Don't cry  ♫

735
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,840

Unni!

739
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,160
Unni, I made it!

740
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,520
Unni, I got into Seohan 
University medical school!

741
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,840
Man Jung.

742
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,100
- Really?
- Yeah, Unni.

743
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,670
You studied so hard.

744
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,640
I'm so happy for you, Man Jung!

745
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,690
It's all thanks to you, Unni.

746
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,220
Unni, thank you...

747
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,160
for supporting me.

748
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,860
Unni, your suffering is over.

749
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,380
I'll become a doctor and make 
sure to take care of you.

750
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,340
That's not what I want.

751
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,870
My joy is to see you do well.

752
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,200
My sister, I'm so proud of you!

753
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,010
I'm proud of you, Man Jung!

754
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,620

761
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,080
A human being...

762
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,660
shouldn't be ungrateful.

763
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:14,400

I'll pay you back...

- I'm sorry...
- My son...

770
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,910
He's having a nightmare.

771
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:33,530
Jae Hee.

772
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:34,680
Jae Hee.

773
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,330
Jae Hee, wake up.

774
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,560
Are you dreaming? Having a nightmare?

775
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,550
No, it's okay...

780

Park Pil Hong has no reason 
to ruin Jae Hee.

781
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,460
Was he used?

782
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,160
Chairwoman?

783
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,070
 

784
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:50,490
Jae Hee.

785
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,600
  The customer is not 
answering the phone.  

786
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,280
Geez, he's not answering his phone.

787
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,930
- Oh, hi.
- Mr. Woo.

788
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,310
Did you sleep well?

789
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:00,650
Yes, thanks to you.

790
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:04,060
Have you seen Jae Hee, by chance?

791
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,380
He's not upstairs?

792
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,950
Yes.

793
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,390
Good morning, Father.

794
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:12,930
Hi, Chae Woon.

795
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,470
Jae Hee is gone?

796
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:17,370
Yes. He's not in the bathroom, either.

797
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:20,000
I wonder where he went this early.

798
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,710
- I'll try calling him.
- Okay.

799
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:34,960
 Chae Woon, I'm leaving early. 

800
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,390
 I have so much to take care of. 

801
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,210
Why don't you answer?

802
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:56,840
Jae Hee left early because of work.

803
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,790
Yes, I just got a text, too.

804
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:04,710
Mr. Woo didn't even eat breakfast.

805
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:07,570
He must still feel weak.

806
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,220
What should we do, Father?

807
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,420
Even though I want to help him,

808
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,060
he's being stubborn.

809
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,980
He won't even listen to me.

810
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,940
Mr. Woo?

811
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,850
He's such a sweet person, though.

812
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,830
I've been nasty to him before.

813
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:35,450
Actually...

814
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:39,580
there's a big rift between 
Jae Hee and me.

815
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,730
- Is someone here?
- Mr. Woo is here.

816
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,410
Woo Jae Hee?

817
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,550
Oh, my, Jae Hee.

818
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,430
Hello.

819
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,740
I'm sorry to come so early.

820
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,960
What's going on? 
What happened to your face?

821
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,570
Did something happen?

822
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,610
I want to meet Seo Ah. 
I'd like to talk to you, too.

823
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,390
Seo Ah? Why?

824
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,270
Jae Hee oppa.

825
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,090
Oppa, let's talk in the library.

826
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:28,910
No, let's talk here with your mother.

827
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,300
Seo Ah, is he telling the truth?

828
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,950
Is it true that Chairwoman intercepted 
Jae Hee's construction contract?

829
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:45,320
Well? I wouldn't know much about that.

830
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,060
Seo Ah.

831
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,000
This isn't just about my company.

832
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,890
The livelihood of many
 subcontractors is at stake here.

833
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,610
I was going to meet the Chairwoman, but...

834
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:59,340
I'm sure she won't meet me. 
That's why I'm here to see you.

835
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,860
Seo Ah, help me out.

836
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,210
Meet the Chairwoman 
yourself and correct this.

837
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:08,760
Jae Hee, why would 
Chairwoman ruin your deal?

838
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,490
The company that intercepted the contract
 is linked to Chairwoman Lee.

839
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:17,290
And her assistant Hwang Na Ro is 
antagonistic toward Chae Woon.

840
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:20,520
On top of that, the broker is...

841
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,050
- Park Pil Hong.
- Park Pil Hong?

842
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:27,630
Is Park Pil Hong involved in this?

843
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:30,080
Seo Ah, is that true?

844
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:33,550
I said I don't know about this.

845
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,600
Seo Ah.

846
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,320
I didn't do it. I didn't.

847
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,500
Why would I do that?

848
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,530
Why would a company linked to 
the Chairwoman butt in?

849
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,950
- Unless you asked her.
- Why would I?

850
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:51,400
To take it out on you and
 Bit Chae Woon for getting married?

851
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,700
It's not me. I didn't do it!

852
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,390
Jang Seo Ah.

853
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:01,710
How much more would 
you disappoint me?

854
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:03,560
Mom.

855
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:07,740
Why do you make me feel so sad?

856
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,410
Seo Ah...

857
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,110
Just take it out on me.

858
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,230
I'll take everything.

859
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:18,470
But it's wrong to harm other people.

860
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:21,250
Jang Seo Ah.

861
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:25,450
How did you end up so twisted?

862
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,980
Think however you want.

863
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,890
I didn't do anything.

864
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,900
Hey, Seo Ah.

865
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,970
- Seo Ah. Jang Seo Ah!
- Seo Ah!

866
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,920
Mother...

867
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,200
Could you come with me to 
meet the Chairwoman right now?

868
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,680
Of course.

869
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,800
Let me go change. Wait a minute.

870
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,500
 But will you really be okay? 

871
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:12,830
 If Woo Jae Hee loses this 
contract, he can lose everything. 

872
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,800
Chairwoman.

873
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,230
Please help Jae Hee.

874
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:36,760
Jae Hee can't go down like that.

875
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:40,090
It's too much for me to bear

876
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:43,560
to see him in so much pain.

877
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,870
Please straighten out Jae Hee's deal.

878
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:56,090
I know you don't really like me.

879
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,260
But I'm still your granddaughter.

880
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,540
I'm still your blood.

881
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,740
Please help Jae Hee.

882
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,000
Please help me.

883
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,710
Please have pity on me, Grandma.

884
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:25,480
If I help you, how will you repay me?

885
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,700
What do I need to do?

886
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,300
What do you want from me?

887
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:37,170
Tie up your father, Park Pil Hong.

888
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,340
Pardon?

889
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,090
Chase him away to somewhere far away.

890
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:48,030
Have him disappear from my sight.

891
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,010
It looks like...

892
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:54,800
you're the only one who can 
stop him from acting out.

893
00:54:55,850 --> 00:55:00,110
I'll set up your meeting with him.

894
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:05,890
Gosh, they all must be here.

895
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:11,760
This conversation is just 
between you and me.

896
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:17,360
If you straighten out Jae Hee's deal.

897
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,120
You guys, come and sit down.

898
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,010
Chairwoman, I hope you're well.

899
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:51,630
Did you hear everything 
from Chae Woon?

900
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:54,100
I have nothing to do with

901
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,560
you losing your contract.

902
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:00,720
I explained everything to her just now.

903
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,630
Are you sure, Mom?

904
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:05,150
- You didn't...
- What?

905
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:08,420
Did I plot everything using
 Park Pil Hong?

906
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,530
That's what Bit Chae Woon asked, too.

907
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:15,380
Why don't you ask her if I did or not?

908
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,740
Chae Woon, you knew?

909
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,880
About Park Pil Hong's involvement?

910
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,640
So you knew...

911
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,700
that Park Pil Hong was involved.

912
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:40,740
I didn't know you knew as well.

913
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,300
I'm so sorry about it.

914
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,010
Why would you be sorry?

915
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:50,350
You should've told me.

916
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:54,080
It must've been hard for
 you keep it to yourself.

917
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,250
It's all my fault in the end.

918
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,280
Why is that your fault?

919
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,030
Don't think like that.

920
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:12,890
It hurts me the most to see you in pain.

921
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:15,470
Everything else means nothing.

922
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:27,230
Whoa, Mr. Makjang. You look well now.

923
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:28,740
Of course, I'm well now.

924
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:31,170
Have you heard?
 I'm "Made of steel, Joon Ah."

925
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:34,750
You know that this is all thanks
 to my porridge, right?

926
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,120
- I did almost die, though.
- You did?

927
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,080
I mean, I almost died sick.

928
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,790
I knew it. So I made more porridge.

929
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,790
Don't feel so grateful. 
Be sure to eat it for lunch.

930
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:49,410
Why, why make more porridge...

931
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,700
Wait, are you trying to kill me?

932
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,000
Hae Dean, I'm all well now. 
I don't need that porridge.

933
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,270
I'm fine. I'm well now.

934
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:58,010
My mom said you could get sick again
 just when you think you're all well.

935
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,670
Why, why, why?

936
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:04,690
- Go in. Hurry. 
- Why?

937
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:11,920
What should I do about Seo Ah?

938
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,210
- What?
- Wait.

939
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:31,650
Oh, my goodness.

940
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,350
He's not answering again.

941
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,760
 

942
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,830
What? What is it?

943
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:58,220
What is it?

944
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:13,720
At times like this...

945
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,580
people usually kiss and stuff...

946
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,060
- Kiss...
 - Gosh!

947
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,460
Why say that out loud?

948
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,930
Geez!

949
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,200
Yes, Chairwoman.

950
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,840
I'm here.

951
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,900
Are you in a room?

952
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:40,280
Chairwoman, did you lie to me?

953
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,860
Hello?

954
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:50,220
I had no idea.

955
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,740
I was just asked to take the job, 
so I went there.

956
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,340
I found out when I got there.

957
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,790
If you found out there, you shouldn't
 have signed the contract.

958
00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:59,840
The contract work was
 already in the works.

959
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,820
I just carried out the errand.

960
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,330
I heard that you even stole...

961
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:10,120
a blueprint from Jae Hee's office.

962
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,830
What? Who told you that?

963
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:14,210
Did Mr. Woo say that? Did Chairwoman?

964
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,480
No, I didn't.

965
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,620
Why would I do that?

966
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:20,210
Seo Yeon, don't worry.

967
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:21,880
I'll straighten out everything.

968
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,610
I'm talking to the Chairwoman.

969
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:27,010
I have a weapon 
I'm holding over her head.

970
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,900
- What could that be?
- A voice recording.

971
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,570
A voice recording that proves that

972
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:38,600
she deceived me, your mom 
Jung Won, and stole you away.

973
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,410
Do you think that'll work on her?

974
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:42,800
Why wouldn't it?

975
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,780
She's scared of it, and that's why 
she said she'd fund my business.

976
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:48,060
Do you think she's afraid of that?

977
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:51,480
She set the trap and is 
trying to entrap you.

978
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,820
Seo Yeon, don't think like that.

979
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,370
I have a plan.

980
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,590
I'm an expert in my field.

981
01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:00,600
And Mr. Woo must be in shock 
due to losing the contract.

982
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,750
But it's okay.

983
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,500
Mr. Woo's family is rich.

984
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,130
His father wouldn't 
just sit back and watch.

985
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:08,800
This isn't that simple.

986
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,880
Jae Hee is hurting inside out.

987
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,200
Don't you consider the 
suffering he's experiencing?

988
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,360
Don't you consider other people 
who are hurting over this?

989
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:24,540
I'll repay all the money Mr. Woo lost.

990
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:28,770
I have two awesome business 
ideas in mind right now.

991
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:32,270
- If I could launch them...
 - Park Pil Hong!

992
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,450
Don't ever show up in front
 of the Chairwoman again.

993
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:40,090
Not in front of us, either.

994
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:42,440
Then Chairwoman said...

995
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,540
she'll straighten out
 Jae Hee's contract issue.

996
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,430
Gosh, you're so naive, my daughter.

997
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:50,140
You believe what that granny 
said? She's lying to you.

998
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,290
She's scared that I might 
open up my mouth.

999
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:55,450
She's using you to get rid 
of me, that old woman.

1000
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:57,110
Please!

1001
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:03,310
Fine.

1002
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:06,680
Let's say I'm your daughter.

1003
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,900
Just once in your life...

1004
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:14,810
Please just once in your life...

1005
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:17,270
could you do that for me?

1006
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:19,620
I beg you.

1007
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,470
If you need money, I'll send it to you.

1008
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:25,770
I'll send you all my paychecks.

1009
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:27,410
So, please, I beg you.

1010
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,020
Please...

1011
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:32,450
Please disappear. Don't show up again.

1012
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,670
Please, I beg you.

1013
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:37,480
Geez...

1014
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:41,280
You don't make that much. 
How can you tell me to live off of that?

1015
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,150
Just get your name on
 your mom's family registry.

1016
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,460
That big company could
 become yours someday.

1017
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,850
You have a long work experience. 
Why are you so naive?

1018
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:54,320
Then...

1019
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:58,590
you're saying you can't do what I ask?

1020
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:01,690
Of course, I can't. That's nonsense.

1021
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:04,810
Seo Yeon, just trust your dad.

1022
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:07,750
I'll get back on my feet real quick.

1023
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:30,490
Seo Yeon.

1024
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,040
I'm ashamed that you're my father.

1025
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:44,180
Seo Yeon.

1026
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,290
Seo Yeon...

1027
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:22,980
 

1028
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:27,910
Hi, Chief Yoo.

1029
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:33,390
Can I get the number for 
Jae Hee's cop friend Min Chul?

1030
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:41,010
I have to report someone.

1031
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:45,940
Yes, thank you.

1032
01:04:56,110 --> 01:05:00,710
 

1033
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:14,150
Geez, she speaks so viciously, 
just like her mom.

1034
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:18,730
Park Pil Hong?

1035
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,110
Hey!

1036
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:34,010
Park Pil Hong, you're under
 arrest for bribery and fraud.

1037
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:22,230
♫  Did you forget? 
Did you forget about me?  ♫

1038
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:27,910
♫  Did you forget all those memories  ♫

1039
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:33,460
♫  My heart is opening arms to you  ♫

1040
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:39,360
♫  I'm barely going through today  ♫

1041
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:44,860
♫  When the memories are fading  ♫

1042
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:50,470
♫  I stand on the street 
where we walked together  ♫

1043
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:56,030
♫  I'm trying to erase it again and again  ♫

1044
01:06:56,030 --> 01:07:00,490
♫  But I can still hear you 
breathing on my ear  ♫

1045
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:06,310
♫  Did you forget?
 Did you forget about me?  ♫

1046
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:11,610
♫   I'm still waiting for you  ♫

1047
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:17,450
♫  My love is crying  ♫

1048
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:24,080
♫  My heart is filled with tears  ♫

1049
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:29,930
♫  I'm trying to erase it again and again  ♫

1050
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:35,680
♫  But I keep thinking of your face  ♫

1051
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,890
 

1052
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:47,480
 - Jae Hee.
- Mom. 

1053
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:49,430
 Did you get hurt? Who hit you? 

1054
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:51,090
 What happened? 

1055
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:53,250
 - Mom...
- Mother. 

1056
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:56,020
 I stole a blueprint from 
Woo Jae Hee's office? 

1057
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:58,430
 Let me meet Chairwoman 
Lee Choon Seok from LX Fashion. 

1058
01:07:58,430 --> 01:07:59,970
 She says she doesn't know you. 

1059
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:02,700
 It'd be good if he rots in jail this way. 

1060
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,140
 But it could come back to us. 

1061
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,380
 I won't let that happen. 

1062
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:07,400
 I won't be pressing charges against him. 

1063
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,850
 I ask for leniency. 

1064
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:10,370
 Jae Hee, what are you doing right now? 

1065
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:12,560
 Whose name are you trying to clear? 

1066
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,140
 If you do this, I can't be with you. 

1067
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:16,370
 Chae Woon. 

1068
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:19,350
 Why don't we try to stay apart for now? 

1069
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:21,399
♫  Did you forget?  ♫
