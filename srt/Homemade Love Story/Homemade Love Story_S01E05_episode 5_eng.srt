1
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,090
- I'm home.
 - Pervert! 

2
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,800
What's that?

3
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,360
Who's that?

4
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,760
 Hey, you! 

5
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,150
Hey, who's this jerk?

6
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,350
Who is this?

7
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,160
- Who are you?
- What's going on?

8
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,630
Who the hell are you?

9
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,180
What?

10
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,640
Who are you?

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,600
The owner of 
a construction company?

12
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,170
 
 Oh, my.

13
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,770
But why is he renting a room here?

14
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,190
I don't know. I guess...

15
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,250
he sold his house to put into
 his business or something.

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,100
My gosh.

17
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,410
Are you okay?

18
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,450
Would you be okay if you were me?

19
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,270
I guess you would be since
 you have a hard head.

20
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,790
- What did you say?
- Oh, my.

21
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,720
How did you know 
my sister has a hard head?

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,280
Excuse me!

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,590
Okay, let me take a look.

24
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,800
Wait. What are you doing?

25
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,080
She's a doctor. A doctor.

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,420
Yeah, I'm a doctor.

27
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,970
You hit your head hard 
earlier. Let me look.

28
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,500
No, no. I'm all right.

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,660
Then, how many fingers
 do you see?

30
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,060
You're okay?

31
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,040
Did you injure anywhere else?

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,840
Doesn't his nose look 
a bit crooked?

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,390
Wait, wait a minute.

34
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,620
I'm really okay.

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,630
You said you weren't.

36
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,790
I'm okay.

37
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,200
Why are you getting angry?

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,720
He's entitled to get angry.

39
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,150
You struck him with a plunger.

40
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,740
You should be glad 
his head didn't crack.

41
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,800
Right.

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,060
Aigoo...

43
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,740
Everyone's here.

44
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,160
Oh, my. You're here, Mr. Woo.

45
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,470
It must be him.

46
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,710
Hello. I'm Kim Hwak Se, 
and I live upstairs...

47
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,470
- Ahjumma!
 - Mom! 

48
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,480
Huh?

49
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,320
We just saw too much of him...

50
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,660
Geez...

51
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,390
- What?
- Why are you so down?

52
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,690
Gosh, I thought I sent a group text.

53
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,260
Unni.

54
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,170
You have to press "send."

55
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,270
What's the use in typing
 the text? Because of you...

56
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,760
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,340
Gosh, Mom. You did 
this last time, too.

58
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,410
My boss happened to 
come in right then.

59
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,060
So, how did you find out 
about our Samgwang Villa?

60
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,700
You sold him the idea, huh?

61
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,130
- What?
- Oh, no.

62
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,900
There was a leak at 
the Yeonhuidong house,

63
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,910
and Mr. Woo came over to fix it.

64
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,790
And the realtor happened 
to call me about a tenant.

65
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,150
By chance, were you 
eating something then?

66
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,910
Some food that Noonim prepared?

67
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,200
How did you know that?

68
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,250
Ahjumma, do you rent out rooms?

69
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,270
Yeah, I run a housing facility.

70
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,710
I rent out a room,

71
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,720
and I provide meals, laundry, 
and cleaning services.

72
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,110
But strangely, I can't seem to 
find any tenants these days.

73
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,850
- Right then! 
- You asked her, right, ahjussi?

74
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,500
- I'm not an ahjussi.
- Yeah, you are.

75
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,150
"If I rent a room from you..."

76
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,530
If I rent a room from you,

77
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,660
do I get to eat like this every day?

78
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,260
Aigoo, it may not be a feast,

79
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,660
but I prepare with all my care.

80
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,930
I make sure you can eat like this.

81
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,800
See?

82
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,420
Noonim's cooking skill 
worked this time, too!

83
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,610
I totally fell for ahjumma's
 cooking skills.

84
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,190
Aigoo.

85
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,700
Gosh, you're just 
being nice, Mr. Woo.

86
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,380
- Here, eat.
- Yes.

87
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,010
Right. Some people have never 
tasted my mom's cooking,

88
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,940
but no one can stop 
eating her food just once.

89
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,850
It's unforgettable. 
They always come back.

90
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,300
- Yeah, right.
- Yes, you're right.

91
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,140
He's the gluttonous one.

92
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,600
Okay, in any case...

93
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,880
the newbie at the Samgwang Villa.

94
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,270
What's your name?

95
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,690
Yes, I'm Woo Jae Hee.

96
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,430
With Yoo Jae Hee...

97
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,000
 Not "Yoo." It's "Woo." 

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,830
Not Yoo, but Woo.

99
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,870
- It's Woo.
- All right, all right.

100
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,570
With Mr. Woo Jae Hee,

101
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,090
we'll toast and 
welcome him! Cheers!

102
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,310
 Welcome! 

103
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,610
- Thank you!
 - Welcome, Mr. Woo! 

104
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,320
Oh, yeah. I have an announcement.

105
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,350
Yes, Unni. You have good news.
 What is it?

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,900
Hey.

107
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,500
Did you settle the
 plagiarism issue?

108
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,690
Yeah.

109
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,740
That's great!

110
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,260
Thanks, Auntie.

111
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,300
I'll start working at LX Fashion

112
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,960
as an intern.

113
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,160
Oh, my gosh!

114
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,810
Whoa.

115
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,580
LX Fashion. I know them...

116
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,200
♫  Congratulations!  ♫

117
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,780
♫  Congratulations!  ♫
Bit Chae Woon, my goodness.

118
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,400
Unni, I'll congratulate you!

119
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,750
- You did great!
- Let go of me.

120
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,120
Congrats.

121
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,850
Gosh, Mom...

122
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,840
Oh, yeah. Unni, how about 
studying in the States?

123
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,670
Oh, they'll decide depending on 
my performance as an intern.

124
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,850
- Done. It's a done deal.
- You're so lucky!

125
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,190
Hey, I don't know that yet.

126
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,490
- I have to do well.
- You do well already.

127
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,330
♫  You say you don't know, 
you have to do well  ♫

128
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,080
♫  But you'll be great  ♫

129
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,120
♫  You say you don't know, 
you have to do well  ♫

130
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,230
♫  You'll really be great  ♫

131
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,460
♫  And...  ♫

132
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,390
♫  We welcome you  ♫

133
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,390
Congrats! Congrats!

134
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,450
Thank you!

135
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,740
Okay, let's eat.

136
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,410
Oh, yes. Here, Mr. Woo Jae Hee.

137
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,400
 

138
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,300
 

139
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,050
 The competition winners
 will start tomorrow. 

140
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,930
How do I face Bit Chae Woon?

141
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,780
And Jae Hee oppa 
doesn't even call me.

142
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,900
If he doesn't call, I'll just go over.

143
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,140
- Was it Ra Hoon?
- Yes, Hyung.

144
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,850
- Thanks for your help.
- Don't mention it.

145
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,280
Aigoo...

146
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,320
You don't have that much stuff.

147
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,580
I have more, but I'll bring
 them over tomorrow.

148
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,970
It's at the office storage.

149
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,290
I'll help you.

150
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,620
It's not that much.

151
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,870
Noonim says you lived
 in a motel all this time.

152
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,370
Yes.

153
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,430
You lost everything, huh?

154
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,120
Well, it's not that.

155
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,290
Life is like that.

156
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,020
With sunny days, 
there will be cloudy days.

157
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,570
And with cloudy days, 
there will be sunny days.

158
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,030
You know, in my heyday...

159
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,300
Gosh, seriously...

160
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,970
Why are you trying to lie?

161
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,570
I came to get this.

162
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,770
Auntie, are you moving
 into Mom's room?

163
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,500
What else could I do?

164
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,370
Gosh, I'll be able to sleep
 soundly from now on.

165
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,880
Look who's talking.

166
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,430
Speak for yourself.

167
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,630
That's what I just said.

168
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,130
Oh, young man.

169
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,640
You can't get a refund on 
the rent you paid in advance.

170
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,860
Excuse me?

171
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,250
Auntie, take this, too.

172
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,980
Can't get a refund on the rent...

173
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,800
Just shut your ears.

174
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,350
Don't worry about it.

175
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,940
So, do your parents
 live separately?

176
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,480
Yes.

177
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,830
Whoa...

178
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,500
How did you lose everything?

179
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,240
 The number you dialed 
does not exist. 

180
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,290
 Please check and dial again. 

181
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,230
That's strange.

182
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,020
 

183
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,960
Hi, ahjumma. This is Jae Hee.

184
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,550
Excuse me?

185
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,640
You quit working at our house?

186
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,740
When?

187
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,500
Jung Min Jae.

188
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,730
I'll bet 100 won on

189
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,770
you coming home tonight.

190
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,750
Everything tastes so good today.

191
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,360
 

192
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,790
I knew it.

193
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,310
What?

194
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,070
 Please put Mom on the phone. 

195
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,690
What for?

196
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,320
I can't get through on her phone.

197
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,180
 Her phone is broken. 

198
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,520
It says her number doesn't exist.

199
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,750
I told her to change her number.

200
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,530
 Let me talk to Mom. 

201
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,530
She's sleeping.

202
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,950
Mom wouldn't be 
sleeping this early...

203
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,610
Hello?

204
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,300
  The customer is not 
answering the phone. 

205
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,090
Geez, seriously!

206
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,680
I knew it.

207
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,800
I know they're together,

208
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,480
yet she's making him 
call me to test me.

209
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,660
What do you take me for?

210
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,600
I'm sitting on top of your heads.

211
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,780
It's tasty.

212
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,820
What's going on?

213
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,430
Why would she 
change her number...

214
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,620
Geez, I wish Mom 
would call me first.

215
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,840
What are you doing out here?

216
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,450
Oh, your girlfriend.

217
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,830
What?

218
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,460
I won't disturb you.

219
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,760
Go ahead and talk.

220
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm done talking.

221
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,880
I see.

222
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,360
Hold on...

223
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,070
Congratulations again.

224
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,030
For getting into LX Fashion.

225
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,680
- Actually, I know that company...
- Well...

226
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,570
I also welcome you once 
again to Samgwang Villa.

227
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,400
Then are you done working
 on our project now?

228
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
No.

229
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,700
I started working 
on the tiles already.

230
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,660
I'll be sure to finish 
that after work.

231
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,650
That goes without saying.

232
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,900
You asked to join us on the
 remodeling and another project.

233
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,960
You said no.

234
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,430
When did I? I said
 I'd think about it.

235
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,350
Then you'll let me join you?

236
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,690
Then I'll do it.

237
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,900
But in the evenings.

238
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,400
After work hours.

239
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,720
What will you do about
 your burning ambition?

240
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,170
Or is it greed?

241
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,120
Whoa, what a showoff.

242
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,520
I know you're saying this because

243
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,370
I don't need the work, right?

244
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,880
How did you know that?

245
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,510
You're getting a call.

246
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,730
 

247
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,600
Yeah.

248
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,330
- You said you were done talking.
- Why?

249
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,820
Oppa, did you move?

250
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,240
Hey, how do you know that?

251
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,460
What?

252
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,050
Why did you go there?

253
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,550
I hadn't heard from you,

254
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,450
and I was feeling down. 
So I came to your place.

255
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,870
 But someone else was living 
there. I was so shocked. 

256
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,930
 How could I know 
that you had moved? 

257
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,150
When did you move?

258
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,450
Where did you move to?

259
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,970
 

260
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,680
100,000 won...

261
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,940
 Let's share. 

262
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,440
 Well, I... 

263
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,410
Hey!

264
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,240
Geez, come on!

265
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,130
What is it?

266
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,290
- What are you hiding?
- What?

267
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,730
- Why?
- It's nothing.

268
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,450
- What is it?
- Get away from me!

269
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,410
- What is it? Show me!
- It's nothing!

270
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,900
Geez...

271
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,750
Why is it so heavy?

272
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,210
Geez.

273
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,900
Aigoo.

274
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,530
Ouch.

275
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,160
Let's turn off the light.

276
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,980
Geez.

277
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,500
Aigoo.

278
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,900
Ow!

279
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,010
Ow, that hurts!

280
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,880
Ow! That hurts!

281
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,010
You can run, but you can't hide.

282
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,320
Wait until you get home.

283
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,700
Geez.

284
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,420
Geez, seriously.

285
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,270
Jung Min Jae.

286
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,300
Geez! That Jung Min Jae!

287
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,330
How can he not 
tell you he moved?

288
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,470
Isn't Jae Hee...

289
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,750
just thinking of you as
 his friend's sister?

290
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,850
Jae Hee oppa can be stern.

291
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,420
He takes after his father.

292
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,010
Seo Ah...

293
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,010
I know what you're going to say.

294
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,650
"No matter how tough it is,

295
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,400
don't rely too much 
on your boyfriend.

296
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,900
You shouldn't show
 your weak side."

297
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,080
Gosh, so you know.

298
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,430
You know when to push or
 let go when it comes to work.

299
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,440
Why can't you do that
 with Jae Hee?

300
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,680
Well, you know...

301
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,740
I missed Jae Hee oppa since 
I was feeling down today.

302
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,800
Are you...

303
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,790
that bothered by her

304
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,770
coming in to work tomorrow?

305
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,400
Lee Bit Chae Woon.

306
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,120
Seo Ah,

307
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,340
let's look further ahead.

308
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,420
To completely get over 
her shadowing over you,

309
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,150
this is the best way. Okay?

310
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,240
Okay.

311
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,900
Endure.

312
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,090
Let's survive, Bit Chae Woon.

313
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,800
Seriously.

314
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,100
Geez!

315
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,200
Gosh, come on.

316
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,630
How can he snore so loud?

317
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,120
 Hey! 

318
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,630
Geez!

319
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,400
Gosh...

320
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,010
Gosh, seriously.

321
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,800
Aigoo.

322
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,800
Aigoo, seriously.

323
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,500
Gosh.

324
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,900
Aigoo...

325
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,100
Aigoo...

326
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,390
My goodness.

327
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,540
Aigoo.

328
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,010
My daughter.

329
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,670
I'm so proud of you.

330
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,940
My gosh.

331
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,570
Goodness.

332
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,920
 

333
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,200
It's my first day at work.

334
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,940
Mom.

335
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,640
Put them over there.

336
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,980
Okay, here.

337
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,560
Over there.

338
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,070
Set the table.

339
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,300
Mom, you ironed my clothes.

340
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,540
Of course. It's my daughter's
 first day at work.

341
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,740
You should look clean cut.

342
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,210
What clothes? You only 
bought her clothes, huh?

343
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,000
Aigoo, I didn't. She had them.

344
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,430
Here, Chae Woon.

345
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,300
Let's stay strong.

346
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,520
Me, too. Me, too. Me, too.

347
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,570
- Give me some, too.
- Aigoo!

348
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,630
She's always like that.

349
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,170
She's even envious 
about taking vitamins.

350
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,300
Stay strong.

351
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,000
Good morning!

352
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,220
Good morning!

353
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,860
Good morning.

354
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,240
I see. Now that I see
 your face, Noonim...

355
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,900
I can tell you couldn't sleep at her 
because of you-know-who.

356
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,290
What are you saying?

357
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,270
Good morning.

358
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,790
- Aigoo.
- Good morning, ahjussi.

359
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,250
Did you sleep well?

360
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,390
I guess you couldn't sleep.

361
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,240
Excuse me, Ahjumma.

362
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,910
Yes, Mr. Woo?

363
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,100
- You know the rent I paid you?
- Mr. Woo.

364
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,790
Mr. Woo, try this.

365
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,120
Here, radish kimchi.

366
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,460
Try it. Here.

367
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,410
It's so good!

368
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,110
Aigoo, braised cutlass.

369
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,360
What about the rent?

370
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,450
What?

371
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,300
Oh, nothing.

372
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,700
It's so tasty.

373
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,600
Is it?

374
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,290
Chae Woon!

375
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,870
Chae Woon.

376
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,020
- Wait, wait.
- What now?

377
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,730
Aigoo, this.

378
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,490
You have to blow this.

379
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,650
Mom, we'll use up all your
 lucky petals at this rate.

380
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,130
It's an important day.

381
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,160
- Blow.
- All right.

382
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,970
- Here.
- Two, three.

383
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,170
Let my Chae Woon do a good 
job at work starting today.

384
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,280
And please let her 
meet a nice man at work.

385
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,650
To be a good writer,

386
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,890
you have to know Korean well.

387
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,400
So I got this for you.

388
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,730
 

389
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,760
It's a gift.

390
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,650
 

391
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,950
Jung Hoo oppa.

392
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,480
You're doing well, right?

393
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,400
Darn it.

394
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,460
Why didn't you wake me up?

395
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,370
This woman...

396
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,250
 

397
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,280
 The number you dialed 
does not exist. 

398
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,290
 Please check and dial again. 

399
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,890
Fine, do you think I'd 
care if you do this?

400
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,910
Fine.

401
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,650
Go for it. Let's do it.

402
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,800
What the heck?

403
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,510
Who ate all this?

404
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,100
Wait.

405
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,800
Geez.

406
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,920
Geez, come on.

407
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,850
Geez, seriously!

408
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,020
Depending on your performance,

409
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,700
only one person will get 
a chance to study in the States.

410
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,890
As you know, there were two 
grand prize winners this time.

411
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,690
Can't you send us both?

412
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,390
They have only one spot available.

413
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,910
Please do your best.

414
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,270
Director, they're interns 
who are starting today.

415
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,560
Welcome.

416
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,180
Let's work well together.

417
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,540
Hello.

418
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,280
- Hello.
- I spoke to Professor Pierre yesterday.

419
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,270
I see.

420
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,400
It's nice to know you studied
 under the same professor.

421
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,760
Thank you in advance.

422
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,980
How long have you 
been back in Korea?

423
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,070
- About a month.
- I see.

424
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,640
- Ahjumma, you dropped this.
- Yes.

425
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,720
Thank you.

426
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,400
It's still hard for me
 to get used to...

427
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,580
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

428
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,490
Excuse me. Director!

429
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,300
Ahjumma, by chance...

430
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,910
No, it's okay.

431
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,720
Are you okay?

432
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,700
Didn't you get hurt? Let me see.

433
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,980
- I'm okay.
- CEO!

434
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,070
CEO!

435
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,260
Are you okay?

436
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,090
- I'm okay.
- Your hand...

437
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,440
I'm so sorry.

438
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,010
- I'm sorry. 
- Bit Chae Woon.

439
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,940
Did you lose your ID?

440
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,670
I haven't gotten one yet.

441
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,930
If you haven't,

442
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,080
you should be alert and 
follow your sunbaes.

443
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,850
What are you doing? 
This is so dangerous.

444
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,300
My apologies.

445
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,660
Manager In.

446
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,970
It's her first day here. You 
should've taken care of her.

447
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,210
My apologies, CEO.

448
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,790
- Ask for medical staff...
- No, I'm fine.

449
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,500
Everyone, I'm sorry
 for alarming you.

450
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,090
Let's get back to work, everyone.

451
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,370
I'm fine.

452
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,620
Are you sure you're okay?

453
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,500
Gosh, I'm fine.

454
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,290
You were overreacting
 in front of the staff.

455
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,910
You're the one who overreacted.

456
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,320
If a random person saw you,

457
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,800
they'd think you're 
Bit Chae Woon's mom.

458
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,160
What do you mean mom?

459
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,740
I acted intuitively, seeing 
that she might get hurt.

460
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,530
That's what I mean.

461
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,720
Why does your intuition kick in?

462
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,490
Especially for Bit Chae Woon.

463
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,550
Not again.

464
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,160
You said you'd deal 
with this bravely.

465
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,460
And I am like a mom if 
you want to get technical.

466
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,800
She's our employee.

467
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,320
As the CEO,

468
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,470
I should look after my employees
 like they're my children.

469
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,610
I got it.

470
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,200
Aigoo, my daughter is so cute.

471
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,620
Our upcoming F/W concept

472
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,090
is vintage.

473
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,130
Using texture and technique,

474
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,690
I want to liven up the 
vintage look and feel.

475
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,850
What would be appropriate?

476
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,100
Please share your thoughts.

477
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,200
Well...

478
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,180
how about we utilize embroidery?

479
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,890
The patches or computerized 
embroideries do look clean,

480
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,190
but I don't think it will 
have the vintage feel.

481
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,870
And how about we place the 
logo on the upper left arm?

482
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,780
Then you can accentuate the side.

483
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,610
Bit Chae Woon.

484
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,860
I liked your thoughts.

485
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,980
CEO is very complimentary of you.

486
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,650
Thank you.

487
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,300
So I was thinking...

488
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,810
I'd like you to research and put

489
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,070
a presentation together 
on what we discussed.

490
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,790
Do you think you can do that?

491
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,330
By the day after tomorrow.

492
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,860
Yes, I'll give it a shot.

493
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,360
Great.

494
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,910
Give her the materials.

495
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:42,570
They're various brand
 collections in the country.

496
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,320
You should start by 
figuring out the trend first.

497
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,650
Then I look forward to it.

498
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,480
Impressive, my friend.

499
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,090
All right, good day.

500
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,800
Following the third quarter,

501
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,360
we also have a new product launch
 planned in the fourth quarter.

502
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,630
We'll see continued sales...

503
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,840
President.

504
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,410
Do you have something to say?

505
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,740
You know, right?

506
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,600
What do you mean?

507
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,500
You know.

508
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,100
Oh, I see.

509
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,610
Daebon Furniture?

510
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,070
I was going to brief you on 
that after I review first...

511
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,500
Not that.

512
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,010
Then what...

513
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,660
Jae Hee's mom.

514
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,650
Is something the
 matter with Noona?

515
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,650
 Does he not know? 

516
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,760
Nothing. You can go now.

517
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,410
Okay.

518
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,500
 

519
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,570
 The number you dialed 
does not exist. 

520
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,330
 Please check and dial again. 

521
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,620
 The number you dialed 
does not exist. 

522
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,530
 Please check and dial again. 

523
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,510
The number doesn't exist?

524
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,770
Wait.

525
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,020
 

526
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,200
 The line is currently busy.  

527
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,250
 You'll be connected to the voicemail.  

528
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,300
 

529
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,970
 - The line is currently busy. 
- Geez, who is he talking to?

530
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,950
Geez, why is he on
 the phone for so long?

531
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,790
- Uncle.
- Hey, man!

532
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,060
Why were you on 
the phone for so long?

533
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,610
Calling me?

534
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,180
You don't know, either?

535
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,440
Then...

536
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,980
you, too?

537
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,470
Min Suk doesn't know...

538
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,590
and Jae Hee doesn't know, either.

539
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,500
If that's the case...

540
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,430
 Goodbye, Woo Jung Hoo. 

541
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,990
 I'm out of here. 

542
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,030
Did this woman really...

543
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,300
Geez, no, no.

544
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,590
She can't do anything.

545
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,390
She'll suffer through and through

546
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,580
and crawl back home.

547
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,470
See if I take her back.

548
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,020
Geez, darn it!

549
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,700
Darn.

550
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,780
Jae, Jae, Jae Hee...

551
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,950
Hurry, come.

552
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,250
So...

553
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,120
Noona told you not
 to worry about her?

554
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,040
Yes.

555
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,790
I thought she was just 
saying that at the time,

556
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,980
but I think it was a declaration 
now that I think about it.

557
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,030
She did. She sure did.

558
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,320
She left home.

559
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,470
- She left home?
- No.

560
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,760
If she left on her own,

561
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,860
that'd be good.

562
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,200
What?

563
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,670
By chance...

564
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,590
- did Jung Hoo?
- Get out!

565
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,170
Get out right this minute!

566
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,830
Honey, I'm sorry.

567
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,700
Please forgive me this once.

568
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,510
I don't need you! Get out!

569
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,200
Hey, hey, hey.

570
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,890
- I'll... I'll just...
- Jae, Jae Hee...

571
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,750
You can't approach him
 rashly at times like this.

572
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,940
What if something 
happened to Mom?

573
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,890
- Let go.
- Jae Hee...

574
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,120
 Jae Hee and Min Suk, I'm fine. 

575
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,550
 Don't be fussy and wait for me. 

576
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,460
- Mom.
- Noona?

577
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,540
  - The call is not going through. 
- Geez, hang up!

578
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,710
You hang up, Uncle!

579
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,580
  - The customer is not answering... 
- Geez, come on!

580
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,630
 Don't call me. 

581
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,510
 I'm really fine. 

582
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,550
 I'll be back. 

583
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,060
Geez, Mom...

584
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,800
♫  I'm a beautiful girl, 
I'm a beautiful girl  ♫

585
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,900
♫  Beauty is my weapon  ♫

586
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,620
♫  I'm a beautiful girl  ♫

587
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,350
♫  I'm a beautiful girl  ♫

588
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,230
♫  Everyone loves me  ♫

589
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,860
♫  I'm a beautiful girl  ♫

590
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:30,000
♫  I'm a beautiful girl  ♫

591
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,670
♫  I'm a beautiful girl  ♫

592
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:39,600
♫  I'm a beautiful girl  ♫

593
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,010
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

594
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,730
- Good day.
- Thank you.

595
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,170
Yes, I'm busy.

596
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,260
Are you busy, too?

597
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,000
My gosh.

598
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:06,757
I shouldn't make 
deliveries to this area.

599
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:25,607
 This scent. 

600
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:27,237
Hi.

601
00:35:28,747 --> 00:35:30,497
Oh, hi.

602
00:35:30,497 --> 00:35:31,877
Hello.

603
00:35:31,877 --> 00:35:33,247
Are you free?

604
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:35,267
Am I free...

605
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:38,347
The time...

606
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:41,077
Well, I should go back...

607
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:49,287
 

608
00:35:50,587 --> 00:35:52,757
- Business school?
- Pardon?

609
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,607
- Well, I'm actually...
- I see.

610
00:35:56,607 --> 00:35:58,577
Business school?

611
00:35:58,577 --> 00:36:00,007
Register.

612
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:02,707
- Register? I don't want to...
- Sign here.

613
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:04,487
Well, I don't have the time...

614
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:05,797
Why not?

615
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,877
You just have to sign here.

616
00:36:30,877 --> 00:36:32,977
Sign? Okay.

617
00:36:37,677 --> 00:36:39,417
Sign.

618
00:36:43,687 --> 00:36:46,577
- I see. Lee Ra Hoon.
- Lee Ra Hoon.

619
00:36:46,577 --> 00:36:48,027
Hey, Cha Ba Reun.

620
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:49,117
Test him.

621
00:36:49,117 --> 00:36:51,057
What test are you talking about?

622
00:36:55,477 --> 00:36:56,877
A beginner!

623
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,197
Manager, you promised.

624
00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:09,247
You said you'll let me
 try out for Trot Girls.

625
00:37:09,247 --> 00:37:10,847
It looks like they're meeting today.

626
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:12,367
Why didn't you tell me?

627
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:13,797
Is that right?

628
00:37:13,797 --> 00:37:15,757
You saw the trot video 
clip I put together.

629
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:17,057
You said it looked good.

630
00:37:17,057 --> 00:37:18,737
Well, there are so
 many candidates.

631
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:19,937
Shall we talk later?

632
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,167
You can't do this.

633
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:23,467
You put me through a wringer,
 saying I can be a trainee.

634
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:25,657
I won't stay put this way.

635
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:26,937
Do whatever you want.

636
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:29,167
Hae Deun, where are you going?

637
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:30,367
To the CEO's office.

638
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:32,237
I'll make an official complaint.

639
00:37:32,237 --> 00:37:33,987
Hae Deun! Lee Hae Deun!

640
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:39,977
 I'll put you in as 
a candidate for now. 

641
00:37:39,997 --> 00:37:41,847
 You do the rest. 

642
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:44,087
Just watch me.

643
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:56,587
 There are probably around 
30 people only for today. 

644
00:37:56,587 --> 00:37:58,787
 There will be 30 more tomorrow. 

645
00:37:58,787 --> 00:38:01,107
 You realize you're the oldest, right? 

646
00:38:01,107 --> 00:38:02,767
 Work hard. 

647
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:06,677
 Only five members out of 
these people for Trot Girls. 

648
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:09,227
 You have to make that 
five, Lee Hae Deun. 

649
00:38:09,227 --> 00:38:10,777
Hae Deun.

650
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:12,257
You can move these.

651
00:38:14,317 --> 00:38:15,477
What are you doing?

652
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:18,617
I'm here as a trainee.

653
00:38:20,177 --> 00:38:22,777
What trainee? For this group?

654
00:38:23,827 --> 00:38:24,837
 No way. 

655
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:28,287
 What a joke. 

656
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:31,567
A trainee?

657
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:33,227
Oh, my. Really?

658
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,627
A trainee?

659
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:36,467
- Aigoo. 
 - Yeah, Mom. 

660
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:39,047
I'm so happy that I'm crying.

661
00:38:39,047 --> 00:38:40,707
 Hae Deun. 

662
00:38:40,707 --> 00:38:42,307
Don't cry.

663
00:38:42,307 --> 00:38:43,987
It's wonderful.

664
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:45,547
Hey, Hae Deun, 
it's Uncle Hwak Se.

665
00:38:45,547 --> 00:38:47,267
Congratulations! Really!

666
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:48,727
 Thanks, Uncle. 

667
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,807
But I'm just a candidate right now.

668
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:52,757
There are so many people.

669
00:38:53,617 --> 00:38:56,047
Yeah, they'll eliminate 
among these people.

670
00:38:56,047 --> 00:39:00,087
Aigoo, everything will 
work out this time.

671
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:03,007
So, work hard no matter what.

672
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,867
 - No matter what. 
- Gather around.

673
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:06,727
Mom, I have to go.

674
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:08,937
Okay. Go in now.

675
00:39:08,937 --> 00:39:11,387
Good luck, my daughter.

676
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:12,637
Fighting!

677
00:39:13,547 --> 00:39:15,457
Aigoo, seriously.

678
00:39:15,457 --> 00:39:16,937
Wow, Noonim.

679
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,867
Hae Deun got selected 
again this time.

680
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:20,107
Although she's only a candidate.

681
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,897
Gosh, I know.

682
00:39:21,897 --> 00:39:25,117
Was it called "Trot Girls" 
or something?

683
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:27,737
It's a new group they're forming.

684
00:39:27,737 --> 00:39:29,067
- Trot Girls?
- Yeah.

685
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,127
Trot. That's my specialty.

686
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:33,677
Wow, I'm so happy for Hae Deun.

687
00:39:33,677 --> 00:39:36,727
Gosh, I'm so happy.

688
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:38,647
Are you going to work?

689
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:41,377
Yes, I have to stop by the hospital.

690
00:39:41,377 --> 00:39:44,087
Noonim, my throat has 
been bothering me lately.

691
00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:45,217
Why? Your throat?

692
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,707
Give me a minute.

693
00:39:46,707 --> 00:39:48,217
Aigoo.

694
00:39:50,427 --> 00:39:52,827
- Trot...
- Hwak Se.

695
00:39:52,827 --> 00:39:55,177
It's bellflower root tea.

696
00:39:55,177 --> 00:39:58,117
It's great for a sore throat.

697
00:39:58,117 --> 00:40:00,147
So, drink it whenever
 you get a chance.

698
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,257
Gosh, Noonim.

699
00:40:02,257 --> 00:40:04,047
Gosh, come on...

700
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:06,657
- Noonim.
- Not again...

701
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:09,467
Hurry up and get better, Hwak Se.

702
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:11,807
I'm fine. My throat is fine.

703
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:14,567
- You're cool, Hwak Se.
- Bye, Noonim.

704
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:16,207
Aigoo.

705
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:18,437
My gosh, my Hae Deun...

706
00:40:18,437 --> 00:40:19,957
Gosh, I'm so glad.

707
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:24,007
Oh, my.

708
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:27,047
How can she not say 
anything to me

709
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:28,697
and change her number?

710
00:40:29,747 --> 00:40:31,957
What's her new number?

711
00:40:31,957 --> 00:40:33,257
Hot.

712
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:40,337
Your mom said,
 "Don't tell Jung Won." Right?

713
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:44,327
I'm sorry.

714
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:47,657
I came to see you wondering
 if you knew anything.

715
00:40:47,657 --> 00:40:49,127
I'm so worried about my mom.

716
00:40:49,127 --> 00:40:51,497
I'm sure your mom is fine.

717
00:40:52,577 --> 00:40:54,677
She even changed her number.

718
00:40:54,687 --> 00:40:57,277
I guess she really wants
 a new beginning.

719
00:40:57,277 --> 00:40:59,037
And about this...

720
00:40:59,037 --> 00:41:02,347
I don't think you 
should tell Seo Ah.

721
00:41:02,347 --> 00:41:03,667
 Look at this guy. 

722
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:06,087
 Is he really not interested
 in my Seo Ah? 

723
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,587
In case Seo Ah would worry?

724
00:41:09,587 --> 00:41:11,977
All right. I won't tell her.

725
00:41:11,977 --> 00:41:14,997
Seo Ah is struggling 
with work these days.

726
00:41:14,997 --> 00:41:18,027
I heard you're a big comfort to her.

727
00:41:18,027 --> 00:41:19,077
Pardon?

728
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:20,247
Thanks.

729
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:22,807
I'll count on you to take care 
of Seo Ah in the future.

730
00:41:22,807 --> 00:41:24,817
Oh, yes.

731
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:27,027
 You jerk. 

732
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:29,697
 Don't you dare hurt my Seo Ah... 

733
00:41:39,517 --> 00:41:42,647
Headbutt must be 
around here somewhere.

734
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,877
Head... Headbutt!

735
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:46,967
Head...

736
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:49,877
It's not her.

737
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:52,247
Oppa!

738
00:41:52,247 --> 00:41:53,997
Oppa!

739
00:41:53,997 --> 00:41:55,327
Oppa!

740
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:58,547
Oppa!

741
00:41:59,427 --> 00:42:01,687
- The director's boyfriend is here.
- Her boyfriend?

742
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:09,887
Everyone's got someone.

743
00:42:09,887 --> 00:42:13,347
Hey, people are watching. 
What are you doing at work?

744
00:42:13,347 --> 00:42:15,867
What brings you here? 
To see me?

745
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,277
Yeah, well...

746
00:42:17,277 --> 00:42:19,037
I came by the Resource Team.

747
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,957
What?  You came all the way here.

748
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:23,117
Were you going to leave 
without seeing me?

749
00:42:23,117 --> 00:42:25,867
Hey, Seo Ah, I have to
 get back to the site.

750
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:28,137
See you next time. 
Have a good day. I'm off.

751
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:29,677
Oppa!

752
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,217
Headbutt...

753
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:35,267
I'm sure that big forehead
 is easy to spot.

754
00:42:38,177 --> 00:42:39,477
CEO.

755
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,867
Why did Jae Hee oppa come by?

756
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:43,797
I want to keep my
 promise to Jae Hee.

757
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:45,367
I'm supposed to keep it a secret.

758
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:46,707
Mom.

759
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:48,227
Come on now.

760
00:42:48,227 --> 00:42:50,897
Please mind your manners, 
Director Jang.

761
00:42:50,897 --> 00:42:53,407
I'm off to my meeting.

762
00:43:08,077 --> 00:43:09,807
Oh, yeah...

763
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:14,077
Mr. Kim Hwak Se.

764
00:43:14,077 --> 00:43:15,517
Yes.

765
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:24,867
Yes, how can I help you?

766
00:43:31,137 --> 00:43:32,667
Aunt?

767
00:43:36,687 --> 00:43:40,467
You're here to help a friend 
out temporarily, right?

768
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:43,647
Gosh, what a coincidence.

769
00:43:44,677 --> 00:43:47,677
My throat has been 
bothering me lately.

770
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:51,297
You're right.

771
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:53,467
It is what you're thinking.

772
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:54,637
What?

773
00:43:54,637 --> 00:43:57,237
What you're imagining right now.

774
00:43:57,237 --> 00:43:59,597
"There's some issue at 
the Jeju Island Hospital.

775
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:00,697
That's why she's working here.

776
00:44:00,697 --> 00:44:02,857
That's why I bumped into her
 at that hospital last time.

777
00:44:04,127 --> 00:44:08,157
To have the upstairs room, 
she flipped out...

778
00:44:08,157 --> 00:44:10,567
She threw such a fuss.

779
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:12,507
Aigoo, poor Soon Jung noonim.

780
00:44:12,507 --> 00:44:15,037
This woman Lee Man Jung
 is so pathetic."

781
00:44:15,037 --> 00:44:17,107
That's what you're
 thinking right now.

782
00:44:18,577 --> 00:44:20,087
I wasn't.

783
00:44:21,277 --> 00:44:22,827
You weren't?

784
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,427
Okay.

785
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:27,557
That's right. I'm working here
 temporarily to help out.

786
00:44:27,557 --> 00:44:28,917
So you have a sore throat?

787
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,667
Say ah.

788
00:44:31,647 --> 00:44:35,167
What about Jeju Island Hospital?
 Is there a problem?

789
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:36,657
Who said that?

790
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:38,487
You just said so.

791
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:41,427
Gosh, darn it.

792
00:44:42,457 --> 00:44:44,087
Say ah!

793
00:44:47,927 --> 00:44:49,167
Director Jang.

794
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:50,807
Yeah, the meeting went well.

795
00:44:50,807 --> 00:44:52,507
I want to wrap up at the office.

796
00:44:52,507 --> 00:44:54,067
Go home already.

797
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:57,617
What?

798
00:44:57,617 --> 00:45:00,947
I'd be grateful if you'd 
start a bath for me.

799
00:45:00,977 --> 00:45:04,777
Yes, daughter. See you later.

800
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:49,717
You don't need to focus too much
 on figuring out the trend.

801
00:45:49,717 --> 00:45:51,247
Yes, CEO.

802
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:54,017
The important thing is
 to focus on our brand.

803
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:56,787
Get to the core issue.

804
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,997
Yes. I'll keep that in mind.

805
00:46:05,557 --> 00:46:08,017
It's proof that I worked 
hard today.

806
00:46:08,957 --> 00:46:10,417
Just a moment.

807
00:46:12,617 --> 00:46:13,927
Use this.

808
00:46:29,147 --> 00:46:31,347
 Could she have really... 

809
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:34,657
 bullied my Seo Ah? 

810
00:46:38,377 --> 00:46:42,977
I think you're the one who
 need this, Bit Chae Woon.

811
00:46:44,817 --> 00:46:46,937
I do some pretty rough work.

812
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,467
My hands are like
 this all the time.

813
00:46:50,827 --> 00:46:52,617
I'm really sorry...

814
00:46:52,617 --> 00:46:54,847
about what happened
 this morning.

815
00:46:54,847 --> 00:46:56,317
Right?

816
00:46:56,317 --> 00:46:58,007
Watch out going forward.

817
00:46:58,007 --> 00:47:00,757
That glass is very expensive.

818
00:47:06,977 --> 00:47:08,727
 

819
00:47:10,817 --> 00:47:12,117
Why?

820
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:19,987
I worked a part-time job, thinking 
that I wouldn't make it here.

821
00:47:19,987 --> 00:47:22,657
I have to finish that up. 
It's an alarm for that.

822
00:47:22,657 --> 00:47:24,697
What kind of job? 
Serving at a restaurant?

823
00:47:24,697 --> 00:47:26,417
I lay down tiles.

824
00:47:26,417 --> 00:47:29,257
I used to work as a freelance
 interior general contractor.

825
00:47:31,527 --> 00:47:33,157
Is that so?

826
00:47:34,407 --> 00:47:35,827
All right then.

827
00:47:35,827 --> 00:47:37,307
Good evening.

828
00:47:37,307 --> 00:47:38,597
Bye.

829
00:47:57,997 --> 00:48:00,667
Geez...

830
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:03,387
Hey, we're working too
 hard day and night.

831
00:48:03,387 --> 00:48:05,217
What if we die like this?

832
00:48:05,217 --> 00:48:06,527
We can't die.

833
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:08,697
Only after we finish 
all the projects we have.

834
00:48:10,247 --> 00:48:12,937
I heard Ms. Lee found a job.

835
00:48:12,937 --> 00:48:15,577
- Could she do this with us?
- You think that's possible?

836
00:48:15,577 --> 00:48:18,377
Headbutt. She was all talk.

837
00:48:20,527 --> 00:48:22,427
Yes, sir.

838
00:48:22,477 --> 00:48:23,777
Oh, that? Go ahead.

839
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:24,777
Go ahead.

840
00:48:26,187 --> 00:48:27,397
Yes, yes.

841
00:48:27,397 --> 00:48:29,077
Yes, I'll take care of it.

842
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,797
Yes, I got it.

843
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:41,787
Geez, these guys.

844
00:48:41,787 --> 00:48:43,217
They didn't turn off
 the lights again.

845
00:49:04,177 --> 00:49:05,577
Geez, scared me.

846
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:08,277
I'm the one who 
should be startled.

847
00:49:11,997 --> 00:49:14,527
So, you came.

848
00:49:14,527 --> 00:49:17,107
Of course, I should. 
I'm responsible for this job.

849
00:49:17,107 --> 00:49:18,337
As expected.

850
00:49:18,337 --> 00:49:21,367
If you keep saying 
ambition and whatnot,

851
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:23,287
I'll just leave.

852
00:49:23,987 --> 00:49:25,767
What did I say?

853
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:28,557
What an exemplary contractor.

854
00:49:28,557 --> 00:49:30,697
That's what I was going to say.

855
00:49:37,677 --> 00:49:41,477
Stop monitoring me and 
do what you need to do.

856
00:49:41,497 --> 00:49:44,557
I'll do this perfectly. 
So don't worry.

857
00:49:44,557 --> 00:49:46,607
Gosh, don't say it like that.

858
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:51,127
Ms. Lee, you're here.

859
00:49:51,127 --> 00:49:52,147
Hi.

860
00:49:52,147 --> 00:49:53,987
Whoa, daebak.

861
00:49:53,987 --> 00:49:55,817
Ms. Lee...

862
00:49:55,817 --> 00:49:57,477
This is awesome.

863
00:49:57,477 --> 00:49:59,477
How did you do that?

864
00:49:59,477 --> 00:50:01,917
Yeah, you did a great job.

865
00:50:25,707 --> 00:50:27,747
- Mom! 
- Hi!

866
00:50:28,767 --> 00:50:30,697
You worked hard today, too.

867
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:32,197
That's right.

868
00:50:32,197 --> 00:50:34,367
I started a bath for you.

869
00:50:34,377 --> 00:50:36,777
Gosh, thank you, my daughter.

870
00:50:41,197 --> 00:50:42,987
It's not the one I put on you.

871
00:50:42,987 --> 00:50:45,727
It fell apart while 
working hard today.

872
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,457
But still. This is terrible.

873
00:50:48,457 --> 00:50:50,347
Mom, you don't like this.

874
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,957
- A band-aid is...
- It's okay.

875
00:50:51,957 --> 00:50:53,967
I just put it on.

876
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,037
I'll wash up.

877
00:50:57,067 --> 00:50:58,237
Mom.

878
00:51:08,617 --> 00:51:10,507
Aigoo, how nice.

879
00:51:10,507 --> 00:51:13,577
You get a ride from me since 
we live in the same house.

880
00:51:13,577 --> 00:51:17,627
Actually, I have to 
make another stop.

881
00:51:18,377 --> 00:51:21,477
Yeah, since you 
worked so hard today,

882
00:51:21,507 --> 00:51:23,177
I thought I'd give you a ride home.

883
00:51:23,177 --> 00:51:24,967
That's...

884
00:51:24,967 --> 00:51:27,917
how humane I am...

885
00:51:29,477 --> 00:51:30,577
Geez.

886
00:51:34,077 --> 00:51:35,377
Hey.

887
00:51:37,387 --> 00:51:40,087
She sure falls asleep anywhere.

888
00:51:41,127 --> 00:51:42,767
Oh, no.

889
00:51:45,547 --> 00:51:47,217
Geez, come on, Headbutt.

890
00:51:49,827 --> 00:51:51,627
Come on now.

891
00:51:51,627 --> 00:51:53,517
Oh, no!

892
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:20,747
Are you off to somewhere else?

893
00:52:20,747 --> 00:52:22,307
I have to stop by somewhere.

894
00:52:22,307 --> 00:52:24,187
Oh, your girlfriend.

895
00:52:24,187 --> 00:52:26,737
Gosh, you should've gone 
directly from the site.

896
00:52:26,737 --> 00:52:28,757
I told you. I'm not like that.

897
00:52:28,757 --> 00:52:32,217
I'm totally well-mannered 
and thoughtful...

898
00:52:32,217 --> 00:52:34,087
Thank you for the ride.

899
00:52:34,087 --> 00:52:36,207
All right, go!

900
00:52:37,327 --> 00:52:39,527
Geez, she's so annoying.

901
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:40,957
Everything she does bothers me.

902
00:52:42,337 --> 00:52:44,167
Geez, gosh.

903
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:46,677
She's such a clutz.

904
00:52:48,377 --> 00:52:49,777
What's this?

905
00:52:49,817 --> 00:52:51,397
Working hard.

906
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:53,627
You startled me.

907
00:52:53,627 --> 00:52:55,277
Wow, that could've been bad.

908
00:52:56,567 --> 00:52:58,237
Thank you, Mr. Woo.

909
00:53:03,017 --> 00:53:05,057
Anyway, she's annoying.

910
00:53:07,137 --> 00:53:08,407
Geez.

911
00:53:18,637 --> 00:53:22,447
I think Mr. Woo's mother left home.

912
00:53:23,477 --> 00:53:26,127
Gosh, if I visit Father 
at times like this,

913
00:53:26,127 --> 00:53:27,977
I'd score some big points.

914
00:53:28,877 --> 00:53:31,877
Gosh, Jae Hee oppa
 would be upset.

915
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:39,917
 

916
00:53:45,207 --> 00:53:46,517
Let's see...

917
00:53:47,817 --> 00:53:49,757
Why is it so hard?

918
00:53:49,757 --> 00:53:51,387
It's only ramen.

919
00:53:51,387 --> 00:53:52,827
What?

920
00:53:53,747 --> 00:53:55,017
Geez.

921
00:53:55,017 --> 00:53:57,217
Whatever.

922
00:53:58,247 --> 00:53:59,777
Geez.

923
00:54:04,337 --> 00:54:06,287
Gosh, what the heck?

924
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:07,607
Geez, come on.

925
00:54:11,087 --> 00:54:12,347
Geez.

926
00:54:15,677 --> 00:54:17,747
 

927
00:54:20,907 --> 00:54:22,397
Hi, Seo Ah.

928
00:54:22,397 --> 00:54:23,627
 Father. 

929
00:54:24,587 --> 00:54:26,277
 You weren't asleep, were you? 

930
00:54:26,277 --> 00:54:29,427
No. I was reading.

931
00:54:30,837 --> 00:54:32,247
Jae Hee's mom?

932
00:54:32,247 --> 00:54:34,247
She's sleeping right now.

933
00:54:35,377 --> 00:54:36,877
Of course.

934
00:54:36,887 --> 00:54:38,557
Everything is fine.

935
00:54:38,557 --> 00:54:40,437
Aigoo, Seo Ah...

936
00:54:40,437 --> 00:54:43,657
You're always so caring. 
Thank you.

937
00:54:45,517 --> 00:54:47,587
Seo Ah, we'll talk next time.

938
00:54:47,587 --> 00:54:49,657
 Father, is something the matter? 

939
00:54:49,657 --> 00:54:51,287
No, no.

940
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:53,087
Thank you, Seo Ah.

941
00:54:55,437 --> 00:54:57,167
Ow!

942
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:01,337
Geez...

943
00:55:01,337 --> 00:55:02,997
Step aside.

944
00:55:08,717 --> 00:55:12,197
Who says you can
 come in like this?

945
00:55:12,197 --> 00:55:13,997
So, Mom did leave home.

946
00:55:13,997 --> 00:55:15,767
Did something happen
 between you two?

947
00:55:15,767 --> 00:55:16,797
None of your business.

948
00:55:16,797 --> 00:55:18,677
Get out. Get out of my 
house right this minute.

949
00:55:19,387 --> 00:55:21,907
You still haven't eaten dinner?
 Should I order something in?

950
00:55:21,907 --> 00:55:23,267
What do you mean
 I haven't eaten?

951
00:55:23,267 --> 00:55:24,527
It's my late-night snack.

952
00:55:24,527 --> 00:55:25,777
Geez.

953
00:55:27,887 --> 00:55:30,247
What are you doing? Get out.

954
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:33,137
Where is the number
 to my security?

955
00:55:33,207 --> 00:55:34,367
Darn it.

956
00:55:37,647 --> 00:55:41,247
If something happens
 to Mom, I'll really...

957
00:55:41,247 --> 00:55:42,727
I won't stand back.

958
00:55:42,727 --> 00:55:44,667
What did you say? You punk...

959
00:55:47,027 --> 00:55:47,917
Hey!

960
00:55:48,777 --> 00:55:50,277
You haven't eaten dinner.

961
00:55:50,277 --> 00:55:51,877
You have no strength.

962
00:55:51,877 --> 00:55:53,347
Hey.

963
00:55:54,927 --> 00:55:56,107
Hey.

964
00:55:56,107 --> 00:55:57,647
Hey!

965
00:56:02,117 --> 00:56:04,737
 - A trainee? 
- Yup.

966
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:06,857
Whoa, congrats, Lee Hae Deun!

967
00:56:06,857 --> 00:56:08,037
Good job! I'm so proud of you!

968
00:56:08,037 --> 00:56:09,677
Congratulations, Lee Hae Deun.

969
00:56:09,677 --> 00:56:11,157
Hey, congrats!

970
00:56:11,157 --> 00:56:12,707
Gosh, I'm dizzy!

971
00:56:12,707 --> 00:56:16,127
But I think I'm the oldest.

972
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:18,107
You're probably the 
rudest, though.

973
00:56:18,677 --> 00:56:19,577
Hey.

974
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,457
Who cares how old you are?

975
00:56:21,457 --> 00:56:25,077
Then you work that much
 harder. Don't be intimidated.

976
00:56:25,077 --> 00:56:26,567
It shows if you're intimidated.

977
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:28,227
That means you're losing already.

978
00:56:28,227 --> 00:56:29,567
I got it.

979
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:31,017
Hey, gather around.

980
00:56:31,017 --> 00:56:32,057
Okay.

981
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:33,837
 Let's go, go, go! 

982
00:56:33,837 --> 00:56:35,377
Lee Hae Deun, receive my power!

983
00:56:35,377 --> 00:56:36,647
Don't be intimidated, Lee Hae Deun!

984
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:37,757
 Let's go, go, go! 

985
00:56:37,757 --> 00:56:38,937
 - Go, go, go! 
- I'm not intimidated!

986
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,497
Yay!

987
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:41,827
Gosh, come on!

988
00:56:41,827 --> 00:56:43,817
Hey, here you go again!

989
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,367
Get out. I have to work.

990
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:46,657
Get out.

991
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:48,247
Hey.

992
00:56:48,247 --> 00:56:49,847
Did the basement room rent out?

993
00:56:50,447 --> 00:56:52,097
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

994
00:56:52,997 --> 00:56:55,337
I told you to advertise diligently.

995
00:56:55,337 --> 00:56:57,107
That's right! Work hard.

996
00:56:57,107 --> 00:56:59,067
Hey, why did you hit me?

997
00:56:59,067 --> 00:57:00,247
Hey, you!

998
00:57:05,107 --> 00:57:09,397
♫  I'm dense, yeah, yeah  ♫

999
00:57:09,397 --> 00:57:11,407
♫  I don't like it  ♫

1000
00:57:11,407 --> 00:57:14,757
 

1001
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:20,737
Bit Chae Woon, why did you note 
everything on your phone?

1002
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,477
This is fun.

1003
00:57:31,077 --> 00:57:33,077
A new tenant?

1004
00:57:33,147 --> 00:57:35,377
 

1005
00:57:37,977 --> 00:57:39,787
A new tenant.

1006
00:57:45,477 --> 00:57:46,877
Yeah, right.

1007
00:57:53,747 --> 00:57:56,417
 I'm moving into 
Samgwang Villa for now. 

1008
00:57:56,417 --> 00:57:59,387
 Continue to look for who 
Lee Bit Chae Woon's birth mother is. 

1009
00:58:00,447 --> 00:58:02,587
 Why am I moving in
 out of the blue? 

1010
00:58:02,587 --> 00:58:05,157
 Hey, you have to break 
deep into the fishery 

1011
00:58:05,157 --> 00:58:06,767
 to catch a fish. 

1012
00:58:07,447 --> 00:58:10,047
 Let's hurry up and 
snatch a fortune 

1013
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,937
 and get out of town. 

1014
00:58:18,317 --> 00:58:21,557
It's nice to go to work with you
 for the first time in a while.

1015
00:58:21,557 --> 00:58:23,187
Aigoo, I feel the 
same way, Noonim.

1016
00:58:23,187 --> 00:58:25,197
You said the party is 
at the Yeonhuidong, right?

1017
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:26,317
Yeah.

1018
00:58:26,317 --> 00:58:29,017
I heard it's a charity 
party for an orphanage.

1019
00:58:29,017 --> 00:58:31,887
My boss will be so
 happy to see you.

1020
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:36,447
Then should we dispatch a fantastic 
duo first time in a long time?

1021
00:58:36,447 --> 00:58:38,187
- Shall we?
- Hwak Se!

1022
00:58:38,187 --> 00:58:39,697
Soon Jung!

1023
00:58:39,697 --> 00:58:41,517
 Cross! 

1024
00:58:43,577 --> 00:58:45,267
- Please come in.
- Come in.

1025
00:58:46,027 --> 00:58:47,607
My gosh.

1026
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,687
Welcome.

1027
00:58:50,947 --> 00:58:52,737
Did you see the post online?

1028
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,347
Yes, I saw it online.

1029
00:58:54,347 --> 00:58:56,117
- The room.
- I see.

1030
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:58,107
I'm glad you came.

1031
00:58:58,107 --> 00:59:00,727
Did you come for 
the upstairs room?

1032
00:59:00,727 --> 00:59:01,757
Yes, yes.

1033
00:59:01,757 --> 00:59:03,067
Aigoo.

1034
00:59:03,067 --> 00:59:04,647
Oh, no.

1035
00:59:04,647 --> 00:59:07,057
That room is rented already.

1036
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,077
Really?

1037
00:59:10,477 --> 00:59:12,177
Geez, that's too bad.

1038
00:59:12,977 --> 00:59:16,287
The post said that 
your cooking is awesome.

1039
00:59:16,287 --> 00:59:18,117
I came here looking 
forward to that.

1040
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:22,317
By chance, is there a spare room?

1041
00:59:22,317 --> 00:59:25,097
I'm okay, even if it's in 
the basement or the rooftop.

1042
00:59:25,097 --> 00:59:27,707
Yes, we do!

1043
00:59:27,707 --> 00:59:29,017
Really?

1044
00:59:31,017 --> 00:59:32,667
Come in. Come in.

1045
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:33,417
Okay.

1046
00:59:33,417 --> 00:59:36,517
This may look like 
a semi-basement room.

1047
00:59:36,517 --> 00:59:39,887
But you can actually say it's 
almost on the first floor.

1048
00:59:39,887 --> 00:59:42,317
Hwak Se, it's not 
on the first floor.

1049
00:59:42,317 --> 00:59:44,727
Look over here. Look at 
how the sunlight comes in.

1050
00:59:44,727 --> 00:59:48,027
It's wide. It's hot now
 that I'm standing here.

1051
00:59:48,027 --> 00:59:50,427
- Aigoo.
- Can I move in today?

1052
00:59:50,477 --> 00:59:52,877
Yes, of course.

1053
00:59:52,897 --> 00:59:55,077
You can move in right away.

1054
00:59:55,077 --> 00:59:57,287
Yes, of course.

1055
00:59:57,287 --> 00:59:59,287
But I was asking about dinner...

1056
00:59:59,287 --> 01:00:01,787
- Aigoo, I...
- Yes, you can. Yes.

1057
01:00:02,777 --> 01:00:04,467
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1058
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,867
Even the semi-basement room?

1059
01:00:06,867 --> 01:00:08,717
That's great.

1060
01:00:08,717 --> 01:00:10,327
So...

1061
01:00:10,327 --> 01:00:12,947
don't be surprised later.

1062
01:00:12,947 --> 01:00:15,107
I'm working late tonight,

1063
01:00:15,107 --> 01:00:16,487
so we'll throw a party later...

1064
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:17,947
Yes, I know.

1065
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,877
Reading about Noonim's 
excellent cooking skills

1066
01:00:19,877 --> 01:00:21,937
totally won him over.

1067
01:00:21,937 --> 01:00:23,107
I knew it.

1068
01:00:23,107 --> 01:00:26,857
Uncle, I posted that. I thought
 it was a good selling point.

1069
01:00:26,857 --> 01:00:29,427
Yeah, it is.

1070
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:32,167
Ra Hoon.

1071
01:00:33,707 --> 01:00:35,677
Are you sure you're in school?

1072
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:38,177
 I'm hearing the same 
song here and there. 

1073
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:41,287
Uncle, my class is starting.
 I have to go.

1074
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:44,257
Oh, okay. All right, go ahead.

1075
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:49,277
Wow, that's weird.

1076
01:00:49,357 --> 01:00:51,297
Why? What, Hwak Se?

1077
01:00:51,297 --> 01:00:55,117
I can hear the same song being 
played at Ra Hoon's school.

1078
01:00:55,117 --> 01:00:57,677
Gosh, no way.

1079
01:00:57,677 --> 01:00:59,347
The sound is ringing loudly here.

1080
01:00:59,347 --> 01:01:01,207
You got confused there.

1081
01:01:01,207 --> 01:01:02,637
- Gosh.
- No, that's not it.

1082
01:01:02,637 --> 01:01:05,007
My hearing is quite sensitive.

1083
01:01:05,007 --> 01:01:07,237
Gosh, it's a pretty zucchini.

1084
01:01:07,237 --> 01:01:08,927
It's pretty.

1085
01:01:10,577 --> 01:01:13,177
Geez. Is my hearing messed up?

1086
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:22,127
That was close.

1087
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:29,367
 

1088
01:02:34,707 --> 01:02:38,007
Shall we begin?

1089
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:43,997
You said you have a 
presentation coming up at work,

1090
01:02:43,997 --> 01:02:45,777
so I'm extending my deadline.

1091
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:48,257
Gosh, my ears hurt.

1092
01:02:48,257 --> 01:02:50,297
You said that so many 
times on our way home.

1093
01:02:50,297 --> 01:02:51,827
I have scabs in my ear.

1094
01:02:51,827 --> 01:02:54,917
Why do you think 
I keep repeating this?

1095
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:57,447
No matter how many times I say it, 
you haven't thanked me at all.

1096
01:02:57,447 --> 01:02:58,757
Right?

1097
01:02:58,757 --> 01:03:02,267
Mr. Woo, you just 
love getting credit.

1098
01:03:02,267 --> 01:03:05,317
You love it when people say, 
"Thank you very much."

1099
01:03:05,317 --> 01:03:08,537
You love it when 
you're on a pedestal.

1100
01:03:08,537 --> 01:03:10,687
 That's like my dad. 

1101
01:03:10,687 --> 01:03:12,037
What?

1102
01:03:12,037 --> 01:03:13,817
Yes, yes.

1103
01:03:13,817 --> 01:03:16,997
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1104
01:03:18,727 --> 01:03:20,357
Satisfied?

1105
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:24,117
Geez, so annoying.

1106
01:03:26,307 --> 01:03:27,717
Aigoo!

1107
01:03:27,717 --> 01:03:30,817
Gosh, Koala. He's so condescending.

1108
01:03:32,737 --> 01:03:34,257
What's all this?

1109
01:03:36,377 --> 01:03:39,517
Oh, the new tenant 
for the basement room.

1110
01:03:39,517 --> 01:03:42,437
What the heck? Who's
 supposed to clean this up?

1111
01:03:42,437 --> 01:03:44,067
Geez.

1112
01:03:44,067 --> 01:03:45,567
Please leave it.

1113
01:03:45,567 --> 01:03:47,657
I was going to clean up,

1114
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,567
but I wasn't sure 
where I should put them.

1115
01:03:49,567 --> 01:03:52,037
Oh, are you the new 
basement tenant?

1116
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:53,047
Yes.

1117
01:03:53,817 --> 01:03:55,117
Give it to me. I'll clean up.

1118
01:03:55,117 --> 01:03:56,377
Aigoo, it's okay.

1119
01:03:56,377 --> 01:03:58,047
- I'll do it.
- Gosh, it's okay.

1120
01:04:06,967 --> 01:04:08,747
Hey! Hey, you jerk!

1121
01:04:08,747 --> 01:04:10,427
What are you doing, you jerk!

1122
01:04:18,277 --> 01:04:20,187
My head...

1123
01:04:20,187 --> 01:04:21,687
Unni!

1124
01:04:21,687 --> 01:04:23,007
Hyung!

1125
01:04:24,447 --> 01:04:25,497
My head...

1126
01:04:32,317 --> 01:04:33,597
There.

1127
01:04:33,597 --> 01:04:35,427
- Gosh, so pretty, Hwak Se.
- Yes.

1128
01:04:41,787 --> 01:04:45,337
♫  It's very, very good  ♫

1129
01:04:45,337 --> 01:04:48,087
Gosh, coming out and 
working with you

1130
01:04:48,087 --> 01:04:49,897
like this gets me
 so excited, Noonim.

1131
01:04:49,897 --> 01:04:51,967
Me, too, Hwak Se.

1132
01:04:53,327 --> 01:04:55,397
♫  It's good  ♫

1133
01:04:55,397 --> 01:04:58,067
♫  It's very, very good  ♫

1134
01:04:59,167 --> 01:05:01,957
I guess the basement 
guy moved in okay.

1135
01:05:01,957 --> 01:05:02,567
I see.

1136
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:05,157
I should've prepared 
dinner for him.

1137
01:05:05,157 --> 01:05:06,407
Aigoo.

1138
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:09,237
Hae Deun and Ra Hoon 
prepared dinner for him.

1139
01:05:09,237 --> 01:05:11,267
Hae Deun told me that

1140
01:05:11,267 --> 01:05:13,627
he ate three bowls of rice.

1141
01:05:13,627 --> 01:05:15,857
Gosh, really?

1142
01:05:15,857 --> 01:05:17,917
He got to taste your food.

1143
01:05:17,977 --> 01:05:21,077
Now, he's not going anywhere. 
He's your new tenant.

1144
01:05:21,077 --> 01:05:23,237
 Welcome! 

1145
01:05:23,237 --> 01:05:24,607
Oh, my. The guests are here.

1146
01:05:24,607 --> 01:05:26,147
- Hwak Se, take care of this.
- Okay.

1147
01:05:26,147 --> 01:05:27,537
Do this for me.

1148
01:05:27,537 --> 01:05:29,317
♫  It's good  ♫

1149
01:05:29,317 --> 01:05:30,957
♫  - It's very, very good  ♫
- Hello.

1150
01:05:30,957 --> 01:05:32,707
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1151
01:05:32,707 --> 01:05:35,057
- Hello.
- You're here tonight, ma'am.

1152
01:05:35,057 --> 01:05:37,407
- Yes.
- I look forward to dinner.

1153
01:05:37,407 --> 01:05:38,797
Thank you.

1154
01:05:38,797 --> 01:05:41,147
Right? You'll be so surprised.

1155
01:05:41,147 --> 01:05:42,627
Thank you.

1156
01:05:42,627 --> 01:05:44,147
- This way, please.
- I look forward to it.

1157
01:05:44,147 --> 01:05:46,497
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1158
01:05:46,497 --> 01:05:48,507
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1159
01:05:48,507 --> 01:05:51,317
- Gosh, you came.
- Welcome.

1160
01:05:51,317 --> 01:05:53,347
- Hello.
- Hello.

1161
01:05:53,347 --> 01:05:55,067
Hello.

1162
01:06:08,317 --> 01:06:10,197
By chance...

1163
01:06:16,367 --> 01:06:18,437
a long time ago...

1164
01:06:22,787 --> 01:06:25,207
didn't you live at Min Jae's house?

1165
01:06:29,177 --> 01:06:30,477
Oh, my.

1166
01:06:30,477 --> 01:06:33,277
Ms. Jung Won?

1167
01:06:33,337 --> 01:06:34,897
It's you.

1168
01:06:36,257 --> 01:06:38,427
Wait a minute, your name is...

1169
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,177
Soon Jung.

1170
01:06:40,177 --> 01:06:41,917
That's right. Soon Jung.

1171
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:43,827
Soon Jung!

1172
01:06:45,977 --> 01:06:48,157
How long has it been?

1173
01:06:49,437 --> 01:06:51,077
Ma'am.

1174
01:06:51,987 --> 01:06:53,657
Soon Jung!

1175
01:06:53,657 --> 01:06:55,287
Noonim!

1176
01:06:55,287 --> 01:06:56,897
What's wrong?

1177
01:06:58,987 --> 01:07:00,917
 How... 

1178
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:03,877
 How could I run into 
Seo Yeon's mom here? 

1179
01:07:04,877 --> 01:07:06,277
Are you all right?

1180
01:07:07,297 --> 01:07:13,887
♫  You don't need to force love  ♫

1181
01:07:13,887 --> 01:07:21,907
♫  Like passing time, 
you can't stop the heart  ♫

1182
01:07:21,907 --> 01:07:28,217
♫  You're drawn to each 
other like the magnets  ♫

1183
01:07:28,217 --> 01:07:32,957
♫  I can fill the hole that 
was dug in my heart  ♫

1184
01:07:32,957 --> 01:07:34,717
 

1185
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,357
 - You brought the phone, right?
- What? 

1186
01:07:36,357 --> 01:07:38,857
 He came to my office saying
 he found your phone. 

1187
01:07:38,857 --> 01:07:41,477
 Pil Hong hyungnim's 
ex-wife is Kim Jung Won. 

1188
01:07:41,477 --> 01:07:42,417
 Are you sure? 

1189
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:45,897
 Then I'm their son-in-law? 

1190
01:07:45,897 --> 01:07:48,307
 Great. This is just great. 

1191
01:07:48,307 --> 01:07:49,417
 Let's go home. 

1192
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:51,197
 - Let's get a divorce.
- What? 

1193
01:07:51,197 --> 01:07:52,537
 I said, let's get a divorce. 

1194
01:07:52,537 --> 01:07:54,017
 A divorce! 

1195
01:07:54,017 --> 01:07:56,487
 Mr. Woo Jung Hoo, we're from
 the Seodaemun Police Station. 

1196
01:07:56,487 --> 01:07:59,097
 Seo Ah, does it bother you 
that much that I'm around you? 

1197
01:07:59,097 --> 01:08:00,457
 Bit Chae Woon. 

1198
01:08:00,457 --> 01:08:01,727
 CEO. 

1199
01:08:01,727 --> 01:08:03,397
 What's going on here? 

1200
01:08:03,397 --> 01:08:04,867
 Please see me. 

1201
01:08:04,867 --> 01:08:07,535
♫  At unexpected love  ♫
