1
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,070
Seo Yeon!

2
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,560
Dad...

3
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,450
Dad!

4
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,200
Dad!

5
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,800
Dad!

6
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,180
Help me!

7
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,820
 My Seo Yeon didn't get hurt. 

8
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,770
- Dad...
 - What a relief. 

9
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,020
Dad...

10
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,780
Hang on.

11
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,420
 Seo Yeon is calling me "dad." 

12
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,860
 I'm happy. 

13
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,040
 Seo Yeon... 

14
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,430
 I'm sorry for everything. 

15
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,710
 

16
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,150
Chae Woon!

17
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,400
Chae Woon! Chae Woon!

18
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,920
Chae Woon!

19
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,040
What happened?

20
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,070
Are you all right?

21
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,300
What in the world is going on?

22
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,190
Chae Woon, was it a hit and run?

23
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,180
Did someone do this on purpose?

24
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,240
I don't know.

25
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,960
Aigoo. What happened?

26
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,680
Wait...

27
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,390
Nurse...

28
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,010
Doctor...

29
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,720
What's going on in there?

30
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,890
- Are you Park Pil Hong's family?
- Yes.

31
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,270
Park Pil Hong shed too
 much blood. He needs blood.

32
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,840
He is Rh O-negative blood type.

33
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,590
We don't have any in our hospital, 
so we're looking into it.

34
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,530
Wait, I'm...

35
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,050
I'm Rh O-negative blood type.

36
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,880
You are?

37
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,740
 Come on. 

38
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,200
 If you don't can't hit that, it's over. 

39
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,380
 - Wait...
- Don't come closer! 

40
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,090
 Why now? 

41
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,590
 Why did you show up now... 

42
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,060
 Why did you show up
 in this shabby state? 

43
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,490
 I just... 

44
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,300
 wanted to... 

45
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,820
 be a good dad to you. 

46
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,890
 I've been fine without a good dad, and 

47
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,370
 I've managed well by myself. 

48
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,760
 I'm ashamed that you're my father. 

49
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:19,760
♫  Just like we had promised
 from the beginning  ♫

50
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,110
 Seo Yeon! 

51
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,310
♫  I'll give you all my heart  ♫

52
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,740
 He called me and said 
he loves you so much, 

53
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,950
 but he doesn't know how to express it. 

54
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,640
 Well... 

55
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,200
 I'll get going first. 

56
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,130
 Chae Woon. 

57
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,400
 No, Jae Hee. Don't come out. It's cold. 

58
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,880
♫  Just hold my hand  ♫

59
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,360
♫  Just like now  ♫

60
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,930
 

61
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,740
Well...

62
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,380
He's out of surgery.

63
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,670
But he's still unconscious.

64
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,630
They say tonight is critical.

65
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,700
Aigoo...

66
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,350
I didn't know that

67
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,130
the clothing repair shop man
 was Unni's birth father.

68
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,600
Does my mom know?

69
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,830
I couldn't tell her because
 she was in meetings.

70
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,280
Chief Goo should've told her by now.

71
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,400
- Jae Hee.
- Mother.

72
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,600
Seo Yeon...

73
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,160
She fell asleep just now after 
hearing that he's out of the surgery.

74
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,580
My daughter must be in such a shock.

75
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,690
Then it was indeed that punk Prof. Kim.

76
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,280
Okay, Min Chul. Thanks.

77
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,270
Did they catch the hit-and-run?

78
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,500
Yes. They chased him down
 and caught him.

79
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,640
He's called "Prof. Kim."

80
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,360
He used to work with Hwang Na Ro.

81
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,110
When you say, "worked with," meaning...

82
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,230
they did terrible things together.

83
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,680
Yes.

84
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,450
Chae Woon's father must've given cops
 some information on Prof. Kim.

85
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,240
So he had a vendetta against him.

86
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,060
Wow, he's a scary guy.

87
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,680
So, was he targetting Chae Woon?

88
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Because she's 
Park Pil Hong's daughter?

89
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,330
I think so.

90
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,990
How scary.

91
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,710
But I'm so glad that they
 caught that guy.

92
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,520
I know.

93
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,980
Ttak Bae, did you find out 
where Prof. Kim is?

94
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,320
- The cops arrested him?
 - Yeah, at the scene of the crime. 

95
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,190
 He got caught after running away
 after hitting Pil Hong hyungnim. 

96
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,240
What?

97
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,070
 Pil Hong hyung must 
have critical injuries. 

98
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,030
 I heard he tried to rescue his daughter. 

99
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,310
Pil Hong hyung...

100
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,580
It's my fault.

101
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,830
 Prof. Kim's minions are looking for you. 

102
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,300
 They won't let you get away with it. 

103
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,320
 Na Ro, hide for now even if 
you turn yourself in later. 

104
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,300
Seo Ah.

105
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,130
Did you follow me, by chance?

106
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,120
Go back home.

107
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,110
I heard Park Pil Hong is 
in serious condition.

108
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,610
CEO must be in shock.

109
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,290
I got the call on my way over here.

110
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,830
Go, Seo Ah.

111
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,700
Go.

112
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,020
Jang Seo Ah!

113
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,140
Come to your senses, please!

114
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,530
Do you think I liked you for real?

115
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,980
I didn't.

116
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,700
I approached you for money. 
I used you.

117
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,560
I was never true to you.

118
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,720
No.

119
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,890
You were genuine.

120
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,440
I knew you weren't genuine

121
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,530
in the beginning.

122
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,210
But as time passed,

123
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,740
I know you fell in love with me.

124
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,630
I know that.

125
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,590
No.

126
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,190
That's not true.

127
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,840
Go back.

128
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,500
Go back! Please!

129
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,560
I can't go back like this.

130
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,960
No one is by your side, Na Ro.

131
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,720
I'll stay by your side.

132
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,300
♫  I love you, love you  ♫

133
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:15,970
♫  Just love me like the
 stars in the sky  ♫

134
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:34,570
♫  Even if you don't say a word  ♫

135
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:41,010
♫  I know how you feel  ♫

136
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:48,500
♫  Even though I can't touch it  ♫

137
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:54,590
♫  I can feel it wherever I am  ♫

138
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,930
Whoa.

139
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,490
- It looks delicious.
- Right?

140
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,930
Seo Ah.

141
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,990
You're supposed to eat it 
on a lid like this.

142
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,170
It's hot. Be careful.

143
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,680
Try it.

144
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,750
Whoa, it looks good.

145
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,880
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

146
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,280
Thanks.

147
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,870
Actually, it's my first time
 in a place like this.

148
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,810
Seo Ah, you did grow up so sheltered.

149
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,580
It'd be so nice...

150
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,090
if I lived with you in a place like this.

151
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,870
Well...

152
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,020
we can put up a small 
curtain over there.

153
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,700
Well...

154
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,860
we can put a small 
cabinet over there.

155
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,560
Should we put a few 
scented candles?

156
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,040
We'll have only one pair of everything.

157
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,150
Two dishes...

158
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,990
two utensils...

159
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,730
two cups.

160
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,820
Just for you and me...

161
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,460
Only for the two of us.

162
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,040
I have something to give you.

163
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,970
 

164
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,790
You like math, Na Ro.

165
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,510
So why do you like math?

166
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,470
When I'm working on a math problem,

167
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,840
thoughts don't clutter my head.

168
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,680
"Why was I born so poorly...

169

00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,500
Seo Ah, you're home.

340
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,680
I'm glad you're home.

341
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,250
Where were you last night?

342
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,500
Were you with Hwang Na Ro?

343
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,490
Seo Ah.

344
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,520
Do you even know what kind 
of person Hwang Na Ro is?

345
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,990
Hwang Na Ro approached 
you intentionally...

346
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,580
Mom.

347
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,690
I know everything.

348
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,980
You know everything?

349
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,900
You knew...

350
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,300
Someone connected 
to Hwang Na Ro...

351
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,130
caused Park Pil Hong's accident.

352
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,660
You knew all that...

353
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,560
and you were still 
with Hwang Na Ro?

354
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,050
I'm sorry, Mom.

355
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,570
But Hwang Na Ro was also 
getting blackmailed by that man.

356
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,690
That's why...

357
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,750
Anyway, he's connected to him.

358
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,190
Where is Hwang Na Ro?

359
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,800
Mom.

360
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,130
You don't have to worry anymore.

361
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,630
He...

362
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,810
left.

363
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,970
He won't show up to us anymore.

364
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,700
Seo Ah.

365
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,530
What are you saying?

366
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,370
I won't see him anymore.

367
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,370
I can't see him anymore.

368
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,820
Seo Ah.

369
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,240
What is it you want to tell me?

370
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,410
Unni, actually...

371
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,760
well, we...

372
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,840
requested Eun Ji and Ra Hoon's...

373
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,000
DNA test.

374
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,730
Oh, really?

375
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,370
How...

376
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,010
Eun Ji said she didn't want to.

377
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,660
We convinced her to
 go ahead and find out.

378
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,910
Hwak Se worked hard
 to convince her.

379
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,730
But because we were so pushy,

380
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,690
I think Eun Ji left all of a sudden.

381
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,190
Thinking of all kinds of things 
after requesting a DNA test and all.

382
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,600
Well, so...

383
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,350
how did the DNA test 
results come out?

384
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,710
Eun Ji is his birth mother.

385
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,460
Ra Hoon's birth mother.

386
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,200
We don't have that much 
time left to be together.

387
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,340
We didn't get to do
 all the things on your bucket list.

388
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,620
But still, we're together like this.

389
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,890
So did she just leave like that?

390
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,300
Eun Ji ahjumma.

391
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,900
Yeah.

392
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,310
I think so.

393
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,210
You didn't run the 
parentage test, huh?

394
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,110
No.

395
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,640
But Ba Reun...

396
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,990
For some reason...

397
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,540
I think she's my real mom.

398
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,150
How come?

399
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,860
Just because.

400
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,680
I just feel like it.

401
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,110
You feel it?

402
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,390
Then, don't you want 
to meet her again?

403
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,360
Well?

404
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,190
I'm not sure.

405
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,130
If she's really my birth mom,

406
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,890
I wouldn't even know what to do.

407
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,200
But Chae Woon noona
 was like that, too.

408
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,840
Several people came for

409
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,420
Chae Woon noona, 
claiming to be her birth parents.

410
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,410
But whenever that happened,

411
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,860
Chae Woon noona said 
everyone felt like her birth parents.

412
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,220
She says, "Not this time."

413
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,540
And when she met them,

414
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,030
she'd again...

415
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,180
feel like that person was 
her birth mom...

416
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,690
or her birth dad.

417
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,700
She felt that way.

418
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,040
Then when they turned out 
they weren't, she'd get so upset.

419
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,200
Gosh, Chae Woon unni...

420
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,870
I see.

421
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,260
I think I feel similar to her.

422
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,350
I feel like she's my birth mom, 
even if she's not.

423
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,730
This is my first time.

424
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,260
Ahjussi, are you okay?

425
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,800
Does it hurt anywhere?

426
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,260
Do you recognize me?

427
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,300
Of course, I do.

428
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,110
The food truck incident.

429
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,700
Yes.

430
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,940
I'm really sorry about that.

431
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,000
I didn't go out there 
to scam you last time.

432
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,420
I went out because 
someone asked me to.

433
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,890
It's okay.

434
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,880
You still told me the truth back then.

435
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,110
I didn't lose that much.

436
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,660
Thank you.

437
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,810
No need to thank me.

438
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,200
I'm sorry.

439
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,120
Bit Chae Woon unni is resting at home.

440
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,550
She said she'll be back
 when she feels better.

441
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,050
Tell Seo Yeon not to come back.

442
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,840
I'm fine.

443
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,140
Get better soon, ahjussi.

444
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,560
Yes. So that Chae Woon noona 
won't worry too much.

445
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,160
Come in.

446
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,390
CEO, I made some porridge.

447
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,920
Try some.

448
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,520
Director Seo Ah went into the office.

449
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,810
She said she has
 some things to wrap up.

450
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,620
Really?

451
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,710
But Hae Deun, why are you here?

452
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,720
If you're going to work
 from here today,

453
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,010
I thought you might need me.

454
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,450
No. I don't need you.

455
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,110
Go home.

456
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,640
You stayed up all night 
at the hospital last night.

457
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,370
You must be tired.

458
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,590
Yes.

459
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,540
I'll leave after changing
 the water in the humidifier.

460
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,440
- Hae Deun.
- Yes?

461
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,960
By chance...

462
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,580
are you two considering 
marriage or...

463
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,800
you're not very serious 
and intimate, are you?

464
00:35:35,746 --> 00:35:37,786
Well, um...

465
00:35:37,786 --> 00:35:39,216
Hae Deun.

466
00:35:39,216 --> 00:35:41,296
At home and the office,

467
00:35:41,296 --> 00:35:44,336
you're following me 
around looking after me.

468
00:35:44,336 --> 00:35:46,136
That makes me feel uncomfortable.

469
00:35:46,136 --> 00:35:48,286
I hope you stop that.

470
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:52,346
It's because you won't 
approve of our relationship.

471
00:35:53,956 --> 00:35:56,796
Do you think I'll approve
 if you do this?

472
00:35:56,796 --> 00:35:59,886
There's no other way besides this.

473
00:35:59,886 --> 00:36:01,726
My gosh.

474
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:05,006
Hae Deun, you have a strong ego.

475
00:36:05,006 --> 00:36:08,056
If I treat you like this,

476
00:36:08,056 --> 00:36:11,366
shouldn't you quit because 
of your bruised ego?

477
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:13,996
Why do you make me the 
bad person in this?

478
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:17,086
I'm sorry.

479
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:21,026
Yes, I have a strong ego.

480
00:36:21,026 --> 00:36:23,176
So when you treat me like this,

481
00:36:23,176 --> 00:36:26,546
it really hurts my ego
 and makes me sad.

482
00:36:27,796 --> 00:36:30,146
But for the first time,

483
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,996
I think I found something 
more precious than my ego.

484
00:36:33,996 --> 00:36:36,136
From what I heard, you also

485
00:36:36,136 --> 00:36:38,716
pursued love that people opposed.

486
00:36:38,716 --> 00:36:41,666
Then don't you understand
 how I feel?

487
00:36:42,616 --> 00:36:43,856
I do understand.

488
00:36:43,856 --> 00:36:45,896
I understand way too well.

489
00:36:45,896 --> 00:36:49,346
But I know how bitter and
 empty the end of that love is

490
00:36:49,346 --> 00:36:51,316
That's why I'm so against it.

491
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:54,776
There's a reason why the 
parents opposed a relationship.

492
00:36:54,776 --> 00:36:59,126
Even if it's tough and 
torturous now...

493
00:36:59,126 --> 00:37:00,616
But still, CEO.

494
00:37:00,616 --> 00:37:02,886
If you could go back to that time,

495
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:04,766
would you not pursue that love?

496
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,916
If you were the same CEO then.
 Not your current self.

497
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:11,806
Joon Ah and I could...

498
00:37:11,806 --> 00:37:14,806
regret this later, but...

499
00:37:14,806 --> 00:37:17,416
we'll work hard at it, 
so that doesn't happen.

500
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:21,326
We don't want to break up only 
because our family tree is tangled.

501
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:25,046
I'm sorry for speaking up rudely.

502
00:37:27,676 --> 00:37:29,266
Thank you.

503
00:37:29,266 --> 00:37:31,066
I'll enjoy the porridge.

504
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:33,366
Sure.

505
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:46,716
Well, CEO.

506
00:37:46,716 --> 00:37:49,016
Actually...

507
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:51,556
What?

508
00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:53,746
Do you have something else to say?

509
00:37:55,366 --> 00:37:58,066
No. Enjoy the porridge.

510
00:38:08,796 --> 00:38:10,596
Hae Deun, this...

511
00:38:11,716 --> 00:38:13,146
Who made this?

512
00:38:13,146 --> 00:38:15,776
I did. Isn't it delicious?

513
00:38:15,776 --> 00:38:17,806
I have...

514
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:20,826
never eaten anything like this before.

515
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:22,086
- Gosh.
- Right?

516
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:23,776
Mr. Makjang said the same thing.

517
00:38:23,776 --> 00:38:26,076
I made lots of porridge 
over there. Enjoy.

518
00:38:34,886 --> 00:38:38,016
So you still don't know
 where Eun Ji is?

519
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,746
No, Noonim.

520
00:38:39,746 --> 00:38:43,696
I'm looking for her through
 my network of friends.

521
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,556
But she must be hiding really well.

522
00:38:46,526 --> 00:38:49,636
I'm looking for her through
 the hospital, but it's not easy.

523
00:38:49,636 --> 00:38:51,286
Gosh...

524
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:54,636
I want to find her before 
Ra Hoon goes to the military.

525
00:38:58,376 --> 00:39:00,016
- Ms. Noh?
- Yeah.

526
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:01,716
The owner. The landlord.

527
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:05,766
Samgwang landlord 
who lives in the States?

528
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:08,146
Hi, Ms. Noh.

529
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:11,406
Yes.

530
00:39:11,406 --> 00:39:14,236
I'm still looking...

531
00:39:14,236 --> 00:39:15,586
but I was in such a rush

532
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,756
that I can't find a good one.

533
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:19,176
Well...

534
00:39:19,176 --> 00:39:22,276
could you give us more time?

535
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:24,766
Does she want us out?

536
00:39:26,216 --> 00:39:28,116
I see...

537
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:32,776
Gosh, Ms. Noh is so mean.

538
00:39:32,776 --> 00:39:34,696
She said we could say until spring.

539
00:39:34,696 --> 00:39:36,756
Why is she telling us
 to move out so suddenly?

540
00:39:36,756 --> 00:39:38,886
I guess the house behind us

541
00:39:38,886 --> 00:39:41,436
is starting construction next month.

542
00:39:41,436 --> 00:39:44,256
I guess she wants to fix 
this place at the same time.

543
00:39:45,656 --> 00:39:47,296
Then as expected...

544
00:39:47,296 --> 00:39:49,766
she wants to demolish 
this Samgwang Villa

545
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:52,806
and build a new building?

546
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:54,996
I guess so.

547
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:59,296
When Ms. Noh called me last fall,

548
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,056
I was looking for a place.

549
00:40:02,056 --> 00:40:03,936
I was looking for one, too.

550
00:40:03,936 --> 00:40:05,386
I couldn't find any good place.

551
00:40:06,206 --> 00:40:08,636
You were looking, too?

552
00:40:08,636 --> 00:40:10,686
With Hwak Se.

553
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:12,256
I see.

554
00:40:12,256 --> 00:40:13,616
Gosh.

555
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:16,716
I lost your apartment.

556
00:40:16,716 --> 00:40:18,186
Of course, I should be accountable.

557
00:40:18,186 --> 00:40:21,246
Gosh, Man Jung. 
What are you saying?

558
00:40:21,246 --> 00:40:24,276
I do feel like I could 
rely on you, though.

559
00:40:24,276 --> 00:40:26,796
Since I wasn't the only one looking.

560
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:29,996
It will work out, Noonim.

561
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:33,346
There's nothing we can't do
 if Samgwang people come together.

562
00:40:33,346 --> 00:40:34,736
Of course.

563
00:40:35,606 --> 00:40:39,796
Or we could build the second 
Samgwang Villa in the outskirts.

564
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:42,566
That's right.

565
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:45,266
Or the Samgwang people 
could lift up this structure

566
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:47,026
and move to the outskirts.

567
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:49,416
Aigoo...

568
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:51,036
I heard there's a truck like that.

569
00:40:51,036 --> 00:40:52,356
A truck that moves houses
 in other countries.

570
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,786
They do that overseas.

571
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:54,866
- Yeah.
- Yup.

572
00:40:59,746 --> 00:41:01,386
 Ah, ah... 

573
00:41:01,386 --> 00:41:04,606
 Announcing to my beloved 
Samgwang Villa residents. 

574
00:41:04,606 --> 00:41:07,676
 We'll have an urgent meeting 
for Samgwang Villa residents. 

575
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:11,736
 Please gather at 
the jokbal place tonight. 

576
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:17,816
So Chae Woon, you were
 looking into it, too?

577
00:41:17,816 --> 00:41:20,576
Yeah, I was talking it 
over with Jae Hee.

578
00:41:20,576 --> 00:41:23,136
So I was looking up a few places

579
00:41:23,136 --> 00:41:25,726
where the moving schedule 
would work out like this.

580
00:41:25,726 --> 00:41:28,776
But I didn't know she'd ask us
 to move out all of a sudden.

581
00:41:28,776 --> 00:41:32,146
She can't make us move 
out of the blue, can she?

582
00:41:32,146 --> 00:41:36,056
We were supposed to 
move out last fall, but

583
00:41:36,056 --> 00:41:38,466
Mr. Noh was working
 with our situation.

584
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:41,876
In any case, it means 
we have to move out.

585
00:41:41,876 --> 00:41:43,576
That's right.

586
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:47,146
- I'm sad. Aren't you?
- Yeah.

587
00:41:47,146 --> 00:41:49,796
But must we move out?

588
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:52,306
Can't we negotiate 
a deal with Ms. Noh?

589
00:41:52,306 --> 00:41:55,916
I know. Maybe we should come up 
with a negotiation team...

590
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:57,396
and go to the US.

591
00:41:57,396 --> 00:41:59,786
- Gosh, that's too much.
- Too much.

592
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:01,476
I talked to Ms. Noh over the phone,

593
00:42:01,476 --> 00:42:03,396
and she's very insistent.

594
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,896
You called her, too?

595
00:42:05,896 --> 00:42:07,346
I did, too.

596
00:42:07,346 --> 00:42:10,126
No wonder she was 
so annoyed talking to me.

597
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:12,856
That grandma is pretty
 particular, to begin with.

598
00:42:13,816 --> 00:42:16,776
But still, there has to be a way.

599
00:42:16,776 --> 00:42:19,526
How about this?

600
00:42:19,526 --> 00:42:20,926
- Oh, my.
- Dad.

601
00:42:20,926 --> 00:42:22,236
Hello.

602
00:42:22,236 --> 00:42:23,686
Hwak Se, I'm sad.

603
00:42:23,686 --> 00:42:26,686
I'm a Samgwang Villa resident, too, 
and you didn't invite me.

604
00:42:26,686 --> 00:42:29,726
Gosh, I thought you'd be busy.

605
00:42:29,726 --> 00:42:31,866
Look at you. You were 
busy today in your suit.

606
00:42:31,866 --> 00:42:34,426
How did you find out?

607
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,246
I saw the group chat
 and figured it out.

608
00:42:38,496 --> 00:42:40,446
Dad, you're so quick.

609
00:42:41,466 --> 00:42:45,036
Dad, do you have a good idea?

610
00:42:45,036 --> 00:42:47,266
Well...

611
00:42:51,456 --> 00:42:54,186
Aigoo, it's that expensive?

612
00:42:54,186 --> 00:42:57,716
Gosh, we can't take that place.

613
00:42:57,716 --> 00:43:00,926
The timing was perfect
 for our move date.

614
00:43:00,926 --> 00:43:02,946
Yes, sir.

615
00:43:02,946 --> 00:43:05,626
Please call me again.

616
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:08,866
Aigoo...

617
00:43:10,466 --> 00:43:13,206
Gosh, what should we do?

618
00:43:13,206 --> 00:43:16,476
The date to move out is 
quickly approaching.

619
00:43:17,406 --> 00:43:21,026
Aigoo, aigoo. This is bad.

620
00:43:26,306 --> 00:43:27,746
Wait...

621
00:43:27,746 --> 00:43:29,606
Na Ro.

622
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:31,966
Hello, Mother.

623
00:43:35,476 --> 00:43:38,286
- Mother, I...
- Park Pil Hong...

624
00:43:38,286 --> 00:43:40,506
is recovering well.

625
00:43:40,506 --> 00:43:43,466
The surgery went well.

626
00:43:46,596 --> 00:43:48,216
I'm sorry.

627
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:51,236
It's all my fault.

628
00:43:57,856 --> 00:44:00,326
Na Ro...

629
00:44:00,326 --> 00:44:04,326
You had to carry your 
heavy heart alone.

630
00:44:04,326 --> 00:44:07,296
It must've been so tough for you.

631
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:12,086
I'm on my way to the police 
station to turn myself in.

632
00:44:13,856 --> 00:44:17,166
I wanted to see you 
before doing that, Mother.

633
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:19,356
That's why I stopped by.

634
00:44:20,676 --> 00:44:22,426
You did?

635
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:25,166
I'm glad you came, Na Ro.

636
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:29,516
You made a tough decision.

637
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:35,006
Then I'll get going.

638
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:38,116
Stay healthy, Mother.

639
00:44:44,636 --> 00:44:45,976
Wait.

640
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:50,466
Let's go inside and 
eat dinner before you go.

641
00:44:50,466 --> 00:44:51,886
No, it's okay.

642
00:44:51,886 --> 00:44:54,406
Gosh, eat before you go.

643
00:44:54,406 --> 00:44:56,776
Everyone is coming home late.

644
00:44:56,776 --> 00:44:59,116
I have to eat alone, too.

645
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:01,356
Please? Come inside.

646
00:45:01,356 --> 00:45:03,576
Yeah. Come in.

647
00:45:07,486 --> 00:45:09,776
Here. Scoop up some rice.

648
00:45:12,426 --> 00:45:14,306
Wherever you are...

649
00:45:14,306 --> 00:45:16,616
you have to eat well.

650
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:18,776
Eat well and stay healthy

651
00:45:18,776 --> 00:45:21,676
so that you could 
think good thoughts.

652
00:45:21,676 --> 00:45:22,896
Yes.

653
00:45:24,966 --> 00:45:28,616
And later on, 
be sure to come back.

654
00:45:28,616 --> 00:45:30,596
Maybe...

655
00:45:30,596 --> 00:45:33,046
we might be moving.

656
00:45:34,206 --> 00:45:35,816
Later on...

657
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,266
be sure to call me...

658
00:45:38,266 --> 00:45:40,446
and come find me, Na Ro.

659
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,636
Okay?

660
00:45:41,636 --> 00:45:43,326
I'll wait for you.

661
00:45:45,316 --> 00:45:46,766
Yes, Mother.

662
00:45:49,086 --> 00:45:50,886
Slow down and eat a lot.

663
00:45:50,886 --> 00:45:52,056
Okay.

664
00:45:56,366 --> 00:45:58,756
Here. Rice.

665
00:46:02,286 --> 00:46:03,876
Watch for the bones.

666
00:46:27,386 --> 00:46:29,476
I'm sorry, Seo Ah.

667
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:55,376
Mother.

668
00:46:55,376 --> 00:46:57,636
Aigoo, seriously.

669
00:47:01,766 --> 00:47:04,426
Aigoo. Aren't you hungry?

670
00:47:04,426 --> 00:47:06,246
I'm okay.

671
00:47:07,436 --> 00:47:10,296
Do you like chicken knife noodles? 
I thought I'd make it for lunch.

672
00:47:10,296 --> 00:47:12,506
Really? I love chicken knife noodles.

673
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:17,296
Mother...

674
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:19,396
I'll clean up there.

675
00:47:19,396 --> 00:47:21,326
Hae Deun's room?

676
00:47:21,326 --> 00:47:23,316
Oh, that's not good then.

677
00:47:23,316 --> 00:47:26,326
I'll clean everywhere else 
but that room.

678
00:47:27,916 --> 00:47:29,646
Don't.

679
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,986
- Joon Ah, don't clean.
- I really want to.

680
00:47:31,986 --> 00:47:33,506
Don't do it.

681
00:47:33,506 --> 00:47:35,186
I'll work hard, Mother.

682
00:47:38,896 --> 00:47:41,666
What? What was that look?
 Her look?

683
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:45,066
She definitely looked 
at me with affection.

684
00:47:45,066 --> 00:47:46,926
Good, good, good. I got her.

685
00:47:46,926 --> 00:47:49,216
My goodness. Joon Ah...

686
00:47:49,216 --> 00:47:52,206
He's so cute in a way.

687
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:54,276
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

688
00:47:54,276 --> 00:47:55,546
Gosh, no.

689
00:47:55,546 --> 00:47:57,896
Gosh, never. I can never do this.

690
00:47:57,896 --> 00:47:59,036
No, no.

691
00:47:59,036 --> 00:48:00,456
Aigoo.

692
00:48:00,456 --> 00:48:02,316
Aigoo...

693
00:48:12,586 --> 00:48:14,506
What's this?

694
00:48:14,506 --> 00:48:17,286
Certificate of family relations?

695
00:48:18,306 --> 00:48:23,016
Did Hae Deun have to submit 
a certificate of family relations?

696
00:48:23,866 --> 00:48:25,486
Wait a minute!

697
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,466
Spouse...

698
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:29,386
 
Jang Joon Ah?

699
00:48:29,386 --> 00:48:31,186
Jang Joon Ah is here, Mother.

700
00:48:31,186 --> 00:48:32,476
Should I mop here, Mother?

701
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,956
- I'll work hard.
- Come here, Joon Ah.

702
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:35,546
Why is...

703
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:38,746
On the certificate
 of family relations,

704
00:48:38,746 --> 00:48:41,216
why are you listed 
as Hae Deun's spouse?

705
00:48:41,216 --> 00:48:43,226
Aigoo, what are you doing?

706
00:48:43,226 --> 00:48:44,826
Give it!

707
00:48:44,826 --> 00:48:46,296
Wait...

708
00:48:46,296 --> 00:48:48,466
Why, why are you her spouse?

709
00:48:48,466 --> 00:48:50,716
- Mom, what are you doing here?
- Ra Hoon.

710
00:48:50,716 --> 00:48:53,476
For Hae Deun's certificate
 of family relations,

711
00:48:53,476 --> 00:48:56,996
why is Joon Ah listed
 as her spouse?

712
00:48:56,996 --> 00:48:59,246
"Spouse: Jang Joon Ah"?

713
00:48:59,246 --> 00:49:01,306
Mr. Makjang?

714
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:06,026
Whoa! Hae Deun noona
 is trying so hard.

715
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,616
She must love Joon Ah hyung so much
 that she made a fake certificate

716
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:11,356
to look like a married couple? 
So childish.

717
00:49:11,356 --> 00:49:13,266
Right.

718
00:49:13,266 --> 00:49:15,056
That's it, right?

719
00:49:15,056 --> 00:49:17,426
Gosh, she's playing around, huh?

720
00:49:17,426 --> 00:49:19,136
- Seriously.
- Mother...

721
00:49:19,136 --> 00:49:21,556
- Gosh.
- Mother, it's true.

722
00:49:21,556 --> 00:49:23,056
What?

723
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:25,726
It's true that we're married.

724
00:49:25,726 --> 00:49:26,946
Married?

725
00:49:26,946 --> 00:49:29,696
What are you talking about? 
When did you get married?

726
00:49:29,696 --> 00:49:31,226
Then is this...

727
00:49:31,226 --> 00:49:33,786
Mother, I'm sorry. 
We got our marriage license.

728
00:49:33,786 --> 00:49:35,116
Oh, my God!

729
00:49:35,116 --> 00:49:36,476
What are you talking about?

730
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:37,476
Hyung!

731
00:49:37,476 --> 00:49:39,486
Mr. Makjang.

732
00:49:39,486 --> 00:49:41,916
Mom, Mom, Mom...

733
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:44,086
I'm really sorry, Mother.

734
00:49:44,086 --> 00:49:45,426
I'm sorry, Mother.

735
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,016
- Gosh, Joon Ah!
- I'm sorry.

736
00:49:53,446 --> 00:49:55,826
For the upcoming photoshoot,

737
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,586
I think this would look nice
 as the main item.

738
00:50:01,216 --> 00:50:04,216
More than that, how about 
we mix and match like this?

739
00:50:04,216 --> 00:50:06,546
Lee Hae Deun, it's nice.

740
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:12,096
 That smile means 
she's starting to like me. 

741
00:50:12,096 --> 00:50:13,486
You have a good feel for it.

742
00:50:13,486 --> 00:50:14,786
 Yay! 

743
00:50:20,206 --> 00:50:22,096
Hi, Soon Jung.

744
00:50:22,096 --> 00:50:23,666
Yeah.

745
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:25,106
Why?

746
00:50:26,196 --> 00:50:27,466
What?

747
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:31,066
Marriage license?

748
00:50:33,766 --> 00:50:35,266
Lee Hae Deun.

749
00:50:35,306 --> 00:50:36,586
Yes?

750
00:50:36,586 --> 00:50:40,316
Did you get your marriage
 license with Joon Ah?

751
00:50:40,316 --> 00:50:42,456
How did you know that?

752
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,916
What?

753
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,116
Oh, my gosh.

754
00:50:46,116 --> 00:50:47,936
Had Deun!

755
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:55,416
Oh, my God.

756
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:57,886
I can't even believe this...

757
00:50:57,886 --> 00:50:59,916
Lee Hae Deun.

758
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:03,056
Is that why you were stuck 
with me and targeted me?

759
00:51:03,056 --> 00:51:04,876
As my daughter-in-law?

760
00:51:04,876 --> 00:51:07,146
Well, not as your daughter-in-law...

761
00:51:07,146 --> 00:51:10,446
but from honestly liking you, CEO...

762
00:51:10,446 --> 00:51:12,776
- Joon Ah.
- Yes.

763
00:51:12,866 --> 00:51:17,586
Then you were acting like that 
with me as my son-in-law.

764
00:51:18,566 --> 00:51:22,056
Of course, I did have that in mind
 to a certain extent, Mother.

765
00:51:22,056 --> 00:51:25,326
But I truly wanted 
to help you out more.

766
00:51:25,326 --> 00:51:29,186
Honestly, seeing how hard
 you worked, Hae Deun...

767
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,326
my heart was wavering.

768
00:51:32,496 --> 00:51:34,246
You, too, CEO?

769
00:51:34,266 --> 00:51:38,866
I was actually starting to think 
like that about Joon Ah these days.

770
00:51:38,956 --> 00:51:40,686
- Really?
- Really, Mother?

771
00:51:40,686 --> 00:51:42,736
But this is wrong.

772
00:51:42,736 --> 00:51:45,886
How could you get a marriage
 license on your own?

773
00:51:45,886 --> 00:51:48,706
Well, Mom, as for that...

774
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:53,526
We didn't do that out 
of rebellion toward our moms...

775
00:51:53,526 --> 00:51:55,556
That wasn't our intention 
at all. We just...

776
00:51:55,556 --> 00:51:57,546
thought if we did that,

777
00:51:57,546 --> 00:52:01,216
we could be more firm
 in our willingness, right?

778
00:52:01,216 --> 00:52:03,236
Gosh, Joon Ah.

779
00:52:03,236 --> 00:52:05,936
I'm so disappointed in you, Joon Ah.

780
00:52:05,936 --> 00:52:09,046
How could you come up 
with such an idea?

781
00:52:09,046 --> 00:52:11,986
I think Hae Deun is the one
 who encouraged it.

782
00:52:11,986 --> 00:52:13,206
Isn't that right?

783
00:52:13,206 --> 00:52:14,326
What?

784
00:52:14,326 --> 00:52:19,106
Well, Mom. She didn't 
encourage, Mom. Never.

785
00:52:19,106 --> 00:52:21,466
Hae Deun and I are one 
at heart, so...

786
00:52:21,466 --> 00:52:23,546
even when we see our eyes, 
we just know.

787
00:52:23,546 --> 00:52:25,346
We see, we know. Like that.

788
00:52:25,346 --> 00:52:29,716
Our hearts connected. So we came up 
with the idea at the same time.

789
00:52:29,716 --> 00:52:31,226
To get our marriage license.

790
00:52:31,226 --> 00:52:35,556
Even if your feelings 
connected at the moment,

791
00:52:35,556 --> 00:52:38,246
you're older than her, Joon Ah.

792
00:52:38,246 --> 00:52:40,256
You should've talked her out of it.

793
00:52:40,256 --> 00:52:41,936
Wait, Soon Jung.

794
00:52:41,936 --> 00:52:44,486
They're adults. Why are you 
blaming their age?

795
00:52:44,486 --> 00:52:47,006
And Hae Deun is an adult.

796
00:52:47,006 --> 00:52:49,336
Hae Deun must've 
muttered her idea first

797
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:51,816
for Joon Ah to go along with it.

798
00:52:51,816 --> 00:52:55,396
Gosh, mutter?

799
00:52:55,396 --> 00:52:57,566
CEO.

800
00:52:57,566 --> 00:53:00,436
That's not right.

801
00:53:00,436 --> 00:53:03,676
Mom. Mom, why are you 
acting like this?

802
00:53:05,826 --> 00:53:08,086
I'm not pleased.

803
00:53:08,086 --> 00:53:11,576
Hae Deun, how could you 
be so audacious?

804
00:53:11,576 --> 00:53:13,796
How could you think
 of such a thing?

805
00:53:13,796 --> 00:53:15,746
Gosh, CEO.

806
00:53:15,746 --> 00:53:20,396
There's no way Hae Deun would've
 done this all by herself.

807
00:53:20,396 --> 00:53:23,626
They say it takes two to tango.

808
00:53:23,626 --> 00:53:25,206
I'm sure they planned it together.

809
00:53:25,206 --> 00:53:26,556
Mother...

810
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:28,426
Oh, my. Joon Ah.

811
00:53:28,426 --> 00:53:29,286
Yes?

812
00:53:29,286 --> 00:53:31,586
What's wrong with your hands?

813
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:33,916
You have sensitive skin.

814
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:36,686
You said you were helping out here. 
How much did you work?

815
00:53:36,686 --> 00:53:38,686
You have eczema!

816
00:53:38,686 --> 00:53:40,496
Soon Jung.

817
00:53:40,496 --> 00:53:43,246
No matter how he tried, 
you should've stopped him.

818
00:53:43,246 --> 00:53:46,026
CEO, I didn't make him work.

819
00:53:46,026 --> 00:53:48,866
I kept telling him to stop, 
and he refused his help.

820
00:53:48,866 --> 00:53:50,776
But Joon Ah would just 
push his way through.

821
00:53:50,776 --> 00:53:53,256
That's right, Mom. 
Mother is telling the truth.

822
00:53:53,256 --> 00:53:54,996
Mother kept rebelling.

823
00:53:54,996 --> 00:53:56,426
- Rebel?
- Huh?

824
00:53:56,426 --> 00:53:58,496
Not rebel... 
What the heck am I saying?

825
00:53:58,496 --> 00:54:00,636
I mean, Mother kept
 trying to stop me, but

826
00:54:00,636 --> 00:54:02,676
I was stubborn and insistent.

827
00:54:02,676 --> 00:54:04,266
So I did the housework, Mom.

828
00:54:04,266 --> 00:54:07,766
And CEO, as for my Hae Deun...

829
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:10,346
She took care of you...

830
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:14,216
and made you porridge. 
I heard that she did her best.

831
00:54:14,216 --> 00:54:19,186
I haven't even tasted the porridge
 that Hae Deun made for me.

832
00:54:19,186 --> 00:54:22,096
Gosh, it's better you don't 
taste that porridge.

833
00:54:22,096 --> 00:54:23,796
- My goodness.
- What?

834
00:54:23,796 --> 00:54:25,366
Wait...

835
00:54:25,366 --> 00:54:28,376
Mom, Mom, why are you 
acting like this?

836
00:54:28,376 --> 00:54:30,816
These kids are the ones
 who did wrong.

837
00:54:30,816 --> 00:54:33,536
"These kids"? Huh?

838
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:36,586
I'm your older brother. 
You keep calling me "Joon Ah."

839
00:54:36,586 --> 00:54:38,106
I'm sorry.

840
00:54:38,106 --> 00:54:40,806
Joon Ah and Hae Deun are at fault.

841
00:54:40,806 --> 00:54:44,136
- "Joon Ah"?
- Why are you getting upset?

842
00:54:44,136 --> 00:54:45,976
- I know.
- That's what I mean.

843
00:54:45,976 --> 00:54:47,126
Gosh...

844
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:50,266
Geez.

845
00:54:50,266 --> 00:54:54,166
I even thought of approving your 
relationship because I felt sorry for you.

846
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,766
But this is wrong. 
I could never accept this.

847
00:54:56,866 --> 00:54:59,266
Me, neither. 
I can't accept this, Hae Deun.

848
00:54:59,346 --> 00:55:02,836
How can you do this 
without even telling me?

849
00:55:02,836 --> 00:55:05,466
I'm so disappointed in you!

850
00:55:05,466 --> 00:55:07,296
Mom, what could we do now?

851
00:55:07,296 --> 00:55:08,726
What do you mean?

852
00:55:08,726 --> 00:55:11,706
You did that on your own. 
Live with it.

853
00:55:11,706 --> 00:55:13,236
I won't see you ever again.

854
00:55:13,236 --> 00:55:14,796
Mom.

855
00:55:14,796 --> 00:55:16,336
Same with me, Joon Ah!

856
00:55:16,336 --> 00:55:18,446
You had a heart-to-heart with me.

857
00:55:18,446 --> 00:55:20,546
How could you do this to me?

858
00:55:20,546 --> 00:55:23,106
Mom, but that's...

859
00:55:23,106 --> 00:55:24,846
Yes, we understand.

860
00:55:24,846 --> 00:55:26,696
Huh? What?

861
00:55:26,696 --> 00:55:29,076
We can't help it if you two 
would oppose to the end.

862
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,786
It's not like we can get divorced.

863
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:32,856
The ink on the marriage
 license isn't even dry yet.

864
00:55:32,856 --> 00:55:35,826
Hey, what will you do then?

865
00:55:35,826 --> 00:55:38,676
We will go somewhere far away.

866
00:55:38,676 --> 00:55:40,016
Since you oppose,

867
00:55:40,016 --> 00:55:42,116
we'll leave our home 
and live somewhere far.

868
00:55:42,116 --> 00:55:43,556
Hey, Hae Deun.

869
00:55:43,556 --> 00:55:44,816
Hey, Lee Hae Deun!

870
00:55:46,366 --> 00:55:49,706
I... I think the same...

871
00:55:49,706 --> 00:55:51,066
Joon Ah.

872
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:53,966
I feel the same way. We'll go far.

873
00:55:54,066 --> 00:55:56,566
- Jang Joon Ah.
- Yes?

874
00:55:57,526 --> 00:55:59,026
Joon Ah.

875
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:01,066
Think this through.

876
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:04,286
You can't resolve matters 
in life out of stubbornness.

877
00:56:04,286 --> 00:56:06,546
Mother, we're not being stubborn.

878
00:56:06,546 --> 00:56:08,086
We love each other.

879
00:56:08,086 --> 00:56:10,346
- Yes, love. Love.
- We're in love.

880
00:56:12,026 --> 00:56:13,626
All right.

881
00:56:13,626 --> 00:56:15,246
Leave then.

882
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,436
 Pardon? 

883
00:56:16,436 --> 00:56:18,456
I said, leave.

884
00:56:18,456 --> 00:56:22,116
- What?
- I'm not scared of you leaving anymore.

885
00:56:22,116 --> 00:56:24,696
Seo Ah left and came back.

886
00:56:24,696 --> 00:56:26,966
I'm exhausted now.

887
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,546
You do whatever you want.

888
00:56:28,546 --> 00:56:30,436
Leave, Jang Joon Ah. Go.

889
00:56:30,436 --> 00:56:32,366
Sit. Sit down.

890
00:56:32,366 --> 00:56:33,596
Wait...

891
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:36,856
Sit back down. Leave?

892
00:56:38,006 --> 00:56:39,456
Okay, we'll leave now.

893
00:56:39,456 --> 00:56:41,436
- We'll leave now, Mom.
- Joon Ah.

894
00:56:41,436 --> 00:56:42,576
Will you really do this?

895
00:56:42,576 --> 00:56:44,836
Should I go, Mom? Really?

896
00:56:44,836 --> 00:56:46,506
- I'm leaving.
- Hey.

897
00:56:46,506 --> 00:56:48,146
- Sit. 
- I'm leaving, Mom.

898
00:56:48,146 --> 00:56:49,686
Hey, Lee Hae Deun!

899
00:56:49,686 --> 00:56:51,266
- Leave them alone?
- Let them be!

900
00:56:51,266 --> 00:56:52,816
Gosh.

901
00:56:52,816 --> 00:56:55,116
Mom...

902
00:56:55,116 --> 00:56:57,846
Gosh, CEO.

903
00:56:57,846 --> 00:57:01,536
This won't work. 
Seeing how they are...

904
00:57:01,536 --> 00:57:04,896
we can't give in this way.

905
00:57:04,896 --> 00:57:06,736
That's right.

906
00:57:06,736 --> 00:57:09,306
We should stand up against them.

907
00:57:10,566 --> 00:57:11,996
My gosh...

908
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:15,566
Wait, Mom...

909
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:20,076
So cold.

910
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,106
Where do we go?

911
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,156
I know.

912
00:57:24,156 --> 00:57:26,746
We did the right thing
 by leaving, right?

913
00:57:26,746 --> 00:57:28,246
Huh?

914
00:57:28,246 --> 00:57:30,516
We already walked out.

915
00:57:30,516 --> 00:57:33,336
Besides, this is the only path we have.

916
00:57:33,336 --> 00:57:34,586
You saw our moms, Director Lee.

917
00:57:34,586 --> 00:57:37,396
They keep opposing us and 
saying things to discourage us.

918
00:57:37,396 --> 00:57:38,486
Gosh, seriously.

919
00:57:38,486 --> 00:57:40,756
As for that, this is quite
 shocking for them.

920
00:57:40,756 --> 00:57:44,636
I know. So why did you get the
 certificate of family relations?

921
00:57:44,636 --> 00:57:48,226
I mean, I thought it was neat. 
So I got a copy. So what?

922
00:57:48,226 --> 00:57:51,166
Nothing. I'm in the wrong.

923
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,686
So cold.

924
00:57:52,686 --> 00:57:55,576
Gosh, whatever. They were 
bound to find out anyway.

925
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:56,896
Let's go.

926
00:57:56,896 --> 00:57:59,786
Since it's cold, 
let me go get our coats.

927
00:57:59,786 --> 00:58:02,436
We should've grabbed
 our coats on our way out.

928
00:58:02,436 --> 00:58:05,116
How could we do that?

929
00:58:05,116 --> 00:58:07,266
I know...

930
00:58:07,266 --> 00:58:09,586
If we go back in, we'll look bad.

931
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:12,076
Endure with the power of love.

932
00:58:12,076 --> 00:58:14,586
I don't think the power
 of love would work that well.

933
00:58:14,586 --> 00:58:17,236
- I'll hug you.
- I'm so cold!

934
00:58:17,236 --> 00:58:18,906
You're so annoyed.

935
00:58:38,906 --> 00:58:41,876
Professor, hello.

936
00:58:43,866 --> 00:58:48,066
I feel like I was always 
on the receiving end.

937
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,386
The dinner is on me.

938
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:53,066
Thank you, Noonim.

939
00:58:56,776 --> 00:58:58,566
Professor.

940
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:04,466
I've been thinking about this a lot.

941
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:07,856
Since getting to know you,

942
00:59:07,856 --> 00:59:11,946
I did get butterflies...

943
00:59:11,946 --> 00:59:15,356
and it's true that 
my heart was wavering.

944
00:59:16,596 --> 00:59:18,016
I see.

945
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:22,546
But when I thought about it,

946
00:59:22,546 --> 00:59:24,896
I realized...

947
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:29,096
I think it was more 
of compassion for Ba Wi.

948
00:59:33,706 --> 00:59:37,216
My Ba Wi sure loves you a lot.

949
00:59:38,476 --> 00:59:41,976
When I see Ba Wi, he reminds me 
of when Jae Hee used to be little.

950
00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:44,546
I cared for him, especially 
for that reason, but

951
00:59:46,146 --> 00:59:50,986
I don't think that's a good thing.

952
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:56,056
Ba Wi does have a bigger
 expectation from you.

953
00:59:56,056 --> 00:59:58,376
Because he does long for a mom.

954
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,186
That's why...

955
01:00:02,186 --> 01:00:08,406
I think I should put 
a stop to my feelings.

956
01:00:08,406 --> 01:00:11,756
That's why I wanted to 
meet you today, Professor.

957
01:00:13,806 --> 01:00:17,046
To put a stop means...

958
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:20,056
Do you mean we 
shouldn't meet anymore?

959
01:00:20,056 --> 01:00:23,286
No, it's not like that.

960
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:28,726
Actually, I'm going to go 
somewhere for a while.

961
01:00:29,886 --> 01:00:33,896
There's something else 
that I need to take care of.

962
01:00:35,826 --> 01:00:38,896
If I disappear all of a sudden,

963
01:00:38,896 --> 01:00:41,516
I thought Ba Wi and 
you might worry about me.

964
01:00:41,516 --> 01:00:43,276
That's why I'm telling you.

965
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,256
Well...

966
01:00:47,256 --> 01:00:51,986
did I ever make you feel 
uncomfortable, Noonim?

967
01:00:51,986 --> 01:00:54,456
If that's the case, 
please tell me with ease.

968
01:00:54,456 --> 01:00:56,056
No.

969
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:58,336
It's really not like that.

970
01:00:58,336 --> 01:01:03,416
You were so warm and 
good toward me, Professor.

971
01:01:05,336 --> 01:01:07,296
Thank you so much.

972
01:01:23,776 --> 01:01:25,956
You did well, Jung Min Jae.

973
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,650
You did well.

974
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,140
Then the next step is...

975
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,010
It's pretty.

976
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,630
All right...

977
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:46,290
Look. Look at this.

978
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:49,110
- It's coming out!
- What's this?

979
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,780
- What's this?
- Isn't it neat?

980
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,310
- It went off. Is it okay?
- It's supposed to.

981
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:54,820
Look, Hae Deun.

982
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,770
I hid some food in the office pantry.

983
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:57,930
Did I do well?

984
01:01:57,930 --> 01:01:59,220
Compliment me.

985
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,260
- You did well.
- Did I?

986
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,420
- You did well?
- Am I good?

987
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,580
Our mothers think that 
we didn't bring anything out,

988
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,100
so they must think we went 
to Auntie or Jae Hee's.

989
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,800
We're taking good care of ourselves.

990
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,410
But it is cold here at night.

991
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:13,030
- Are you cold?
- Yeah.

992
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,460
Then I should turn up the heat.

993
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:16,660
How is it?

994
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,650
- What in the world?
- You're not cold anymore?

995
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:19,570
- You're not cold, right?
 - Right.

996
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:20,640
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

997
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,590
Why did you light the candles?
 Are you a shaman or something?

998
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:24,220
No. Look.

999
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:29,160
We get to spend our
 first night together.

1000
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,110
You're right.

1001
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:34,150
Daebak. This is our first night?

1002
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,220
Yeah.

1003
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,600
Oh, no, Hae Deun...

1004
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,580
I'm sorry we're spending our 
first night together like this, honeybuns.

1005
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:41,700
Honey...

1006
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,450
It's okay, honeybuns.

1007
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:44,940
- Honeybuns.
- Honeybuns.

1008
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,500
Honeybuns.

1009
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,440
What should we do
 tomorrow, honeybuns?

1010
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,750
Well, we'll beg for 
forgiveness, honeybuns.

1011
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,200
And cross-mark again.

1012
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,740
- Cross-mark again, honeybuns?
- Yes, honeybuns.

1013
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,220
- Let's do that, honeybuns.
- Okay, honeybuns.

1014
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:56,890
It's nice to be together, honeybuns.

1015
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:58,580
- Right, honeybuns?
- Yeah, honeybuns...

1016
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,120
- "Honeybuns" sounds so good.
- Honeybuns.

1017
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,200
Honeybuns.

1018
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,650
- I love you.
- Me, too, honeybuns.

1019
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:04,190
Really? Shall we kiss?

1020
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,470
Gosh, I'm so happy right now.

1021
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:11,880
One more time.

1022
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,760
- This is crazy.
- Why?

1023
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,110
I love it.

1024
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:19,310
What the heck? You scared me.

1025
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:21,290
So nice. Let's kiss.

1026
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,210
What's going on?

1027
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:41,770
What's this?

1028
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:43,430
What? Is there a fire?

1029
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:45,220
Wait...

1030
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:46,780
Oh, no...

1031
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,150
Honeybuns!

1032
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,670
Wait, wait.

1033
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:54,050
What do we do?

1034
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:55,490
Oh, my!

1035
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:56,870
Here.

1036
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:59,550
- Put on a cap.
- Why?

1037
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:02,890
♫  Hey, you  ♫

1038
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:06,600
♫  Let's live a good life  ♫

1039
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,900
 Gosh, what a relief. 

1040
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:19,690
Jung Min Jae still must rely on me.

1041
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,580
- I'm home.
- I'm home.

1042
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:27,690
Welcome. Did you have a good day?

1043
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:29,730
Father, why are you cleaning?

1044
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,740
You're supposed to clean
 with me this weekend.

1045
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,570
You cleaned last time, too, 
Chae Woon.

1046
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,140
So I cheated this time, too.

1047
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:37,000
How can you do that?

1048
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,420
I'm doing it.

1049
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:42,520
Geez, I'm getting jealous 
as soon as I get home.

1050
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,280
- Really?
- Really?

1051
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,770
- Sorry about that.
- Sorry about that.

1052
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:47,500
What in the world?

1053
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,890
Jung Min Jae.

1054
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,860
- Mother.
- Mom!

1055
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,880
Mom, are you going on a trip?

1056
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,230
Yeah.

1057
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,750
To where?

1058
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,270
Somewhere.

1059
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:05,140
But before that,

1060
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,420
I have to meet someone. 
That's why I'm here.

1061
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,370
Who? Me?

1062
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:12,040
No.

1063
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:15,950
Woo Jung Hoo 2.

1064
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:20,180
Woo Jung Hoo 2?

1065
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,440
2?

1066
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,460
If you say 2...

1067
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,510
Woo Jung Hoo 2! To your place!

1068
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:29,720
Yes, ma'am!

1069
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,760
Woo Jung Hoo, here I am!

1070
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,260
At your service!

1071
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,850
What, what's going on?

1072
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,270
- Father...
- Dad...

1073
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:52,410
♫  In the extravagant building forest  ♫

1074
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:56,260
♫  You're walking with 
confidence, City Boy  ♫

1075
01:05:56,260 --> 01:06:00,240
♫  In the suffocating gaze of people  ♫

1076
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:04,240
♫  You're walking 
with pride, Working Girl  ♫

1077
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:09,140
♫  You're the star of this city, 
So beautiful Girl  ♫

1078
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:15,440
♫  You can make every
 dream come true  ♫

1079
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,340
♫  If you say so, it'll happen  ♫

1080
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,430
♫  Oh baby  ♫

1081
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:24,290
♫  Passion, I want to know
 everything about you  ♫

1082
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:27,800
♫  Motion, even a little gesture  ♫
