1
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,640
  Excuse me.  

2
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,610
  - Hwang Na Ro! 
 - Hwang Na Ro.  

3
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,490
Good morning, Bit Chae Woon.

4
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,340
- Why are you here? 
 - Here?

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,040
I'm here to find someone.

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,920
  Who?  

7
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,700
Is he your friend, Mr. Woo?

8
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,490
Hello.

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,770
I know him, but he's not my friend.

10
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,690
Ah, is that so. He's not your friend.

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,140
Who are you going to see here?

12
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,340
Ah, it is...

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,730
Are you here to meet Mr. Lee?

14
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,260
You have been staring at Mr. Lee the whole time.

15
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,420
Why would he? This is my first time meeting him.

16
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,900
I know. I was looking at you because you looked familiar.

17
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,430
But I guess we never met before? What is your name?

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,010
- Is it Park-- 
 - My name is Lee Dong Chool.

19
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,330
Mr. Lee Dong Chool.

20
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,220
I guess I don't know you.

21
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,110
  Hey!  

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,680
What are you doing after coming here all of a sudden?

23
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,840
I came to the branch store near here, but I had something to tell you.

24
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,820
What is it?

25
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,630
- Since you're here, why don't you have a cup of coffee? Even though you're not Mr. Woo's friend. 
- I'm fine. Thank you.

26
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,440
- I don't like to drink coffee from a stranger. 
 - Is that so?

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,530
Then, I'll go back to work.

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,840
     

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,550
Peek-a-boo!

30
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,070
What the hell!

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,930
You bastard! You can't beat me.

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,210
Hey! Don't you know that one of the millions of nicknames that praise me is a tiger without feet?

33
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,420
And it's even a Jiri mountain tiger.

34
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,120
I pretend to be tricked to please you, you old man.

35
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,360
But you did use your brain.

36
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,640
How did you know that I was here?

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,110
What are you talking about it?

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,460
- One of the millions of nicknames that praise me is-- 
 - I don't want to hear about that.

39
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,980
It seems like my babies hate you.

40
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,530
When you came in there, they looked at you as if you're a puppy with poop on it.

41
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,740
My Seo Yeon and my future son-in-law looked at you like that.

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,740
Your future son-in-law? My god, what a nonsense.

43
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,250
Hwang Na Ro, I feel bad for you.

44
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,610
So you're going to be close with them here?

45
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,880
What is it? Is it "pulling a family string tactic" or something like that?

46
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, would it work even after she finds out that you're the father who threw her away?

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,560
You bastard, don't you shut your mouth? Do you want to get out of this field forever?

48
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,480
I wonder how long you can shout at me like this.

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,520
The tables are turned already.

50
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,320
What?

51
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,740
I wouldn't bother you that much since you need to prepare for your retirement.

52
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,840
So, don't provoke me.

53
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,450
Did you understand me?

54
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,640
Also!

55
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,720
Don't grab me by the collar next time.

56
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,120
Let's try to look dandy to others. Okay?

57
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,620
Then, good luck with your work.

58
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,710
Sure. I like that we don't interrupt each other's business.

59
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:17,190
But if you damage anything of Seo Yeon, who is Bit Chae Woon, I'm going to kill you. Did you hear me?

60
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,680
Wow. Is this that something called paternal love?

61
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,040
It doesn't suit you, why are you doing that?

62
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,640
That kind of concept doesn't suit you.

63
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,080
Good luck with your work!

64
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,940
Yes, Na Ro. When I was your age, I was acting up like you, too.

65
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,980
I was so innocent because I didn't know how scary the world is.

66
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:49,640
Then, when you fall to the gutter, you'll get some sense.

67
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,090
Where this doll came from?

68
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,810
It's a waste just to throw it out.

69
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,990
I feel like I saw this somewhere before.

70
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,680
  Stretch to the front. Stretch your left leg to the back.  

71
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,210
  Think as if someone is pulling your arm and leg and stretch it longer.  

72
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,280
  Stretch more with the sense of your torso getting longer.  

73
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,060
My goodness! 
      

74
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,370
Now he loves to call me anytime!

75
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,660
Oh, one second...

76
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,140
It's strange.

77
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,040
Why is the symptom that I had before I got a divorce is coming back?

78
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,860
  My goodness!  

79
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,840
Sure. He's not completely gained back his health.

80
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,380
And he's my friend. Let's have some loyalty!

81
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,310
- Yes! 
   - Why are you picking up your phone so late? I got worried.  

82
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,660
What is it? Do you want to learn how to cook millet rice?

83
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,560
Did you eat breakfast?

84
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,300
Do you know what this is?

85
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,820
What is that? Put the camera closer.

86
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,340
Oh! Kamjiki! My Kamjiki was there!

87
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,550
Kamjiki?

88
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,030
That's your nickname because you get surprised a lot. 
      

89
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,550
  Where did you find that?  I was looking for that a lot when I was coming out of that house!  

90
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,590
It was stuck in the boiler room.

91
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,800
Kamjiki was in the boiler room?

92
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,020
Don't throw that out and leave it well. I'll come and get it later.

93
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,640
Don't throw that out! Okay?

94
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,540
  Then, is this yours?  

95
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,880
Yes, it's mine! It's my attachment doll.

96
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,730
An attachment doll?

97
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,950
You're an adult! Why would you pay for this kind of thing?

98
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:24,090
I didn't buy that. Woo Jung Hoo, don't you really remember that?

99
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,390
What are you talking about it?

100
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,890
Right. You wouldn't remember it.

101
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,060
Anyway, don't throw that out and hold on to it. Don't throw it out!

102
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,190
I'm not going to. Did you ever see me throwing something out?

103
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,120
Did you call me to ask about that?

104
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,940
  What?  

105
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
  Yes!  

106
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,640
You're acting strange. You never called me before.

107
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,400
Then, I should get going.

108
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,440
My goodness. What kind of manner is that?

109
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,920
How can he not remember that doll?

110
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,740
What can I expect from him anyway?

111
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,460
He's not James.

112
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,640
You just had breakfast, and you're eating corn puffs now?

113
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,440
Yes!

114
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,640
I have something to think about it right now.

115
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,420
When I'm thinking, I have to chew on something.

116
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,940
- Unni. 
 - Yes?

117
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,830
- You know Hwang Na Ro in the basement room. 
 - Yes?

118
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,520
Was he acting strange lately or something like that?

119
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,750
I don't think so.

120
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,460
There's nothing! He's very kind to me.

121
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,700
He can't join around people that easily,

122
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,240
but he's a kind person and have a nice manner. He's fine!

123
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:17,180
Well, that's right. There's nobody who's not nice to you, right?

124
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,310
In our Lee Soon Jung's world,

125
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:26,840
every bad people has their sad stories, and there's nobody in the world who can not be forgiven, right?

126
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,500
That's not true.

127
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:42,040
I have somebody who I can't forgive.

128
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,570
Two people.

129
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,410
  Really?  

130
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,040
I didn't know that. Do you even have two? Who are they?

131
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,750
  Yes?  

132
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,860
  Your sin is that you were a Bit Chae Woon's mother.  

133
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,220
  That hurts, Soon Jung.  

134
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,770
There are some people.

135
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,140
Oh, aunt, you didn't go to work today.

136
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,140
Why are you calling me an aunt? I'm off today.

137
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,510
Oh, okay, is that so.

138
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,060
Noonim! Can I help you with something?

139
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,640
- No, it's okay! I'm almost done. 
   - Oh, okay...  

140
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,500
Then, I'll go to the store to work.

141
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,990
Hwak Se!

142
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,000
Hwak Se, let's have some talk!

143
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,480
What's going on with them?

144
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,000
That Cunning Penguin! So you met him at the prison before?

145
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,150
You never called Na Ro the Cunning Penguin before.

146
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,780
Why are you calling him like that all of a sudden?

147
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,340
You're right. That's how Eems hyung used to call him.

148
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,400
I got so surprised right now, so it just came out like that.

149
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,940
But are you sure? Did you really see him in prison?

150
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,580
- Maybe you got confused? 
 - I'm a hundred percent sure.

151
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,790
If he didn't talk to me back then, I might have been confused, but he also talked to me.

152
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,490
What did he say?

153
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,560
  You're all done!  

154
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,240
  - Oh, no. 
  - It's okay!  

155
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,100
  - Doctor. 
 - Yes?  

156
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,690
  You look like a kind person.  

157
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,220
   I get that a lot from people.  

158
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,070
Then, Hwang Na Ro appealed to you a lot at that time.

159
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,370
Was he trying to get your heart and get out of the prison, like the show "Prison Break?"

160
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,790
I mean, I think there are times when things can happen in anybody's life.

161
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,060
I'm not trying to have prejudice over him, but I had a feeling at that time...

162
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,540
  He was looking at me in the medical office in prison,  

163
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,560
  and I thought, 'ah, this guy is a total schemer, he totally schemed a woman and came in here.'  

164
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,850
That thought just popped in my head at that moment.

165
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,160
I don't think Na Ro is that kind of a person!

166
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,910
Jjung-a, you know about that too since we all lived together.

167
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,200
I don't necessarily want to dig up his past!

168
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:58,250
But then, how Hwang Na Ro treated us in Samgwang villa

169
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,540
was his real face?

170
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,550
Huh?

171
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,370
Of course!

172
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:13,140
And also, you can't prove the guy you met at the prison was really Hwang Na Ro, and even if it was him,

173
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,340
I believe he had a reason to be in there.

174
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,440
I'm a hundred percent sure it was him, but I'm questioning what was the reason why he was in there!

175
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,270
I almost grabbed him and asked him. You know, I can't stand wondering.

176
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,030
Aigo, of course, I know about that.

177
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,880
But,

178
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,820
I still think Na Ro would've had some unavoidable situation.

179
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,840
Look at Eems hyung, who's the kindest person in the world!

180
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,760
He's still sometimes afraid of debt collectors because of what happened back in the days.

181
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,240
That makes me miss him again.

182
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:50,030
Anyway, everybody has their own sad stories that they couldn't share with others.

183
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,090
I also...

184
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,280
I have one, too.

185
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,080
  Excuse me!  

186
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,240
  It was the time when I was really hopeless.  

187
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,080
  I had so much anger inside that I was fighting with the gangs on the street  

188
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,940
  and stayed overnight in a police station cell.  

189
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,320
I became so much better person right now.

190
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,180
I should know my place.

191
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,150
What are you talking about knowing your place?

192
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,380
I mean!

193
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:39,760
Yesterday, I was like that because I got surprised when the kids were asking all of a sudden.

194
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,550
Aunt.

195
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,110
I'm really fine.

196
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,370
These last few days, I was really excited and happy.

197
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,580
That's enough for me.

198
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,610
How can I ask for more?

199
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,220
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

200
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,250
Why are you calling me 'aunt' again?

201
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,440
It's ridiculous...

202
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,900
Are you breaking up with me?

203
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,380
I'm sorry!

204
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,980
I apologize to you! What should I do? Should I tell everything to my sister right now?

205
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,140
Then, let's just be open to everybody! Let's go and tell my sister about us!

206
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,470
Man Jung!

207
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,620
When you said you have something to talk with Hwak Se, I thought you would talk with him in the yard, but you were here.

208
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,860
I wondered where you went.

209
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,040
- I felt suffocating in the yard. 
 - Is that so.

210
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,160
- Hwak Se! 
 - Oh, yes?

211
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,040
Didn't you say you're going to work?

212
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,180
Ah, yes. I was on my way to work.

213
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,560
Unni, are you going to work?

214
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,780
Yes, I'm going to Yeonhui-dong.

215
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,170
Oh?

216
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,820
What's going on, Man Jung?

217
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,730
Unni, can I come with you to Yeonhui-dong?

218
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:21,180
You shouldn't! If you come, you would be disturbing me.

219
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,510
- I guess so, too. 
 - What's wrong with you?

220
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,810
- Are you crying? 
 - I just yawned.

221
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,940
I'm sleepy.

222
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,990
A modern woman is always sleepy.

223
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,150
Well...

224
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,050
That can happen.

225
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,550
Oh, owner!

226
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,480
You came out early today!

227
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:09,470
Why is it keep getting screwed! My goodness...

228
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,640
     

229
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,300
What did you tell Bit Chae Woon?

230
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,400
I'm sorry?

231
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,540
  What did you say to her to make her come over before breakfast and harass me!  

232
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,100
What are you talking about it?

233
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,400
I didn't say anything to her.

234
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,940
What did Chae Woon say to you?

235
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:52,230
You don't have to know about that. You have to leave far away.

236
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,830
  Since you're still around here, Bit Chae Woon that thing can't have her sense to herself  

237
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,940
and yell nonsense to me!

238
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,550
If you don't leave in a couple of days, I'm going to frame you with whatever crime

239
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,560
  - and make you leave!   
 - I'm not going to leave. I--

240
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,670
     

241
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,530
  The person you're trying to reach is not available...  

242
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,520
What did she say to Chae Woon again?

243
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,060
     

244
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,890
  It's nice!  

245
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,560
I guess there's something called blood connection

246
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,000
that pulls me towards her.

247
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,550
  What are you going to do by sending Seo Yeon to our place after all these years?  

248
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,460
  That filthy Park Pil Hong's child!  

249
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,580
He doesn't look like a bad person.

250
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,150
I knew you were going to be here like this.

251
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,020
Koala!

252
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,040
I told you not to come.

253
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,500
How can I not come to see you when you're working so close to my site?

254
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,350
Also, I thought you were going to be like this, so I ran to see you.

255
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,660
I thought you might feel sad about seeing your father's photo.

256
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,940
It's not like that.

257
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,540
I know everything about you.

258
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:57,740
Well, the chairwoman said horribly about this person,

259
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,960
and it seems like the CEO and my mom doesn't have good feelings for him, too.

260
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,740
But I think there is a chance that it might be all misunderstandings...

261
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,710
I think I just want to believe it that way.

262
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,870
  Since she's like this, I can't say to her that Mr. Park Pil Hong was in prison,  

263
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,440
  and he knows Hwang Na Ro from there as well.  

264
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,240
Why?

265
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,870
I just thought my Moong-i must be having a hard time.

266
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,220
I just want everything in the past was all misunderstandings,

267
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,650
and I want him to live well somewhere.

268
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,590
It's okay for me not to see him forever.

269
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,700
- Did you eat lunch? 
 - Yes!

270
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,080
- What about you? 
 - I ate, too.

271
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,270
Then!

272
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,280
Let's have dessert.

273
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,470
- Is it coffee? 
 - Yes.

274
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,740
When I was coming out, Mr. Lee asked me if I'm going to see you,

275
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,940
and I said yes, and he packed me some coffee.

276
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,200
- He's very considerate. 
 - I know.

277
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,390
Here you go.

278
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,540
Mr. Lee said coffee should be drunk after enjoying the scent.

279
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,750
Oh, is that so?

280
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,580
Ah! It's nice.

281
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,640
One second.

282
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,550
  Jang Joon Ah? 
    

283
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,340
Ah, it's Seo Ah's brother.

284
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,640
Didn't you say he's in London?

285
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,110
Actually, he's here right now.

286
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,040
- Really? 
 - Excuse me for a second.

287
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,830
Yes, Joon Ah.

288
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,880
Yes, my friend. How is my baby sister?

289
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,550
Why are you asking me about Seo Ah?

290
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,400
I guess you want to be head-locked by me again.

291
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,160
Don't be ridiculous.

292
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:02,570
Hey, Jang Joon Ah! If you're so worried about your sister, then don't hide like a coward. Come out to the front

293
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,140
  and take care of her by yourself!  

294
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,290
Taking care?

295
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,470
How dare you speak English in front of me?

296
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,420
  So what is it? Do you want to end our friendship?  

297
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,730
Hey, just end it.

298
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,230
  Just end the friendship!  

299
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,290
Maybe we should have a drink for a farewell drink.

300
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,390
If you want to drink, text me. Bye.

301
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,210
What drink-- Hello? Hello?

302
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,480
Wow, he's just hanging up abruptly like that.

303
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,200
  What are you doing! You made me do tons of work all by myself!  

304
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,970
I'm sorry! I have something that I just thought about it.

305
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,510
Ta-da! What do you think about this look to send out to the customer who ordered it?

306
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,020
You didn't put it together as I told you to.

307
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,200
The look needs to emphasize feminine beauty.

308
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,640
This customer is going to the reunion to see her ex-boyfriend who broke up with her.

309
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,710
That's right, the school reunion.

310
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,990
So the look has to be as elegant and sophisticated as you can!

311
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,540
The clothes should scream out that "you are the idiot who dumped me."

312
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,540
Then this is the look! We shouldn't emphasize femininity,

313
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,870
but it should look like "I'm doing fabulous without you."

314
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,640
Just send this style to the customer. It'll work!

315
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:24,480
Okay, I'm going to send that to the customer, but if it doesn't work, then I'm not going to trust you anymore.

316
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,940
What is it?

317
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,630
What? What is it?

318
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,330
Aren't you happy that I'm here to help you out like this?

319
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,740
Yes. What? No, I don't know about that.

320
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,160
Just pay me the backed up payment.

321
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,540
Oh, I got an important call.

322
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,720
- Hello? 
 - You didn't get any phone calls!

323
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:02,340
As I mentioned earlier, with the development of the new product, through service upgrades,

324
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,890
  we expect to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.  

325
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:13,210
  To differentiate ourselves from other jokbal restaurants, Eems hyung will be quickly running for delivery!  

326
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,640
Hwak Se!

327
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,760
I'm sorry?

328
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:32,000
- What is it? 
 - Didn't you just say something like Hwak--

329
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,320
- Let's go with that idea. It's great. 
 - Really?

330
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:44,170
  - You never decided this fast before...   
 - Why don't we finish our meeting here for today?

331
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,360
Thank you all for your hard work.

332
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,000
That's so unusual for him...

333
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,180
Thank you for your hard work!

334
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,220
I'm sorry! I'm not wasting any mop.

335
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,180
- I'm sorry? 
 - I wash it well and using it more than a hundred times.

336
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,230
And also, I'm not wasting any detergent.

337
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,060
Oh, no! I'm so sorry, president.

338
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,770
I'm so sorry.

339
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,580
I don't know why you're apologizing to me...

340
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,040
Aigo, ma'am! You're doing a great job.

341
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,500
- You're doing great. 
 - I'm so sorry!

342
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,130
I heard it from Jae Hee oppa.

343
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,350
Hwang Na Ro.

344
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,550
That I went to prison before?

345
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,540
- I heard that you said you knew about it already to Woo Jae Hee. 
 - If I say I didn't know about it,

346
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,840
it hurts my pride too much to Jae Hee oppa.

347
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:17,050
I bet you said, "what does it matter" to him.

348
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:24,160
Because you have to do something for him to worry, so you can get his attention.

349
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,270
Because for you, I'm something to stir Woo Jae Hee.

350
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:40,340
You said Bit Chae Woon's father, Park Pil Hong, was a big trouble maker.

351
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,530
Then, did you...

352
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,200
meet him in prison?

353
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,690
I knew it.

354
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,670
  Now you know everything about my past.  

355
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,800
What are you going to do now?

356
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,240
What do you think I will do?

357
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,920
I think you'll use me as much as you want.

358
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,010
Park Pil Hong...

359
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,070
Why?

360
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,680
Jung Won!

361
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:59,500
Actually, I went to Soon Jung's place yesterday.

362
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:03,490
I was going to say thank you for taking good care of Jae Hee and his father.

363
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,810
But then...

364
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,510
your mother was there.

365
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:16,420
What? Was my mom at Soon Jung's place?

366
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:23,640
I just saw your mother on the street after she came out of Soon Jung's place.

367
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:28,800
But Jae Hee's father ran into her directly in that house.

368
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,590
But what he said was...

369
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,960
Why? What did he say?

370
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:46,300
I mean, your mother, the chairwoman,

371
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:51,410
was kind of threatening Soon Jung.

372
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,100
What?

373
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,470
Why is she threatening her?

374
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,590
Anyway, he told me it felt like that.

375
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:06,540
Jung Won, you said it feels like Soon Jung didn't tell you about something.

376
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,740
I think this has some connection to it.

377
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,160
It sounds like it.

378
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,810
Well, we don't know. It might not be.

379
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,930
Soon Jung is Jae Hee's father's, first love.

380
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:33,290
So maybe to his eyes, everything might have seen like that as well.

381
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:38,710
I guess I should've not told you about that...

382
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,730
Jung Won, someone knocked on the door.

383
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,160
Should I let them in?

384
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,350
Y-Yes.

385
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,890
Come on in!

386
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:59,020
- Oh, mother! You're here! 
 - Hello, Seo Ah.

387
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,200
Oh!

388
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,080
You're the one who opened the door for me at the Samgwang villa, right?

389
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,730
I'm Jae Hee's mom.

390
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,260
Ah, how are you?

391
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:13,630
I didn't know you worked in this company. It's good to see you!

392
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,250
Mother! What made you come by here today?

393
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,700
I was just around this neighborhood. I should get going. I was gone from my store for too long.

394
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,480
- Jung Won, I'm leaving now! 
 - Okay, see you soon.

395
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,740
Jung Won, don't worry too much. Jae Hee's father might have seen it wrong.

396
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,830
Thank you.

397
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,080
  - Have a safe trip back to your store. 
 - Seo Ah, good luck with your work!  

398
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,600
- Goodbye, mother! 
 - Have a safe trip!

399
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:46,200
What do you want to request?

400
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:52,120
I want to hire Hwang Na Ro as my Chief Secretary.

401
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,920
You have your direct secretary, Ms. Yoon.

402
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,570
I need more than Ms. Yoon.

403
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:03,000
I felt like I need a professional secretary to assist my work in general.

404
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:10,120
After seeing the Spain project, I thought Hwang Na Ro is the right person for the job.

405
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,240
If you let me do it, I'll work my best to support the director.

406
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,610
CEO, you'll accept my request, right?

407
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:23,570
Well, I think this is not a case to determine abruptly.

408
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:27,070
Let me think about it.

409
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,720
  The person you are trying to reach is not available...  

410
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,440
She never picks up her phone at once.

411
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,720
I have to see Soon Jung.

412
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:58,030
Even though I might have to be harsh to her, I have to ask what's going on.

413
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,480
Hello..?

414
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,240
Hello?

415
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,240
  Jung Won?  

416
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,070
Y-You...

417
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,830
It's me, Pil Hong oppa.

418
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,010
How have you been, Jung Won?

419
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,500
- Where are you right now? 
 - Don't be too hasty.

420
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,190
I really want to see you, too.

421
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,340
  Where shall we meet?  

422
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,500
Okay.

423
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,370
I guess you have a great occasion.

424
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,760
Yes! I'm meeting up with my old lover for a long time.

425
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,660
You must be excited!

426
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,240
Yes, I'm very excited.

427
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:30,680
♫   Now I'll leave what I miss as it is in my heart.   ♫

428
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,410
What should I do?

429
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,880
Yes, I should just tell everything to my mom.

430
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,070
But if I do so, then she would say I should help her with the company work!

431
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,650
No, I should think of Seo Ah. She's my one and only baby sister.

432
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,730
  Let's just do it! 
    

433
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,130
Why is she not picking up the phone?

434
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,860
- I'm so sorry! 
 - Are you okay? Thank you.

435
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,640
- Excuse me! 
 - Yes?

436
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,770
Don't you remember me? I met you at the place where Mr. Woo works.

437
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,900
You are the one who pinned me down!

438
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,830
  Who is he? Is he a cop?  

439
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,900
I don't know what you are talking about it.

440
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,350
Aren't you the one who works at Jae Hee's site?

441
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,360
You're in a suit. Maybe not?

442
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,770
I think you got the wrong person.

443
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,200
I'm sorry.

444
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,480
I'm pretty sure it is him!

445
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,640
I remember everybody whom I saw in 0.1 seconds!

446
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,390
Whatever.

447
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:54,640
  - The person you are trying to reach is not available.  
 - Why is she not picking up! We don't get along at all, mom.

448
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:58,000
Even though I want to tell her everything, she doesn't give me a chance!

449
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,160
Jung Won?

450
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,840
I was very happy when you visited me in prison.

451
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,240
Thank you, Jung Won.

452
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,120
You did it, right?

453
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,740
You took Seo Yeon away and made her into a person who doesn't exist in this world.

454
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,150
Who said that to you?

455
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,190
Is it Soon Jung?

456
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,660
Did you meet up with Soon Jung?

457
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,470
I saw her a couple of times.

458
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,620
She looked great!

459
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,080
Did you give her something in return for raising our Seo Yeon?

460
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,120
You knew about everything.

461
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,560
Park Pil Hong!

462
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,370
How dare you come to see me? What are you going to do with all your sins?

463
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,910
- How dare you? 
 - Don't be upset.

464
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,230
We're near your office.

465
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,820
There's a weird posting coming on your company community board. You should be more careful with your behavior, Jung Won.

466
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,830
Did you do that as well?

467
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,840
No, Jung Won! I don't know how to use a computer.

468
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:33,570
How can I get access to your company's community board? And do you think I'm crazy?

469
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:37,520
- I wouldn't do anything to make you and Seo Yeon in trouble. 
 - Shut your mouth up.

470
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,350
How dare you--

471
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Anyway, don't get me wrong. I don't do such a petty thing. Really!

472
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,560
Why did you want to see me?

473
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,190
The biggest reason is I missed you.

474
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,010
And I wanted to let you know of my true feelings.

475
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,600
I've been regretting deeply over the years.

476
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:12,310
I'm going to work hard and repenting until the day I die.

477
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,630
So...

478
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,990
So you want me to give you money?

479
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:25,290
- I can't give you anything. 
 - I'm not the same person anymore, Jung Won!

480
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,230
I want you...

481
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,400
to admit me as Seo Yeon's father.

482
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,440
What?

483
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,120
Stop talking crazy, and don't show up to me again. Don't show up to Seo Yeon as well!

484
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,100
If you show up to me again,

485
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,770
I'm going to put you back into prison.

486
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,390
With what crime?

487
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,880
What did I do?

488
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,440
Sure. I admit that I let Soon Jung take care of our Seo Yeon.

489
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,620
Because you were having a hard time back then!

490
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:05,770
So I thought we should let someone take care of Seo Yeon to focus on your treatment.

491
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,310
That's why I did that.

492
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,680
But that Lee Soon Jung ran away with Seo Yeon!

493
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,440
Maybe she wanted to have Seo Yeon because she's cute or something like that.

494
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,540
Don't talk nonsense just because you have an open mouth, and go.

495
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,600
Can you look at me in a better way?

496
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,340
Seo Yeon seemed to like me a lot.

497
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,740
What?

498
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,680
Did you meet up with Seo Yeon?

499
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,940
Relax.

500
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:40,380
  - People are looking at you.   
 - Where? At when?

501
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,070
I didn't tell her that I'm her father and just met naturally.

502
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,160
I guess it's the blood connection. She's getting along with me very well.

503
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:56,120
I'm getting close with Seo Yeon slowly.

504
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:01,300
So please let go of your anger and take me back.

505
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,550
I want to go back to the past!

506
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:08,630
I really missed you and Seo Yeon so much!

507
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,740
Jung Won!

508
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,330
I got my hair done at a hair salon today.

509
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,140
It hasn't been that long from lunch, and why am I starving already?

510
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,330
Right, auntie? I'm hungry, too!

511
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,450
  - Should we order something before mom comes back home? 
 - Shall we?  

512
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
  I want to have some drinks as well.  

513
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,790
- Is anybody home? 
 - My goodness!

514
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,030
- Hey! 
 - Unni!

515
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,300
  - What are you doing!   
 - Unni, I missed you so much!

516
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:01,940
- Hey! You freaked me out! 
 - It hurts!

517
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,740
Auntie, you got pretty. You got a boyfriend, right?

518
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,080
What are you talking about it!

519
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,910
Did I get pretty?

520
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,550
Where's mom?

521
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,450
Mom went out to work.

522
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,340
Why did you come here all of a sudden? What about your work?

523
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,440
Today I was mostly working outside of the office. So I did everything earlier and came here.

524
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,340
- Is that so? 
 - I have something to talk about with mom.

525
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,860
Unni, I missed you so so much!

526
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,720
- Did you? 
   - Big sister?  

527
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,940
- Hey! Your big sister is here! 
 - Big sister!

528
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,750
You guys are having a family reunion today!

529
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,060
- Why do you look so haggard? 
 - Unni, he's working part-time jobs really hard these days!

530
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:47,240
- Part-time jobs? 
 - What are you talking about it? He's busy studying!

531
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,840
Unni! Hello!

532
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,040
Hello! But who are you..?

533
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,390
She's Cha-- no, she's the Kim Joon Woo.

534
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,100
- Kim Joon Woo, the one who was using your room? 
 - Right.

535
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,990
- That person was a boy, wasn't he? 
 - I know!

536
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,530
That student was a boy.

537
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,550
And she's a girl.

538
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:12,290
If I want to explain this to you, it's too long and too complicated!

539
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,090
My name is Cha Ba Reun.

540
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:20,340
I had some situation, so I had to pretend to be a boy before.

541
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,890
And nobody knew about that until now?

542
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:27,340
- People thought there was a ghost on the second floor. 
 - Yes! It was chaos here!

543
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,840
- You knew about everything at that time, too, right? 
 - What? Yes.

544
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:37,060
- Then, after all that came out, she's still using the same room with Ra Hoon? 
 - No, no!

545
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,450
We're not using the same room now.

546
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,370
It's not like that.

547
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,310
She's sharing the room with me now, with this poor Lee Man Jung.

548
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,220
- It must have been shocking. 
 - Of course, unni!

549
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,900
- It was shocking because of someone. 
 - It was big chaos!

550
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,340
Then, since Chae Woon is here, should we eat something delicious?

551
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,240
I'll get it for all of you!

552
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,040
- No, I'll pay for everybody! What do you want? 
 - No, it's fine!

553
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,940
Since I haven't come back here in a while, I'll buy it for you guys!

554
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:05,310
Are you going to buy it? Did you make some good money, Bit Chae? That's nice!

555
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,040
  - Sandwich? 
 - I want an egg-mayo one.  

556
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,940
 - Sandwich and soju! How does that sound? 
 - It's weird!   

557
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,170
The vegetable is very fresh!

558
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,700
- And also... 
   - Yes?  

559
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:25,430
- Since the big sister is here, I want to tell you guys something. 
 - What is it?

560
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,120
  What? What is it?  

561
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,090
Big sister! Auntie.

562
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:39,980
I'm actually not a Seohan university student.

563
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,250
  What?  

564
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,740
I mean, I'm not a college student.

565
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:52,220
What are you talking about it now?

566
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,760
Hey, Lee Ra Hoon!

567
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,500
I failed again to go into college on my third time,

568
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,350
I felt so sorry, so I said I got into Seohan university.

569
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,760
But somehow, I couldn't tell the truth until now.

570
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,920
What kind of nonsense are you talking about it right now?

571
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,950
Big sister, I'm really sorry.

572
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:21,360
Then, why were you so busy until now?

573
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,110
What were you doing the whole time!

574
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,810
  Hey!  

575
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,440
Is it real?

576
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,900
Yes.  I'm sorry.

577
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,800
Hey!!

578
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:41,640
How can you fake that!

579
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,340
Are you crazy? Are you crazy!

580
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,240
  - Auntie! Stop it! 
 - Did you lose your mind!  

581
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,300
Stop it, auntie! He lived best as he could until now!

582
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:55,040
Yes, aunt! Ra Hoon worked for delivery service, coffee shop, convenience store,

583
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,170
  - and food truck, too!   
 - Ra Hoon saved a lot of money!

584
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,400
And he wants to open his own food truck.

585
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:12,240
Then, were you having a smelly feet issue because of that?

586
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:19,040
How much trouble have you been going through--

587
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,230
I'm so sorry, big sister.

588
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,940
Auntie, I'm so sorry. You were very happy that I got into the same university that you graduated from.

589
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,460
You have so many things to be sorry for.

590
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:35,500
Ra Hoon, Ra Hoon.

591
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,740
When I was moving into your house, I just felt so ashamed, so I just talked about your university a lot.

592
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,940
Because I was too ashamed to living off of your mom after losing everything that I have.

593
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,430
I don't deserve to say anything to you.

594
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,430
  I'm sorry.  

595
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,060
I'm so sorry, big sister.

596
00:44:54,740 --> 00:45:01,940
You were going through trouble teaching me after coming back from construction sites.

597
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:06,530
- I'm really sorry. 
 - Forget about it!

598
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,160
Stop apologizing!

599
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,340
- You should've told us before. 
  - Stop crying.

600
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,240
Why did you go through all the trouble by yourself?

601
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:20,040
How did you not tell anybody and live with it all by yourself?

602
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,730
- Your mom must have been so surprised. 
 - Uncle!

603
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,460
Ra Hoon, you punk!

604
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:44,260
How can you eat this delicious thing by yourself when I'm back with an empty stomach riding the subway?

605
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:46,210
  - What?   
 - How can you!

606
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,260
  - You surprised me! 
 - Where's mine!  

607
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,740
  It's here! We have one for you!  

608
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,140
You punk!

609
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,370
  Here you go.  

610
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,340
I'm going to see how delicious it is!

611
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,070
  Stop crying.  

612
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,530
Welcome!

613
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,960
Can I get some recommendations for the bed?

614
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,290
I heard it's good for recovering from fatigue before exercise.

615
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:19,760
You heard it from other people already! You came to the right place.

616
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,770
Our bed is famous for people who play golf!

617
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,340
Why don't you lie down here?

618
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,680
  Wow, it feels good.  

619
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,220
It definitely helps to recover from fatigue!

620
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,150
- Noona! 
 - Why is he...

621
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,310
Excuse me for a second.

622
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,640
Hey, don't call me noona! I'm the manager here.

623
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,540
I'm sorry, manager! The president is here with me.

624
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,020
- What? 
 - Thank you for your hard work!

625
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,170
Manager Jung Min Jae, thank you for your hard work.

626
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:54,370
Your store's sales are impeccable.

627
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,230
Yes, I'm working hard to make a lot of sales.

628
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,510
Did you not bring the Kamjiki?

629
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,100
Kamjiki?

630
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:08,110
My attachment doll!

631
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:12,950
- How can I bring all the way that to here? 
 - What's wrong with Kamjiki?

632
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,430
Don't you really remember that?

633
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,340
I don't remember anything!

634
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:19,510
Oh! Thank you for your hard work!

635
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:21,640
Oh, there are customers!

636
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,150
  Which products are the most popular among the customers?  

637
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,640
  Like the one you are looking at right now...  

638
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,540
Noona, didn't he change a lot?

639
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:34,390
He's laughing a lot like that, and he's nice to employees at the office as well!

640
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,140
He's nice to me, too!

641
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,440
Really? But why is he treating me the same as before?

642
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,570
Is he treating you the same as before?

643
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:44,160
Yes!

644
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,530
He is wearing that suit again! I told him to buy a new one.

645
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,940
- Is Manager Jung Min Jae here? 
 - Ah, she's right in there.

646
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:03,430
Hello, noonim!

647
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,640
Oh, professor!

648
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,300
Hello. I found the right store!

649
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,730
It's good to see you again. This is for you.

650
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,960
- I didn't feel right to come with empty hands. 
 - You didn't have to!

651
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:20,870
It's a beautiful flower! What is this?

652
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:24,770
- It's macarons. 
 - I love macaron!

653
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:29,140
Really? I just bought it because I like it. We like the same thing!

654
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,030
Oh! My goodness!

655
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,840
  Wait, that "ha ha ha" sound is from...  

656
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,240
Is it that "ha ha ha" from that time?

657
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,540
By the way, why did you come here today?

658
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:56,380
I was around this neighborhood for work.

659
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,310
But I remembered that Jae Hee said your store is around here.

660
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:03,900
By the way, it's okay for me to call you noonim, right?

661
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:06,950
I asked Jae Hee, and we didn't have that much of an age gap.

662
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:10,560
You can call me whatever you want to.

663
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:13,700
It's so pretty!

664
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,950
Excuse me, president?

665
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,740
Noonim, when do you get off from work today?

666
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,040
  If it's okay with you, why don't we have dinner together?  

667
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:29,040
- Ah, yes. You came all the way here. 
 - Manager Jung Min Jae!

668
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:34,100
I think you have to work overtime tonight.

669
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,410
Overtime work?

670
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:41,030
I want to hear a briefing about your store's business management.

671
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,930
Chief Bae can do that for you.

672
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:47,690
No, I want to hear it from you, manager.

673
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,310
I want to discuss some management situations, as well.

674
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,400
Okay, I get it.

675
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,480
I'm so sorry, professor. I think it's not possible to have dinner tonight.

676
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,080
Ah, right.

677
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,730
Then, why don't we have some tea right now?

678
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,080
- Yes, sounds great! 
 - Come this way.

679
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,470
B-Brother-in-law!

680
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,540
- Oh, goodness! Can you hold this for me? 
 - Yes!

681
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,640
Thank you. Please go in first.

682
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:46,000
     

683
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:51,010
Yes, Soon Jung.

684
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,850
Are you busy right now?

685
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:58,440
No, I'm not. I just came back home from work.

686
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,770
Why did you call me?

687
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:04,050
I heard that my mom went to see you.

688
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,350
  I heard it from Min Jae.  

689
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,830
Yes.

690
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,590
  Soon Jung, we should meet up.  

691
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,440
  There's something that I want to know.  

692
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,080
I'll go to your place after work.

693
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,530
I'll go to your office.

694
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,090
No, no. I'll go to your place.

695
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:34,570
Chae Woon!

696
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,270
Mom!

697
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:41,430
Chae Woon, what happened?

698
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:45,080
Why did you come here?

699
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,500
I came here because I missed you.

700
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,460
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

701
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,940
- What about you? 
 - I have been well, too.

702
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,570
I heard that you went to see the chairwoman.

703
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,340
She called you again.

704
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:12,140
Why did you go see her?

705
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,510
I thought she was too mean to you.

706
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,440
She framed everything in the past on you and harassing you again now.

707
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,840
No, I'm fine!

708
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:31,670
- Whatever she says to me, I'm totally fine! 
 - No.

709
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:35,280
We can't be suffering like this anymore.

710
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,320
Mom.

711
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:48,530
Let's go to the chairwoman today, and reveal everything she did wrong to you.

712
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:55,120
The things that you couldn't tell anybody until now,

713
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,780
please tell me everything now.

714
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:02,400
Chae Woon.

715
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:09,130
I know that you didn't tell anything and hold everything on to yourself because you thought I would get hurt.

716
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,620
But if you are suffering by yourself, then what's the point?

717
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,440
She doesn't feel sorry at all, and she even comes to you and harasses you!

718
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:27,140
Don't be afraid for me to be hurt.

719
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:35,300
It hurts me more when you are having a hard time all by yourself.

720
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,940
Let's be brave, mom.

721
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:49,940
  Why don't you think it's for your eldest daughter and be brave?  

722
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,430
You can do that.

723
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,770
To the hotel where the chairwoman is staying?

724
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:09,480
Yes.

725
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,340
I want to talk about something important.

726
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,510
Okay.

727
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:18,580
Chae Woon.

728
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,860
Yes?

729
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,530
Did you...

730
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,240
  Maybe it's the blood connection. She gets along with me well.  

731
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:32,840
It's nothing. I'll see you later.

732
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,000
Yes.

733
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,530
  Moong-i!  

734
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,190
Mr. Woo, are you coming home now?

735
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,920
I heard you have an important meeting today.

736
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:50,350
I'm going to drive for you.

737
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,490
The sales are steadily increasing!

738
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,920
It's great.

739
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,240
Did you see everything, president?

740
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:14,460
Yes, thank you for your hard work, manager Jung Min Jae.

741
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:19,340
- Then, I'll get off from work now. 
 - Sure.

742
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:27,650
That kind of cookies are just sweet and nothing!

743
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:31,520
It's delicious and has pretty shapes, too!

744
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:37,690
You might go to the emergency room again by eating that, which can get stuck in your throat!

745
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,140
  Oh, my god!  

746
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:50,990
  Why do you have to eat this cookie in the secret of your husband!  

747
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,820
Why don't we go out for dinner, manager Jung Min Jae?

748
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:00,740
What should we eat? Soondae soup? Ox bone soup?

749
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,080
I guess you don't remember that.

750
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,740
What are you talking about it? My memory is back to normal now.

751
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:22,400
The reason why I was choking on this macaron before was that you were so aggressive to me,

752
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,210
so I got shocked and choked on it.

753
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:33,270
How can I not remember that? I do remember it.

754
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:38,980
Now I think about it, this was the cookie that turned my fortune.

755
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:42,810
I shouldn't live like this anymore by treated like this by my husband.

756
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:47,050
I shouldn't live with the guy anymore who makes me eat a cookie in secret!

757
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:50,250
It was the cookie that made me realize that.

758
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,780
You're giving too much meaning to the cookie.

759
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,740
But you...

760
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:00,640
You just lost your memory and made me debilitate!

761
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:03,510
Is it all because of me?

762
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,680
Did he become like that because I dumped him?

763
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,030
You made me suffer in guilt like that!

764
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,640
You're a person who's going to follow me to the afterlife if I die!

765
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:18,540
Are you afraid that I might follow you to the afterlife?

766
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:23,670
- Am I that dreadful? 
 - Yes, you're dreadful, dreadful, dreadful!

767
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,760
Why are you...

768
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,950
I regret so much that I loved you when I was young.

769
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,950
I got married to you even though my mom was against it so much,

770
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:39,460
but those thirty years that I lived in silence, I regret it so much!

771
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:45,320
That's why I wanted to end everything and to try to live my life well again.

772
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:51,230
But I heard that you lost your memories, so I felt bad. That's why I was nice to you.

773
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:57,900
But why are you keep showing up to my life and interfering in everything!

774
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:06,910
I'm sorry to interfere with your life, Jung Min Jae.

775
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:13,580
If it weren't me, you would've been on a date with that dude tonight.

776
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,770
I'm sorry that I interrupted.

777
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:20,810
From now on, I'll never interfere with anything in your life.

778
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,610
I'll get going.

779
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,520
That doll, Kamjiki!

780
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,350
Just throw it away.

781
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:38,470
I don't want to see it again.

782
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,440
Take care.

783
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:18,370
He never knows how to console others.

784
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:22,040
He didn't change at all.

785
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:50,240
Maybe it was better when I lost my memories.

786
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:57,240
♫   you can't stop the heart   ♫

787
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:03,720
♫   We're drawn to each other like the magnets   ♫

788
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:11,480
♫   So that we can fill in a hole in our heart   ♫

789
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:23,980
♫   When I see you, I can smile   ♫

790
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:31,670
♫   You became a place to rest after a hard day   ♫

791
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:39,310
♫   The rain called you is making me wet   ♫

792
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:45,760
♫   I got soaked in an unexpected love   ♫

793
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:53,270
  My back and shoulders are in pain after serving for all those guests!  

794
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:58,410
  It was guests after guests after guests.  

795
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:02,210
  It's not your first time doing my father's birthday!  

796
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:08,020
  It's good thing for him to be healthy and the whole family to thrive and can gather to eat together.  

797
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:13,670
  I know it's a good thing, but why do I have to do all the work by myself for that good thing?   

798
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:17,250
  Your sisters all went to the bedroom and lay down immediately.  

799
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:22,250
  All those sisters-in-law, who are doing great work, didn't even show up.  

800
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:28,790
  "You knew about it all and got married to me! Why are you grumbling so much!"  

801
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,340
  You're going to say this, right?  

802
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:37,450
  Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you!  

803
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:42,390
  Happy birthday dear Hye Ryung. Happy birthday to you!  

804
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,310
  Wow! She must be happy!  

805
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,190
  Today's my birthday, too.  

806
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:55,540
  You didn't know today's my birthday, did you?  

807
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:58,280
  You only knew about your father's birthday.  

808
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:05,260
  Was your birthday was the same as my father?  

809
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:10,440
  No, he's celebrating the lunar calendar birthday, so it became the same date as mine this year.  

810
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:16,270
  Well, if you knew about it wouldn't make any difference. You never celebrated my birthday.  

811
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,340
  Birthday is not a big deal!  

812
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:24,840
  I don't like celebrating birthdays and wedding anniversaries.  

813
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,740
  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  

814
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,440
  Every day is the same and living the best we can is important!  

815
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,290
  Is money falling down from the sky on birthdays?  

816
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,310
  Or golden rain is coming?  

817
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,080
  I don't expect anything like that!  

818
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:42,450
  I got late because I was buying you a present.  

819
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,900
  Thank you so much!  

820
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,640
  Where are you going?  

821
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:57,510
  My goodness. Come here, Jae Hee's mother! 

822
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:01,330
  Look at this. Somebody just left with the coin in this machine!  

823
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,070
  I think I can get a doll.  

824
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:07,120
  You love it when it's free.  

825
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:11,020
  I have to get one. Since it's free, I have to get a doll!  

826
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:15,590
  This is really hard! Not everybody can get a doll.  

827
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,840
  Go up, go up!  

828
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,960
  Go to the right more!  

829
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:37,880
  Grab it!  

830
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:40,210
  Grab it! Grab it! Oh?  

831
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:44,130
  Hold on to it!  

832
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:03,990
  It's your birthday present.  

833
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,040
   Let's go home.  

834
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:16,090
  A birthday present?  

835
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,640
  It's the first time to get a birthday present from him.  

836
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:32,260
This is...

837
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:37,440
This is the doll from that time...

838
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,040
Jae Hee's mom...

839
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:46,160
Jae Hee's mom...

840
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:04,860
Why am I being like this again?

841
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:09,850
I was getting over well.

842
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:28,610
♫   I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you   ♫

843
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:35,670
♫   Stay with me forever   ♫

844
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:42,480
I'm sorry, beautiful woman. I'm sorry.

845
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:49,210
I'm so sorry that I made you suffer.

846
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:53,340
I'm sorry, beautiful woman.

847
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,160
Mom, are you nervous?

848
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:18,530
Yes, a little bit.

849
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,150
Take it easy, mother.

850
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,780
Oh, the CEO is here. Hello!

851
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,180
Jae Hee's here, too.

852
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:36,290
Soon Jung.

853
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:44,460
I'm going to tell you everything that you have been wondering about it.

854
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:47,480
Yes, Soon Jung.

855
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:56,160
What brings you here in the middle of the night?

856
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:59,940
Did Bit Chae Woon make another trouble?

857
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,970
Soon Jung, why are you...

858
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:14,400
Hello, chairwoman.

859
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:17,880
Didn't you say you're the only person coming?

860
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,910
I had to say that for you to open the door.

861
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:28,390
Soon Jung has something to say to you.

862
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:33,160
I don't want to hear it, and you should all go.

863
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,040
You should take them and leave now!

864
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,510
  Mom!  

865
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:39,510
Let's hear what she's going to say.

866
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:43,930
There's no reason why you can't listen to her if you have nothing to hide.

867
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:46,710
What is it about?

868
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:51,720
What? What do you want to talk to me about!

869
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:08,440
♫   Did you forget? Did you forget about me?   ♫

870
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:13,760
♫   Did you forget all those memories   ♫

871
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:19,620
♫   My heart is opening arms to you   ♫

872
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:24,920
♫   I'm barely going through today   ♫

873
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:30,900
♫   When the memories are fading   ♫ 
      

874
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:32,880
  Na Ro!  

875
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:37,920
  - I said, I think I saw you before somewhere.  
 - Are you talking about the southern prison?  

876
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,340
  Now the aunt is bothering me, too.  

877
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:44,840
  Kamjiki! How have you been! You were dirty before, but you became clean!  

878
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,040
  She must have been hurt by me so much.  

879
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,140
  I shouldn't show up in front of her at all from now on.  

880
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:53,050
  - Hwang Na Ro is not a trustworthy person! 
 - You're just a mere intern.  

881
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:55,570
  How dare you to give me a lecture?   

882
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,510
  Bit Chae Woon and director Jang is in a love triangle?  

883
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:02,460
  I think it's not okay to hire Hwang Na Ro as your secretary.  

884
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,870
  CEO! How can you not accept this simple request?  

885
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:07,040
  Don't you have any other feelings for him?   

886
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:10,370
  Can't I have feelings for him?
